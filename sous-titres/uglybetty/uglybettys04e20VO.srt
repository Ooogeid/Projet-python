1
00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:02,702
Previously on "Ugly Betty"...
Aah!

2
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:06,505
You have exactly the right voice
for a new magazine I'm starting.

3
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,676
I want you to help me
run it... in London.

4
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:12,368
There is something about you
that I automatically liked.

5
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:13,941
I would do anything for that girl.

6
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,450
My biological father has
that tweety bird tattoo.

7
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,173
It's a great feeling, isn't it,

8
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,522
when everything is...
right in the world?

9
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:24,957
Hi, Mr. Dunn. I would
like to accept your offer.

10
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:27,298
I don't want anything from you.

11
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:30,719
I'm the one who made you feel
this way. Give me the gun.

12
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,203
Fashionista, trendsetter,

13
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,437
loyal friend...

14
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:45,018
This cherished icon

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,382
who once walked the
halls of "mode"

16
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,779
is now eating out of
the hands of angels

17
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:53,431
and soiling the carpets of
heaven for all eternity.

18
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:55,812
Amen. Hallelujah.

19
00:00:55,874 --> 00:00:58,263
Poor alston.
He was a good dog, Amanda.

20
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:00,668
He was.

21
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:02,840
Good-bye, Halston.

22
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:05,796
I can't believe it Marc.
The only connection

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,953
to the mother I
never knew is gone.

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,047
Indigenous. Good look for you.

25
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:25,828
Officer, there they are! Amanda...

26
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:28,248
You said you got a
permit for this, right?

27
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:33,516
Run!

28
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:43,388
Crisis "mode"...

29
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,824
With "mode" just weeks away

30
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:47,212
from publishing its
100th anniversary issue,

31
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:49,417
wilhelmina Slater
is still unconscious

32
00:01:49,495 --> 00:01:52,413
after a mysterious shooting
at the "mode" offices.

33
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,817
And that bullet

34
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:56,637
must have been filled
with beauty powder,

35
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:59,386
because she looks ravishing.

36
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:01,318
So far the only
information we have

37
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,954
is that her longtime
Nemesis Claire Meade

38
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:05,462
was the sole witness.

39
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,747
She claims the shooting
was an accident,

40
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:10,406
which has fashionistas
everywhere straining

41
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:12,134
to raise their eyebrows.
Come on. Let's go.

42
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:14,562
B., how can you move to London?

43
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,031
Won't you miss all the kidnapping,

44
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:19,076
shooting and murder at "mode"? Mm,
no, not really.

45
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:21,055
This looks so good.
Yeah, I gotta say,

46
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,884
I'm really glad I'm becoming
a part of this latin family.

47
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,384
Aw, kid, we are gonna
Spice you up so much,

48
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,048
you're gonna forget you're white.

49
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,140
Okay, this smells amazing.
Let's eat.

50
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:31,663
Unh-unh. Hands off.

51
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:33,844
For you, sheep's heart,

52
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:36,497
liver and lung
stuffed in intestine,

53
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:38,765
otherwise known as haggis.

54
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:42,698
Ew! Oh, my God. Oh!

55
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:44,701
Oh, my God. I'm gonna vomit.
Papi, why?

56
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:47,266
I-I'm fine just eating what
everyone else is eating.

57
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,159
Mija, that's what
they eat in the u.K.

58
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:51,578
You need to toughen up
your stomach before you go.

59
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,190
Ugh. Unless, uh...

60
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:57,563
You want to stay. Papi,
I am taking the job in London.

61
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,007
I understand.

62
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:02,148
Oh, look, so I been looking
at a couple of houses

63
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:03,969
that look pretty good. Shh!

64
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,227
He's in the other room.
You guys are moving?

65
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:08,457
We're just looking.

66
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,756
We haven't told papi yet.
With you leaving and everything,

67
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:13,016
it's just... it's hard time. Well,

68
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:15,164
he's gonna have to get
used to it sometime.

69
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:17,746
Besides, I saw some nice
places in Bay Ridge...

70
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:19,476
Bay Ridge?! Shh.

71
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,297
Look,

72
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:23,166
just swear that we are
gonna look in Manhattan.

73
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:25,018
And thanks to the great recession,

74
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,742
you'd be surprised on how
affordable things are now. Hey, hey.

75
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,555
Betty, you haven't
touched the haggis.

76
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:32,678
Trust me, you don't want
to eat it when it's cold.

77
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:34,187
That's my phone.

78
00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:37,151
What's the matter with you?
Where did you even find that?

79
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:39,764
Oh! Daniel. Hi, Daniel!

80
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes. I can be right there.

81
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,949
Sorry, guys. Daniel needs me.

82
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,504
So... I guess I'll just
have to eat with him.

83
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:50,540
Are you finally gonna tell him
that you're moving to London?

84
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:54,665
Yes, I'm going to tell him.
It's just not easy. Okay?

85
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:57,678
He gave me my start.
I owe him everything.

86
00:03:57,755 --> 00:03:59,985
But I've made my decision,
and I'm gonna tell him.

87
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,893
Sorry I can't stay for dinner.

88
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,282
You really haven't
missed that much.

89
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:09,791
We had this ridiculous aborted
funeral for Amanda's dog.

90
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,403
She brought that big queen

91
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:13,127
who I think is her father.

92
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,603
But I'm not sure,
and I would just hate for her

93
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:18,488
to have to go through
all that again.

94
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:20,475
What else can I tell you?

95
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:23,007
Oh. Well, I'm still not over Troy

96
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:24,861
even though he's got a boyfriend.

97
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,312
H... what?

98
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,339
Stop it.

99
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,495
I like him.

100
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:34,482
Oh, you're so bad.

101
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:38,865
Willie...

102
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:41,997
I knew your obsession
with the meades

103
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:43,561
would get the better of you.

104
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:46,254
Now look at you.
Your makeup is still flawless,

105
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,984
but you're in a coma.

106
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,589
I just want you to be happy,

107
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,849
'cause all this scheming...

108
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:55,477
It's killing you.

109
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,283
You know, I think this
is the best conversation

110
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:04,518
we've ever had.

111
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,211
Are you crazy?

112
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:10,183
Look, you're doing your fishy
face thing in this one.

113
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:12,107
No, I'm not. That's just my face.

114
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,575
No, it's not. And you're
standing like a robot.

115
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,971
So my shoulders don't droop.
What's the matter with that?

116
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,361
Daniel, this is your big picture

117
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,308
for the 100th anniversary issue.

118
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:24,488
This looks like the guy that I
met my first day on the job.

119
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,029
This is pose-y Daniel.
You're not that guy anymore.

120
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,233
Well, thank you.
I will take that as a compliment.

121
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,261
So, um... Daniel,

122
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,793
uh... listen.

123
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:38,526
There's something I've
been wanting to tell you.

124
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,097
Wait. Uh, one quick thing.

125
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,607
In this issue,
we're doing profiles

126
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:43,867
of everyone who's ever been
editor-in-chief of "mode,"

127
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,399
and I was hoping maybe
you'd write mine.

128
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,483
Really?

129
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,135
Oh, my God! I would love that!

130
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,348
Good. 'Cause I gotta tell ya,

131
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:56,151
there's no way I could've
done this job without you.

132
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,300
I think we make a good team,
you and me.

133
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,913
So... I interrupted you.

134
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,397
What were you saying?

135
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,632
You know what? I forgot.

136
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,491
Good morning, sunshine.

137
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:31,449
No, I haven't had a
chance to tell Daniel yet.

138
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:32,707
Well, don't you think he'll notice

139
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,736
when you stop showing up
for work in three weeks?

140
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,252
Hilda, I can't talk about this.
I'm at work.

141
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:38,408
And if anyone here finds out
I'm taking a job in London,

142
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:41,413
it will spread like wildfire.
You're taking a job in London?

143
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:43,593
Shh! Marc, please.

144
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:46,461
Please don't say anything.
Daniel doesn't know yet.

145
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,554
Just give me a chance to tell him first.
Of course. Of course.

146
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,869
I totally get it.
I'm not going to tell anyone.

147
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:54,666
What are you doing?
What are you doing?! Marc! Oops.

148
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,566
You did not. I totally did.

149
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:07,291
Say hi to the beckhams.

150
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,246
Hey, Betty, have fun in London.

151
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:15,777
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No. Oh, God, no!

152
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,358
No, don't send that!

153
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,362
That's not yours to send!

154
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,982
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

155
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,226
Oh, God.

156
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,302
Stop! Don't take any calls!

157
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,295
Give me five minutes
alone with him!

158
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,633
Daniel!

159
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,292
Betty.

160
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:37,537
I have something I have
to tell you, and it's big.

161
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:40,398
Bigger than you taking
a job in London?

162
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:01,618
I'm so sorry you found out
before I could tell you.

163
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:04,744
Daniel, I am so grateful
for these last four years.

164
00:08:04,804 --> 00:08:06,649
It has been a pleasure
working with you.

165
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,071
Actually, an honor,
and... did you rehearse this?

166
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:12,418
A little. Daniel...

167
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:14,463
We're always gonna
be friends, and I...

168
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:15,948
Betty, it's fine.

169
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,913
It is?

170
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:21,164
Yeah.

171
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:22,944
Okay.

172
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:24,964
Great.

173
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:26,602
Is there anything else?

174
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:28,492
Um, yeah. I...

175
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:30,440
I need you to...

176
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:33,340
Sign this form releasing
me from my contract.

177
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:35,481
They need it tomorrow.

178
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,029
Yep. No problemo.

179
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:40,945
Okay.

180
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:42,877
Great.

181
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,496
When I heard what happened,
I had to come.

182
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,293
Connor, I don't understand.

183
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:57,474
How did you... get out of jail?

184
00:08:57,544 --> 00:08:59,292
I talked a guard into letting
me out for a few hours.

185
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:00,962
He's just outside.

186
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:04,238
But I thought you'd
been transferred.

187
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,490
That's what I needed
you to believe

188
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,239
so that you could move on.

189
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:11,194
But, Willie...

190
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,711
I can't live without you.

191
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,957
Okay, let's calm down...

192
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:26,896
Before we put you
back in that coma.

193
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:29,348
Oh! It would be worth it.

194
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:32,673
I spent my entire life
fighting f a magazine

195
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,053
when I should've been
fighting for you.

196
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,450
It's all gonna be different now.

197
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:43,062
Wilhelmina Slater is a
completely changed woman.

198
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,586
Well, I hope not
completely changed.

199
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,256
There were some parts
of you I rather liked.

200
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,260
Hi, Daniel.

201
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:01,193
Just a little reminder that I
need to get that paper signed.

202
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,909
No biggie. When you can...
by tomorrow.

203
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:07,506
Earlier is better, but nothing
that inconveniences you.

204
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,205
Hi, papi.

205
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,825
Did you know that London is
the dirtiest city in Europe?

206
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:14,622
What? I'm reading this online...

207
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:16,601
The dirtiest city,
and the most expensive,

208
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:18,365
with the worst food,
and they say the people there

209
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,289
are the most unfriendly
in the world.

210
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,710
You know, I was there.
It didn't seem so bad.

211
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,658
This is on the Internet, Betty.
Want me to send it to you?

212
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:28,686
Aah! Mija, what's wrong?

213
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:32,667
I'll call you back.
Amanda! Are you okay?

214
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:36,879
How could you put your dead
dog in my refrigerator?

215
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:39,196
That dead dog has a name.

216
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,016
Halston.

217
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,789
And he's simply being
cryo-genitally preserved

218
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,736
until I can give him a proper
farewell. In my fridge?!

219
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:47,860
We are a food-free household.

220
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:49,426
And you need to lose
a little weight,

221
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:52,709
so it's really a win-win.
Get him out, please.

222
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,402
I'm going for a walk.

223
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,165
Hey, Betty?

224
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,338
What?

225
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:59,334
I heard you're moving to London.

226
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:03,634
And I just... want to say that
I'm really gonna miss you.

227
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,255
Thank you, Amanda.
That is very sweet.

228
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:15,035
So really,

229
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:17,152
I can't just keep Halston in
your fridge for a little bit? No.

230
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,387
Claire.

231
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:25,193
Before this happened,
you would've been

232
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:26,669
the last person in the
world I'd want to see.

233
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,881
Well, I'm just happy to
see that you're awake.

234
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:33,597
That's nice. It's very
sweet of you to visit.

235
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,777
I need to talk to you.

236
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:38,659
We're saying

237
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,592
that Tyler had nothing
to do with your shooting.

238
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,517
You need to corroborate our story.

239
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:44,208
I do?

240
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:47,141
You made him drink.
You supplied him with a gun.

241
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:50,185
This is your doing, wilhelmina,
and you need to fix this.

242
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,029
This... is what we can offer you.

243
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,794
It's funny, I would've
been happy with flowers,

244
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,374
or perhaps a handwritten
note saying,

245
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:04,378
"thank you for saving my life."

246
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,719
Oh, please. I know
exactly who you are.

247
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,426
And you're going to milk this

248
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,199
until you can get
your manicured claws

249
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:12,899
into our company,

250
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,520
because wilhelmina only does
things that help wilhelmina.

251
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:22,204
Well, I guess you know me
better than I know myself.

252
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:28,376
Now flap those bat wings
of yours and get out.

253
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,491
Look, I'm sorry.

254
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:14,631
But in my defense,
it looked a lot cooler in my head.

255
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:17,620
I don't understand.
I thought you were okay with it.

256
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,423
You said, "no problemo."

257
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,332
Well, it is a problemo. I'm angry.

258
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,128
I can't believe you'd
make a decision that big

259
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,133
without talking to
me about it at all.

260
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:27,072
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,356
Look, I don't want us
to end on bad terms.

262
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:33,593
I don't either.
I just don't know how I feel

263
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,822
about releasing you
from your contract.

264
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,610
What are you saying?

265
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,390
We've invested a
lot in you, Betty.

266
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,371
If it was anyone else, I'd say no.

267
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,535
I need to think about this.

268
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,290
Okay. Well...

269
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:50,623
They need the form right
away or I'll lose the job.

270
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:53,212
I said I would think about it.

271
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:56,707
All right. Well, then I guess
we'll talk about it later.

272
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,978
I mean, can you believe
the nerve of that Claire?

273
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,750
What have I ever done to her?

274
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,266
Several things come to mind.
Like, oh, I don't know...

275
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,567
Stealing sperm from
her husband's corpse?

276
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:12,027
Well, the craziest thing is,

277
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:13,839
before old chicken neck showed up,

278
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:16,268
I was just so happy to be alive,

279
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,695
I was just willing to
let the whole thing go.

280
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:22,411
That's not crazy. That's wonderful!
It was a moment of weakness.

281
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:25,072
If those idiots want
me to save Tyler,

282
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:27,804
they're gonna have to hand
over the whole damn company.

283
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,968
Oh, Willie, don't say that.
That's wrong.

284
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:32,452
Oh, you're one to
be judging me, Marc.

285
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,672
After all these years,

286
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:36,420
whenever I needed something
that was morally questionable,

287
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:37,929
you were right there with me.

288
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,606
You're right. I was willing
to do anything for you.

289
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:47,906
You were like my mother,

290
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,119
my goddess, my diva.

291
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,579
Y-you know, you were-
-you were my life.

292
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:56,247
I thought that if you had
everything you wanted,

293
00:14:56,341 --> 00:14:58,571
you'd be happy, but...

294
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,303
You'll never be happy.

295
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:04,579
There's always something more.

296
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,209
Thank you.

297
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:13,476
Oh, hi, Betty. Oh, hi, Mrs. Meade.

298
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,808
You sound like I feel,
which isn't great.

299
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,093
What's going on? I don't wanna
bore you with my problems.

300
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:20,569
Oh, Betty, please.

301
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:23,430
The last two weeks have been
nothing but gunshots and comas.

302
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:25,953
I would love to
hear your problems.

303
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:29,389
Well, actually, um,
it's sort of about...

304
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:31,354
Daniel.

305
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:35,847
Oh! There you are!

306
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,154
What are you doing?

307
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:38,991
You know I steal when I get upset.

308
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,508
Spencer screamed at
me 'cause he ended up

309
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,056
in one of those "who
wore it better"? Columns.

310
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:45,180
And only 82% of people
said Ellen degeneres

311
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,360
wore the suit better
than he did. No.

312
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,828
I hate him. He's dead to me.

313
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:51,312
I never wanna talk to him again.
He's your father.

314
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,300
Is everything okay, dear?

315
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,584
Yeah. It's just Betty.

316
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,868
Sh-she wants to leave,
and... I heard.

317
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,769
I tawt I taw the
tweety bird tattoo

318
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,029
when he lifted up his shirt

319
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,657
and a little bit of
crackage popped out.

320
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:06,374
I didn't wanna say anything
to you because, well,

321
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,730
I wasn't sure,
but then Halston died,

322
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,431
and you were so sad. Oh, my God.

323
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:14,090
Marc, what am I gonna do?
Should I tell him?

324
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:16,271
But then what if I tell him,
and he rejects me?

325
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:17,882
What if... what if
he's not my father,

326
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,170
and I have to go through
all of this all over again?

327
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,535
What if you have to go through
this all over again? Ooh.

328
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:23,362
Hey, Amanda.
Wow, I see you more now

329
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,319
than when you actually worked here.
Not funny, Suarez!

330
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:28,866
That's not funny at all!
That's terrible timing!

331
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:32,853
Sorry. I'm not doing well
with anyone around here today.

332
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,946
Okay, seriously, whatever drama
you got going on today...

333
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,550
I've been sucked into enough.
I don't need it!

334
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,937
So what's up?

335
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:45,742
Well, look, before I go to London,

336
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:48,108
I have to get released from
my contract... ugh! God!

337
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,630
Betty. Honestly!

338
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:51,115
Go on.

339
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,687
Okay, are we talking
or not? Mm-hmm.

340
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:57,276
Just the other night,
we were here talking and working.

341
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:58,575
I mean, she's writing my bio.

342
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,652
I wouldn't trust
anyone else to do that.

343
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:02,159
Are you sure this isn't about

344
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,636
more than just Betty's
editing skills?

345
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:05,968
What are you talking about?

346
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:10,182
I'm talking about the fact that
you might have feelings for her.

347
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,498
What?

348
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,511
He's a bully!
And he's manipulative!

349
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,442
And he as a weak chin. Yeah!

350
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:17,359
Yeah! Yeah, um... what? No! No,
he doesn't.

351
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:18,785
What does that have
to do with anything?

352
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,928
He's... well, keep... keep-
-keep... keep ranting, though.

353
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:21,987
Come on, mom,
that's crazy! Perhaps.

354
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:24,423
Or could it explain your behavior?

355
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:26,467
What? No! No way.

356
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:28,296
Daniel, darling, you were so upset

357
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:29,747
at the possibility of her leaving,

358
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:31,304
you nearly burned
down your office.

359
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:34,445
If you are having such a
hard time with her leaving,

360
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:37,121
you need to give her
a reason to stay.

361
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,860
Well, I think you need
to go and give him

362
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:40,185
a piece of your mind.

363
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,189
You know what? I will. Thanks! Yeah.
Good! You're welcome.

364
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,214
Daniel, I...

365
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:49,450
Me first. Betty,
I can't live without you.

366
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:03,125
So what exactly did Daniel say?

367
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:06,217
He offered me a promotion-
full-fledged editor...

368
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,253
And a really nice bump in salary.

369
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,067
That's major, a.B.
I know. What do I do?

370
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:13,658
Seems pretty clear to me.
You have to take it.

371
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:16,315
Papi, come on. There are a
lot of things to consider.

372
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,110
Hey, we... we got great news, too.

373
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,114
What? Nothing. Nothing.

374
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,023
No, it's not nothing.
It's something.

375
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,723
Come on. What is it?
We're gonna get a place in the city!

376
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,047
Yay!

377
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,531
I think that's great.

378
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,840
Great news. I-I'm
gonna go wash dishes.

379
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:38,988
Why did you say anything?!

380
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:42,425
We don't know if we're taking it yet!
Um, Betty might stay.

381
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:43,380
I thought it was a good

382
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:45,281
time to test the waters.
Hilda, it's okay.

383
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:46,957
No, it's not okay!

384
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:50,857
And you don't tell me what is
okay and what isn't okay! Okay?

385
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,070
Okay.

386
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:00,618
Ay. I'm sorry.

387
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,767
I am sorry. It's not you, okay?

388
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:04,114
I just...

389
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,255
Ay. Look, I'm so happy for you.

390
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:10,683
You're living your dream,
and I am so proud of you.

391
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:16,112
I just feel like I finally have
a chance at living my dream...

392
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:19,628
The happy family life
that I've always wanted...

393
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:21,576
And I can't do it.

394
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,484
I mean, how is papi gonna feel

395
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,841
if we both leave him alone?

396
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,981
I don't know.

397
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:34,553
I don't know how
papi is gonna feel.

398
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:38,222
But if you want that place,
get it.

399
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,730
Yeah.

400
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:45,567
Hilda, you deserve to be happy.

401
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:59,309
Rouge alert! Rouge alert!

402
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:00,864
Our sources have just confirmed

403
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,172
that wilhelmina Slater
is en route to "mode,"

404
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:04,673
where she will be
publicly speaking

405
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:06,893
about her shooting
for the first time.

406
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,682
Who shot the diabolical diva?

407
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:10,534
And what gorgeous piece of couture

408
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:12,961
did they blast a hole through?
Stick with me,

409
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:16,061
because wilhelmina always
tells suzuki first.

410
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,858
Willie! Willie, suzuks here!

411
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:20,342
Out of my way, clown.

412
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:22,347
Cut!

413
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,502
Thank you, all,
for meeting me here.

414
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:25,786
I have a brief statement,

415
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,743
and then I'd like to
get back to my office.

416
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,963
As you can imagine,
work really piles up

417
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,271
when you're in a coma.

418
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:34,267
There's been some speculation
as to what happened

419
00:20:34,342 --> 00:20:37,090
the night I was shot. And I...

420
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,540
And...

421
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,120
I'd like to put the
rumors to rest,

422
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,173
let the truth speak for itself.

423
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,416
It was not Claire
Meade who shot me,

424
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:52,536
although it's obvious why
people would think so.

425
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:55,825
It was...

426
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,174
It was me.

427
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:11,683
I s cleaning my gun,
and I shot myself by accident.

428
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:13,863
So... sorry to disappoint,

429
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:17,428
but there was no drama
that night. Just...

430
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,928
A foolish mistake.

431
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:31,311
Well, thank you for
an informative day.

432
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:33,874
That was a complete waste of time.

433
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:36,456
I can't believe I'm saying this,

434
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:38,132
but... thank you.

435
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,089
Don't thank me.
I didn't do it for you. Right.

436
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,542
Forgive me for saying so,
but why do I feel like

437
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:49,082
I'm going to pay for this one day?
Because you don't know me.

438
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:52,197
So go ahead and unclench
everything. We're good.

439
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:55,529
Well, as good as you and I can be.

440
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:58,286
Really?

441
00:21:58,332 --> 00:21:59,867
Yes, really, Claire.

442
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,948
Chamomile?

443
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:16,416
Thank you.

444
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,373
Justin, I don't know what to do.

445
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:25,041
If I go to London,
am I being selfish?

446
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:27,564
I feel like I'm letting
everyone down...

447
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:33,517
Papi, Daniel, Hilda.

448
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:36,553
Not to mention, it's such a risk...
aunt Betty...

449
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,678
You're all about risk.

450
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:43,346
You took a job at "mode" magazine.

451
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,166
You showed up to your
first day of work

452
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:49,683
in a poncho that
reeked of disaster.

453
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:53,223
But...

454
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:55,683
You became a star.

455
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:58,792
And it's not selfish.

456
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:03,412
It helps, kind of,
to... to see you be so brave.

457
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,552
You know, it...

458
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:09,381
It sort of raises the
bar for the rest of us.

459
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,320
Not to mention,

460
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:16,645
I get to visit my
cool aunt in London.

461
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:20,369
How did you get so smart?

462
00:23:21,863 --> 00:23:23,661
I had a few good teachers.

463
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:50,007
You're leaving, aren't you?

464
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,532
Uh, do you have, um,

465
00:24:01,217 --> 00:24:02,808
another copy of that...

466
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,076
Paper you want me to sign?

467
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,139
Are we good?

468
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:39,367
We're good.

469
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,603
Daniel... I'm supposed
to be at a meeting,

470
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:48,368
uh, right now.

471
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:51,867
So why don't we, um...

472
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,249
Talk later?

473
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:12,483
Betty, this is such a great party.

474
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:13,854
And thank you so much

475
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:16,395
for making it a farewell
to Halston. Yeah.

476
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:18,079
That was a surprise.

477
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,070
It's just so perfect...
good luck, Betty. Bye.

478
00:25:20,124 --> 00:25:24,090
Finally realizing where
he belongs... "mode."

479
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:34,953
Oh, Mrs. Meade.

480
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,598
I'm so glad you came.

481
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:39,930
Oh, Betty. I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

482
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,982
I'm so proud of you.

483
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,235
Thank you.

484
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:46,943
Do you think Daniel's coming?

485
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:48,443
I don't know.

486
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:51,391
He's been avoiding me for days.

487
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:54,611
I think he hates me now.

488
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:56,455
He doesn't.

489
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:59,292
Losing you is very
hard for him, Betty.

490
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,753
I don't even think he
knows quite why yet.

491
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,372
What do you mean?

492
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:07,616
I have a theory.

493
00:26:09,078 --> 00:26:10,654
What?

494
00:26:13,562 --> 00:26:16,529
Really? No. No. No.

495
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:28,552
Hey. Hey.

496
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,053
This is fun. I'm really
glad I got to come.

497
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:34,089
Well, you were an intern here.
You're a "modie," too.

498
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:37,820
Why don't you go dance with him?

499
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,230
Oh. Come on. You know you want to.

500
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,620
He's got a boyfriend. That guy?

501
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:45,536
Mnh-mnh. Reeks of rebound.

502
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,744
I don't think that's
gonna work out.

503
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:49,896
Oh, what do you know?

504
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,204
You're recently hatched
from the gay egg.

505
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,617
You still have lot to
learn about relationships.

506
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:56,045
So do you.

507
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:33,057
Look out, skinny bitches!

508
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,957
I don't care who sits here.

509
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:38,370
This big orange doughnut
will always be mine!

510
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,718
And Halston's.

511
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:48,235
Oh, hi.

512
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:50,790
You made it.

513
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:52,443
Of course.

514
00:27:52,593 --> 00:27:55,393
I couldn't miss that
pooch's farewell.

515
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:57,524
I didn't realize you knew Betty.

516
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,824
I was talking about Halston.

517
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,003
Oh.

518
00:28:01,593 --> 00:28:02,663
Right.

519
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,251
Uh, Daniel. This is Betty.

520
00:28:09,264 --> 00:28:10,959
Um... it's my going away party...

521
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,579
And you're not here.

522
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:16,064
Uh, I was just wondering
if you're gonna come.

523
00:28:16,348 --> 00:28:19,844
I really hope that I get
to see you before I leave.

524
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:22,536
Okay. Bye.

525
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:26,547
You know, you do work for
two editors-in-chief.

526
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:28,688
I have to find out you're leaving

527
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:30,646
through a mass e-mail?

528
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:32,704
You never asked my permission.

529
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:37,342
Permission granted.

530
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:39,673
Thank you. It's interesting.

531
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,725
You spent four years of your life

532
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,330
working your way
up the ladder here,

533
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:45,870
and now you're
throwing it all away.

534
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:49,002
Um... yeah, I...

535
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:51,416
I never thought I'd
say this, but...

536
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:55,082
You've got big balls,
Betty Suarez.

537
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:03,056
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

538
00:29:08,406 --> 00:29:11,721
I don't know why I got so
competitive with Ellen.

539
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:13,861
She wore the hell
out of that suit.

540
00:29:14,602 --> 00:29:16,271
Spencer, I have
something to tell you,

541
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:18,870
and I'm really worried about
how you're gonna react.

542
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,424
I know you're my daughter.

543
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,366
What? How?

544
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,714
I recently found out from a friend

545
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:26,989
that fey got pregnant

546
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:30,226
shortly after I... was with her.

547
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:32,758
It was the '80s, studio 54.

548
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,499
I got so blitzed out of my mind,

549
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,655
I thought fey was Andy warhol.

550
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:40,122
I contacted an agency to find you.

551
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,070
And then I hired you as my stylist

552
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,155
so I could get to know you first.

553
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:50,255
I wanted to make sure
I wasn't intruding.

554
00:29:51,972 --> 00:29:53,548
It's okay.

555
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:55,911
Really?

556
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,507
Really. I've been waiting
years for you to intrude.

557
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:02,329
Well, then...

558
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:04,133
I forbid you to see that boy.

559
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:06,089
Wait. What boy? What are you
talking about? I don't know.

560
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:08,053
It just sounded like a
fatherly thing to say.

561
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:09,601
Oh. Then I hate you, dad!

562
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:20,406
Marc.

563
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:21,489
Yeah. Got you!

564
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:22,831
Oh, yes.

565
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,732
I'm gonna miss you.

566
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:28,623
I know.

567
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:31,283
And you're gonna miss me.

568
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,869
Take care of everything here.

569
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,064
Are you going to talk to her?

570
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,164
I think I need to let her go.

571
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:53,795
What?

572
00:31:53,865 --> 00:31:55,520
Go to the marked tabs.

573
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:06,421
Those'll be your pages to fill.

574
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:09,256
You're now sole
editor-in-chief of "mode."

575
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,925
I'm stepping down. It's time.

576
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:14,825
I got this job because
it was handed to me,

577
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,629
but... you've earned it.

578
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:19,513
Well...

579
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:21,597
This is quite a surprise.

580
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:25,077
How does... Claire feel about it?

581
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,243
Oh, she's given it her blessing.

582
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,190
Congratulations, wilhelmina.

583
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:36,259
And, uh, what are you gonna do?

584
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,751
I'm gonna start over.

585
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,885
Okay, everybody. Gather round.

586
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,289
I'd like to make a toast.

587
00:32:57,335 --> 00:32:59,333
This is gonna be his last
attempt to make you stay.

588
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:00,834
I just want to say...

589
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:03,415
I know I can't stop my
daughters from leaving.

590
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:06,290
But I can give them
a little advice.

591
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,767
Betty...

592
00:33:07,956 --> 00:33:09,723
You're moving across an ocean.

593
00:33:10,536 --> 00:33:12,047
Where you'll have no family,

594
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:15,219
no friends,
you won't know the city.

595
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:16,415
Papi.

596
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,067
I know what that's like, mija.

597
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,436
Oh, we were so afraid.

598
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,264
But it was the best decision
we made in our lives.

599
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:34,477
Something tells me...
you'll look back

600
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:37,482
and think the same
about this move.

601
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:39,870
Thank you, papi.

602
00:33:43,306 --> 00:33:44,538
Next.

603
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:46,974
No, stop. No advice.
I-I gotta tell you something.

604
00:33:47,012 --> 00:33:48,732
Wait. No, papi, me first.

605
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:50,407
My advice is that
you're very stubborn

606
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:52,745
and you don't listen. Ha!

607
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:55,205
Tell him.

608
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,714
We're moving to Manhattan.

609
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,679
And there's plenty of room.

610
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:01,379
Yeah, we want you to
come and live with us.

611
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:02,861
Yeah.

612
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:05,483
That's very sweet.

613
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:07,085
And I appreciate it.

614
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,379
But I'm not going anywhere.

615
00:34:09,457 --> 00:34:11,150
We're not gonna let
you live here alone.

616
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:13,187
I want to live here alone.

617
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:14,431
Don't you think I'm a little tired

618
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:16,387
of sharing one bathroom
with the three of you?

619
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:20,360
Believe me, my bladder isn't
what it used to be. Oh, come on.

620
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:23,203
I thought we were gonna have
an elegant lunch, but...

621
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:26,464
Oh, I want my daughters
and my grandson

622
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,333
to live their lives
the way they want.

623
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,193
A nosotros.

624
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:33,885
A nosotros.

625
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:43,278
I heard congratulations
were in order,

626
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:45,866
and I wanted to be
one of the first.

627
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:48,237
Thank you, you are
the first, indeed.

628
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:50,498
You can put the flowers anywhere.

629
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:53,254
You... always seem
to know what's right.

630
00:35:01,405 --> 00:35:02,787
Okay. Well...

631
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,961
Uh, not so fast.

632
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,887
Now that "mode" is mine,

633
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:10,434
uh, I'm going to be doing
some housecleaning...

634
00:35:11,032 --> 00:35:12,671
Getting rid of some of the fat.

635
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,603
But Betty already left.

636
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,327
You know, I really
am gonna miss her.

637
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:27,315
Anyway, uh, I might need to
lean on you a little more...

638
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:29,006
Creatively...

639
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:31,162
If you feel you're up to it.

640
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,750
Yes. Sure.

641
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:37,486
I'm happy to be
leaned on creatively.

642
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:38,946
Good.

643
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,478
But no more schemes, right?

644
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:43,387
Well, uh...

645
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:47,094
There is just one.

646
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:56,403
I, uh...

647
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:57,967
Pulled some strings
with the senator

648
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:01,396
and got you a new cell mate-
a fairly high-profile type.

649
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:04,040
And why does this
high-profile prisoner

650
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:06,093
put such a twinkle in your eye?

651
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:07,966
Well, the feds are hoping

652
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:09,741
to extract a
confession out of him.

653
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,369
And someone who could
sweet-talk a guard

654
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:16,045
into letting him out of
prison to visit his girlfriend

655
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:17,738
might get him to talk.

656
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,973
And if so,

657
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:22,634
that person could suddenly
find his sentence...

658
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,436
Drastically reduced.

659
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:26,400
Well...

660
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,629
I think this guy
is going to find me

661
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,050
very hard to resist.

662
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:36,510
I couldn't agree more.

663
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:41,506
Okay.

664
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:44,219
First... what are you...

665
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:45,376
We have a surprise.
What are you doing?

666
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,740
You cannot go to
Europe in those. So...

667
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,170
Nice. Okay, can I take mine, too?

668
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:54,280
No. Come o...

669
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,512
Good-bye.

670
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:01,484
Bye.

671
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,840
You're gonna come
visit me soon, right?

672
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:07,582
Yeah. Summer can't
come soon enough.

673
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:11,873
I love you.

674
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,261
Be safe.

675
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:22,566
You go be great, chipmunk.
All right? Okay.

676
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,295
Be good, Austin.

677
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:34,649
Te quiero, mija.

678
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,365
I love you, papi.

679
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:41,148
Okay, okay. Okay.

680
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:43,136
Um, I will call you
as soon as I land.

681
00:37:43,183 --> 00:37:45,045
It might be very early,
so just wait till you wake up

682
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:47,441
and call me back, okay? We will.

683
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:18,490
Betty.

684
00:39:18,552 --> 00:39:19,662
Oh! Sorry.

685
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:23,035
Daniel.

686
00:39:24,335 --> 00:39:25,638
So... was that hard for you?

687
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,252
Not really.

688
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:28,446
Well... I just...

689
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:31,195
I realized I've had
everything handed to me.

690
00:39:31,264 --> 00:39:33,775
I've... I've never really
gotten anything on my own,

691
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,284
like... like you.

692
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,727
Well... I know there's a
lot you can do, Daniel.

693
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:42,556
Thank you.

694
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:45,007
And I also realized...

695
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:46,316
I didn't say good-bye,

696
00:39:46,362 --> 00:39:49,521
which is, uh, really not cool.

697
00:39:49,884 --> 00:39:50,923
So...

698
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,184
Good-bye...

699
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,253
And good luck...

700
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,089
And...

701
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:58,349
Have a safe flight. Thank you.

702
00:39:58,403 --> 00:40:00,282
I'll call you when I get there.

703
00:40:02,888 --> 00:40:04,118
So...

704
00:40:05,762 --> 00:40:08,466
So that's it? You're, uh,
headed back to New York?

705
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:13,351
No. I think I'm gonna...

706
00:40:13,763 --> 00:40:15,658
Stay around here for a while,

707
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:17,254
see what I can find.

708
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,514
Maybe take you to dinner...

709
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,022
Tonight, if you're free.

710
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:25,347
I would love that.

711
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:31,239
Well, I better get back to work.

712
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:35,277
I'm really glad you're here.

713
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,999
I'll, um, call you later.

714
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:42,587
Okay. Okay.

715
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,408
Hey, if you want something to do,

716
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,388
I am looking for a new assistant.

717
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:57,788
