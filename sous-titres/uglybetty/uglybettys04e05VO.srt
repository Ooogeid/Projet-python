1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,110
papi,I'm coming home
right now. I promise.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,550
well,don't blame me if
your arroz con pollo is dry.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,480
It's not meant to be reheated.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,250
I'm sure it will still be delicious.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,010
I'll see you soon. Love you. Bye.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,520
Uh,sorry. Sorry,sorry.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,390
I didn't mean to scare you.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,490
W-- that's
okay. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,700
I-I just came by to say,

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,860
I really liked your
pitch for a "green" issue.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,080
Wilhelmina was wrong. It did
not "reek of recycled manure.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,770
" thank you. And I-I really
liked your "get sporty" idea.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,110
You were not "nothing but nose
hair" while you were pitching it.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,890
and I've also been meaning to tell you,

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,520
I'm really digging your new look.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,310
Oh,thanks.

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm sorry,I have to do this.

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,990
your hair was caught.

19
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,700
Thank you.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,600
Have a good night.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,120
You,too.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,150
hey,I thought we were leaving together.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,730
Oh,marc,you can't honestly be
asking me to stay any later.

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,990
I'm exhausted.

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,250
I've been working since
9:00 A.M. Without a break.

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,080
And by "working," do you mean
"gossiping" and "complaining"?

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,820
Hey,mandy-licious.

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,750
hey,matty-licious.

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,950
- are you okay,marc?
- Oh,yeah,I'm fine.

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,920
I just got a piece of
corny stuck in my throat.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,140
Amanda,listen. Wilhelmina thinks
that some of the "real" people

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,560
we shot for the "real people"
column were a little too "real.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,610
" so I was wondering if you
wouldn't mind staying just for a bit,

34
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,590
just to go over pictures. absolutely.
No problem. I love staying late.

35
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,980
somebody's in a rush to get out of here.

36
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,500
Oh,I'm just trying to avoid hartley.

37
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,720
Plus,I wanted to meet natalie
for this whole group meeting.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,520
Oh,yeah. How is that going?

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,270
Goodactually you know,it's really
helping me al with losing molly.

40
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,320
That's great.

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,360
By the way,I've noticed you and matt
have been a little chummy lately.

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,880
Anything you'd care to report?

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,140
Um,no. Not at the moment.

44
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,600
But maybe I'll have some news for you
by the time we have our lunch tomorrow.

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,560
That's right. Uh...

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,890
our first ever
non-professional,just friends lunch.

47
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,830
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna lp you go
through your rum to find a new assistant,

48
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,310
because clearly,you forgot
that we even had a lunch.

49
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,780
Betty,how could I ever replace you?

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,890
well,what an unpleasant surprise.

51
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,190
Wait,uh,wilhelmina?

52
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,880
I want you to know how much I respect

53
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,510
all the work you've been doing in tibet.

54
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,000
It's a very special country to me

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,300
because it was very close to
molly's heart,so thank you.

56
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,040
why the hell was pasty-face

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,520
hugging me and mumbling
something about tibet?

58
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,720
Oh,um,that might...

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,000
be because you're being honored

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,200
at the annual "style
cares" charity event.

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,910
- Why? - Uh,because--
you-- mm--

62
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,070
- you give a lot of money to orpha in tibet.
- When?

63
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,970
- Over the past five years.
- How?

64
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,130
Uh,through,a tax-deductible
charitable foundation

65
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,130
set up by your accountant and someone.

66
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,670
- Who?
- Me.

67
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,900
But I only did it because
your accountant told me to.

68
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,610
But the good news is,you don't have to

69
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,520
traipse across town to
some tired old ballroom

70
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,720
for the event because the honore always

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,990
hosts the event in their own home...

72
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,720
so that more money
can go to the orphans.

73
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,230
And when,exactly,were you going
to tell me about all of this?

74
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,580
The day before the event,so
you'd have less time to hit me.

75
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,540
Think of the tiny baby orphans...

76
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,720
and your public image.

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,070
I suppose you do make a good
point about my public image.

78
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,490
But who the hell would get
excited about a charity event?

79
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,010
I've been invited to a charity event!

80
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,240
And it's at wilhelmina'S.

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,110
atilhelmina's apartment?

82
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,470
How exclusive!

83
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,520
Can you steal
me something--

84
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,720
like a napkin,an olive,anything?

85
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,850
Oh,my god. Look at you.

86
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,530
Last year,you had to
steal a dress to get in.

87
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,100
Now you're totally legit.

88
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,120
Well,being an editor has its perks.

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,830
Well,getting your dinner
at the right temperature

90
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,300
certainly isn't one of them.

91
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,970
Sorry. I'm making this about me.

92
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,410
So... who's gonna be your plus one?

93
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,260
I don't know. Um...

94
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,180
I mean,maybe,I'll... invite matt.

95
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,930
What?! Are you crazy?

96
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,270
After everything that has happened?

97
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,640
Hilda,come on. I know
what this sounds like,

98
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,640
but things have been going
really well between us.

99
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,190
And I know that there
is still something there.

100
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,920
And what better place to
start over than a party,huh?

101
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,670
I mean,that was--
that was incredible!

102
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,630
During that last focus
exercise,I got to this place of...

103
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,340
I mean,I don't even
know how to describe it.

104
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,540
- It was...
- I know.

105
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,890
It-- it was
so peaceful!

106
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,960
I know. I feel the exact same way.

107
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
It's like I feel closer
to robbie than ever.

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,550
God! I can't believe
I am saying all this.

109
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,160
I was such a sour bitch
before you knew me.

110
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,130
Wait,um,"before"?

111
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,820
Oh,you know what really sucks?

112
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,300
Once I get back to work,

113
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,720
all this stress starts coming
in from all sides,and I just...

114
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,820
I lose this great
feeling I have right now.

115
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,090
Oh,hey.

116
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:40,710
You know,if you ever need any
help or guidance or whatever...

117
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,620
I'm always available.
You know that,right?

118
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,140
Well,maybe I should just
hire you as my personal guru.

119
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,850
Oh,please! I could really use the money.

120
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,460
you know what?

121
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,610
I-I just had a crazy thought.

122
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,410
<i>will you be my plus-one? Betty</i>

123
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,140
- Hey.
- Hey.

124
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,470
I'm glad you're here.

125
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,950
Actually...

126
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,810
there's something I've been meaning
to ask you about wilhelmina's party.

127
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,700
- Really?
- And let--

128
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,810
let me preface my question

129
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,990
by saying you really
don't have to say yes.

130
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,560
In fact,I'd be perfectly
fine if you said no,

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,260
because I'm not really
even sure it's a good idea.

132
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,310
Matt,I'm sure it's a great idea.

133
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,340
All right,then. Would you be okay...

134
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,120
- yes.
- If I brought a date?

135
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,660
Yes. Of course.

136
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,050
That'S...
great that y--

137
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,320
why wouldn't it be okay for you
to bring a date? That's great.

138
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,270
Cool,cool. Um...

139
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,350
and I'm sure you'll probably
be bringing someone,too.

140
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,610
- Yep.
- Great.

141
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,190
Yep. Yes,I'm bringing someone.

142
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,710
So... so...

143
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,760
now it won't be awkward
for either one of us,

144
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,720
uh,to see the oer one
with another person,

145
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,540
'cause we'll both be
there with other people.

146
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,710
Yay.

147
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,810
hey,look! There's,uh,katie from sales.

148
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,890
Yep,there she is.

149
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,500
Anyway,I'm glad you're so
cool with the whole date thing.

150
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,420
Oh,yeah. No,I'm cool with it.

151
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,430
I'm more than cool with
it. I'm freezing with it.

152
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,980
brr!

153
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,490
please tell me you did not say that!

154
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,110
Well,what was i supposed to say?

155
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,320
You shouldn't have said anything.
You should've decked him.

156
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,860
Hilda,you were right.

157
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,380
I don't know why I keep hoping that

158
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,240
things are gonna work
out between me and matt.

159
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,060
- I'm so stupid!
- You are not stupid,okay?

160
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,090
You were just following
your stupid heart.

161
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,350
I know it's ridiculous.

162
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,800
It's just,I can't
help but feel replaced.

163
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,920
That is not true!

164
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,960
You are one of a kind,betty
suarez,and don't you ever forget it.

165
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,040
Nobody could ever replace you,okay?

166
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,710
Okay. Look,I gotta go
I'm meeting daniel. Bye.

167
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,980
hey.

168
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,140
Betty,hey. I finally replaced you.

169
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,170
Meet natalie,my new assistant.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,700
You really think it's a good idea

174
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,130
to hire someone you
met in grief counseling?

175
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,880
I mean,doesn't she know all sorts
of personal things about you?

176
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,350
Won't that be kind of weird?

177
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,360
Actually,it's kind of great.

178
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,550
I'm super comfortable with her
because she knows me so well.

179
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,500
You know,it's kind of like
I found another you,betty.

180
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,210
Well...

181
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,020
what kind of office
experience does she have?

182
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,890
Didn't you say she was
a-a massage therapist?

183
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,960
Turns out that requires a lot
more paperwork than you'd think.

184
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,900
Plus,she's so excited to be here.

185
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,000
I mean,she got a new
haircut and everything.

186
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,390
Oh,you did notice.

187
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,650
I did. It looks great.

188
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,760
Thanks. Can you help
me with these phones?

189
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,140
I just pressed this button,and
there was a really loud squeak.

190
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,620
Uh,hey,you know what?

191
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,160
Betty,can you give her a
quick orientation? Do you mind?

192
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,070
No,of course not.

193
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,800
wow. You'd be a knockout in that.

194
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,950
Is that what you're wearing
to wilhelmina's party?

195
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,220
no.

196
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,990
Some dumb editor is,because only
dumb editors get to go to the party.

197
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,970
Not that I want to go to a dumb
editor party anyway. It's so dumb.

198
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh,really? Well,that's too bad
because I was gonna invite you.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,170
But if you
think it's dumb--

200
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,210
dumb? Who said it was dumb?

201
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,180
No,no,no,no. You're right. Hanging
out with a bunch of editors--

202
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,750
it sounds boring.

203
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,890
But it would at least
be fun if you were there.

204
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,610
- It would?
- So what do you say?

205
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,710
I have to check my calendar.

206
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,690
What do you know? I'm free. What time?

207
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,980
well,I have to come
straight from a meeting,

208
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,560
so I'll be late,but you
come whenever you want,

209
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,360
and find me when you get there.

210
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,810
Okay.

211
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,950
what? You're going with betty's matt?

212
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,290
Isn't that going to break
her pudgy little heart?

213
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,590
Marc,it's just that matt
makes me feel smart and pretty.

214
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,880
Can't you just be happy for me?

215
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,030
I'm sorry. It's just that I assumed

216
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,840
your attraction for baby fartley

217
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,250
startearted and ended with
his money-filled pockets,

218
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,940
but now I see you
actually like this guy.

219
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,550
I do. I can't help it. He completes me.

220
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,560
Oh,mandy!

221
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,600
You're having real feelings!

222
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,590
now I am happy for you!

223
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,840
don't be happy for me.

224
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,330
I'm gonna break betty's
pudgy little heart.

225
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,850
- I hate feelings.
- Well...

226
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,530
- marc,when did i get so deep?
- I don't know.

227
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,050
Look,why don't you just t
go to the party with matt?

228
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,450
That would be the selfless thing to do.

229
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,900
no,seriously. You can either tell betty
the truth,pray she doesn't show up,

230
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,300
or,you know,find some way
of cushioning the blow.

231
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,210
no,those really are your options.

232
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,660
so in order to write
your speech for tomorrow,

233
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,920
I just need to get a
feel for who you are.

234
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,950
For example,what inspired
you to help tibetan orphans?

235
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,060
Marc!

236
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,010
Many years ago,ms. Slater embarked
on a soul-searching pilgrimage

237
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,170
to the tiny village of
tawang,high in the himalayas.

238
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,860
It was here that she
experienced a holy vision,

239
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,100
which brought her to this
organization,and ultimately...

240
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,650
her life's mission.

241
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,400
- now holy
v-- - bup,bup!

242
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,100
Wilhelmina slater's office.

243
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,530
Uh,y-- uh,hold
on just a minute.

244
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,690
It's nico. She sounds upset.

245
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,620
Darling,what's wrong?

246
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,540
Don't say another word.

247
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,410
willie,you're coming back,right? Willie?

248
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,530
You've got what you need,right?

249
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,360
All righty. Uh,I'll show you
how to check the messages.

250
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,900
you've reached betty suarez,assistant
to daniel meade,editor-in-chief--

251
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,670
greeting deted.

252
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,840
Now how do I do a new one with my voice?

253
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,430
You have your files backed up,right?

254
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,010
- I do. -
But it's--

255
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,460
- great.
- In the trash.

256
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,910
- Okay.
- Awesome.

257
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,190
I like to keep his
messages on this side. Yeah.

258
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,430
I'm gonna keep them on this side,so
he can grab 'em as he walks by.

259
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,690
Well,I think he's pretty used
to me handing them to him.

260
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,090
Hey,this is convenient,thanks.

261
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,080
<i>Betty's Computer</i>

262
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,920
<i>Natalie's Computer</i>

263
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,040
all right,so that's about it.

264
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,350
Well,thank you so much for your help.

265
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,460
Ok.

266
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,870
Oh! Don't forget this.

267
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,610
- Oh,thanks.
- Yeah.

268
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,660
Like I was never here.

269
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,200
Oh,will
you--

270
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,580
uh! Daniel meade's office.

271
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,360
Can you remind daniel
that we have a lunch?

272
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,110
- Yeah.
Uh-huh. - great.

273
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,990
Yeah,no. This is natalie.

274
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,270
Yeah,I'm his new assistant.

275
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,130
Yeah. Sure.

276
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,970
I'm not surei'mhat looking
at,detective castelar.

277
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,820
Is that a smudge of dirt?

278
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,770
It's a thumbprint. In blood.

279
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,890
Eh,if you say so.

280
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,560
I'm afraid that you're not
a terribly good photographer.

281
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,670
I found the print on
jonathan vieja's boat.

282
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,670
It's his blood.

283
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,100
The print belongs to your daughter.

284
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,860
Well,nico spent a lot
of time on that boat.

285
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,090
They were dating.

286
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,420
I'm not sure what you think that proves.

287
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,750
I've worked for
jonathan's family before--

288
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,480
covering up his messes.

289
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,530
Your ex-boyfriend was
not a nice guy,was he?

290
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,170
He had a
temper--

291
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,050
especially with women.

292
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,090


294
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,190
You know,maybe I'm not being clear.

295
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,930
I don't think she's lucky.

296
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,390
I think she killed him.

297
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,030
I think she dumped the body overboard,

298
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,770
I think she got some
help cleaning up her mess,

299
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,050
and I think you missed a spot.

300
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,190
Well,if you think I do my own cleaning,

301
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,960
you don't know me very well.

302
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,580
I'm not the kind of person you'd
want as an enemy,mr. Castelar.

303
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,080
I've written a number on
the back of that picture.

304
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,470
I prefer cash.

305
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,110
are you actually trying to blackmail me?

306
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,650
well,that's adorable.

307
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,780
But it doesn't go like that,

308
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,880
so get out.

309
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,070
mom,what are you doing?
You'reot gonna pay him?

310
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,390
I will do what I always do.

311
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,350
I'll beat him at his own game.

312
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,630
But he knows everything.

313
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,800
I don't want to go to jail.

314
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,570
You won't go to jail!

315
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,560
I'll handle this.

316
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,690
I know what I'm doing.

317
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,960
Ugh! Everyone is talking
about this ridic charity event.

318
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,420
If you ask me,it sounds
like a real snooze-fest.

319
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,390
I'm sure a super-fun girl
like you isn't going,are you?

320
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,770
Of course I'm going. I'm an editor. I
was invited. Why wouldn't I be going?

321
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,040
Why so upset-y,betty?

322
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,710
sorry. I'm just in a really weird place.

323
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,050
Daniel just hired a new assistant
and matt invited someone else.

324
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,920
Did matt say who he was taking?!

325
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,610
- No.
- Oh.

326
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,100
Wait,are you going by yourself?

327
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,670
- No!
- Oh.

328
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,260
- Who are you bringing?
- I don't know.

329
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,340
Amanda,what's with all the questions?

330
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,730
Nothing. I just wanted to ask because...

331
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,510
I know some great guys
I could set you up with.

332
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,150
Oh. Thanks. But,um...

333
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,230
I think I'm gonna ask a friend.

334
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,870
Maybe we should just hear him O.

335
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,000
Mom,the "wit and whimsy" column
has been in "mode" for 60 years.

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,180
I'm not gonna cut it
just to make room for ads.

337
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,210
I'm sorry. I have to draw the line.

338
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,300
Well,maybe you can draw
that line somewhere else.

339
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,760
You know,I'm putting a lot
of money into this company.

340
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,650
Of course I do. You rarely waste an
opportunity to remind us of that fact.

341
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,640
all I'm saying is,it would be nice

342
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,320
to see a little return on my investment.

343
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,510
You can understand that,can't you,son?

344
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Don't call me "son.

345
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,550
" Right.

346
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,060
You've both made your
opinions very clear.

347
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,930
Maybe we should all just
think this over for a bit.

348
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,410
Fine. Let's do that.

349
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,760
mm! There you are.

350
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,100
And there's natalie.

351
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,350
So natalie said how much
fun you guys had earlier,

352
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,010
so I thought you wouldn't
mind if she joined us.

353
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,770
Nope. What's to mind?

354
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,990
- And for you?
- Just an iced tea for me.

355
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,030
- You got it.
- Yeah,thanks.

356
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,010
- Oh,you're not eating?
- No,I'm on a special diet.

357
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,610
Oh.

358
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,920
I mean,sorry,what is that?

359
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,040
This is maca-greeny and cheese.

360
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,280
- Guess who gave me the recipe.
- Um,gloria?

361
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,510
Of course. but this is actually good.

362
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,190
who's gloria?

363
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,120
She's this weird woman from group.

364
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,490
Oh,she is not weird,she's eccentric.

365
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,560
She wears leg warmers every single day.

366
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,780
the point is,she only eats green foods

367
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,710
because she thinks they
help her phase better.

368
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,250
what is--
what's "phase"?

369
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,060
Oh,it's this exercise that we do.

370
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,800
- Involves breathing.
- Yeah,it's--

371
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,530
it's kind of hard to explain.

372
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,880
Okay.

373
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,370
um,so you were gonna catch us up
on things with you and matt,right?

374
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,170
oh,yeah. Daniel told me about you guys.

375
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,460
You're getting back
together or something?

376
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,400
Um... uh,no,actually.

377
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,030
I don't think that's gonna be haing.

378
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,290
Uh,I did think that maybe
there was still something there,

379
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,700
but apparently,he didn't,

380
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,230
because he's taking someone
else to wilhelmina's party.

381
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,880
Oh,I'm sorry.

382
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,850
No. I mean,thanks,but it's fine.

383
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,420
Anyway,I was
thinking--

384
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,770
you know how I used to always
be your plus one at work events?

385
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,500
Well,how do you feel about
being mine thi this time?

386
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Actually,um,I was already
gonna bring someone...

387
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,760
oh. Right. Of course. Duh.

388
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,410
I mean,you're the new me,huh?

389
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,120
- Yeah.
- But you can totally come and hang with us.

390
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,480
Yeah.

391
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,060
Yeah. Yeah,yeah.

392
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,690
Yeah,that would be fun. This is.

393
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,020
The writers finished
a draft of your speech.

394
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,340
I think it's appropriately
faux-modest,yet preachy.

395
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,160
You should probably
take a look at it,though.

396
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,690
Ugh,I don'tare.

397
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,030
Are you okay,willie?

398
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,180
I was worried when you raced
out of here this morning.

399
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,900
Everything is fine.

400
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,870
But I ed you to do some research.

401
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,390
See what dirt you
can dig up on this--

402
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,160
no. Willie,please.

403
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,850
I'm sorry,but I can'T.

404
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,890
I took this job because I
wanted to be a fashion editor,

405
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,300
not blackmailer or
a digger of dirt or--

406
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,500
fond as I am of
ascots and monocles--

407
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,210
a junior detective.

408
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm sorry.

409
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,200
I can't spend one more moment of my
life scrounging around in dumpsters,

410
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,720
looking for horrible
information on people.

411
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,470
Enough is enough. I-I can't
do it anymore. I'm sorry.

412
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,700
Nico killed her boyfriend.

413
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,280
I covered it up.

414
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,630
This detective is blackmailing
me,and I don't have the money.

415
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,170
I need to find out something on
this guy or we both go to jail.

416
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,190
Uh,I'll get right on it.

417
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,130
amanda,hey!

418
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,770
I'm going to wilhelmina's party.

419
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,110
- You found a friend?
- No.

420
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,500
- You found a date?
- No.

421
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,550
- You found your dad?
- No. You're setting me up.

422
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,130
- I'm taking you up on your offer.
- No! Okay.

423
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,480
And then four
pages of minis--

424
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,220
we're calling it "the thigh's
the limit," and that's february.

425
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,630
Great.

426
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,670
Um,but where's the
"wit and whimsy" column?

427
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,500
I was told that column was being cut.

428
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,640
No,it's not being cut.

429
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,450
I was very specific about that.

430
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,030
Well,that's the message
I got from your mother.

431
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,400
What?

432
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,260
I don't care if he's in a meeting.

433
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,070
Oh,my god!

434
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,930
oh,my god.

435
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,830
Daniel!

436
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,830
I should have told you
before about cal and me.

437
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,960
I don't want to hear about it.

438
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,600
But you deserve to know.
We were involved before.

439
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,260
It was a long time ago,when your father
and I were going through a particularly--

440
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,540
no,wait,. Are you saying
you had an affair with him?

441
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,320
Please,I'm
trying to--

442
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,620
stop! Okay? Don't talk to me.

443
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,710
I told you,you should have let him go.

444
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,200
That's easy for you to say,but
I'm not that kind of a parent.

445
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,290
Maybe we just don'tthink the
same when it comes to our kids.

446
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,080
You know,maybe it's better that
things didn't work out with ours.

447
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,570
Why would you say something like that?

448
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,490
You have no idea how
hard that was for me.

449
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,290
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,810
finally! Everybody's here already.

451
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,540
spicy little tamale.

452
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,390
these are all your friends?

453
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,410
Yep. And they're all here to meet you.

454
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,770
Well... amanda... you
said it was a mixer.

455
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,990
Instead,it's a bunch of guys and me.

456
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,390
God,would you stop
talking about matt already!

457
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,060
What? ! Who said anything about matt?

458
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,600
Betty,he has moved on.

459
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,060
You don't need him anymore.
Just get it together!

460
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,400
- What?
- Betty?

461
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
Hey,it's,uh,it's andy.

462
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,120
Andy,my favorite barista.

463
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,110
you gave me a free cookie
with my coffee the other day,

464
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,760
and I never got to thank you,so...

465
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,450
- thanks.
- Yeah,yeah. No,happy to do it.

466
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,010
I-- c-can I get you a
drink or some chips or--

467
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,850
um,yeah,sure. I'll have some wine.

468
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,320
Great.

469
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,690
hi. I'm here about the
ad you put in craigslist--

470
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,000
shh! Shut up about that!

471
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,880
We're all friends here,okay?

472
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,890
Friends! what's your name?

473
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,800
oh,I j-- I can't get
that image out of my head!

474
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,030
My mother
and-- and him?

475
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,970
What I-- what is that thing called
after the soldiers go through the war?

476
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,960
- Post-traumatic stress
disorder? - That's it.

477
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,610
Okay,you've been writing an angry
e-mail to your mother for over two hours.

478
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,960
Mm-hmm. So?

479
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,520
Remember in group when bennett
was talking about "brain-drainers"?

480
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,860
You know,people who
create unnecessary drama?

481
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,760
You know,look,don't get me wrong.

482
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,700
I've only been here for a day,but...

483
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,810
I've sn a lot of drama.

484
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,420
I mean,your mom,this
guy hartley,betty...

485
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,700
now wait a second. Hartley,yeah.

486
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,900
My mom,maybe. But not betty. No way.

487
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,020
Well,you know,she just
seems a little needy.

488
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,810
you know,when she asked you
to go to that party with her

489
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,120
and you said no and she acted
like she was fine with it?

490
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,700
She wasn't fine with it.

491
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,660
Yeah,but her ex-boyfriend
asked someone else to the party.

492
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,800
Yeah,drama.

493
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,690
I don't want to seem harsh,but isn't
this what you were complaining about--

494
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,660
all this stress coming at
you and ruining your clarity?

495
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,010
I don't think it's coming from you.

496
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,150
Actually,I've only ever
been to mexico one time.

497
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,570
And were all the women as
beautiful and voluptuous as you?

498
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,150
oh,wow. I don't even know
how to answer that. Um...

499
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,750
Uh,will you excuse me just one second?

500
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,760
Amanda...

501
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,050
this is gonna sound really weird,

502
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,650
but your friend is putting
your stuff in his bag.

503
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,440
Oh,no,that's just... joe.

504
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,620
He's kind of a klepto.
It's totally cool.

505
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,970
hey,are you into me or not? 'Cause if
you're not,I'm gonna answer this other ad.

506
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,930
- Okay,jerry,you're a little drunk.
- Did you just say "other ad"?

507
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,780
- Okay,get out of here.
- Did he just say "other ad"?

508
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,540
I do not know what
he was babbling about.

509
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,430
I think he probably a little
jealous that you are so into dean.

510
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,690
- Andy!
- Same thing

511
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,780
wait,th is your craigslist ad,right?

512
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,410
What? ! No,no!

513
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,740
"Hombres,are you into
plus-size chicas? "!

514
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,840
Amanda! You did this? !

515
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,660
Way to stick to the plan,guys.

516
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,870
okay,everybody calm down.

517
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,220
Why don't you come over here,

518
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,760
eat some more dip and we
can all just talk a little?

519
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,700
Look,guys,I'm sorry.

520
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,510
I don't know why she thought it was
a good idea to bring you all here,

521
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,140
but I can't do this,so bye.

522
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,860
Okay,this is what we're gonna do--
we're just gonna go to a couple bars,

523
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,970
- maybe see who's cruising the high line.
- Amanda,just give it up!

524
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,730
- wait,wait,wait,betty.
- she wasn't that big anyway.

525
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,560
mrs. Meade?

526
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,350
Betty,I need your help.

527
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,360
All right,marc. Tell me
what we are doing here.

528
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,290
Well,it turns out your dirty P. I.

529
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,230
Is of the
corrupt,b-grade,bridge-and-tunnel variety,

530
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,540
and somehow got himself married
off to a hoagie franchise heiress.

531
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,840
- He has hoagie
money? - Mm-hmm.

532
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
What's,uh,what's he blackmailing me for?

533
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,160
Well,princessunchmeat keeps
him on a very short leash,

534
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,110
so she wouldn't appreciate photos of her

535
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,450
keeping him on an even shorter leash.

536
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,830
Who the hell are y?

537
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,710
We're looking for castelar.

538
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,720
He's in there.

539
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,670
I'll take it from here.

540
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,560
She may want this.

541
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,870
Hey,natalie? Where's daniel?

542
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,220
I really need to talk to him.

543
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,600
uh,he should be back any minute,

544
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,110
but,uh,we're leaving
for a group meeting,

545
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,020
so I doubt he'll have time to talk.

546
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,180
Well,he'll have tmake time.

547
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,500
This is pretty important.

548
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,520
- So is this meeting.
- Daniel,hey.

549
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,090
Uh,look,um,I just got off
the phone with your mom.

550
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,540
I think you should talk
to her. She's really upset.

551
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,320
She called you. Of course. Look,uh...

552
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,320
I don't know why she's
trying to involve you,

553
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,460
but I'd really rather not
talk about it right now.

554
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,760
Daniel.

555
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,730
Your mother's really hurting. I
thinshe just wants you to hear her out.

556
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,570
No offense,but maybe we should just
let daniel work out his own problems.

557
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,660
Um,no offense,but maybe you should just butt
out and let daniel answer forimself,okay?

558
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,310
Betty,you're being incredibly rude.

559
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,010
Natalie's just trying to
help me. She's my friend.

560
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,900
Yeah,so are we.

561
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,560
Daniel,your mom needs you right now.

562
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,100
But,no. Instead you're listening
to your new friend natalie?

563
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,510
Is this like when I asked
you to go to the party

564
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,900
'cause I can't stand to
be there alone with matt,

565
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,230
and,no,you're taking
your new friend natalie?

566
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,690
Okay,stop it.

567
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,310
I don't know what's going on with you.

568
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,650
I don't need this drama in my life,okay?

569
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,580
that was really brave.

570
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,090
bite me,baby. Oh,yeah.

571
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,730
I hope you' enjoying this.

572
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,090
Oh,yeah,baby,yeah.

573
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,940
This is a different class of shoe
than you're used to,detective.

574
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,980
Smile!

575
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,780
hey! Who the hell are you?

576
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,480
*****

577
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,890
yes,I am. No. I mean,no,no,no,I'm not.

578
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,970
Oh,hell! Did my wife send you?

579
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,040
Aw. Oh,no.

580
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,260
marc,this is not the man
who's blackmailing me.

581
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,600
But this is detective castelar.

582
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,410
oh,damn it!

583
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,580
Of course he didn't use his real name.

584
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,000
He stole this man's identity 'cause
he knew I'd try something like this.

585
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,100
I should've seen it coming.

586
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,210
So who's blackmailing you?

587
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,780
been looking for you.

588
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,960
were so good with your
mother this morning.

589
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,990
I almost believed you
actually killed me.

590
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,460
Thank you. I know she has the
money,yet she still refused to pay you.

591
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,410
We've got to amp this up--
give her a reason to pay.

592
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,240
Jonathan,trust me.

593
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,540
I know just how to play her.

594
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,770
what do you want,amanda?

595
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,270
Betty,please don't hang up.

596
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,690
I feel so bad about what happened.

597
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,100
Yeah,so do I.

598
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,260
well,I just thought you'd have a
better chanceat a love connection

599
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,190
if we placed an adfor
your special needs.

600
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,560
Please don't be mad at me.

601
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,840
I'm not mad.

602
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,460
I know that inyour own
warped,potentiallylife-threatening w,

603
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,210
you're just tryingto be a good friend.

604
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,020
Yeah. Totally.

605
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,120
Hey,that guy andyleft his number
if you want togive him a call.

606
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,590
I'm not interested.

607
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,700
I decided I'm not going.

608
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,790
Really?

609
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,440
Mm-hmm. Look,I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

610
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,130
What do you mean,you're
not going to the party?

611
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,010
Hilda,it's fine.

612
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,730
It's not like anyone'sgonna
miss me anyway.

613
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,490
Daniel's off with hisnew
best friend natalie and...

614
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,760
and,and,and,what,betty?

615
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,580
And,yes,hilda,matt is stillgoing
with someone else,and it still sucks.

616
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,240
I can'tjust walk in there alone.

617
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
Yes,you can.

618
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,490
It's so julia roberts
from"my best friend's wedding.

619
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,090
" I love that for you.

620
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,680
Betty,why are youholding
on so hard to matt?

621
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,130
He has clearly moved on. Why don't you?

622
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,920
I don't know.

623
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,670
It's just,everything's changing so fast.

624
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,850
Things are weirdwith daniel at work,

625
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,720
and I just really thought
thatmatt and I could he a future.

626
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,970
I just wish one
thingcould stay the same.

627
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,560
Well,we're not going anywhere.

628
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,420
So can't that beenough
for you for a while?

629
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,440
No.

630
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,130
what am I doing?

631
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,830
I've worked too hardto let someone else

632
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,670
stop me from having
fun at this party--

633
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,510
- a party i was invited to.
- There you go!

634
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,600
So what if I'm alone?

635
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,900
Yeah,who cares?

636
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,060
I deserve this,and I'm going.

637
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,970
Oh... I forgot to get a dress.

638
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,050
Oh,I got it!

639
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,590

649
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,920

650
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,970
How barrassing. Champagne,count?

651
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,360
Ms. Slater?

652
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm onthe board of "style cares,"

653
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,590
and I just wanted totell
you how thrilled we are

654
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,700

Well,what can I say? I'm a giver.

656
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,340
I hope you realize how
manychildren you've helped.

657
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,260
yes. I'm all about the children.

658
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,200
Are you okay,willie?

659
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,920
No,I'm not okay,and it's all your fault.

660
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,810
You broughtthis
into my house--

661
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,000
this ridiculous spectacle!

662
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,410
And l these people
throwinginsane amounts of money

663
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,580
on childrenI don't even know!

664
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,160
And I can't evenafford
to save my own child.

665
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,580
Marc,what am I supposed to do?

666
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,540
I thought I could handle it,but I can'T.

667
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,000
Well,I can.

668
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,760
I'm turning myself in.

669
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,350
Oh,don't be ridiculous.

670
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,440
No daughter of mineis going to prison.

671
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,760
I'll have him killed.

672
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,650
Okay. okay.

673
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,000
You're not turning yourself in,

674
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
and you,you're not killinganyone.

675
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,680
What's with this family?

676
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,470
Mama,we have no choice.

677
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,310
If you can't pay,then I
needto do this to save us both.

678
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,760
ms. Slater? It's time for your speech.

679
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,160
of course.

680
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,520
Watch her.

681
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,160
betty! What areou doing here?

682
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,540
You said you weren't coming.

683
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,640
I changed my mind.

684
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,920
listen,betty,I have somethingreally
hard I need to tell you.

685
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,170
they're here.

686
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,110
- Hi.
- Hey there. Hi.

687
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,090
Yeah,my name is matt hartley.

688
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,680


690
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,620
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

691
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,400
wait. Wait,he's here with that girl?

692
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,390
How could heehere with that girl
when he's supposed tobe here with...

693
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,030
you?

694
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,460
It's fine. Amanda,don't--
don't look so sad.

695
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,210
It's-- it's not even as hard
asI thought it was gonna be,so...

696
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,040
really? 'Cause if I were
you,I'd be devastated.

697
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,400
anyway.

698
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,260
Uh,what was that really
hardthing you wanted to tell me?

699
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,700
Nothing. Just,um...

700
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,390
you look really pretty.

701
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,660
That's not hard. That's nice.

702
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,470
Well,it was hard for me.

703
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,660
are youstill angry with me?

704
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,020
I wasn't angry.

705
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,040
I'm justsensitive about...

706
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,370
our past.

707
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,170
Sometimes,I think I made mistake.

708
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,860
You were married,I was married.

709
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
It's sad,but...

710
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,250
that child hadno place in this world.

711
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:30,230
people always ask mehow I got
involved with an organization

712
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,090
that helpstibetan refugee children.

713
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,940
They usually say I'm in itfor
the tax break,which I am.

714
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,600
but the
real reason--

715
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,380
my heart goes out tothose
motherless children.

716
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,850
They have no oneto fight for
them,and that'swhat a mother does.

717
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,330
Shnever gives upon her child.

718
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,080
I will not rest untilI've
raised enough money

719
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,840
to help every one of those
kidsget wh they need to survive.

720
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,930
Because that'S...

721
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,630
that's what I would dofor my own child.

722
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,180
Thank you. Thank you.

723
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,470
Thank you.

724
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,980
hi.

725
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,990
Natalie,I believeI owe you an apology.

726
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,610
I'm very glad daniel has found
someone thathe can trust and rely on.

727
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,310
I hopewe can be friends.

728
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,980
I'd like that.

729
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,870
uh... um,uh,I should get this.

730
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,760
I'll let you two have a minute.

731
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,550
Thank you for saying that.

732
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,050
I'm sorry about the waywe
left things yesterday.

733
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,200
I didn't realize how
weirdit was gonna be for you

734
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,010
to watch someone take
over yourold job,butet it.

735
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,290
I do.

736
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:30,680
If it's any consolation,it's
pretty weird for me,too.

737
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,980
Right. Well...

738
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,820
I know thatyou're going through
somethingreally difficult,daniel.

739
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,310
I'm just glad that youdon't
have to do it alone.

740
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,960
Thanks.

741
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,380
Excuse me.

742
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,530
Of course. Here you go.

743
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,500
****

744
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,040
I told you,we had to do this work thing.

745
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,440
don't worry,I will get him back there.

746
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,620
here you go.

747
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,760
I'll take one,please.

748
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,790
Hey,amanda,you made it.

749
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,820
I'm glad you got in.

750
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,470
I was worried they mightcause
a ruckus at check-in

751
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,750
since I ended up with
sixplus ones on my list.

752
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,460
Oh. Oh,I didn't realize
youcould have multiple plus ones.

753
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,650
Yeah,I just didn'tthink it wasair that
none of the support staffgot invited.

754
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,150
I mean,you guys deserveto
have fun,too,right?

755
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,830
Right.

756
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,800
Is one of those for me?

757
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,920

758
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,250

<i>Outlook Adoption Agency</i>

761
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,950
I gave my son upfor
adoption many years ago.

762
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,530
I want to find him now.

763
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,710

- Oh,hello.

764
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,130

Yeahi-I promised heather
thatI would be right back,

766
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,330
but that was before I
realizedhow long the bar line was.

767
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,230
I like how you
twocoordinated your outfits.

768
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,590
Uh... yeah. That was her idea.

769
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,480
But you--

00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,170

that. Can I take that back?
