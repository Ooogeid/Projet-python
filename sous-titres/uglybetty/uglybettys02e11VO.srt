1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,090
Previously on "Ugly betty"... You have a secret husband?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,370
I haven't seen stuart for five years. I'm sick. 

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,180
What are we talking about here? $100,000 For an experimental treatment. 

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,330
I don't know what my father's talents are. 

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,960
I don't even know who he is. 

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,040
That's all the more reason to keep looking. 

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,700
There is a business to be run. Time to grow up. 

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,570
Guys, everyone is watching. 

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,790
We're not gonna choose a president

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,080
with a paintball war. I'm not letting you win this. 

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,170
Is this bradford meade's body?

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,840
If I can't marry into the meade family, 

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,430
I will give birth to an heir. 

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,210
You don't know it's me. 

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,580
www.Ragbear.com

16
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,220
and I heard you snickering. 

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,330
Very mature. 

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,730
Oh, and drop that off at human resources. 

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,650
Thank you. 

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,460
Oh, would you get out of my way, sticks?

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,510
I hate fashion week- divas, bitches!

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,300
<i>and, younow, everyone is on that new cheesecake-heroin diet. </i>

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,860
ooh. I could totally stay on half that diet. 

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,530
Is it just me

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,510
or are these models even skinnier this year?

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,950
Oh, size zero-zero is the new zero. Ugh. 

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,940
Do you know I spent this morning

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,220
fitting a spinal column with a tuft of hair?

29
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,180
Okay, here are daniel's v. I. P. Tickets

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,310
to luella, lacroix, chan and ronson. 

31
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,190
Right here. Get it?

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,520
I got it. Okay. 

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,140
Betty, here's the guest list for "mode. "

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,510
Daniel needs to star the people he wants on the front row. 

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,420
And can you make sure that they're - famous, pretty, skinny. Got it. 

36
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,620
There you are. Hey. Hey. 

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,230
I know I'm not gonna see you much this week, so here. 

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,390
It's got water, granola bars

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,610
and the evacuation routes for the "mode" show. Oh, and... 

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,100
That's gotta last you till friday. 

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,070
You'll wait for me?

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,690
<i>come back alive. That's all I ask. </i>

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,320
give 'em heck, betty. 

44
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,460
Oh, thank god. Thank you. 

45
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,110
Check it out- a peace offering fro

46
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,010
the dalton swivel task chair. 

47
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,910
It's like god is cradling my butt with his hands. 

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,140
Mm. Sounds comfy. 

49
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,680
Okay, here's the graphic for the runway show on friday. 

50
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,360
That's it, huh? Yep. It's okay. 

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,600
See, now that's the problem- it's just okay. 

52
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,910
This is gonna be the first fashion week on my own. 

53
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,620
Everyone's gonna be watching me, betty. Daniel, it'll be great. 

54
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,290
I watched the run-through last night, and it's not great. 

55
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,490
I hate to admit it, but wilhelmina always came up

56
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,580
with cool themes. 

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,450
You know,2004, it was "hollywood's golden era. "

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,450
The next year, it was"palace of versail

59
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,980
and the press, they ate it up. 

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,160
Well, we are under a tent. 

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,950
Oh, here's a theme- "cirque du soleil. "

62
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,860
Cirque du so lame. 

63
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,730
What about, um, an '80s thing? Big hair-

64
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,910
big snore. 

65
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,830
Okay, see, you're in that place, 

66
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,160
so let's brainstorm later. 

67
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,490
Right now I have to go give justin's class

68
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,630
a tour of the magazine. 

69
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,140
Right now? Remember?

70
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,130
I'm showing them how the publishing world works, 

71
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,630
molding young minds. I told you about this. Did I look like I stening when you were telling me?

72
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,450
Yes. You did. 

73
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,590
Wow. I'm getting pretty good at that. 

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,070
Great. 

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,920
Where the hell is it?

76
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,910
What bastard took it?

77
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,470
Oh, there you are. 

78
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,730
Oh, I love you, rocky road. 

79
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,970
My parents never let me have ice cream as a child. 

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,210
Well, it's good to see

81
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,740
the hormone shots aren't affecting you at all. 

82
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,590
I hate these shots. 

83
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,100
But I love pasta and sunflowers. 

84
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,610
Oh. Okay, let's focus. "Slater" magazine is dead, 

85
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,950
and this is our only chance you getting a piece

86
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,020
of the meade empire. 

87
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,960
You're right. I've beenhorm-otional. 

88
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,850
But the hardest part is almost finished. 

89
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,930
Exactly. Soon dr. Weiss will extract your eggs, 

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,510
<i>fertilize them with bradford's yeolde sperm, </i>

91
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,580
pop 'em back into your girlie place and then voil?

92
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,620
Okay, I never thought I'd say this to a woman before, 

93
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,800
but turn around and bend over. 

94
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,110
One, two, stick. 

95
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,980
Aah! Marc!

96
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,600
And 're done. 

97
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,780
Oh, marc, we're gonna be such good parents. 

98
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,390
Oh. 

99
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,750
Oh. 

100
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,680
Lindsay, just so you know, I interned here last summer. 

101
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,670
The lizard belt in september's issue-

102
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,420
all me. 

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,360
<i>oh, my god, you're almost cool. </i>

104
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,500
this is the conference room, 

105
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,870
where we have our weekly meetings. 

106
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,530
The editors meet to discuss

107
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,380
which articles go into the issue, 

108
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,570
after that, the freelancers submit their rough draft. 

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,680
Fun fact-50% of our writers are freelancers. 

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,920
<i>that's right, kids, anyone can be a writer. </i>

111
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,160
now line up, because I have a "mode" pencil

112
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,220
for each and every one of you. No pushing. 

113
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,810
Wow. Really?

114
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,140
Okay. Moving on... 

115
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,650
Let's go, kids. 

116
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,570
Betty, it's so rewarding to see

117
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,630
one of my former students succeed as a working writer. 

118
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,210
Oh, um, actually, I'm still just an assistant. 

119
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,390
Oh, well, you're all grown up

120
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,740
and living in the big city. 

121
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,360
She still lives at home in queens. 

122
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,540
Oh, well, your sense of style has certainly... 

123
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,420
Does anybody have any questions?

124
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,340
When you did the paris hilton shoot, 

125
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,040
was she, like, super skinny in real life?

126
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,110
Yeah, was she wearing extensions? I don't really get involved in that side of it. 

127
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,480
Any other questions... That aren't about celebrities?

128
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,570
Yes, hillary. 

129
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,530
Well, you did an article on the fur industry. 

130
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,010
Was there any backlash? Because, I mean, 

131
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,970
you advertise furs in your issues. 

132
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,140
Oh, I love that question. High five. 

133
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,580
Uh... 

134
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,160
Hillary! Oh, man. 

135
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,060
Whatever. Uh, um, never mind. It doesn't matter. 

136
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,930
No, no, it does. 

137
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,900
It-it raises a very interesting ethical issue. 

138
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,080
Let's go, kids. 

139
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,940
Are you trying to ruin hillary's life? What? Justin, she's the only one

140
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,710
who's listening to anything I'm saying. 

141
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,460
Yes, but lindsay is the leader. 

142
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,870
If she doesn't like what someone says, 

143
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,590
she makes their life hell. 

144
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,260
It's like "lord of the flies" in ballet flats. 

145
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,770
Guys, look, I know it looks very glamorous, 

146
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,270
but "mode" is about so much more

147
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,380
than just fashion. 

148
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,120
It is about journalism and telling stories

149
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,250
that reach out to people, 

150
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,170
not about what gisele is eating for lunch. 

151
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,390
Gisele eats lunch? What did she eat? I have no idea. 

152
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,380
Cucumber-wrapped sushi, sevejelly beans, 

153
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,470
sparkling water at room temp. "Mode" is awesome. 

154
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,700
<i>yeah, it makes you realize I totally need to go on a diet. </i>

155
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,990
who are you? What do you do? Do you have a boyfriend?

156
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,630
You're so gorgeous. Who does your hair?

157
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,760
I wanna be you. 

158
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,250
Doesn't she look so skinny? Yeah, I love your makeup. 

159
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,770
Oh. 

160
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,470
Oh, please be ewan mcgregor. 

161
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,550
Well, that's lovely, ewan, but I have had better. 

162
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,120
I hope you're talking about this morning. 

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stuart!

164
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,440
Easy, tiger. 

165
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,400
Why not? Only on of my organs is failed. 

166
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,140
Stop it. Don't joke. 

167
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,060
Do you not have a doctor's appointment today?

168
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,950
Yes, but I'm skipping it. 

169
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm-I'm tired of being prodded and poked. 

170
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,500
Stuart, you're sick. You can't deny it. 

171
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,750
You-you've got to go. 

172
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,590
I don't want to lose you. 

173
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,970
Christina, you know, that's a man, 

174
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,790
not a bottle of vodka. 

175
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,250
So introduce us. 

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm stuart, her husband. 

177
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh. You're married?

178
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,230
You don't work here anymore. I'm gonna go and call security. 

179
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,400
No, I'm here on business. 

180
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,540
Excuse me, mcstraighty, if you'll avert your eyes, 

181
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,990
I have a clandestine meeting in the secret sex room. I've been in there. 

182
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,920
Oh. 

183
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,710
<i>oh. </i>

184
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,700
ew. 

185
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,150
Hey, lady. 

186
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,780
Hey, tramp. 

187
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,220
Shall we have lunch?

188
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,640
Oh, are you playing "papa, can you hear me?" Again?

189
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,580
I'm just spending some quality time with my dads. 

190
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,470
Today I'm feeling particularly close

191
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,710
to jimmie "j. J. " Walker. Dy-no-mite. 

192
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,670
Oh, you're gonna find him, amanda. 

193
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,140
I don't know, ma. 

194
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,440
Today I got a call from the private investigator and-

195
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,080
dit-dit-dit-dit-dit. What do we like to call him?

196
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,440
Dick tracy. 

197
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,520
He came up with nothing. Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit. 

198
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,870
He was shooting blanks. Yeah. 

199
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,240
<i>you know, marc, not everything has a sexual inunendo. </i>

200
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,100
I come in here every single day, and I just stare at this wall. 

201
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,220
He's all I think about. You're right. 

202
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,750
As much as I like seeing my friends in a bad place-

203
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,340
you know, because it makes me feel superior... Mm-hmm. 

204
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
<i>this isn't fun anymore. </i>

205
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,030
m gonna help you. 

206
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,600
We're turning to a higher power. 

207
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,510
A psychic? She's amazing. 

208
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,980
My first time, she totally figured out I was gay. 

209
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,670
Yeah, so did the doctor who delivered you. 

210
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,430
Because I said so, 

211
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,880
and I carried you for nine months and ruined my body. 

212
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,990
How's that for an answer? I don't know why I can't-

213
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
so sorry. 

214
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,300
If you ever have children, don't give them your number. 

215
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,200
Wait. Wait. 

216
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,550
Wait... Wait. 

217
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,360
Not to worry, 

218
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,010
you won't ever be having chil-

219
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,280
oh, I'm sorry. Do you not want to hear the negatives?

220
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,560
Because I just kinda say what I see. 

221
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,780
Linda, this is my apparently barren friend, amanda, and-

222
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,620
oh, linda?

223
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,450
No, shouldn't it be, like, destiny? Ooh, or celestia?

224
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,090
Oh, you're one of those. 

225
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,480
Listen, I have a gym towel in my bag. 

226
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,720
I could make a turban. 

227
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,620
Marc, psychics go to the gym?

228
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,910
Focus. Listen, amanda has some questions about-

229
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,470
wait. Hold it. 

230
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,680
I'm geing something. 

231
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,570
I'm getting something. 

232
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,160
Shelley! Mom!

233
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,160
I said no boys in that house but-but-

234
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,830
get him out. 

235
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,580
She's good. 

236
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,600
So, um, do you think they got anything out of it?

237
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,090
I mean, I can't really tell. Betty, they're new york teenagers. 

238
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,270
If they could sorta read

239
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,680
and they don't kill me, I'm happy. 

240
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,470
All right. We're gonna take our lunches

241
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,550
down to the park. 

242
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,410
Come on. Let's go. 

243
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,400
Oh, my god. 

244
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,020
Look at them. 

245
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,640
<i>I am such a cow. </i>

246
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,460
skipping. 

247
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,820
Skipping. 

248
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,940
Skipping. 

249
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,320
Skipping. 

250
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,480
Don't hate me 'cause I'm a guy

251
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,590
and burn 26% more calories. 

252
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,710
Skipping. 

253
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,750
Daniel, I know you're busy. 

254
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,300
What's up, betty? Oh, just a little thing. 

255
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,820
We need to totally change this magazine. 

256
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:16,540
<Font color=#4096d1>-=????????L??=-

258
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,990
do you ever think about

259
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,890
how "mode" affects it\'s readers? Yeah. Women read it. They buy stuff. 

260
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,670
We make money. We buy stuff. It's circle of life, betty. 

261
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,580
Why do we showothing but starving women

262
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,290
in designer gowns?

263
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,000
It's what we do. Why is this suddenly a surprise?

264
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,910
It's not. I know exactly what this magazine is. 

265
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,330
But, daniel, you should have seen these young girls today. 

266
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,260
It-it was right there in front of me, 

267
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
<i>and-and I feel like I finally work</i>

268
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,840
in a place that can do something about it. 

269
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,200
What? Nothing. 

270
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,630
You just have your "let's change the world" face on. 

271
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,720
Well, I can't help it. 

272
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,420
Watching those girls today made me flash back

273
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,540
to when I s a kid at leslie levine's pool party. 

274
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,730
Every one of those girls had on their tiny little bikinis, 

275
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,290
and there I was, in my oversized new kids on the block t-shirt, 

276
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,820
eating chips inside with leslie's parents. 

277
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,420
<i>so you were that girl?</i>

278
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,500
look, I-I know we can't completely change "mode, "

279
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,450
but couldn't we at least show

280
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,520
a wider range of women?

281
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,680
How wide are we talking?

282
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,270
Normal, just not... Death-y. 

283
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,970
I took the liberty of having graphics put this together. 

284
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,560
<i>now here is average girl. </i>

285
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,610
fun-loving, great sense of humor, 

286
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,860
just trying to have it all in the big city, 

287
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,460
<i>and here is what average girl has to look at</i>

288
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,940
in her favorite fashion magazine. 

289
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,910
No, she's not being coy, her neck is just too thin

290
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,430
to hold up her enormous head. 

291
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,120
So average girl thinks, well, I can't relate to this. 

292
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,510
Should I lose 100 pounds so i, too, can be accepted? Okay, I get it. I get it. 

293
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,830
Wait, I'm not finished. If we continue at this rate, 

294
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,060
<i>this is what april's cover will look like. </i>

295
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,030
wh-what do you want me to do?

296
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,100
You need a theme for your show. 

297
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,190
This could be it- healthy models. 

298
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,790
They did it at the milan and the madrid shows. 

299
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,160
Exactly. They banned all girls with a body mass index below 18. 

300
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,900
And they got a hell of a lot of press for it. And you could even feature the models

301
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,830
in next month's issue. Daniel, you don't even know

302
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,270
what this will mean to these girls. 

303
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,270
Think of the publicity. And think of all the kids who will be reading the magazine. 

304
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,310
And we could get so much publicity. And we'd be helping all... 

305
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,230
You know what? It's a win-win. 

306
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,150
Okay. 

307
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,170
<i>I will go talk to alexis, </i>

308
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,420
and we're gonna have to contact the production staff, 

309
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,730
because we're gonna need new models. 

310
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,410
Oh, and I think we should probably do a new backdrop, too. 

311
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,200
Oh, and we gotta call catering, 

312
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,890
because we can actually have food this year. 

313
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,100
Thank you, daniel!

314
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,840
Suck that, leslie levine. 

315
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,680
I sense that you are looking for... 

316
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,830
Something. 

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,910
Okay. 

318
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,590
It's a person. 

319
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,100
It is a person. I'm getting chills. 

320
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,560
It is your... 

321
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,290
Unc-

322
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,510
bro-

323
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,350
si-

324
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,610
fa- father. 

325
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,530
It's your father. 

326
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,610
It is my father. Oh, my god. 

327
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,860
Who is he? Where is he?

328
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,790
I'm seeing... 

329
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,330
A dog. 

330
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,520
You're going to rescue a dog. 

331
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,220
I already rescued a dog-halston. 

332
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,900
He was my mother's. 

333
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,960
This is another dog. 

334
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,940
You are going to rescue... 

335
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,780
A black dog. 

336
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,630
Linda, forget the dog. 

337
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,900
I need to know about my father. 

338
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,710
Marc, she's not doing it. Make her do it. 

339
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,190
Oh. Oh, I don't know what I'm doing. 

340
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,220
I think she's in a trance. 

341
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,860
The dog is all that I see. Hmm. 

342
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,600
And, yes, you will eventually learn to walk again. 

343
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,650
Wh? What? What?

344
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,480
Well, at least you got good news. 

345
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,010
Okay, I want to hear what each magazine is up to. 

346
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,270
Let's go. 

347
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,600
Daniel, glad you could join us. 

348
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,240
I'm sorry. I thought you and I had a meeting today. 

349
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,750
Oh, we did, but I'm totally backed up, 

350
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,130
so I'm hearing pitches from all the editors

351
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,000
for the next issues at once. 

352
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,650
Have a seat. 

353
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,870
Okay. 

354
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,040
Oh, by the way, alexis, thanks for my new desk chair. 

355
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,690
It is awesome. Me, too. It's like sitting in a hug. 

356
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,780
Wait, you all got dalton swivel task chairs?

357
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,210
Just a token of appreciation as president

358
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,180
of a little thing I like to call

359
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,520
the global meade publishing empire. 

360
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,540
Now where were we? I just thought the stupid chair was a peace offering. 

361
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,600
Daniel, whatever you're mumbling, 

362
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,740
we're going left to right. 

363
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,910
"Player magazine, " what you got? We got hometown hotties, video game vixens

364
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,930
and ten pages on grilling. 

365
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,510
That's boobs, boobs and meat. 

366
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,490
Fantastic. 

367
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,720
"Cucina" magazine, make me hungry. 

368
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,910
Well, I hope you like beets - wait a second. 

369
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,950
I thought we were going left to right. 

370
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,940
Oh, daniel, I totally forgot you're down there. 

371
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,830
What's up for "mode"? Well, I think I found

372
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,680
a really great way to put us on the map

373
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,540
for both next month's issue and our fashion show. 

374
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,620
I think we should start using healthy models. 

375
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,770
Like milan and madrid? Exactly. 

376
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,410
No. Ouch. 

377
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,590
What do you mean, "no"? Daniel, the designers will never go for it. 

378
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,210
They want e attention on the clothes, not the models. Alexis, this is a great op-

379
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,270
not gonna happen. "Cucina, " let's talk beets. 

380
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,360
Well, I was thinking, 

381
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,070
<i>"beet your way into his heart. "</i>

382
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,980
I rsvp'd to the breast cancer benefit. 

383
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,660
Betsey johnson wants to have lunch. 

384
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,380
And your accountant called- hold on a second, marc. 

385
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,240
What is the holdup down there?

386
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,810
The last time I was in stirrups this long, 

387
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,950
I brought home a blue ribbon from palm beach equestrian. Almost finished, ms. Slater. 

388
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,620
We managed to extract the follicular fluid

389
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,330
that we'll send to the in vitro lab. 

390
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,740
Oh, hallelujah. But I have to warn you-

391
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,370
we'll be lucky to get one viable egg, very lucky. 

392
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,420
Please. 

393
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,100
I have plenty of viable eggs. 

394
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,150
Women over... 35 Have babies all the time. 

395
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,690
Yes, women that age do. 

396
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,570
Now who do you have in mind to carry?

397
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,490
Carry what? The embryo. 

398
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,910
We'll cryogenically preserve it

399
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,940
until you can line up a surrogate. 

400
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,360
I don't need a surrogate. 

401
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,460
I'm in extraordinary shape. 

402
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,200
Yes, um, how do I p... 

403
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,440
Medically speaking, you can't carry a child. 

404
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,560
All signs indicate that you have a hostile womb. 

405
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,140
Hostile womb?

406
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,810
Aren't they all?

407
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,940
Don't you ever do that to me again. 

408
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,210
First you make me pitch like I'm any other employee, 

409
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,460
then you knock it down?

410
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,300
Here we go. 

411
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,010
You're just mad because I said no to your idea. 

412
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,790
No, I'm mad because it's a good idea, 

413
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,430
and you said no because it's mine. Maybe. But that's the fun part of being boss. 

414
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,910
Look, the magazine is barely getting back on it\'s feet. 

415
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,790
Now is not the time to rock the boat. Are you pulling rank?

416
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,370
I guess I am. 

417
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,730
Well, maybe I'm not gonna accept that. 

418
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,540
I don't have to sit there anymore. 

419
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,590
Hostile womb. Me?

420
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,790
Hostile?

421
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,440
It practically has a welcome mat. 

422
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,590
Well, it hasn't had a welcome mat since the '90s. 

423
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,890
But I need to have this baby. 

424
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,420
Now where could I find someone

425
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,710
who's sturdy of frame and wide of hip?

426
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,340
Someone with a womb as accommodating

427
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,290
as the four seasons... 

428
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,200
Someone I can control... 

429
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,350
Brandy... 

430
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,590
Those names you're always telling stories about, 

431
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,790
are they your children or cats?

432
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,450
Oh, those are my kids- all five of them. 

433
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,830
Five kids? Five kids. 

434
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,990
Looks like you just found yourself

435
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,360
a 5-star womb. 

436
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,350
No, that's totally out of our budget. 

437
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,790
Well, then I guess I'm gonna have to go

438
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,470
<i>with the cheaper caterer that I have</i>

439
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,480
waiting for me line two. 

440
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,700
What? You know I don't have anyone on line two?

441
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,690
Okay, could you please just give us a cheaper rate?

442
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,670
Yes! Thank you. Thank you. 

443
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,810
Thank you. 

444
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,080
I love it when you play hardball. 

445
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,880
Well, I don't want to, but sometimes they make me. 

446
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,270
Great, betty. Thanks. 

447
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,750
Oh, I have good news. I pitched my idea to alexis. 

448
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,760
<i>I mean, our idea... Okay, your idea. </i>

449
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,350
man, you are playing hardball today. 

450
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,560
So... Did she go for it? Mm, not at first. 

451
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,690
I totally stared her down, though. 

452
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,250
Told her I wasn't going anywhere. 

453
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,310
I don't mean to brag, but itid get into

454
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,580
a little bit of a pissing contest, 

455
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,430
and I think we both know who has better aim these days. 

456
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,550
M- me, betty. I have the penis. 

457
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh. I'm uncomfortable now... 

458
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,150
But I'm happy. 

459
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,290
Very happy. 

460
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,430
<i>I can't believe this. I love fashion week. </i>

461
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,260
oh, my god. 

462
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,560
Lil' bow wow. I love you. 

463
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,030
Dropped the "lil', " but-but thanks, sugar. 

464
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,870
Yeah, you're reallbig. 

465
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,170
I mean, you're... You're a man now. 

466
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,080
Nothing little about you, I bet. 

467
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,720
I mean, I'm- I'm guessing. I-

468
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,920
why does everything I say sound so dirty?

469
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,460
Um, can't come clean till you get a little dirty, right?

470
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,470
I don't even know what that means. 

471
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,740
Look, this is not good, all right?

472
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,750
Don't worry, mr. Wow. Someone will come right away. 

473
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,570
Help!

474
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,160
Um, hell

475
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,590
is someone gonna do something about that alarm?

476
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,620
It's been on for, like,15 minutes. 

477
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,960
So annoying. 

478
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,440
* I know you tired of these lames *

479
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,590
* but, girl, they ain't the same *

480
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,240
* you need a real guy like boweezie in your life *

481
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,520
* the type of dude that'll splurge *

482
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,000
* and get you ything you like *

483
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,620
* get your hair done, nails fixed, boo, you got that *

484
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,770
* bills late, don't stress, get 'em paid like that *

485
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,820
that is so good! Appreciate it. 

486
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,690
That's actually off my brand-new album, so... 

487
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,090
I think we're getting rescued. 

488
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,830
Hey-hey, you know what? Um, I was thinking, 

489
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,410
you know, if, uh, we was here a little bit longer... 

490
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,690
I like 'em freaky like you, girl. 

491
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,230
Oh, I have a boyfriend. 

492
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,240
Oh. 

493
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,390
Are you happy? I saved the day again. 

494
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,700
Hey, you're bow wow. 

495
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,900
Uh... 

496
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,750
Uh, look, uh, thanks for the ride, b. 

497
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,520
Appreciate it. 

498
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,480
What's up? What's up?

499
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,440
Mm-hmm. 

500
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,380
Oh, my god. Bow wow. 

501
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,960
Bow wow. 

502
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,880
I just rescued a dog. 

503
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,140
Linda, if you can hear me... 

504
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,000
I believe. 

505
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,740
Christina, do you have a minute?

506
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,960
Henry, it's fashion week. 

507
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,320
Unless you need to be hemmed, stitched or draped, 

508
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,490
I have got no time for you. 

509
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,410
Right. Um, actually, it's about your insurance. 

510
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,670
The paperwork came through accounting. 

511
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,310
We've been working with h. R. On some cost-cutting-

512
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,430
too many words. Oh. Right. Sorry. 

513
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,710
Um, well, I just thought that I should tell you myself. 

514
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,600
They won't cover your husband for experimental procedures. 

515
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,840
Oh. 

516
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,450
Uh, well, I-I figured it wasn't gonna be that easy, 

517
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,100
but i, uh... Well, I thought I would give it a try. 

518
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,910
I'm sorry, christina. Yeah. 

519
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,470
Ow. 

520
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,560
What the hell are you doing in here?

521
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm shopping. Cliff and I have a big date tonight, 

522
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,390
and I was looking for some pants with butt cleavage. 

523
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,860
Oh... Take whatever you want. 

524
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,140
Oh. Sure. 

525
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,840
Oh. 

526
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,490
Oh, this is probably about your sick husband, huh?

527
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,310
There, there. 

528
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,730
Is there anything I can do?

529
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,390
Not unless you've got $100,000 in your pocket. 

530
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,340
Nope. All me. 

531
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,470
Thank you all for coming

532
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,540
for the official model weigh-in

533
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,410
for the ten designers to watch show. 

534
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,290
This is the first of many positive cnges

535
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,920
I'll be making at "mode. "

536
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,950
Changes which nor women of all shapes and sizes. 

537
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,960
Now I would like to turn it over

538
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,720
to alexis meade, my sister. And president of meade publications. 

539
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,600
Uh, we're very excited for these changes... Justin, I want you to go back to your school

540
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,950
and tell that little girl clique

541
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,050
that "mode" is using healthy models this year. Please don't make me do it. 

542
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,620
I'm this close to being their first boy. Wait, these are not the models that I booked. 

543
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,090
Here they are... They're so skinny. 

544
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,970
The fresh, new, robust faces of fashion. 

545
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,090
Elke, if you could step up here, please. 

546
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,290
A healthy 120 pounds. 

547
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,890
What? There's no way she weighs 120 pounds. 

548
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,150
I've eaten hamburgers that look heaviethan her. Yeah, she's, like,102. 

549
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,170
How'd you know that? That's my gift - that and accessorizing. 

550
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,290
118 Pounds. 

551
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,380
98. 

552
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,840
123 Pounds. 

553
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,090
103. She must have eaten breakfast. 

554
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,310
Over here, folks. We'll get a shot

555
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,250
of elke, the girls and me eating cupcakes. 

556
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,980
Justin, get on that scale. 

557
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,380
No! I ate breakfast, too. 

558
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,470
Justin, do it. 

559
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,980
This just added 20 pounds to my real weight. 

560
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,580
What?

561
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,320
Oh, god, me, too, 

562
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,220
and that's not a number I need to see. 

563
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,530
Great. I can't even believe this. 

564
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,280
Alexis rigged the scales to get publicity. 

565
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,060
What do you mean, your prices went up?

566
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,250
I just saw you. 

567
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,480
Hey, I called the dog thing, didn't I?

568
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,770
It's worth an extra $20. Give me your hands. 

569
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,260
I know where they've been. 

570
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,530
Yeah. 

571
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,700
Something's coming. 

572
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,460
It's your father... 

573
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,330
And the letter "b. "

574
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,890
Uh, benjamin, barry, borris, barbara. 

575
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,700
And I see a kiss. Um, um, bloom. 

576
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,420
Orlando bloom. I get to kiss orlando bloom. 

577
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,270
You know what? What?

578
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,060
You make my head muddy. 

579
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,090
Now listen. It's all about this "b. "

580
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,720
Just follow the "b. " The "b" will lead you to a kiss. 

581
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,310
The kiss will take you to your father. 

582
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,830
I don't know how much clearer I could be. 

583
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,530
Daniel, I don't know where you are, 

584
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,750
but you need to call me back. 

585
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,530
<i>you are not going to believe what alexis did. </i>

586
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,770
what did alexis do?

587
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,390
Um... 

588
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,270
Look, I-I know you're my boss and... 

589
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,170
Actually, my boss' boss, 

590
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,420
or the president of my boss, 

591
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,120
which would indirectly make you my president. 

592
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,300
I have a press conference to get back to. 

593
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
I know about the models. 

594
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,360
You're lying about their weight. 

595
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,680
I thought the whole point of this was to make

596
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,440
a positive change. The whole point of this is to sell clothes and get publicity. 

597
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,170
But this is even worse. Now we're sending out the message

598
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,990
that these emaciated models are actually healthy?

599
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,830
No one cares about the models. 

600
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,920
They're nothing more than hangers. 

601
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,690
And designers don't want to show

602
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,630
their clothes on fat hangers. 

603
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,890
You know, we're not that different. 

604
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,420
Really?

605
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,210
We both grew up not liking what we saw in the mirror. 

606
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,780
I thought that out of everyone, you might understand. 

607
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,920
I know your brother gets it. 

608
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,490
My brother... 

609
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,230
You know what?

610
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,550
I'm sick and tired of being the villain around here. 

611
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,190
<i>let me tell you something about your hero daniel. </i>

612
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,500
<i>fixing the scales was his idea. </i>

613
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,700
a "b. " Concentrate. Who's a "b"?

614
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,510
Hey, betty. 

615
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,790
Amanda, have you seen daniel?

616
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,380
Ugh, quiet, halston. I'm sorry. He's a little bit racist. 

617
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,400
I hate that about him, but it is who he is. 

618
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,520
Okay, offensive. 

619
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,550
He picked up his messages. He must be back. 

620
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,190
Betty, wait. You're my "b. "

621
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,830
I don't even know what insult that is, 

622
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,240
but I don't have time. I need to find daniel. 

623
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,400
Now, brandy, you can pick any of these... 

624
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,980
Oh, except for the russian sable. 

625
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,970
I shot that one myself. 

626
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,750
Ooh, I was in such a mood that day. 

627
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,820
Miss slater, this is all so much. 

628
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,340
I just don't know. 

629
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,490
Well, all your expenses will be paid, 

630
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,350
and you'll have the best of care. 

631
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,090
Oh, it's not about that. 

632
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,680
We're talking about bringing another life into the world. 

633
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,730
Well, since I lost my fnc?

634
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,590
I've been so alone. 

635
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,650
And I... I have so much love to give. 

636
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,850
I think I need to do this for you, miss slater. 

637
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,450
Oh, uh, call me wilhelmina... 

638
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,230
While you're pregnant. 

639
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,780
Oh, daniel, 

640
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,000
will you help me out with this?

641
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
It's a danish, betty. 

642
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,080
I know, but I weighed it

643
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,230
on that scale in the conference room. 

644
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,420
Turns out it's 20 pounds. 

645
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,790
I'm glad I didn't get e one with the cheese. 

646
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,450
Oh, boy. 

647
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,770
I'm not leaving. 

648
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,630
Alexis wasn't gonna change the show. 

649
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,160
This was the compromise. 

650
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,690
Compromise?

651
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,590
You lied to get media attention. 

652
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,470
Daniel, why didn't you just tell me the truth?

653
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,570
'Cause the truth was alexis cut me off at the knees, 

654
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,460
and I didn't know how to come down here

655
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,170
and tell you I was powerless. 

656
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,380
Did you care about this at all beyond the publicity?

657
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,520
It's okay, daniel. I get it. 

658
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,650
I don't know. I just... 

659
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,960
I thought that maybe it could be different

660
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,870
for these girls. 

661
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,950
I guess I was wrong. 

662
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,040
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. 

663
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,640
"The 400 blows. " "Bring it on. "

664
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,460
Um, let's keep looking. 

665
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,580
Ooh, ooh, ooh, "the sorrow and the pity. "

666
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,950
"Bring it on 2- bring it on again. "

667
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,810
Okay, maybe we should just get ice cream. You know, we could find something

668
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,900
we both want to watch if we just... 

669
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,150
Go in the little room behind the curtain. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going in there. 

670
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,450
The last time, we ran into my dentist, 

671
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,350
and-and he puts his hands in my mouth. Oh, grow up. 

672
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,160
We're two healthy american men in a relationship. 

673
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,120
They can keep us from getting married, 

674
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,860
but they can't keep us from going in a little dark room

675
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,980
behind the curtain. Come on. 

676
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,510
Wow. They have "the 400 blows" in here, too. 

677
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,780
Ew. That's not truffaut. Ew. 

678
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,750
Straight. Straight. Straight... 

679
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,320
Military, military... 

680
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,360
Military... 

681
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,550
Shaved, shaved, shaved... 

682
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,470
Manicurist?

683
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,170
There's- there's manicurist porn?

684
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,530
No. That woman with the whip, 

685
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,820
that's wilhelmina's surrogate. 

686
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,050
Uh, good news- if she can do that

687
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,100
with a ping-pong ball, 

688
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,120
it'll make for an easy delivery. 

689
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,460
Ew. Ew. 

690
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,740
<i>I'm with you, mija. </i>

691
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,510
those models are too skinny. 

692
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,840
That's why I stay away from that world. 

693
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,140
I still get offers. 

694
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,970
Hilda... 

695
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,820
The garbage man yelling out "nice rack, "

696
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,410
is not a modeling offer. I don't know. 

697
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,280
I just... 

698
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,350
I thought that daniel would have gotten it. 

699
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,370
In my day, women were proud to show a little... 

700
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,420
<i>trastos en su tronco. </i>

701
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,820
junk in their trunk. 

702
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,330
Yeah, I get it, 

703
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,920
but no one wants to hear their dad say it. 

704
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
Daniel, what are you doing here?

705
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,160
Delivering invitations. 

706
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,230
"Fashion gets real-

707
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,070
"'mode' magazine's alternative fashion show, 

708
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,380
hosted by daniel meade and betty suarez"! It was your idea. 

709
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,620
<i>what? We're putting on a show? With the kind of women we want to use. </i>

710
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,810
and I brought, um, justin and his friends some. 

711
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,240
I thought you'd want them there, too. 

712
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,000
Ooh. 

713
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,980
Wait. 

714
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,350
Is this really about the girls?

715
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,550
Or is it about the publicity?

716
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,560
Or is it about getting back at alexis?

717
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,440
Little bit of everything, 

718
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,860
but mostly, it's for you. 

719
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,560
I kinda remembered being one of those guys

720
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,570
who made fun of the girls

721
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,370
in the big t-shirts at the pool parties. 

722
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,970
<i>oh. You were that guy. </i>

723
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,660
not anymore. 

724
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,630
Now come on. 

725
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,340
Let's go put on a big, fat fashion show. 

726
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,260
I'm sorry. That didn't come out-

727
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,790
I get it. 

728
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,450
Okay, everyone, remember, now this is a renegade show. 

729
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,650
We're not officially sanctioned. 

730
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,330
If anyone asks you what you're doing, you know nothing. 

731
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,600
Oh, can we have code names? I want to be princess daisy. Oh, I'm dragon. No, no, eagle. 

732
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,410
No, dragon-black dragon. 

733
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,090
Guys! Guys, do whatever you want. 

734
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,690
It's fine, as long as it's not falcon. That's mine. 

735
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,680
Now the official "mode" show starts at 2:00, 

736
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,110
so we have to be ready to take over the lights and the music... 

737
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,090
Hilda's taking care of the hair, and christina actually found

738
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,390
some amazing new fashion designers. Great. 

739
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,700
Which brings us to the models. Let's hit the streets. 

740
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,750
<i>I want- I want real women here-</i>

741
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,300
tall, short, young and old- none of those hot, skinny girls. 

742
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,180
You're kind of on your own with that. 

743
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,600
I don't really know where to start. 

744
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,590
Now come on, everyone. Let's do this. 

745
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:29,960
Okay, betty, please. 

746
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,460
I just need, like, two minutes. 

747
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,490
I will give you all of your messages

748
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,970
for the next week. 

749
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,740
So a psychic told me that a "b" would lead me

750
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,360
to a kiss that would lead me to my father. 

751
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,650
I think that you are my "b. "

752
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,190
So what, are you gonna kiss me?

753
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,930
Like you've never thought about it. 

754
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,040
Amanda, I don't know anything about your father or psychics. 

755
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,820
It's magic, and, like science, 

756
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,220
you don't actually have to understand it. 

757
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,480
You just have to believe it. 

758
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,900
Look, I know we haven't always been close. You made a pi?ata of me for your birthday. 

759
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,970
Exactly. You matter to me, betty gonzales. 

760
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,990
????

761
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,110
I've listened. 

762
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,110
I was so sad to hear that you lost your father... Mother. 

763
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,630
In that boating accident... Cancer. 

764
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,300
Just last year. Six years ago. 

765
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,260
Amanda, I gotta go. 

766
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,360
Wait. Your mother died?

767
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,840
Yeah. 

768
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,240
How did you ever get over that?

769
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,480
Um... 

770
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,920
I didn't. 

771
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,060
I haven't. 

772
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,300
I mean, you'd think after six years, 

773
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:36,960
it gets easier, 

774
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,730
but I still think about her every day. 

775
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,200
That's really sad. 

776
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,730
Yeah. 

777
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,230
But at least we had my father. 

778
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,700
You know, he really stepped up. 

779
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,680
You're so lucky that you have him. 

780
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,300
Look, amanda, I'm sorry. 

781
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,180
I really wish I could help you find your father. 

782
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,550
Yeah. 

783
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,180
So... 

784
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,930
It was... Weird talking to you. 

785
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,270
Yeah. You, too. 

786
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,400
Oh, look. 

787
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,620
One of your photos fell. 

788
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,200
Gene simmons... 

789
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,160
Of kiss. 

790
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,380
The "b" gave me a kiss. 

791
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,340
Gene simmons is my father. 

792
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,510
I'm very disappointed in you, brandy. 

793
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,270
There's only room for one dominatrix

794
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,630
in this relationship. 

795
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,080
I do submissive, too. 

796
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,690
I don't think so. 

797
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,730
Well, obviously we didn't do our homework

798
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,850
with our little, uh, mommy-natrix. 

799
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,110
This is a disaster. 

800
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:18,820
Tell me about it. 

801
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,750
I had to watch "the 400 blows" last night, 

802
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,280
and not the good one- off topic. 

803
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,510
Obviously we need to find a surrogate we can control, 

804
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,060
someone we can watch over day and night, 

805
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,900
someone who is desperate for money. 

806
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,690
Get ready to kiss me. 

807
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,670
<i>christina mckinney, last year you were one of "mode's"</i>

808
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,240
<i>top ten designers to watch... Her husband's sick, </i>

809
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,630
her insurance doesn't cover him, 

810
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,820
<i>and she's desperate for 100 grand. </i>

811
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,260
<i>as the show wraps up, what are your thoughts?</i>

812
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,000
<i>uh, stick around. Um, we're not done yet. </i>

813
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,530
<i>there might be a few surprises in store. </i>

814
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,290
that is one scotch on the rocks. 

815
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,090
This is suzuki st. Pierre, 

816
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,840
live at the "mode" show. 

817
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,150
Kudos to alexis meade

818
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,830
for promising us non-orexic models this year. 

819
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,530
Ku - don'ts for not delivering. 

820
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,910
Okay, justin and his friends just got here. 

821
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,740
Oh, good. Thanks. 

822
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,110
Princess daisy, do you read? Come in, princess daisy. 

823
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,810
I read you, black dragon. 

824
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,020
We're good to go. 

825
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,960
Don't let anyone out of the space. Copy that. 

826
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,860
Hey, I like working together. 

827
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,780
Maybe after the show, the princess can come over

828
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,650
to my place, and the dragon can-

829
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,880
guys, we're all on this line. 

830
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:37,350
Oh, um, uh, sorry. Co- uh, copy. Roger. Over. Out. 

831
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,990
Ladies and gentlemen, how about a big hand

832
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
for our fabulous "mode" fashion show, 

833
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,780
featuring our top ten designers to watch. 

834
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,720
It's not over yet. I'm sure you've heard by now, 

835
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,720
we're doing something a little different this year. 

836
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,950
Well, here it is. 

837
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,280
Welcome to "mode's" alternative runway show. 

838
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,080
????

839
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,250
'S for schoolteacher in great neck... Turn on the camera. Interest piqued. 

840
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,540
<i>the cashier from d'agostino's- real women with real bodies. </i>

841
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,250
<i>see, beauty truly is one size that does fit all. </i>

842
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,150
yeah, so you can go ahead and dedicate this

843
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,540
to all the sexy and hot big women out there, 

844
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,220

889
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,550
well, of course, it was always my idea

890
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,650
to bring the healthy models out

891
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,700
w. Ter in the sho

892
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,630
"save your best for last, " that's what I always say. 

893
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,390
So what did you think? Those women were gross. 

894
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,810
Totally fat and disgusting. 

895
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,850
<i>we're gonna go find a realowfashion sh, </i>

896
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,380
<i>with, like, skinny models. </i>

897
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,000
yeah, they were totally fat and disgusting. 

898
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,150
Let's go, you guys. 

899
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,960
Go on. 

900
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,680
Betty, the press is saying this is our best show ever. 

901
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,390
Of course, alexis is taking all the credit, 

902
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,560
but you know what? I don't care. 

903
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,260
That's right. I'm growing. 

904
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,830
That's great. Daniel, I'm happy for you. 

905
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,420
Hey, what's the matter?

906
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,300
Nothing. It's just... 

907
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,310
Quick. We have 30 seconds

908
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,350
before lindsay notices we're gone. 

909
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,890
I thought your real girl show... 

910
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,020
Didn't totally suck. 

911
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,040
Really?

912
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,210
Yeah. 

913
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,150
So who picks all the clothes?

914
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,370
That seems like a cool job. Oh, that's the fashion editor. 

915
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,610
Listen, if you ever want to talk about - lindsay's looking. She'll call you. Bye, daniel. 

916
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,970
Bye. Uh, stay in school. Don't do drugs. 

917
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,380
What was that? Um, I'm not really sure

918
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,540
what message we're going for here. 

919
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm just trying to be supportive. 

920
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:28,500
We did good, though, didn't we? Yes, we did, and I just want to say, 

921
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,710
on behalf of all the girls who wear oversized t-shirts

922
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,810
to pool parties... 

923
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,870
Thank you, daniel. 

924
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,890
It was my pleasure. 

925
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,160
Oh. 

926
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,430
So I was thinking, 

927
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,990
all the models in our magazine, 

928
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,180
they're, like, under 20. 

929
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,810
<i>would it be so terrible if we had a woman</i>

930
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,020
who was, say... I don't know,35?

931
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,360
You just don't give up, do you?
