00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,925
<i>Previously on "ugly betty"...
gene simmons is my father.</i>

2
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:05,488
Daddy?
Daughter?

3
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:08,626
I'm going to start a magazine-
"Hot flash."

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,863
If i can't marry
into the meade family,

5
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:12,974
I will give birth
to an heir.

6
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,363
We need to find
a surrogate we can control.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,197
Do we feel pregnant yet? How
long am i trapped here for?

8
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:21,030
I'm renee.
I'm daniel.

9
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:22,996
Meade. I know.

10
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:24,996
I see you've met
my sister.

11
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:28,497
You think it's too early to start planning
family vacations? You're a fool, daniel.

12
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:30,729
You have no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

13
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:33,430
You just really seemed to up
your game when betty showed up.

14
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:35,896
What? I don't think i'm
the suarez sister you like.

15
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:38,297
Tell me who you're dating.
Henry from accounting. There.

16
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:40,297
More.
He got charlie pregnant.

17
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:41,925
I know you're leaving
in five months,

18
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:44,394
And i know that
i'm gonna get my heart broken,

19
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:45,816
But maybe it's worth it.

There she is...
good morning.

33
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,729
The birthday girl.

34
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:29,863
<i>Feliz cumpleaños, mi amor.</i>

35
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,925
<i>Thank you, papi.</i>

36
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:35,130
<i>Happy birthday, chica.
Oh, i got something for you.</i>

37
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,175
What? You want 23 more?

38
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:41,896
<i>Love the bag, aunt betty.
Vuitton?</i>

39
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:43,613
No, it's a fake.
I got it from some guy

40
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:46,878
Selling off a blanket on 6th avenue.
You know, you make it really hard for me

41
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,163
To live vicariously through you. So i know
you didn't want anything special this year,

42
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,630
But maybe before you head off
for the poconos,

43
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:55,597
Some birthday pancakes?

44
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:57,564
<i>Daddy, i love
your birthday breakfasts,</i>

45
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,050
But henry and i want
to get an early start.

46
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,729
Well, i hope you and henry
have a wonderful weekend. Mm.

47
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:06,397
And, uh, don't forget
your cupcakes. Oh, i won't.

48
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:10,128
It was nice of daniel to give you the
day off. I know. He was great about it,

49
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:11,363
Except he says
now i owe him one.

50
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,675
Someone has a short memory.

51
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:15,397
<i>Okay, i know you told us
not to, but...</i>

52
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,430
Aah! A cell phone!

53
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:21,896
Justin, this is-

54
00:03:21,963 --> 00:03:23,896
<i>Wait,
is this my cell phone?</i>

55
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,487
Turn it over.

56
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:30,564
Aah! I love it.

57
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,597
Fierce, huh?

58
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:34,330
Very.
Don't do that.

59
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,796
No?
No.

60
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,297
No.
No.

61
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:40,230
Okay. Uh, guys, i love you.
I'll see you sunday night.

62
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:42,729
I'm so excited.
Love you.

63
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:43,940
Love you, too.

64
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,829
Aw, they are gonna have
such a good time this weekend.

65
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,796
<i>Papi, what's wrong?</i>

66
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,930
She forgot the cupcakes.

67
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:56,706
Just a minute.

68
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,863
Did you shave your arms?
They look bigger.

69
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:05,963
Daniel, i know
we've had our issues...

70
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,963
You tried to ruin
my magazine, destroy my family,

71
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,930
Marry my father on his deathbed
- Some bigger than others,

72
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:14,063
But i never personally
wish you any harm.

73
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,430
That's why i'm here
to warn you about renee.

74
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:18,430
Renee has
a history with men.

75
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:21,530
She becomeneedy,
erratic, obsessive.

76
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:24,397
It probably has something to do
with daddy withholding affection

77
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,263
While we were growing up.

78
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,729
I mean, i've dealt with it well,
but renee on the other hand-

79
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:31,197
Stop. You don't
have to say anymore.

80
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:32,972
I don't believe anything
you have to say.

81
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:37,597
Stony brook.

82
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,050
What?

83
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,397
Ask my sister
about stony brook

84
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:46,363
If you really want
to get to know her.

85
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:53,030
How was i? Excellent.
Sincere, but not condescending,

86
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,030
Just the right dash
of menace

87
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:57,030
And your breasts,
of course, look amazing.

88
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,729
You've gotten under
his pasty, hairless skin, woman.

89
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:01,696
Well, i better.
Renee's a loose cannon.

90
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,729
I can't have that,
not with what i have planned.

91
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:09,096
Oh, god,
this bloody window.

92
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:12,397
Oh, is a nice breeze
too much to ask for?

93
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:14,996
I bet my sister
had it bolted shut.

94
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,297
Evil robots
don't need oxygen.

95
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:18,425
Oh.
Let me help you.

96
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:21,263
Oh, go on, please. Ohh.

97
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,763
Ooh. This should freshen
things up a wee bit.

98
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,497
<i>No candles... ever.</i>

99
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,237
Okay.

100
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,096
Christina, okay, wait.

101
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,550
Repeat, please,

102
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,564
And try to enunciate.

103
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,497
I'm sayin' there's something
goin' on with her,

104
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:49,597
And i am going to
find out what it is.

105
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:50,425
With who?

106
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,863
Wilhelmi's sister-Renee.

107
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,397
<i>She's strange.</i>

108
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:56,530
Like, just now.
Like, listen,

109
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,362
I tried to light
a candle...

110
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:01,238
And she totally freaked
out. What? A-A candy?

111
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:02,999
What type of candy?
Why were you lighting it?

112
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,430
A candle.

113
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:08,930
I can't hear you. Justin
bedazzled my cell phone...

114
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:11,896
And i think there's glue
in the circuitry.

115
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:15,030
I know.
It's a mystery...

116
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:18,863
But i'm gonna find out.
Okay, i'll talk to you later.

117
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,297
* happy birthday to me *

118
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,030
Henry!

119
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,230
* birthday girl in the house *

120
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:32,197
I'm ready to get in the car,
go on our adventure!

121
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:35,330
I love adventures.
Where are we going?

122
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,030
Charlie.

123
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:54,987
Charlie. I-I didn't even know
you were in town.

124
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:56,550
Well, you know, i've been
trying for months to get

125
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,691
Into this parenting seminar
with harvey karp.

126
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,766
<i>He's, like,
this amazing baby doctor.</i>

127
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,424
He's, like, a baby guru genius. Betty.

128
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,616
Anyway, so i get
a phone call yesterday,

129
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:09,262
And they have an opening in a seminar
this weekend, so... this weekend?

130
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,759
C- Can you
just give us a minute?

131
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:15,333
Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah, of course. Sure.

132
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:18,753
Baby kicked.
Baby kicked.

133
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:21,404
<i>He's so excited
to see his daddy.</i>

134
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:26,738
Betty, listen,
she just showed up.

135
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,738
I already told her she can go
to that seminar without me.

136
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:33,105
We can still go away.
No, no, no, henry.

137
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:35,071
What-What are you
supposed to do?

138
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,571
It's for the baby.

139
00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:37,925
But it's
your birthday weekend.

140
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,879
I know. I know, but-But maybe
we don't have to go away.

141
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,999
We could just celebrate
here in new york.

142
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:45,999
It's new york.

143
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,538
There's restaurants
and nightclubs,

144
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:52,038
And i will organize the ultimate
birthday extravaganza,

145
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,005
To which you are invited.

146
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,371
Betty, you're unbelievable.

147
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:59,838
Only when i'm with you.

148
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:05,504
Henry,
i can't find the toothpaste.

149
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:08,038
Top left drawer!

150
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:09,316
I'll see you tonight.

151
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:11,394
Okay.

152
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,112
Alexis,

153
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:19,300
I got the numbers you sent me
on mom's magazine.

154
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,504
<i>Good. 'Cause
we really need to talk.</i>

155
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,738
Oh, my god.
What are you doing?

156
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,144
Trying on the new domingo line.
Oh, get over it.

157
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,999
When we were kids,
we used to bathe together.

158
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,050
Yeah? Well, when we were kids,
you were a boy.

159
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,984
So did you look
at mom's budget?

160
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,451
Yeah, i did. I think
she's finally lost it.

161
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:37,800
This was supposed to be
a hobby to make her feel better,

162
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,950
Not a real magazine.
And check this out-

163
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:42,441
She wants to do
an ongoing series

164
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:44,878
About extreme adventure
for the over-50 set.

165
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:46,551
It only adds
$50,000 an issue.

166
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:49,317
You gotta talk to her. No.
You wanted to be in charge.

167
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:51,284
This is your problem.

168
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,534
Oh, amanda, hey.
So look, i know i'm not

Oh, right, 'cause you're turning 40? 24.

I need to plan

179
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,737
And i figured,

180
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:21,817
Where is the most romantic place
to have dinner in new york?

181
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:24,950
Oh, my god. Right now
the pemberly inn is so hot.

182
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:27,384
If i could sit
on the patio at sunset,

183
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,484

184
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,984

Good morning, daniel.

189
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:45,717
I bet you're surprised
to see me.

190
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:48,441
Uh, should i be?

191
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,925
Right. You weren't supposed
to come in today.

192
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:54,084
Look, i'm sorry.
I've had a weird morning.

193
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,783
Uh, glad
you're feeling better.

194
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,441
I'm not sick.

195
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:01,783
It's sort of
a special day today.

196
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,783
Oh, my god. Oh, of course.
I almost forgot. It's okay.

197
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,584
Renee's coming for lunch.

198
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,650
Could you make sure and order us
something really special?

199
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:12,550
Um, okay. All right.

200
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,941

Not really up your alley.

207
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:35,451
I'll just get rid of these. No,
no, wait. Concert with fireworks...

208
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:39,237
I mean, that sounds kinda- Dangerous,
i know. I- I'm glad you're not going.

209
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:42,518
No, no, hang on.
Maybe renee and i could...

210
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,128
You know what? Forget it.

211
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:47,315
I really don't want
to get grass stains

212
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:48,690
On these pants anyway.

213
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,175
Good point.

214
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:54,862
The whole weekend is off?
What happened?

215
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,269
Charlie happened.
Oh.

216
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:58,936
She showed up
for a "surprise visit."

217
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:01,236
Well, now we gotta
do something for betty.

218
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:02,707
No. She already
made other plans.

219
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:05,191
She's going to a concert
in the park tonight with henry.

220
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,816
<i>Papi, you know
how much it means to her</i>

221
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:09,800
<i>To be with him tonight. I know,
but it means something to me</i>

222
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,409
To have the family together on birthdays. Hey,
what if i bring your cupcakes over to henry's,

223
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,436
And then they can eat them
under the stars tonight

224
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:20,436
And, like, we'll be there
in spirit? Getting eaten.

225
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:25,999
Whoa. Oh. Sorry about the outfit.

226
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,425
I just came
from hip-Hop class.

227
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:30,436
I have big news.
I found the perfect apartment.

228
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:32,569
Really? Yeah. And guess where it is?

229
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:35,770
On spring, right around
the corner from your place.

230
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:39,903
Huh. Uh...
sou-Sounds great.

231
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,403
Okay, you're blinking a lot.
What-What's wrong?

232
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,436
Oh, no, i-It's just
everything's happening so fast.

233
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:47,836
You know? How well
do we really know each other?

234
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:49,836
What are you saying?

235
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:54,736
Uh, wilhelmina stopped by
my place this morning,

236
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:57,169
And she said some things,
and, um...

237
00:11:58,238 --> 00:11:59,403
I'm just gonna ask you-

238
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,137
Renee,

239
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,003
Stony brook?
Mm-Hmm.

240
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,202
What is stony brook?
Yeah.

241
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,670
It's a state college
on long island.

242
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,836
I went to school there,
daniel.

243
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:13,770
Sure, i was a little wild.
I had a few boyfriends.

244
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:16,566
You're not the only one who
had a life before we met. No.

245
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:18,903
I- I-I'm amazed
th-That you would even care

After everything that's happened with
you two. Renee, i'm sorry. I just-

248
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:24,565
No, i'm sorry.
Why don't you call me

249
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:26,503
When you're ready
to trust me a little?

250
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:34,436
Uh, yes, a table for two
on the patio.

251
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:39,436
Oh, okay.
Yeah. Yeah, i understand.

252
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:41,269
Um, no problem. Thanks.

253

Uh, just-Could you

Happy birthday.

271
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,800

277
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,503
Right here in manhattan-
An intimate dinner,

278
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,137
And then a concert

279
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:43,970
And fireworks in the park.

280
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:47,137
You know, the only thing missing
is a carriage ride.

281
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,670
Yeah.

282
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,603
Wait, a-A carriage ride?

283
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,836
Yeah.
Why'd you say that?

284
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:55,425
I don't know.

285
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:59,536
It just seemed like
somethin' you'd be into.

286
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,603
It was good to see you.

287
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,870
You, too.

288
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:08,378
Sorry we don't talk
as much anymore.

289
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:13,803
Yeah, well, you know,
just, uh, working and living.

290
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:18,903
Yeah. Working and living...

291
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:26,670
You bitch.
Well, hello to you, too.

292
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:29,550
Why are you trying to break up me and daniel?
Renee, we both know what happens to you

293
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,738
When things get
too serious with men.

294
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,941
This is nothing
like stony brook.

295
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:36,862
Good. It took a lot of work
to clean up that mess.

296
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:39,803
I'm warning you-

297
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,803
Leave us alone or you
will regret it, wilhelmina.

298
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,836
I'm sure i'm not the only one
around here with secrets.

299
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:01,697
Yes, amanda. What's your
favorite thing about getting old?

300
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:02,779
Is it your hair thinning

301
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,690
Or when kids ask you
about vietnam?

302
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,994
Can i help you with something?
Yeah, you know that guy

303
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,489
You're always pretending
is your boyfriend?

304
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:10,640
He's on line two.

305
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:16,488
Hey, birthday girl. Hi, i'm so glad you
called. I have a surprise for tonight.

306
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:19,112
One word-Fireworks.

307
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:21,800
That's two words. No,
technically, that's one word.

308
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,613
Nerdapalooza.

309
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:25,113
Amanda,
get off the phone.

310
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:29,128
Well, i have a surprise for you,
too. Oh, henry, i have to go.

311
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,191
My day's about
to get a lot better,

312
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,300
But i'll call you back.
I love you. Bye.

313
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:37,691
Daniel,
this is so sweet.

314
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:38,988
Oh, good.
I mean, it better be,

315
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,954
'Cause i gotta tell you,
renee is really mad at me.

316
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,255
What is it
with me and women, betty?

317
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:46,050
It's like
no matter what i do,

318
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,188
I'm always letting 'em down,

319
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:50,655
Especially the ones
i care about the most.

320
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:52,737
Can you just make sure
she gets that

321
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:54,925
As soon as possible?

322
00:15:55,988 --> 00:16:00,655
Okay, i'll send
a messenger right away.

323
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:08,455
Cupcakes?
Aw, that's so sweet,

324
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:09,925
But didn't you hear?

325
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,321
There isn't gonna be
a birthday date.

326
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,288
<i>Oh, didn't you hear?</i>

327
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,855
Henry and betty have
a whole new plan for tonight-

328
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:19,321
Fancy dinner,
romantic concert in the park,

329
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:20,789
And then afterwards,

330
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,800
Fireworks,
if you know what i mean.

331
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,722
Well, you know what?
That's great for them.

332
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:27,155
That betty, she, uh,

333
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:29,655
Sure doesn't let anything
get in her way, does she?

334
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,321
No, she doesn't,

335
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:34,822
<i>But if it does,
i got her back.</i>

336
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:36,822
These are not
just decorative.

337
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,789
See ya.

338
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:59,422
So what do you think?

339
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:03,155
<i>Wow, mom, it's so saucy.</i>

340
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,655
I know...

341
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:08,455
And if you look closely,
you can see a nipple imprint.

342
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,613
I've still got it.

343
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:13,088
So listen, mom,

344
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:14,588
We need to talk.

345
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:16,588
Oh, that sounds ominous.
What is it?

346
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:18,588
It's about the budget
for "hot flash."

347
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:20,269
Given the current realities
of the market,

348
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:24,121
I just-I can't put
any more money into the project.

349
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:25,588
You're cutting me off?

350
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,555
W- We haven't even
launched yet,

351
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:29,954
A- And i still need
funding for a staff.

352
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:33,822
I'm sorry. Don't do this
me. You're my daughter.

353
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:36,221
I'm also your boss.

354
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,622
Ooh. Let me help you
with that.

355
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,588
I got it. Thank you.

356
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,999
Wil said you'd be comin' by.

357
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:46,300
She sure is working you
with all this baby stuff.

358
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,999
I know,
but it's nothing

359
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:49,737
Compared to what
she must be going through,

360
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,925
Planning for motherhood
and all to-

361
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:56,255
Where is she, anyway?
Deep tissue massage.

362
00:17:56,321 --> 00:17:58,688
Yeah, she skipped
the baby c.P.R. Class

363
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:02,237
And made christina go alone.
Oh, oh. Of course she did.

364
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:03,300
Well, maybe
the massage will help

365
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,588
Circulate the ice
in her veins.

366
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:07,425
Oh, oops.
Did i say that out loud?

367
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:10,889
No, honey, please, it's okay.
I know how my sister is. Hmm.

368
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:14,362
So, it is, uh, happy hour.

369
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:15,988
I was just about
to make myself a drink.

370
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,921
You like chocolatinis?

371
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:20,422
Liquor and chocolate?
Oh, gee, i don't know.

372
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:21,954
Bring it.

373
00:18:30,238 --> 00:18:31,425
Betty.

374
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,050
Mrs. Meade.

375
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,675
I'm so sorry.

376
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:36,238
I try to keep up the appearance
that i never use the bathroom.

377
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:37,800
I hope you won't
think less of me.

378
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,999
Oh, um, no. No.
I really, really won't.

379
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:46,088
Are you okay?

380
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:47,550
Oh, my own daughter
just told me

381
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,999
That she doesn't believe in
my magazine. Alexis said that?

382
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:54,175
Well, not in so many words,
but it was pretty clear.

383
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,175
She thinks the magazine
is just a fantasy, a pipe dream.

384
00:18:57,175 --> 00:19:02,789
So i have decided not to
move forward with "hot flash."

385
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:04,522
I'm calling it quits.

386
00:19:04,588 --> 00:19:07,832
No. Mrs. Meade,
so what if it is a fantasy?

387
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:10,021
That doesn't mean
you can't make it come true.

388
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:14,021
Ju-Just today,
all of my dreams were crushed,

389
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:16,522
And i-I picked myself up,

390
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,831
I utilized my resources,

391
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:21,155
And now things are gonna
be even better.

392
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:23,255
Betty, what resources
do i have?

393
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:25,722
Everyone i know
has turned their back on me.

394
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:29,925
But you're the most resourceful
person i know.

395
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:32,822
You can do anything.

396
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:41,722
You're very perky,
you know that?

397
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:45,175
I've heard that before.

398
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:49,221
So what dreams of yours
were crushed today?

399
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:53,238
Well, it's my birthday...
oh.

400
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:56,655
And there was a change in plans,
but everything is fine.

401
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:58,988
Henry and i
are going to dinner.

402
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:00,522
How do i look?

403
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:07,954
Oh, no, no. I couldn't.

404
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:09,921
Yes, you can.

405
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,255
<i>Hey, it's betty.</i>

406
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:28,188
<i>Leave a message.
I'll call you back.</i>

407
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:31,655
Hey, betty.
I've got some bad news.

408
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:33,155
Charlie's not feeling well,

409
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:36,121
So i'm gonna have
to take her to the doctor.

410
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:39,655
Don't go to the restaurant.
I'll meet up with you later.

411
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,789
Betty, i'm so sorry.

412
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,622
Love you.

413
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,789
<i>One unheard message.</i>

414
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:53,255
<i>Betty-</i>

415
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:54,722
<i>...go to the restaurant.</i>

416
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,688
<i>I'll meet up with you-</i>

417
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,155
<i>I love you.</i>

418
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,548
Um, suarez.
Reservation for two.

419
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:17,363
So willie really got that girl
to eat dog food?

420
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,894
<i>Yeah, that girl
was her best friend.</i>

421
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,558
She called it
a loyalty test.

422
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:24,800
Portrait
of a mean girl, age 15.

423
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,238
Wilhelmina's always been good
at getting people to do things

424
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:30,234
They didn't want to do.
She still is.

425
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:31,925
Really?
Oh, yeah.

426
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:35,300
How so? Well, she practically
forced christina to carry this baby

427
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,987
So she could get the money to
save her husband's life. No!

428
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:42,701
Yes! And when chriina finds out who the sperminator
is... i thought it was an anonymous donor.

429
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,867
It's bradford meade.
No.

430
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,675
She stole the sperm
from his dead corpse,

431
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:47,940
And when
the bastard heir is born,

432
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,535
<i>She will finally get her hands
on a third of the meade empire.</i>

433
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:56,363
Mm. Oh, i think
i'm gonna vomit. Excuse me.

434
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,175
Thank you.

435
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,067
<i>* quand tu dits
des mots d'amour *</i>

436
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:13,567
<i>* des mots comme je t'adore *</i>

437
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:16,268
* i love you more... *

438
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,267
Are you ready to order?

439
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:21,238
Um, actually, no, not yet.

440
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:23,867
Or, you know what?

441
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:27,668
Um, i could start
with a...

442
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,550
The, uh...
uh, the-The cheese fondue.

443
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,100
That dish is for two people.

444
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:36,050
Oh. Yeah.
There will be two of us.

445
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,034
Uh, my boyfriend is,
uh, on the way. He's coming.

446
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,134
It is a lot of cheese.

447
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,668
We're hungry.

448
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:45,867
Okay, one cheese fondue
for you

449
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:48,701
And your boyfriend.

450
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:52,634
* la la la la la la *

451
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,434
Okay. Okay, henry.
Thanks for calling.

452
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:02,800
Henry is canceling on betty?

453
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,867
Charlie's not feeling well.
Yeah, right.

454
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,933
Beeyotch.

455
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:09,601
What? You know you guys
were thinking it.

456
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:12,925
<i>All right, familia suarez.
You know what this means.</i>

457
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,167
Betty needs a party.
I got the piñata.

458
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:19,363
I'll clear a dance floor.
And i'm making the cupcakes.

459
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,972
And i was like,
"slow your roll, mary-Kate.

460
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:25,863
You just can't call dibs
on every hot piece of... " pie.

461
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,050
Gotta go.

462
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,867
That is so sweet of you.
Thank you.

463
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,034
Yeah, well, it's for betty.

464
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,501
Ha.
What?

465
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:35,100
You just reminded me
of a really funny story.

466
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,925
See, betty's "boyfriend"
called earlier,

467
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:39,267
And he is
totally blowing her off

468
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,832
For their big birthday date
tonight. See?

469
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:45,925
Did you give
her this message?

470
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,175
I'm a receiver, not a giver.

471
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:50,941
Can i have that now?

472
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,425
How precious.

473
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:04,862
Did you make it yourself?

474
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:09,625
It's a gift from daniel,
"with all his love."

475
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:13,862
Oh, you're not gonna ruin
this relationship, wilhelmina,

476
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:16,113
Not unless you want your own
dirty laundry out in the open.

477
00:24:16,113 --> 00:24:19,659
Whatever are you talking about?
I know about bradford's baby,

478
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:22,300
And your plan to g your claws
into the meade fortune.

479
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,862
Oh, i know about all of it.
Mm, you know nothing.

480
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:32,362
<i>She stole
the sperm from his dead corpse</i>

481
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:33,999
<i>And when the bastard heir
is born,</i>

482
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,175
<i>She will finally
get her hands</i>

483
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:36,487
<i>On a third
of the meade empire.</i>

484
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,300
<i>Oh, i think i'm gonna vomit.</i>

485
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:41,965
Last time i checked,
sperm-Stealing was illegal.

486
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:44,737
I think this is all
daniel's gonna need

487
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:46,550
To go straight
to the police,

488
00:24:46,816 --> 00:24:48,813
Unless...
unless what?

489
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,675
Less you leave
me and daniel alone.

490
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:53,691
Let me have what i want,
and you can have what you want.

491
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,987
You really want to do this?

492
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:57,300
Oh, yes.

493
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:01,500
Very well, then.

494
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,300
I'm gonna go spend the night
at my boyfriend's.

495
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:19,675
Madam-

496
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:22,250
Mademoiselle, please.
I'm only 24.

497
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,968
Yes, i'm so sorry.

498
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,925
See, it has been a while,

499
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,367
And it is friday night,

500
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:31,200
And we are very booked.

501
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:32,518
And?

502
00:25:32,518 --> 00:25:35,238
There is a couple
waiting for this table.

503
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:38,300
It is their anniversary.

504
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:40,100
It's my birthday,

505
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:42,033
And-And my boyfriend-

506
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,167
He's not here.

507
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:45,734
We apologize.

508
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:49,100
May i offer you
a doggie bag for the cheese?

509
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,400
Cheers.

510
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,367
Betty.

511
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:12,200
Gio.
Whoa.

512
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,734
What are you doing here?

513
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:16,434
And why
are you in a carriage?

514
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,367
Henry left a message
with amanda.

515
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:20,434
He can't make it tonight.

516
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,050
Charlie.

517
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,234
So i'm not trying
to take his place or anything,

518
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,050
But when i heard
you were on your own,

519
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,238
I remembered my cousin drives
these things for tourists,

520
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:35,456
And i thought, she deserves
to have a little fun.

521
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:39,425
So what do you say?
Want a ride?

522
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,175
I- I don't know, gio.

523
00:26:43,175 --> 00:26:47,112
Come on.
Once around the block.

524
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:50,112
Fine.

525
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:52,112
Once around the block.

526
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,237
All right.

527
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:20,188
Willie,
i know i screwed up,

528
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,344
But breaking into
daniel's apartment,

529
00:27:22,394 --> 00:27:24,690
Isn't that a felony?
I'm too pretty for prison.

530
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,737
They'll pass me around
like a collection plate

531
00:27:25,737 --> 00:27:29,050
At a catholic church.
Stop whining. You owe me.

532
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,829
And prison is exactly
where i'll end up

533
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:32,796
If they find out how this baby
was really conceived.

534
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:35,929
I feel like you'd do
well in prison. I would.

535
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:38,796
Hmm. Now relax. You
don't have to break in.

536
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:40,425
Don'you think
i would have had

537
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,230
An extra set of keys
made for daniel's apartment?

538
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,909
Oh, marc, you underestimate
me. I hate myself even more.

539
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,263
Okay, willie,
i'm going in.

540
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:53,331
But if i don't
make it out alive...

541
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:56,253
We'll always have bergdorf's,
darling.

542
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:04,163
We all know what it's li
to be ignored,

543
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,762
Taken for granted,

544
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:08,096
Not valued.

545
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:09,738
That is
never going to happen

546
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:13,063
To the staff
at "hot flash" magazine

547
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,896
Because this isn't
just a job.

548
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,796
It's a family.

549
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:21,296
Speaking of family,

550
00:28:21,363 --> 00:28:22,800
I'd like
to introduce you all

551
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,263
To my beautiful daughter
alexis meade.

552
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,754
Hello.

553
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:29,362
Can i talk
to you for a sec?

554
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:30,738
Mom, what's going on?

555
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:32,963
I thought i told you there's
no money to hire a staff.

556
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:34,929
Relax, darling,
i don't need your money

557
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:37,796
Or anyonelse's.
I'm using my own resources.

558
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:39,660
Turns out
there's a work program

559
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,441
For recently released inmates.

560
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:44,925
It's subsidized by the state, so my
overhead is minimal. They're prisoners?

561
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:48,497
Ex-Prisoners... like me.

562
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:52,363
Mom, do any of them
have any experience?

563
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,063
They have life experience,

564
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,563
And that's what "hot flash"
is all about-

565
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:01,196
Your life just changed.
What do you do now?

566
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:04,300
I can't think
of a better talent pool.

567
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:07,628
All right,
let's get back to work.

568
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,175
Whew! Anybody have a fan?
It is hot in here.

569
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:14,191
And then the weekend
of my 10th birthday,

570
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,972
There was this blizzard,

571
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:17,425
So no one could
get to the party,

572
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:18,238
And we couldn't leave
the house,

573
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:20,800
So we had to eat
leftover cake for weeks.

574
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,762
Hmm. Well, that's not so bad. Yeah.

575
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,063
Whoa.
Why are we stopping?

576
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,206
Snowflake has to take care
of some business.

577
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:32,430
Oh.
Sorry.

578
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:35,497
Not quite the birthday
you imagined, huh?

579
00:29:35,563 --> 00:29:37,497
Eh, it's my own fault.

580
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:39,530
I had
thistupid fantasy-

581
00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:44,762
Fireworks, epic romance...
like romeo and juliet.

582
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:47,696
Oh, you know those two
ended up dead in a tomb, right?

583
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:49,996
Yeah, i don't like
thinking about that part.

584
00:29:50,063 --> 00:29:52,929
All right. Fantasies are fun,
but we live in reality.

585
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:54,430
It's not perfect,

586
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:56,925
But it doesn't mean
it can't be pretty good.

587
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,430
I know.

588
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,675
I know, i know,
and-And-And it is.

589
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,688
I'm lucky,

590
00:30:03,738 --> 00:30:04,987
Except for the part
where henry's leaving me

591
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:07,113
After his baby's born.

592
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:10,729
It's getting late.
I should get home.

593
00:30:10,796 --> 00:30:13,563
No. You're not going home.

594
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:14,785
I'm not?

595
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:16,996
Nope. We're heading
to central park.

596
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:19,829
We can still catch
the end of that show.

597
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:21,729
Betty wants fireworks
for her birthday,

598
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:23,425
<i>She's gettin' fireworks.</i>

599
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:39,863
Hello?

600
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,130
Hello.

601
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:07,629
Oh, daniel meade,
you naughty, naughty boy.

602
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:09,096
What are you doing?

603
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:10,597
Oh, god.

604
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,896
I, uh, i'm...

605
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:15,263
I'm...

606
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,029
I want you.

607
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:20,296
Excuse me?

608
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:24,488
<i>You, you big, sexy...
magazine editor.</i>

609
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:25,530
I want you.
I love you.

610
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:26,737
I've always loved you.

611
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:29,497
Stop that.
This smells like wilhelmina.

612
00:31:29,563 --> 00:31:32,829
No. It smells like the beginning
of something beautiful.

613
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:33,691
I'm calling the police.

614
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,550
Oh! Well, we'll always have
this moment. Ciao.

615
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:43,463
Have you heard from betty?

616
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,063
Her phone's not working.

617
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,285
<i>Ay. Here comes somebody.</i>

618
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:50,441
Is it her? No, i need more time.
This banner is subpar.

619
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,175
<i>Ay, just hang it.
Who cares?</i>

620
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:55,362
It's not betty.

621
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:58,963
Hi.

622
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:01,130
Hi. Thought you were
at the doctor.

623
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:03,096
I- I was.
Um, everything's fine.

624
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:04,988
They couldn't find
anything wrong.

625
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:08,300
I think charlie was just trying
to ruin my night with betty.

626
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,696
I can't believe i fell
for it. Me, either.

627
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,596
But this is your baby
we're talking about.

628
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,816
What are you gonna do, right? Thanks.

629
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:16,690
Just glad i didn't miss
betty's party completely.

630
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,363
Is she here? Not yet. Thank you.

631
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:24,050
I don't think
we're gonna make it.

632
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,096
It sounds like
it's almost over.

633
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:28,362
Somebody had to stop
for hot chocolate.

634
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:31,430
What?
We're gonna make it, okay?

635
00:32:34,063 --> 00:32:35,063
What was that?

636
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:37,437
Crap.
Think i busted a wheel.

637
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:38,929
I'm gonna try
to rig something up.

638
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:40,816
Oh, okay.
Well, here, i can help.

639
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:42,300
No, no. No.
You stay in the carriage.

640
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
I don't want you to
dirty your dress. Oh-Oh!

641
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,128
Betty!
Oh, no.

642
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,769
You okay?
I'm okay.

643
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh, no.

644
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:53,300
Man, uh...
uhh...

645
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,394
I think i have a, uh...

646
00:32:58,081 --> 00:32:59,362
Napkin.

647
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,662
Okay.

648
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:03,487
Thanks.

649
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:04,659
Yeah.

650
00:33:05,312 --> 00:33:07,566
Uh, i'm so sorry, betty.

651
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,597
This night sucks, huh?

652
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:14,390
You're such a great girl.

653
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,813
You're so good and nice,

654
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,796
And you deserve to have
an amazing birthday.

655
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:23,230
Gio, it's not your fault.
You did everything you could.

656
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:24,696
It's fine.

657
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:26,829
No. No, it's not. I'm-

658
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:29,829
You know, i'm not a big believer
in this whole fantasy thing,

659
00:33:29,896 --> 00:33:33,063
But i at least wanted you
to have a little bit of yours.

660
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,696
I'm sorry.

661
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,425
I wasted your whole night.

662
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,629
* you're not here with me *

663
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:42,497
No, look. Look!

664
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,896
* for you to stay *

665
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:47,729
Fireworks.

666
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:49,196
* in my arms tonight *

667
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:50,729
* arms tonight, arms tonight *

668
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,463
* i'm longing
to hold you tight *

669
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,296
* hold you tight,
hold you tight *

670
00:33:55,363 --> 00:33:57,330
* need to hear you say
it'll be all right *

671
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:58,996
* be all right, be all right *

672
00:33:59,063 --> 00:34:02,363
* i want you to say *

673
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,196
* you'll be holding me
every night *

674
00:34:05,263 --> 00:34:07,130
* every night, every night *

675
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:09,762
* in your arms
and out of sight *

676
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,800
???

677
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,297
This smells like wilhelmina.

678
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:17,564
Oh, my-That is
exactly what i said.

679
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:22,722
You know, look, i stupidly let
her get to me this morning.

680
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:25,488
I messed up. I am sorry.

681
00:34:25,488 --> 00:34:27,696
No, i'm sorry, too,
daniel...

682
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:31,566
Becausi haven't
told you everything.

683
00:34:31,566 --> 00:34:34,363
You can. Trust me.

684
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,456
All right.

685
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,282
Well,
it was back in college

686
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:42,875
At stony brook.

687
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:44,425
I had a breakdown,

688
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:46,737
And i went
to a treatment facility.

689
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:48,691
Still see a shrink.

690
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:51,629
And, uh...

691
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:58,999
I take these every day.

692
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:01,366
- It was a long time ago,
you know,

693
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:05,765
But i guess i'm still
a little sensitive about it.

694
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:09,199
Thank you
for telling me the truth.

695
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:09,879
Yeah.

696
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:11,300
But if you think for a second

697
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,988
That's gonna make me want
to be with you any less,

698
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:16,988
You're wrong.
Really?

699
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:22,487
Don't take that apartment.
Will you move in with me?

700
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,238
Oh, hell, yeah.

701
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:28,798
I wonder what mr. Dull
and sister crazy

702
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,191
Are doing right now.

703
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:31,832
Ugh, don't look at me.
I don't get straight people.

704
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:34,534
Who ts what where?
It's all so confusing.

705
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:37,175
Oh, speak of t she-Devil.

706
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:40,165
Renee, what a surprise.

707
00:35:40,232 --> 00:35:42,165
Do you have a minute,
wilhelmina?

708
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:43,925
I'd like to rub
something in your face.

709
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,300
Well, someone's already doing
that right now, but go ahead.

710
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,453
Daniel and i
are moving in together.

711
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:51,238
Yeah, he's out getting champagne
to celebrate as we speak.

712
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:53,363
Mm. Hip hip hooray.

713
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:55,488
And, willie,
i know what you're up to.

714
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:57,300
Did you really think
i'd be so stup

715
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,988
As to just leave
that recording lying around?

716
00:35:59,988 --> 00:36:02,425
Well, you can't
blame a girl for trying.

717
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:04,175
I'm not going away,

718
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:07,363
So if you or marc
interfere again,

719
00:36:07,363 --> 00:36:09,531
I will release
that recording to everyone,

720
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:12,398
And it'll be all over
for you, wilhelmina.

721
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:19,932
Like i give a tinker's fart
about that recording.

722
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:22,425
No one's gonna believe
the rantings of a drunken fool.

723
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:24,132
Hey, feelings.

724
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,299
Out.

725
00:36:26,366 --> 00:36:29,285
And no one's gonna believe
a crazy woman, either.

726
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:32,798
Show me. Are you sure
those are the right pills?

727
00:36:32,865 --> 00:36:35,238
<i>They were the ones
in that hideous green bag.</i>

728
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:38,032
What did you replace them with?
Your fat-Blockers.

729
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,128
They were the only ones
that matched.

730
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:43,232
Oh, marc, we want her crazy,
not crazy and thin.

731
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:44,050
Oh, right.

732
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,987
Well, no matter.
Those pills are all that stand

733
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:49,425
Between my sister
and the nuthouse.

734
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:51,800
In a few days, she'll start
losing a grip on reality,

735
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,362
And then my plan
will be in motion.

736
00:36:56,363 --> 00:36:57,999
Sorry, renee.

737
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:00,078
I' got
too much riding on this.

738
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:01,425
In.

739
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,703
Hey.

740
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:44,688
You're home.
Hilda and justin are asleep,

741
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:47,378
And, uh,
he wanted to wait for you.

742
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:52,687
I can't believe you guys did
all of this and i missed it.

743
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,170
You didn't have to do
anything special for me.

744
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:58,804
You know what? I think all
of this was, um, more for me.

745
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:01,570
Doing these kind of things
makes me feel good,

746
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:04,070
Like i'm taking care
of my lile girl.

747
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:06,570
But you're a grown-Up now.

748
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:09,036
You don't need me
making cupcakes anymore.

749
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:11,270
<i>Papi...</i>

750
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:16,425
There will never be a day
when i don't need cupcakes...

751
00:38:18,036 --> 00:38:19,737
Or you.

752
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:29,537
Actually, i could really use
e of those cupcakes

753
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,036
Right about now.

754
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,537
Well,
i may have a few... dozen

755
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,036
Left in the kitchen.

756
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:36,969
Really?
Mm-Hmm.

757
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:38,925
Aah, you're the best.

758
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,503
He willie,

759
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,488
You know i've never been one
to second-Guess your choices,

760
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:51,862
But can i ask you a question,
friend-To-Friend? Marc, you know i hate

761
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,738
When things get personal
between the two of us.

762
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:56,175
I do. I do. I know,
but it's just...

763
00:38:56,175 --> 00:39:00,691
What we're doing...
i mean, nee's your sister.

764
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:02,936
There are things
in her past, marc-

765
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:04,570
Terrible things.

766
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:08,936
You have no idea what she's done
or what she's capable of.

767
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:15,237
Renee and i were-

768
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:40,337
I know you think i'm the
evil sister, marc... well...

769
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:43,337
But at least
i stop short of murder.

770
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,378
This is
the best birthday present

771
00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:50,878
I got all day.

772
00:39:51,337 --> 00:39:52,869
<i>Gracias, mija.</i>

773
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:54,670
Oh, i almost forgot...

774
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:56,050
What?

775
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,770
I'm supposed to make sure
you get this.

776
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:06,269
Daniel?
Mm-Hmm.

777
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:07,470
Wh-When did he-

778
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:09,550
He dropped it off
a couple of weeks ago.

779
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,191
He just wanted to make sure
he didn't forget.

780
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:14,570
He remembered he'd forget?

781
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,770
Oh, i'm gonna
call it a night.

782
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:20,303
Happy birthday, sweetie.

783
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,936
Thank you, daddy.

784
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,370
<i>Te quiero.
I love you, too.</i>

785
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,140
Mm, betty.

786
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,550
You're here.

787
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,487
Yeah, i didn't want
to wake you.

788
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:48,675
Hmm. I never got
a chance to tell you

789
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,300
Happy birthday.

790
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,940
Thank you.

791
00:40:56,869 --> 00:40:58,670
* in my dreams *

792
00:40:58,737 --> 00:41:00,770
I'm sorry it wasn't perfect.

793
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:02,303
* i can fly *

794
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,270
Yeah, me, too.

795
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,303
*... everywhere *

796
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,836
* because you love me *

797
00:41:09,903 --> 00:41:12,270
* yes, you love me *

798
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:35,520
