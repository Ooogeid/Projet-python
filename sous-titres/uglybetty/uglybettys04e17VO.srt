1
00:00:00,811 --> 00:00:02,293
Previously on "Ugly betty"...

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:06,001
-Hilda suarez, I love you. Will you marry me?
-Oh.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:07,502
So you like someone.

4
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:10,471
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:13,174
-Are you my mother?
-Yes.

6
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,076
Tyler is not who you think he is.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,246
-Well, who is he then?
-He's your brother.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,347
I really, uh,
need to see you tonight.

9
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:21,816
I'm kind of busy right now.

10
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,707
Thanks for not ditching me tonight.

11
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,153
My name is betty suarez,

12
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:27,285
And I'm looking for
a new orthodontist.

13
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:30,391
I've been wearing braces
for over four years now.

14
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:50,845
Good-bye, braces.

15
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,582
Whoo!

16
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,519
-Morning!
-Morning.

17
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:00,288
Okay.

18
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:00,706
Hey!

19
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:03,174
Papi, betty and I were up all night

20
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,843
Talking about my wedding,
and there is really no way

21
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:09,730
That we can do it without
100 snow-white doves.

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,072
What do you need doves for?
City's full of pigeons.

23
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,600
-And they're free.
-Pigeons?!

24
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:16,602
Ugh! Why do you hate me?!

25
00:01:16,636 --> 00:01:18,637
Betty, back me up.

26
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:21,640
I don't know if I said "
A hundred white doves."

27
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:24,810
Ay! Where is justin
when you need him?

28
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:27,346
Uh, hey, austin.

29
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:29,815
Um, just leaving another message.

30
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,152
Don't really know how you're
feeling about what happened...

31
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:35,654
Um, you know, the... kiss.

32
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,157
Maybe you st your
phone or something.

33
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:41,160
I don't really know. Probably not.

34
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:44,163
Um, anyway, you can call me back.

35
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:47,166
Um, uh, this is justin.

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,569
Justin! Papi doesn't
understand the doves.

37
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:53,572
There have to be a hundred,
and if they're not snow white,

38
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:55,455
Then they might as
well just be pigeons.

39
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,443
That's what I said.
Betty, before I forget,

40
00:01:57,477 --> 00:02:00,112
This is your last check
for the orthodontist.

41
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:02,815
Papi, I'm an adult.
I can cover it myself.

42
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,084
Then I will take it.

43
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:06,652
What? Champagne waterfalls
are very expensive.

44
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:07,987
Please, I'm your father.
Let me do this.

45
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,989
And besides, it's my fault.

46
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:12,324
Everyone on my side of the family

47
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:15,061
Has the big, crazy chompers.
A.B., look this way.

48
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,563
I got you just a
little small something

49
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,965
To celebrate your
braces coming off.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,534
Aww! How sweet!

51
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,102
Not so fast.

52
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:25,905
You can't have it until
those things are gone.

53
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,908
Okay, well, one more
thing to look forward to.

54
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,543
All right, family...

55
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:32,711
Say good-bye to the braces!

56
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:35,548
'cause you're never
gonna see them again!

57
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:37,850
Bye, braces!

58
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:48,761
Tyler? Interesting.
I'm totally on board.

59
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,763
Oh. Um...

60
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:54,266
Amanda spilled a wine cooler
on my shirt last night, so--

61
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:57,269
Oh, last night. So you slept over?

62
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:59,972
Boo-yay! I totally
got the stain out.

63
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:07,780
Thanks. Um...

64
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:10,216
Listen, listen,
I should probably go.

65
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,251
Okay.

66
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:15,788
So... will I see you later?

67
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,723
Yeah, if you want to.

68
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:37,376
Marc, nothing happened.
Honest to prada.

69
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,879
He was just jet-lagged
from his trip with claire

70
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:42,114
So he stayed over. That right there

71
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,216
Was the first time
we've even kissed.

72
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,185
It's actually kind of nice,

73
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:49,822
Getting to know a y before
I tickle his ginger. Sweet.

74
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,457
It really is.

75
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,627
Marc, I think this might be
the start of something real.

76
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,796
So does daniel know about
you and his half brother?

77
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:00,633
No, daniel doesn't know,
and he's never going to.

78
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,102
Really, never?
Secrets come out, mandy.

79
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:06,505
If you think this is real,
you should probably tell daniel

80
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,041
Before he hears about
it someplace else.

81
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:17,516
So the whole time I'm
on this date, right,

82
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:20,486
I keep staring at this guy's
funky lateral incisor.

83
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,421
But, I mean, I can't say anything

84
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:25,191
'cause you know how men are.
They're so sensitive.

85
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:27,126
Huh, what was that?

86
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,661
-Dr. Frankel?
-Yeah?

87
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:30,629
I'm really enjoying this story,

88
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,386
But we're gonna take
my braces off today,

89
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,066
-right?
-Of course. Absolutely! Of course.

90
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,668
Great.

91
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:37,503
So, anyway,
I'm sitting at the table,

92
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:40,539
And mr. Funkyity tooth is taking
forever with this menu, right?

93
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:44,243
Look, I have to be at work
soon because it's picture day,

94
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,745
And I'm really looking forward
to getting a new I.D... mm.

95
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:48,614
With my new smile.

96
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,407
And I don't want to
rush you or anything...

97
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:51,717
mm-hmm. Enough said. Absolutely.

98
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,352
You have had these on forever...

99
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:55,120
Forever. And you are
dying to get them off.

100
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:57,131
-We're not gonna waste another minute.
-Yep, okay.

101
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,692
-Are we ready?
-I'm so ready.

102
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:03,762
And...

103
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:06,765
-There's the fire alarm.
-Are you freaking kidding me?!

104
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,335
I'm so sorry. It's been
on the fritz all week.

105
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:13,005
Well, at least the sprinklers
didn't go off this time. What?

106
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:17,443
Bonjour!

107
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:22,281
I just got back. I brought
you some parisian chocolate.

108
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:24,617
Great. But I'm kind
of busy right now,

109
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:27,920
Getting ready for this shoot.
Oh, yes! The million dollar bra.

110
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,055
Everybody's talking about it.

111
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,025
You really pulled off
quite a coup there.

112
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,160
Ad sales are through the roof.

113
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,499
-Aren't you going to ask me about my trip?
-How s your trip?

114
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,501
Alexis and tyler really hit it off.

115
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:44,503
You know, she was
skeptical at first,

116
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:47,873
But then when she really let
herself get to know him...

117
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:50,643
I just... I wish you
had been there. Yeah--

118
00:05:50,677 --> 00:05:53,245
A fun vacation with my half
brother who I don't like

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,981
And my mother who lied to
me about his very existence.

120
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,550
Daniel, can we please
just talk about this?

121
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,019
Why start now?

122
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:02,421
I'm late for my meeting. Excuse me.

123
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:08,327
I have three words for you--

124
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,129
Million dollar bra.

125
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,958
It's never been featured
on a cover before,

126
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,638
But the good people
at eve's seduction

127
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:16,749
Are allowing "Mode" To be the
very first, thanks to me.

128
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,472
Thank you, thank you.

129
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:23,142
Yes, yes. Daniel did
something right.

130
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:26,044
Hallelujah, it's a miracle.

131
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:29,647
So the bra launches its world
tour with a gala send-off

132
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:30,691
This afternoon at the guggenheim.

133
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,714
We will be shooting the
bra immediately after...

134
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:36,041
At the guggenhei also thanks to me.

135
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,502
If you turn to page
seven of your packets,

136
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:42,586
You'll see the bra's itinerary
for the day, or bra-tinerary.

137
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:46,351
Uh, we are working under
a very tight timeline,

138
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:49,654
-So you will have four hours to shoot the bra.
-Uh, daniel?

139
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:52,090
I'm sure you have this
all thought through,

140
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:54,526
And, uh, I might be a little slow,

141
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,862
But can you explain to me how
we're gonna shoot the bra

142
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:59,898
While it's on a plane?

143
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:02,367
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,302
Well, according to
your bra-tinerary,

145
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,638
You have us shooting the
bra in the afternoon,

146
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:09,040
But the new press release
from eve's seduction

147
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:12,210
Has the bra on its way to
cairo at the same time.

148
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:14,812
I'm sure it's just, uh,
been a little mix-up

149
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,381
And won't be a problem.

150
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:18,383
No, this is a huge problem.

151
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,351
I know the bra has a busy schedule,

152
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,820
But you promised me four
hours to do the shoot.

153
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:25,887
We... no, we didn't have
a written agreement,

154
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,292
We had a verbal one.

155
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:30,495
Look, just put someone
else on the phone.

156
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,130
-Hel-hello? -Dael.

157
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:35,466
Can I talk to you for a minute?

158
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,802
I sort of met someone.

159
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:40,104
Really?

160
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,739
Well...

161
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:44,409
Good for you... I guess.

162
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:45,877
There's more.

163
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:48,112
It's tyler.

164
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:51,316
Amanda...

165
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,484
How can you do this to me?

166
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,687
Well, we said we were casual.

167
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:57,437
I-I thought that's how this worked.

168
00:07:57,438 --> 00:07:58,957
Yeah, but he's my half brother.

169
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:01,626
Don't you see how messed
up that is? Daniel--

170
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,761
Don't say anything.

171
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,968
?

172
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:18,509
Do you thinkaybe--oh.

173
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:20,144
Sorry, I-I was talking.

174
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:23,815
Hey, that's not so bad.

175
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,817
I had planned everything out.

176
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:28,252
I was supposed to
have my braces off,

177
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:31,489
I picked out a nice outfit.
Aww, why didn't you wear it?

178
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:33,424
And then the sprinklers went off

179
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,727
At my orthodontist's this morning.

180
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:38,896
-Ironically improving your look slightly.
-Thanks.

181
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,299
Hey, betty, ask me if,
in four years,

182
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,267
I've ever gotten tired
of making fun of you.

183
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:45,937
Go ahead, ask me. Ask me!
In four years, ve you ever got--

184
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:47,772
Nope!

185
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:50,675
Okay, betty, wait, come back.
Come on, we can fix this.

186
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,377
Look, watch.

187
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:54,612
First, we just gotta
get rid of the braces,

188
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,981
And then we'll fix that hair.

189
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,484
-Ah! Thank you, marc!
-Bup-bup-bup! We're not done yet.

190
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:01,452
Now we gotta fix that face!

191
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:04,322
Let's try this and this and this.

192
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:07,191
Voil?

193
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,394
Marc, this looks nothing like me.

194
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:11,829
You're welcome.

195
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:13,831
I am out of options.

196
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,567
Their head of publicity changed
the bra schedule last minute.

197
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:19,237
E really screwed me on this.
So go above her.

198
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:20,772
Betty, the only person

199
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:22,707
Higher up at eve's
seduction is eve herself,

200
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:24,676
And no one's ever seen her smile.

201
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,311
Everybody knows she's
a cast-iron bitch.

202
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:30,048
I mean, look at her.
Last time she smiled

203
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:31,792
Was when dick cheney shot
that guy in the face.

204
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:33,685
Hmm. All right. So don't
go above her. Go below her.

205
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:36,416
Eve's assistant alison is super nice,
and we're old pals.

206
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,657
She's probably online right now.
Look, I'm sorry I'm so stressed.

207
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,560
First, this whole thing with
the bra and then amanda.

208
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,929
-You know she broke up with me?
-She broke up with you?

209
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:47,965
Yeah. I thought it was
more casual than that.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
No, we were.

211
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,602
It's just that she wanted
to start seeing tyler.

212
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:55,339
Tyler? Your brother?
That's intense.

213
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:58,176
-Why would she do something like that?
-I don't know.

214
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,678
Maybe she wanted something...
more than casual.

215
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:03,881
Hey, come on! I can do
something re than casual.

216
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,018
Okay. I'm just saying,
is that really what you want?

217
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,121
Hey, a-bomb!

218
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,356
B-Bomb! Got the birthday flowers.

219
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:13,925
You rock...

220
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,294
hard. You rock harder!

221
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:18,863
You're a rock star.
You're a rocket ship!

222
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:20,043
You are rock candy. Okay, uh,

223
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:22,100
can we just save all this rockin'
for later, ladies?Thanks.

224
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:24,836
Sorry. He's stressed.

225
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,739
Look, I just found out that
the bra has to go to Egypt.

226
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,208
That's really gonna
screw up our shoot.

227
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,736
Is there something you
can do to help? Ooh,

228
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:33,578
that might be tough.
Eve's in one of her moods today.

229
00:10:33,612 --> 00:10:36,147
She does always pad the
bra's schedule though.

230
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:38,950
So tell you what. Why don't
we meet at the Guggenheim,

231
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:42,019
and see if we can try to convince her?
What do you say?

232
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:44,622
I'd say you rock! No, you rock!

233
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:46,543
-No, you rock!
-Okay, you both rock.

234
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:49,212
Sorry. Thank you.
We'll see you later. Bye-bye.

235
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:52,315
Betty, 1. Giving up, 0.

236
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:56,185
Uh, you've got a raisin
stuck in your... braces.

237
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,454
-It's kind of gross.
-Ew.

238
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:13,150
Hey, braces, the museum is
closed for a private party.

239
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,152
Your school's group is over there.

240
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:16,700
Ah, ha ha. No, I'm not with them.

241
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,356
-I'm actually with "Mode."
-I.D.

242
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:21,191
What's with all the security?

243
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:23,627
Eve's seduction hired us
to protect the bra, miss.

244
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:25,796
Can I see your press I.D.?

245
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,865
Yep.

246
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,069
This isn't you.

247
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:35,673
Oh.

248
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,641
Actually, it's a funny story.

249
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,743
See, it was picture
day at work today,

250
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:42,646
And this guy I know thought
it would be funny to--

251
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:45,149
Oh. Step to the side, ma'am.

252
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:55,392
I'm gonna have to ask
you to open your mouth.

253
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:57,528
Why? What do you think
you're gonna find?

254
00:11:57,562 --> 00:12:00,664
I have braces, okay?
I'm an adult woman with braces!

255
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,166
It's a pain!

256
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,135
Do I wish that I was born
with perfect teeth? Yes.

257
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,073
But I wasn't. So if you'll excuse me,
I have a job to do.

258
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,607
A-bomb! Bomb!

259
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,109
Aah!

260
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:13,577
Ah!

261
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:14,912
Aah.

262
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,683
Do I wish

263
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:22,119
I was born with perfect teeth? Yes.

264
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:24,054
You've got a raisin

265
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,989
Stuck in your braces.

266
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:54,351
What happened?

267
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,487
You got your wish.

268
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:18,192
Dr. Frankel?

269
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:19,807
What are you doing here?

270
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,875
Well, you wished you were
born with perfect teeth,

271
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:24,110
And here you are.

272
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:27,714
You have perfect teeth.
You're welcome.

273
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,373
So what are you--

274
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:34,142
My guardian angel, a tooth fairy?

275
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:36,277
Eh, I don't do labels.

276
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:38,647
Wait a minute.

277
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:48,289
I don't need glasses

278
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:50,016
Wait, why don't I need glasses?

279
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:51,168
You got lasik.

280
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:54,103
You wanted perfect eyes to
match your perfect teeth.

281
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:57,307
-In this world, you're actually just a little bit vain.
-Really?

282
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,242
Mm-hmm. That doesn't
sound like me at all.

283
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,536
Hilda? Papi?

284
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,038
Are you guys...

285
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:12,744
-Who are you?
-Who e you?

286
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,313
-This is my house.
-Yeah, actually, it's not.

287
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:16,982
It's not? No.

288
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:19,551
Well, where's my family?

289
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,186
Baby, get the bat.

290
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,121
Oh!

291
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:26,892
My family lives here?

292
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:29,728
This is amazing.

293
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:32,297
And all of this happened
because I had perfect teeth?

294
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,401
Well, since your papi didn't
have to pay for your braces,

295
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:36,567
All that money went right
into the tech boom.

296
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:41,073
Rented out your old house
and voil? Casa suarez.

297
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:47,679
Oh, my god.

298
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:49,981
Is that my family?

299
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,851
Hey! Mija, there you are.

300
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:55,454
-We've been looking for you.
-Yeah.

301
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,456
Hi, guys.

302
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,692
Uh, hilda, you look so...

303
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:03,328
Beautiful? I know!

304
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,382
Well, I took your advice.
I'm wearing makeup.

305
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:09,301
-Isn't she a knockout?
-Oh! Anyway, betty,

306
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:12,237
I have been looking
everywhere for a wedding dress

307
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:16,074
That looks like the one that you
wore to prom. I went to prom?

308
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,515
I was prom queen?

309
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,451
Okay, ha ha, very funny.

310
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:29,554
Anyway, do you tnk I can
pull off a dress like that?

311
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,390
Oh, your opinion means
so much to me, you know?

312
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:35,360
You're my fashion guru!

313
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:40,532
Oh.

314
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,000
-Aah!
-Oh!

315
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:44,770
There you are. I'm so sorry.

316
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,804
-Where'd you go?
-I've been working double duty.

317
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm showing anna paquin what
her life would've been like

318
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,682
If she didn't have that
giant gap in her teeth.

319
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,776
I mean, my family is loaded,

320
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:58,679
And hilda is happier
than I've ever seen her.

321
00:15:58,713 --> 00:16:01,415
But why does she... look so...

322
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,083
-Different?
-Yeah.

323
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:04,633
It's the law of the universe.

324
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:07,001
There can only be one
really pretty sister.

325
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:09,036
I mean, think about it, right?

326
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,506
There's paris and nicky,
kim and khloe, jeff and beau...

327
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,407
So I'm the pretty sister? Mm-hmm.

328
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,011
You know you love it.
Don't pretend you don't.

329
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,913
You'd be surprised how something

330
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:22,459
As simple as perfect
teeth can change you...

331
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,427
And the people around you.

332
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:35,738
Good afternoon, "Mode" Magazine.

333
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:37,373
Please hold.

334
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:39,708
Oh, hi, betty.

335
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:42,678
-Marc... you have a baby?
-I'm so sorry.

336
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:46,015
Didier had a big trial today,
and our sitter canceled.

337
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,250
You look beautiful, by the way.

338
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:50,853
Are those earrings new?
They're great! And you're nice.

339
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,821
What are you doing at reception?

340
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:54,523
Oh, answering phones,
alphabetizing files.

341
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,325
But if you need me
to run any errands,

342
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,391
I can totally do that.

343
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,567
Rosalita will sleep
through anything.

344
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,318
She once slept through a
coup attempt in el salvador.

345
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,392
Oh. Oopsie-poopsie!

346
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,772
Somebody did a numero dos.

347
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:08,339
I just gotta change-sies,

348
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,441
But if you need anything,
seriously, just...

349
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:12,243
Ohh.

350
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,746
Ugh.

351
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,673
-I can't believe he brought that little goblin.
-Amanda?

352
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:21,141
This is a place of work... ish.

353
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:24,737
Okay, could marc's
desk be any gayer?

354
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,039
Not that I mind gay. I love gay.

355
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:29,375
I just usually prefer the loud,
swishy, stereotypical kind.

356
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:31,877
You're awfully quiet today.

357
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:33,446
Am I?

358
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,681
Yeah, usually you chime
in with some funny remark

359
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:37,883
About his lesbian jeans
or his jheri curl.

360
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:40,586
You mean... you and
I make fun of marc?

361
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,655
Only every monday
through friday, bestie.

362
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:45,157
Um, bestie, I don't think
you should be stealing

363
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:47,126
All that petty cash.

364
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,930
Um, it's not stealing when
you own half the company, b.

365
00:17:50,964 --> 00:17:52,865
Mm-hmm. Yeppers.

366
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,900
Married to daniel.

367
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:56,602
Can you believe it?

368
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:59,071
I mean, at first it was
just casual, right?

369
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:01,974
And then he gets wind that
she's seeing other guys,

370
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:03,943
And then, of course,
daniel gets serious.

371
00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:05,444
Ohh. Jealousy.

372
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,480
It can make a man marry you or...

373
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:09,648
Throw acid in your face.

374
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:12,718
Well, they seem happy.

375
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:15,287
Dr. Frankel?

376
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:18,791
Betty, these just came for you.

377
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:20,893
-They did? From who?
-Derek.

378
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,828
Derek who?

379
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:25,698
Derek jeter!

380
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,833
I'm dating derek jeter?!

381
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:30,269
Well, you were.
He's trying to win you back.

382
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,371
Why am I telling you this?

383
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:34,573
He can have me back!

384
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:37,042
I'll just put these in your office.

385
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,589
I'm a managing editor...

386
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:53,225
I'm rich...

387
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,662
And I'm dating derek jeter!

388
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:58,798
It's great to be betty suarez.

389
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:01,567
It seems like everyone
is doing great.

390
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,314
Daniel!

391
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:17,316
It's so good to see you.

392
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,020
Why? Have you got some
bad news to deliver?

393
00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:23,522
Don't like what I'm wearing? Hmm?

394
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:27,092
Found some new way to humiliate me?

395
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:30,162
What? What are you talking about?

396
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:32,665
You may have everyone
else around here fooled,

397
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:35,234
But I know the real you.

398
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:37,436
Underneath that perfect smile,

399
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,239
You're ugly, betty.

400
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:49,099
Everything seemed so perfect.

401
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:51,507
Why does daniel hate me?

402
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:53,842
We've been through
so much together.

403
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,611
I was his assistant
for three years!

404
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:58,079
Oh, nope. You weren't.

405
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,917
Daniel's dad hired a plain jane
who wouldn't tempt his son,

406
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,486
And without your braces,
that wasn't you.

407
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:07,889
So bradford never hired me?

408
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:10,225
Well, then how'd I
end up at "Mode"?

409
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:20,969
I'm really nervous.

410
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:24,539
Are--are you
interviewing here, too?

411
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:26,474
Yes. I've always wanted
to work in fashion.

412
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:29,110
Oh. I like your poncho

413
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,347
Milan. Dolce & gabbana. Fall.

414
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:36,084
Marc, pull everything we
have on fabia cosmetics.

415
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:37,986
I want to thoroughly
humiliate daniel

416
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,189
At his first meeting
tomorrow morning.

417
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:43,325
Is that a bug in your teeth?

418
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,293
Oh, god. Oh, g-- ugh.

419
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,230
I think it's a poppy seed
from that bagel I ate.

420
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:51,233
You ate a bagel? Ugh.

421
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:58,740
My, what a beautiful,
clean smile you have.

422
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,542
Thank you.

423
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:03,478
Marc, you've just been
demoted to receptionist.

424
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,848
Pretty teeth, follow me.

425
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,721
So I was wilhelmina's assistant?

426
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:14,222
Mm-hmm.

427
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:15,724
How would that work?

428
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,659
I mean, we're completely different.

429
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,429
Well, maybe at first,
but you were a quick study.

430
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,431
No... awful...

431
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,734
No... should've been fired...

432
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:28,036
Hideous... and no.

433
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,038
Beth, do you understand

434
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:32,507
Why I can't even look
at you right now?

435
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,609
D-don't answer.

436
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:37,412
Betty, tell her.

437
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:41,216
Um...

438
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,854
There isn't much flow
from one look to another.

439
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,223
Betty, are you a
fashion person or not?

440
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:50,825
Tell her about the color!

441
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,727
Wilhelmina specifically
asked you for red.

442
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,696
What did you bring us?

443
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,898
No, not red, but burgundy,

444
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:59,501
Candy apple, scarlet, wine,

445
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:02,237
Crimson, blush, vermilion,

446
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:04,506
Puce, maroon.

447
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,541
Honestly, beth. Maroon?

448
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,544
Don't stop, betty.

449
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,814
The only true red in
this room is your face.

450
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:18,453
Betty, you are officially
my favorite person.

451
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,991
Oh, my god. I'm awful!

452
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,959
Beth can't help her red face.

453
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:26,661
She has rosacea.

454
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,064
Maybe I was just having a bad day?

455
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,032
Actually, that was a good day.

456
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:33,802
Yeah. You're kind of a beeyotch.

457
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:35,704
I've been trying to tell you.

458
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,735
Betty.

459
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:58,738
Mother meade. Look at you,
braving the sunlight

460
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:00,840
As if it won't burn your flesh.

461
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,775
Ahclever. I'm a vampire.

462
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:05,211
Well, excuse me if I
don't suck your blood

463
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:08,247
It's a little early to
consume that much booze.

464
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:10,283
Ha ha! Hah!

465
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:12,251
Everything is.

466
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:15,621
Claire and daniel hate me.
Wilhelmina and marc love me.

467
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:17,556
Oh, marc doesn't love you.

468
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:19,558
What? He couldn't have been nicer.

469
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:20,993
Well, to your face.

470
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:23,929
Honey, that's 'cause he's
terrified of you. Look.

471
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:26,399
It's like it's her life's mission

472
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,334
To make sure I never get promoted.

473
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:29,802
I hate her!

474
00:23:29,836 --> 00:23:34,140
I hate her, her and her stupid,
beautiful eth.

475
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:37,510
He hates me.

476
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:40,479
Well, it's not like he
was that crazy about you

477
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:43,382
In your other life.
Well, what about my family?

478
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,850
They seemed happy.

479
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:46,986
Yeah, about that...

480
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:50,356
Betty. Hi.

481
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,291
Uh...

482
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:54,593
Betty, I need to talk to you.

483
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:57,063
Um, this is really hard for me,

484
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:58,998
But, uh...

485
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:02,001
You can't be my maid of honor.

486
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:03,969
I mean, it's my big day,

487
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:07,406
And I just want to be the
center of attention for once.

488
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:08,941
Do you hate me?

489
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,409
No.

490
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:12,111
No, of course not.

491
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:15,481
I mean, if this is what
you and bobby want.

492
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:17,817
Bobby? Who's bobby?

493
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:19,719
Talercio. Your fianc?

494
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:23,522
That guy I had a crush
on in high school?

495
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:26,459
Come on. Don't tease me.

496
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,228
I'm lucky I found a
guy like abundio.

497
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:31,664
Abundio? You're
marrying the meat man?

498
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:33,299
Isn't he, like, 70?

499
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,900
He's 61!

500
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:36,969
Well, how does justin
feel about this?

501
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:38,971
Justin? Who is justin?

502
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,673
Your...

503
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:42,141
Son.

504
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:44,076
What is with you today, betty?

505
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,544
Huh?

506
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:48,481
I mean, you're my sister,
and I look up to you,

507
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:51,384
But why do you always
have to make me feel bad?!

508
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:53,227
Hilda!

509
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:55,988
Hilda. Hilda!

510
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:58,457
Why doesn't she know about justin?

511
00:24:58,492 --> 00:25:00,426
Well being the "Ugly sister"

512
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,528
Is a highly effective
method of birth control.

513
00:25:02,562 --> 00:25:04,038
Mm-hmm.

514
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:07,408
Thanks to your perfect smile,
justin never existed.

515
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:10,044
Ooh. Spooky.

516
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,414
You really are a monster. What?

517
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,717
The million dollar bra shoot.
Oh, like you don't know.

518
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:18,919
Daniel, wait!

519
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:20,888
The bra shoot? That's today?

520
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:23,891
Yeah, it's today,
or it was until you sabotaged it.

521
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:25,860
No. No, I didn't sabotage it.

522
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:28,229
The head publicist changed
the bra's schedule on you.

523
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:30,631
How did you know that?

524
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:33,033
I didn't.

525
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:35,970
Look, daniel, I can fix this.

526
00:25:36,004 --> 00:25:37,638
I know eve's assistant-- alison.

527
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:41,308
I can get her to help us.
Oh, just give it a rest.

528
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:42,894
How dumb do you think I am,

529
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,079
betty? I don't think
that you're dumb,

530
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:48,415
And I don'know what I did
to me you hate me, but...

531
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,620
I can assure you,
we are on the same team,

532
00:25:52,654 --> 00:25:55,322
And the last thing I am is a liar.

533
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:57,691
Oh, yeah?

534
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:06,000
I can't believe I ever
slept with you, betty.

535
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:10,604
Frankly, I can't believe
you slept with him either.

536
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:14,275
Betty, darling, what are you up to?

537
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,877
Are you changing the plan on me?

538
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:18,479
Which--which plan?

539
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:21,248
Oh, sorry. We have so
many plans together.

540
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:24,785
The, uh, "Ruin the bra shoot/
humiliate daniel" Plan.

541
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,554
Oh.

542
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:29,590
Um, so I-I am sabotaging daniel.

543
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:32,393
No, we're sabotaging daniel.

544
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:35,596
Unless you're going rogue on me?

545
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,098
Betty, we're in this together.

546
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:41,135
So just stick with the plan
and by this time next week,

547
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:44,772
You and I will be
co-editors-in-chief of "Mode."

548
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:55,470
I don't believe that I'm in
cahoots with wilhelmina. Mm.

549
00:26:55,504 --> 00:26:57,939
How could having perfect
teeth change me this much?

550
00:26:57,973 --> 00:27:00,408
Well, let me break it
down for you, b-bomb.

551
00:27:00,442 --> 00:27:02,810
All right, having
braces is hard, right?

552
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:06,314
People make fun of you,
and it hurts your feelings,

553
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:08,316
Which made you compassionate.

554
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,652
Pretty-teeth betty-
people fawned all over her,

555
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:12,587
And it went to her head.

556
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:14,722
What are you gonna do?

557
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,694
Betty?

558
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:22,065
Amanda!

559
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,602
Oh, hey, betty. Do you mind?

560
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:28,505
Yes, I mind!
You're in my office, and...

561
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,140
You're married!

562
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:33,010
And this is the last place
daniel would ever step foot,

563
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:36,546
Which is why you let ty-ty and I
have our private time in here.

564
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:39,683
Did you wanna saddle up?
It's a big desk. Mm.

565
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:41,852
Ew. Ew!

566
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:45,288
Hey, I never told derek jeter
about your side action,

567
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:48,792
So I expect you to keep your big,
sexy mouth shut!

568
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:51,595
Whoo! You eat lunch
on that desk? Ugh.

569
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,897
Ew. So amanda is
cheating on daniel...

570
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:55,899
Yeah, well--mm-hmm. In my office?

571
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,835
Well, daniel's not exactly
having a dry spell.

572
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,706
He's all over his assistant
right now in the copy room.

573
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,842
You wanna see? No! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no. I'm good.

574
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:08,912
, all right. So they're
both having affairs?

575
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:11,348
Wipe the judge-y off your face,
jeter cheater.

576
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:13,917
Betty, thank god.

577
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:18,588
I need $40,000...

578
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:21,491
Or I'm a dead man. My bookie says
if I don't cough up 40 large,

579
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:24,494
He'll break my legs. Bookie?!

580
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,136
You lost 40 grand gambling?

581
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,398
You know I've had
this mono on my back

582
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:29,800
Since we struck it rich.

583
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:33,103
-You gonna give me the cheddar or not?
-Papi!

584
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:37,607
It's not like I walk around
carrying thousands of...

585
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:39,594
Dollars in my purse.

586
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:42,363
There it is. Come to papi.

587
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:44,265
My god!

588
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,566
My god!

589
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:50,371
You're a good girl, mija.
Where would I be without you?

590
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,077
Well, adios, papi.

591
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,903
You have to stop doing that. Sorry.

592
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,881
Okay? Mm-hmm.

593
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:01,683
This is terrible.

594
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:04,118
Uh, I-I-it can't stay
this way. Mm-hmm.

595
00:29:04,153 --> 00:29:07,055
It has to change. I have to-
I have to change it back. Okay.

596
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:09,104
-I'm gonna start with daniel.
-All right.

597
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:11,361
I'm gonna go to the
guggenheim... -mm-hmm.

598
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:13,171
I'm gonna talk to eve... -okay.

599
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:14,246
And I'm gonna get him the

600
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:16,140
-million dollar bra back.
-Oh, good, a change.

601
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:19,277
But maybe think about keeping
the hair. I love the hair.

602
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:28,387
So you see, if you
could just please find

603
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:31,524
A-a teeny, tiny,
teensy bit more time

604
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:33,526
For us to shoot the bra,

605
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,162
Then we all win.
We will all be happy.

606
00:29:36,196 --> 00:29:38,131
All I heard was,
"Blah, blah, shrill.

607
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:41,067
Blah, blah, whine.
Blah, blah, beg."

608
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:43,636
And now I'm hungry
for mexican food.

609
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,205
Alison, get me some tacos!

610
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,207
Alison! Uh, I'm so sorry.

611
00:29:48,242 --> 00:29:51,010
There is a little
problem with the bra.

612
00:29:51,044 --> 00:29:53,513
It seems to be missing.

613
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,585
Okay, I am furious.

614
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,321
Alison, go punch yourself
in the neck. Officer!

615
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:05,391
Officer, what the hell is going on?

616
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,960
Officer!

617
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:30,750
Excuse me.

618
00:30:30,784 --> 00:30:31,918
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

619
00:30:31,952 --> 00:30:33,486
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

620
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,687
Excuse me.

621
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,355
Wilhelmina?

622
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,525
Slacking off on the
elliptical, darling?

623
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,995
-The bra-- what are you doing?
-I'm protecting my interest.

624
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,398
The moment I heard you
speaking to daniel,

625
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:48,034
I knew you were gonna
stab me in the back.

626
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:50,736
First, I was hurt,
but then I realized,

627
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:52,972
Of course you'd double-cross me.
You're betty.

628
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:55,074
Help, security!
She's stealing the bra!

629
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:56,876
What?!

630
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,912
No, I'm not! I'm not! Ow!

631
00:31:03,116 --> 00:31:05,017
You're a good girl, mija.

632
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:06,819
Jtin?

633
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:09,121
You sabotaged me!

634
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,939
I want my old life back.

635
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,289
Betty?

636
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:36,657
Hey, are you okay?

637
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:40,774
Daniel?

638
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:47,147
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
take it easy, take it easy.

639
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:49,716
Here you go.

640
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,455
I can see.

641
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:57,323
Uh... yeah.

642
00:31:57,358 --> 00:31:59,726
No, no. You don't understand. I...

643
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,361
My braces! They're back!

644
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:03,229
I got my wish!

645
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:05,932
Okay. Maybe we should get you
to the hospital. No, I'm fine.

646
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,886
I'm fine. Where's the bra?
Is it still here?

647
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:10,069
Yeah, but they're about
to take it to the airport.

648
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:13,239
No, there's still time.
We have to find eve.

649
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:14,674
A-bomb!

650
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:17,043
No, no! No, no, no. No, hey.
No, it's a nickname.

651
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:19,345
It's okay, it's all right.
Come on. Jeez!

652
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,348
Come on, b-bomb.
Eve's right over here.

653
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:24,818
Thank you so much for this.
No problem.

654
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:27,887
Hey, weren't you supposed to
get your braces off today?

655
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:29,889
Yeah, change of plans.

656
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:32,592
Drag! I know how much
you hate those things.

657
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:35,562
Well, aside from not being
able to eat corn on the cob,

658
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:37,730
Which I love, it's not so bad.

659
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:40,400
Where's the bra?
It's supposed to be here.

660
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:42,802
Well, it's not.

661
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:46,506
Oh, no.

662
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,076
No, no, no, no, no, no, , no.

663
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,862
Not this time. Excuse me.

664
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:11,564
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

665
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,067
Wilhelmina.

666
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:16,603
Little extra cardio
wouldn't hurt, darling.

667
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:19,172
The bra. Give it to me.
I don't know what you're talking about.

668
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,774
I'm not gonna let you
take it this time.

669
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:24,310
What the hell?!

670
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:26,079
Oh, my god.

671
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:27,547
Oh, my god.

672
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:30,083
I'm sorry. I t--I thought that--

673
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:32,485
That you were-- like before when--

674
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,288
I hit my head. I-I-I don't know.

675
00:33:35,322 --> 00:33:37,690
I, like, maybe I have
a concussion or--

676
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,926
Ow!

677
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,630
No, no, no, no! Don't pull it.
I'm stuck.

678
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:48,334
What is going on here?

679
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:51,237
I'll tell you what's going on.
Betty is a breast man.

680
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:53,172
I am not a breast man.

681
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:54,974
My braces are stuck to the bra.

682
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:57,210
She ripped my shirt clean off!

683
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:00,547
I'm standing here with
nothing but a bustier on.

684
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,649
It's humiliating! No, it's genius.

685
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:04,717
You're bringing back
underwear as outerwear.

686
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,920
Yes, that's what I'm doing.

687
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:09,455
It's a celebration
of the brassiere.

688
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,623
Whoo!

689
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:12,225
Brava, brava. Thank you.

690
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,527
Hey, betty.

691
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:17,530
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask
you to step away from the bra.

692
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:20,500
Sir, what don't you understand?

693
00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:22,147
My braces are stuck to the bra.

694
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:24,437
Well, that bra has to
be on a plane to cairo

695
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:27,173
Within the hour, whether
you're attached to it orot.

696
00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:30,443
Look, you're not shipping my
junior features editor to cairo.

697
00:34:30,477 --> 00:34:32,845
Look, there is one person
who can resolve this,

698
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,281
And it's eve. We have to find eve.

699
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:37,784
It's all about eve! Eve!

700
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:39,786
Eve! Don't go.

701
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,156
You gotta give us more
time to shoot the bra.

702
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,825
Yeah, we can charter a
plane to get it to cairo.

703
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:49,729
Look, if you could please just
look beyond this predicament

704
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:52,799
And--and--and look
into your heart...

705
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:10,650
Oh. Oh.

706
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:12,619
Uh, that was unexpected...

707
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,787
And a little painful.

708
00:35:17,424 --> 00:35:21,394
Well, since you've cheered me up,

709
00:35:21,428 --> 00:35:24,397
I will allow you to have
the bra for two hours.

710
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:26,265
Yes!

711
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,001
Not a minute longer.

712
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:33,306
Thank you. Yay! We did it! Ow, ow!

713
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,708
We just need to get your
braces off that thing.

714
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:39,545
-Is there an orthodontist here?
-Oh, yeah, that's likely.

715
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:42,081
Oh, me. That's me.
Excuse me. I got it.

716
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:45,318
Dr. Frankel?

717
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:54,605
Okay, here we go. Uh-oh.

718
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:56,606
What?

719
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,370
-Mm. It's more complicated than I thought.
-Oh, no.

720
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,838
I can't tell where the bra
ends and the braces begin.

721
00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:04,808
Well, we're gonna have to just
cut the bra apart then. Ohh!

722
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:07,310
Oh, for god sake, cut betty apart.

723
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:10,247
That bra is worth
more than her life.

724
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:12,816
Well, the only other choice I
have is to remove your braces.

725
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,651
Now?

726
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:17,053
-Like, right now?
-Now.

727
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:19,089
In front of everybody?

728
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,601
Do it.

729
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:34,604
All right. Let's do it.

730
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,340
Okay.

731
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,710
I really need you to hold
your mouth right there.

732
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:08,305
They're gone? They're off.

733
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:12,275
What?

734
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:15,712
Why are you looking at me like that?
Is something wrong?

735
00:37:15,746 --> 00:37:17,147
No, it looks...

736
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:19,849
Betty, you look great.

737
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:22,552
Yes, yes, congratulations, betty.

738
00:37:22,586 --> 00:37:25,221
Your smile will longer
induce seizures in children.

739
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:29,626
Now can we get this show
on the road, please?

740
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,461
Mm.

741
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:51,948
?Fa-fa-fashionista,

742
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:58,555
Hey, how do your teeth feel?

743
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:00,824
Weird. Fine. Naked.

744
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:03,526
Yeah. So I have to get home.

745
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:07,197
My family's planning something
for me to celebrate.

746
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,068
?Fa-fa-fashionista,

747
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,610
Amanda, hey.

748
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:22,579
Can we talk about us?

749
00:38:22,613 --> 00:38:25,548
Oh, well, you were
pretty clear before.

750
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:28,818
Well... i'm sorry, okay?

751
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:31,020
I didn't have a right to say that.

752
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:32,722
You can date whoever you want.

753
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:36,326
That's what "Casual" Means, right?

754
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,995
That's...

755
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:40,630
Thank you.

756
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:04,220
-Hey.
-Hey.

757
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:07,290
So all of those
things going wrong--

758
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:08,792
That wasn't you, was it?

759
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:10,827
Part of your plot to
take over the company,

760
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:12,228
Making daniel look bad?

761
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:14,764
Daniel can do that all by himself.

762
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:18,034
No, marc, this shoot is an a-cup.

763
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:20,036
My plan for the meades--

764
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,038
Double-d.

765
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:31,681
Hey. Did I tell you
my brilliant idea?

766
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:33,616
Million dollar thong.

767
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,352
What's with the face?
You don't think it'd be comfortable?

768
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:38,054
I saw you hugging daniel.

769
00:39:38,088 --> 00:39:41,891
Oh, cute. You're jealous.

770
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:44,594
Actually, daniel and I just
had a really great talk,

771
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:47,630
And he kind of gave
us his blessing. Wow.

772
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:50,333
So daniel meade gave
us his blessing.

773
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:53,369
How generous of him.
Okay, jealousy? Slightly less cute.

774
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:55,972
No, I am just saying that
the guy barely talks to me,

775
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:59,409
And now he thinks that I need
his permission to date you?

776
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:03,513
Yeah.

777
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:06,950
I think you guys still have
some issues to work out.

778
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:08,985
And you know what? So do I.

779
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:11,454
So why don't we take
a little time-out,

780
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:15,492
And we can all work on
our own stuff for now?

781
00:40:21,832 --> 00:40:24,434
Tyler? I don't believe
we've officially met.

782
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,870
I'm wilhelmina slater.

783
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,706
Looks like y could use a drink.

784
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,542
Yeah, I could. But I don't drink.

785
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:39,716
Okay, ready?

786
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,184
Yes.

787
00:40:41,218 --> 00:40:44,854
Surprise! Surprise!

788
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:46,956
Oh! Ahh!

789
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:48,191
Yay!

790
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,894
Yummy.

791
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:52,028
Aww.

792
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:54,130
Isn't that sweet?

793
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:56,533
So sweet.

794
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,535
Oh, can you get that, please? Yeah.

795
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:00,870
Thank you. Let's see.

796
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:03,262
Perfect. Okay, here.

797
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:05,906
Now you can ruin
your perfect teeth.
