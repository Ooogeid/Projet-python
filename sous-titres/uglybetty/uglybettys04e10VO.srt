1
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:08,224
<i>(breathily) dr. Farkas.</i>

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,427
<i>Dr. Farkas.</i>

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,785
<i>Can you please stop?</i>

4
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:16,375
(whirring)
dr. Farkas, can you stop that, please?

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,665
Sorry. It's getting in my nose.

6
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:20,806
Oh. (chuckles) I'm sorry.

7
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:25,009
I, uh, God, you look great.

8
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,753
Oh. Thanks. (chuckles)

9
00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:29,289
What's--what's different about you?
Oh, I don't know.

10
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,251
Small changes no bangs. New glasses.
Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:34,473
Better to see me with.
(chuckles)

12
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:36,970
Uh, are you still working
at the magazine?

13
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:40,420
Yep. But I'm not an assistant
anymore. I'm an editor.

14
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:43,869
Good for you. That's--that's great.
Mm.

15
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,388
And in case you're wondering,

16
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:48,073
I... Am recently single.

17
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,741
Oh. I wasn't wondering,

18
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:52,344
But, um, I'm glad to know it.

19
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,709
Well, I'm glad you're glad.

20
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,627
(chair whirring)

21
00:00:57,288 --> 00:00:59,301
Okay, uh,
since it's out there, um,

22
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,148
What about dinner tonight?

23
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:02,915
I'm a professional.

24
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:05,830
I don't get grossed out
by food caught in braces.

25
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,224
That's very generous of you,

26
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:10,735
But, um, I have a boyfriend.

27
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:12,539
Oh.

28
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:16,903
Well, I, uh, kind of wish
you said that before. (chuckles)

29
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:18,962
I feel like an idiot.

30
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,196
No. Come on, d-don't. I--I'm flattered.

31
00:01:22,196 --> 00:01:24,718
I hope so because I'm--I'm doing great,

32
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,407
Pulling in the high five figures--

33
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:29,701
Well, mid fives with a little
creative accounting, but...

34
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:32,735
Can your new boyfriend
compete with that?

35
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:36,528
He's pretty comfortable. So when
are my braces coming off?

36
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:38,490
Maybe when you lose the rich guy. (laughs)

37
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,271
I'm kidding.
I don't know. Soon-ish.

38
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,462
L--but is it--is it serious
between you two?

39
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:44,781
Yeah, it's serious.

40
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,266
Um, "soon-ish"?
What does that mean?

41
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:51,428
You know, betty, I can't--
I can't play this game anymore,

42
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:52,969
So I'm--I'm gonna need you to...

43
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:54,982
(clears throat)
find a new orthodontist.

44
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,684
Or--or maybe your--your
boyfriend can pry them off

45
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,554
With all of his money.

46
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:08,388
(birds chirping)

47
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:00,720
(grunts)
(yawns)

48
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,396
Oh, I forgot to tell you what
happened in the copy room today.

49
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:06,619
The toner exploded
all over marc.

50
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,882
I know. I was there, remember?

51
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:11,938
We're together all the time,
every day.

52
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:14,771
It's great, isn't it?

53
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:15,713
Yeah.

54
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:18,095
Night.

55
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:19,347
Good night. Mm.

56
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:23,527
(sighs)

57
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,695
Hey! Look who stayed here
last night.

58
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,048
Haven't seen you in ages.

59
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,752
Well, I thought it would be nice

60
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:36,315
For matt and I to do
our own thing for a change.

61
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:39,451
These were just dropped off.
Oh!

62
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:40,951
Ooh.
Let's see who they're from.

63
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,030
<i>(matt, singsongy)
miss you much.</i>

64
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,348
Oh! They're from matt.
(singsongy) he's been
laying it on thick lately.

65
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:51,434
<i>No, he hasn't.
He's just been sweet, but...
Miss you much. Miss you much.
Miss you much.</i>

66
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,196
Annoying.
I didn't say that.

67
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:56,050
We've just been spending
a lot of time together.

68
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,392
Watch out, because
I have seen this before.

69
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:01,081
Couples start out
all lovey-dovey,

70
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:02,270
Attached at the hip.

71
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,690
And then as time goes by, they
get totally sick of each other.

72
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,116
Guys, matt and I are
not sick of each other.

73
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:12,416
<i>Miss you much. Miss you much.
Miss you much.</i>

74
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,138
<i>Miss you mu--</i>

75
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:16,213
I'm a little sick of that.

76
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:19,603
Yeah, well, see? It's the little
things that'll get you.

77
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:22,082
One day matt is saying,
"miss you much!"

78
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:26,201
And the next day, pop! Pop!
Murder/suicide.

79
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:27,424
I have to go.

80
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:29,574
I love you.

81
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:32,963
(lowers voice) so, hilda,

82
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:36,531
What's going on with your, um, you know?
(door opens and closes)

83
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:38,983
You decided to have
the baby.

84
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:40,733
<i>You gotta tell papi
and justin some time.</i>

85
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,737
And what about bobby? He's the father.

86
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,593
I don't even know if he should know.

87
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:48,249
I'm just saying,
all those rumors in high school

88
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:49,984
About his family
being connected--

89
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,761
It's one thing to date a bad y.

90
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:56,998
It is another thing to raise a kid with one.
That was a rumor 15 years ago.

91
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:02,112
Bobby is a sweet guy underneath
all of that macho stuff.

92
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:04,099
Maybe you should just spend
a little bit more time with him,

93
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,533
Get to know him.
(sighs)

94
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,538
It's done. Connor's agreed
to give me account numbers,

95
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:13,884
And you'll have
your money back.

96
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:16,555
This is fantastic.
As soon as we buy hartley out,

97
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:19,303
I can guarantee you'll return
to "mode" as co-editor-in-chief

98
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,823
With a 50% stake in the company.
(flames whoosh)

99
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:24,828
Mm, not so fast. There's still
one remaining issue.

100
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:27,231
I will not come back to run
the magazine with you

101
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:30,733
As long as this woman
is creative director.

102
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:33,875
Well, what can I do?
Denise has a 4-year contract.

103
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,879
How is that possible?

104
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:37,982
This woman knows absolutely
nothing about fashion.

105
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,250
Look what she's wearing--
straight out of last month's

106
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,655
"lucky" magazine, page 46.
She actually thinks emporio armani

107
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,559
And giorgio armani
are brothers.

108
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,096
Ha!
Ha!

109
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,911
(sighs)

110
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:51,278
Well, maybe that's why she
hasn't given an interview yet.

111
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:52,676
She's afraid
if she opens her mouth,

112
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,317
She'll make
a complete fool of herself.

113
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:59,351
If only we knew someone who
had connections to the media.

114
00:05:59,386 --> 00:06:01,220
Yeah, I know.

115
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,495
Oh. Yeah, yeah, right.

116
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,469
(indistinct conversations)

117
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:13,836
I missed you last night.

118
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:17,562
Mm. I know. I got
the flowers and the card.

119
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,784
That was very sweet.
Thank you.

120
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:20,688
Guess what?

121
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,764
I scored us two tickets
to the rangers game tonight.

122
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:26,152
First thousand fans
get a commemorative puck.

123
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,140
No, I can't. I have that
late photo shoot downtown.

124
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:30,043
Oh.

125
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:33,946
But go anyway. Go without me.
You can't miss puck night.

126
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:35,993
It won't be much fun without you.
Come on.

127
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:38,317
Someone around here will want
to go to a hockey game.
(chuckles)

128
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:42,689
Okay, maybe not.

129
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,809
But go.
Bring me back a puck.

130
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:46,876
Well, I guess I'll, uh...

131
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,655
(singsongy)
miss you much.

132
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:52,279
Have fun.

133
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:55,389
(indistinct conversations)

134
00:06:57,537 --> 00:06:58,870
(camera shutter clicks)
ohh!

135
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:01,610
<i>What are you doing?
I'm documenting your change.</i>

136
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,240
My what?
Okay, you have been daniel's
assistant for a week now,

137
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,872
And I can already see it
happening right there.

138
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:11,646
I missed one waxing appointment. So what?
So what?

139
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:14,146
I have taken your picture
every single day this week.

140
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:16,389
Look.
(beeping)

141
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:19,092
I was trying something.

142
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:21,861
Oh, my god! (screams) oh, my god.
Spooky.

143
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:24,497
You're trans-mexi-fying
right before our eyes.

144
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,931
(door open)

145
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:28,066
Thank you so much
for the ride, bobby.

146
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:30,035
It's elizabeth taylor week
on lifetime...

147
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,605
(door closes)
and I could not miss "butterfield 8."

148
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:34,269
She plays a prostitute who has
to pay for her sins, so yeah.

149
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:36,271
Hi!
(justin) hi.

150
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,301
Kid was screaming at me
to run every red light.

151
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:42,103
I almost clipped a nun.
Oh! (chuckles) thank you for dropping him off.

152
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:45,644
Yeah, no problem.
(train rattling in distance)

153
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:48,552
Hey.

154
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:49,964
What's up?

155
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:52,406
Um, I know that we haven't
had, uh, a lot of chances

156
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:56,728
To talk lately, so I was
wondering if maybe you wanted

157
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:59,352
To grab a cup of coffee or something.
(chuckles) I knew it.

158
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:02,184
You knew what?
Justin told me you and archie split.

159
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:03,950
It's 'cause of me, right?

160
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,256
Wrong.
Come on. I mean, I definitely
had something to do with it.

161
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:10,269
<i>No, you definitely
had nothing to do with it.</i>

162
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,173
You know, the more you
tell me that it didn't,

163
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:15,716
The more I know it did.
Oh, my god. I'm not gonna argue
with you about it, bobby.

164
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:18,835
Do you want to have coffee or not?
Yeah, all right. Coffee sounds fun.

165
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:20,726
I'm always up
for a little fun with you.

166
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:24,132
<i>No fun. Just coffee.</i>

167
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:25,479
Okay, okay.

168
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,963
Nobody's gonna have any fun.
We'll just drink coffee.

169
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:29,310
We don't even have to talk.
Good.

170
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,712
(door closes)

171
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,228
So is denise still
in the concept meeting?

172
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:37,031
It should be breaking up--
oh, my god.

173
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:38,179
What's--
back!

174
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,035
What is wrong?

175
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:42,845
My one-night stand
from the bahamas--troy.

176
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:45,558
He works at "mode"!
Wow. That must be awkward.

177
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:48,538
Uh, how long do we have
to stay like this?

178
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,431
Oh, sorry. (gasps)

179
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:54,203
J-- I didn't think
he'd be back so soon.

180
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:56,538
His passport accidentall
ended up in my bag--

181
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,629
Completely innocent,
fully deniable mistake,

182
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:01,453
But now it's like
he's some sort of stalker.

183
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,756
I knew that was him
at my gym and my bank

184
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:06,417
And my backup gym and my--
know what? You're on your own.

185
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,901
It's time to start
operation "get rid of denise."

186
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:10,909
Denise, hey, good news.

187
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:14,834
I got us an interview on "fashion buzz" tomorrow.
Really? Tomorrow?

188
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:15,831
Kinda has to be.

189
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:20,142
Do you know how hard it is to get on "fashion buzz"?
Aren't you guys on that, like, every day?

190
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,706
Well... (clearthroat)
I know it seems that way.

191
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:24,875
Uh, well, I just wish I had
more time to prepare.

192
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,673
Oh, come on.
You're gonna do great.

193
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:28,684
Besides, suzuki is no diane sawyer.

194
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:31,555
Okay.

195
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:47,192
...Sort of distracting, so if we
could just do a couple frames

196
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,147
Without it so we have some options--aah!

197
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,166
Guess who?

198
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:52,499
Matt?

199
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,420
Surprise!

200
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,229
Hey! What are you doing here?

201
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,201
What are you doing here? What
happened to the rangers game,

202
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:01,442
Commemorative puck night?
I figured, puck it. We already
spent one night apart.

203
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:04,245
I couldn't stand being apart
one more minute.

204
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:05,480
(singsongy)
missed you much.

205
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:08,308
Okay.

206
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,255
Ohh.

207
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:15,025
(camera shutter clicks)

208
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:18,814
Ugh. You make me puke.

209
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:21,739
(singsongy) "miss you much!
Miss you much!"

210
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,708
(normal voice)
how can you miss me much

211
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:27,714
When we spend every day
and every night together?!

212
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,689
(slurring) you've sucked the life outta me!

213
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:34,226
I had dreams before I met you!

214
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:36,341
You want to know
what my dream is?!

215
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:38,136
That you drop dead

216
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:41,005
Maybe then
I can miss you much!

217
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,690
(glass shatters, flames whoosh)

218
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,790
(gasps)

219
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,141
Missed you much, too.

220

www.addic7ed.com

222
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,423
So your problem is

223
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:07,088
Your boyfriend w
to spend time with you?
(lowers voice) shh, no.

224
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:11,172
<i>My problem is he wants to
spend all of his time with me.</i>

225
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:13,978
I feel like we're gonna
start resenting each other.

226
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:16,133
Doesn't he have
anything else going on?

227
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,575
<i>Well, he used to.</i>

228
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:20,309
I mean, he used to be passionate
about all sorts of things--

229
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,466
Sports, painting,
and he was really good.

230
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,364
I mean, look at this.

231
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:27,296
Matt did that?
Yeah!

232
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:29,275
Wow, it's pretty good.
I know!

233
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,730
Hey, look at you in the window.

234
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,060
But why is your hand all blurry?
'cause I'm waving.

235
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:38,229
Cute.
He loved painting,
but when he came to "mode,"

236
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:40,021
He just let it go.

237
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:42,498
Well, maybe you can inspire him,

238
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:43,666
You know,
get him back into it again.

239
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,254
Hmm. That's a really good idea.

240
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:49,489
You know what? That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

241
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:52,175
I'm gonna give him back his passion.

242
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,410
(gasps)
hi!

243
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,569
Aah...

244
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:04,612
We haven't had a chance
to talk since I got back.

245
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:06,184
I know.

246
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,936
We haven't.

247
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,871
(singsongy) okay, bye!

248
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:13,564
Just promise me you'll keep
this Saturday night open.

249
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:14,839
My parents are coming
down from boston,

250
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,688
And they are dying to meet
my first boyfriend.
Mercy.

251
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:19,782
Actually,
u're my first everything.

252
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,566
<i>Oh. Ohh.</i>

253
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,895
I'm your first?

254
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:25,995
Aren't you, like, 40?

255
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,227
(lowers voice)
you were so worth the wait.

256
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:34,959
(banging)

257
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,607
(knock on door)

258
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:39,468
Look, I know we were supposed
to meet at the coffee shop,

259
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,157
All right? But I, uh,
I got you a little gift.

260
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:42,969
(chuckles)

261
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:50,849
What the hell?!

262
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:54,180
Look, I saw this,
and I thought of justin.

263
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,067
He can watch "butterfield 8" or whatever

264
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,696
On a big screen tv. It's better.
This is--is too much.

265
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,954
(chuckles) don't worry about it.
I-I got a good deal on it.

266
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:03,435
A deal. What kind of a deal--

267
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:05,999
Like a disappeared from
a loading dock kind of a deal?

268
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,647
Oh, hey. What kind of thing
is that to say?

269
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:12,333
Most people--they would say,
"hey, thank you."

270
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:15,639
So you gonna give me one?

271
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:19,029
(train rattling in distance)
thank you.

272
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,542
(grunts) unh-unh.
No, that sounded like it hurt.

273
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:24,153
Give me another one.
Come on.

274
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:26,067
Thank you.

275
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:30,028
No, I don't buy it. We're
gonna have to work on that.
(chuckles)

276
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,565
<i>So I would love to get
your perspective on this,</i>

277
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:36,421
Denise ludwig, new creative
force here at "mode."

278
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:38,318
Everybody's talking
about this "recession"

279
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,850
And how no one can
afford a manicure.

280
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,206
So why do people keep spending $500

281
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:45,740
On the perfect pair of jeans?

282
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:49,002
Suzuki, I love that question,

283
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:50,827
And no one can answer that better

284
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:53,625
Than my favorite designer
roberto dipaolo himself.

285
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,970
"fashion is a dream
you put on in the morning."

286
00:13:58,278 --> 00:13:59,604
Can't live without a dream,
suzuki.

287
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:01,610
I think that says it all.

288
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,009
I shall no longer worry about
the fate of this magazine.

289
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,478
Cut.

290
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:10,271
Mama needs some powder.

291
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,754
Well, we didn't totally
stink up the joint.

292
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:21,287
I mean, you were amazing.

293
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,982
I had no idea you knew
so much about fashion.

294
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:25,884
(lowers voice) oh, I don't.

295
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:29,574
I paid some freshman
at f.I.T. Like 40 bucks

296
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:32,786
To pull some quotes. I think
he got that one from "lucky."

297
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:35,812
Honestly, I just--I can't
get my head arou fashion.

298
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:39,194
You can't?
No. It's just dumb. But you know what?

299
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:42,120
It doesn't even matter.
I don't care if it's donna karan

300
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,822
Or dog food.
It's just something to sell.

301
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:48,162
Now that suzuki is he gay?

302
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,088
Because I thought I saw him
sneaking a peek at my snookie.

303
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:06,063
(man) where's this go?
Excuse me.

304
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:10,066
In the next room with the other paintings. Yes?
Um, I just read about

305
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,959
Your upcoming emerging artists showcase,

306
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,620
And I was wondering
if you'd be interested

307
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,268
In featuring an up and coming painter?
What have you done?

308
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:19,410
Oh, me? No, nothing.
I'm talking about my boyfriend.

309
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,028
He's a painter, and he's very good.

310
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:25,152
He painted this.
Interesting.

311
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:27,657
So this was painted by your lover.
My boyfriend.

312
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:31,191
Boyfriend? Boring.

313
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,094
Well, it's simple.

314
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:34,620
Nice use of perspective.

315
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,930
What's this, uh, smudge?

316
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,625
Oh, that's me waving.

317
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:42,495
I'm beginning
to see the resemblance.

318
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,412
Oh, he's quite good, your lover.

319
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,228
Yes, my boyfriend is great,

320
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:49,243
And this showcase is perfect for him.

321
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:51,266
He's emerging, he's an artist,

322
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:53,532
And it's exactly the lift
he could use right now.

323
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:57,167
Well, unfortunately,
I can't commit to anything

324
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,456
By just one painting.

325
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,366
Oh, no, he has dens more.

326
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:06,276
They're in his storage unit. I could take you there.
All right, I'll have a look.

327
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:10,447
But I'm warning you--
your lover better be good.

328
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,446
Oh, my lover is good...

329
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:14,736
At painting.

330
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,353
<i>It's the same thing with these
overpriced rags, you know?</i>

331
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:25,721
<i>I don't care if it's
donna karan or dog food,</i>

332
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:30,104
<i>It's just something to sell.
In light of denise ludwig's
blasphemous interview,</i>

333
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:32,702
<i>I've been pumping my contacts
at "mode" for info.</i>

334
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:34,762
<i>Late word into
the "fashion buzz" newsroom</i>

335
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:37,089
<i>Is denise has resigned
from her post</i>

336
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,185
<i>And is returning
to her hollywood roots</i>

337

338

This is a category 5
crap storm.

339
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:47,738
Well, fortunately,
wilhelmina is available

340
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:50,407
To step right back in
to her old job.

341
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:51,857
Over my dead body.

342
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,493
I couldn't have described
your body better, claire.

343
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:57,614
What is she doing here?
We are not hiring her back.

344
00:16:57,614 --> 00:16:59,997
Actually, cal,
we don't need your vote anymore.

345
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:03,058
That's right. The stolen meade
money has been recovered.

346
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:04,328
It has?

347
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:07,230
We can cut you a check for
your investment plus interest

348
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,672
By the end of business today.
Wait a minute.

349
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:13,015
You two are partners
in this, aren't you?

350
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:15,416
You set up that denise video,
and now you're trying

351
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,568
To push cal out.
I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up.

352
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:21,573
You don't tell me when to leave.
No one does.

353
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:25,035
Well, I was hoping you weren't
gonna make this difficult.

354
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,763
You don't know
what difficult is.

355
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,587
But you might learn yet.

356
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,150
Mom--
I don't want to hear it.

357
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,266
You choose this woman over family?

358
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,749
I think that speaks volumes.

359
00:17:44,337 --> 00:17:46,231
(sighs)

360
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:49,402
I give you one simple task.

361
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:51,637
Why am I so surprised
you frakked it up?

362
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,638
You let me deal with my mother.

363
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,473
We get her on our side,
she'll convince cal to leave.

364
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:02,410
Thanks again for coming
to see matt's work.

365
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,712
A show would be so amazing,

366
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:09,018
Give him the focus he needs.

367
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,554
Um, frances?

368
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:13,459
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

369
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,426
<i>My focus was drifting
because these paintings</i>

370
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,568
Just aren't holding it.

371
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:20,593
Really?
Well, he's competent enough,

372
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:23,962
But they're so uninspired.
He hasn't found his voice yet.

373
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:26,109
Well, no, I mean, keep looking.

374
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:30,467
His voice has to be in here somewhere.
(matt humming)

375
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:34,029
That's matt. Um, I really want
to keep this a surprise,

376
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,262
So can you just be quiet?
I'll be right back.

377
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:37,323
(continues humming)

378
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,618
Hey, hey, hey.
What--what are you doing here?

379
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:46,210
I followed you.
What are you doing here?

380
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,422
I forgot my cell. Wait,
how could you have followed me--

381
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:51,485
I missed you much!
Let's go to lunch.

382
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:52,741
Great.

383
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:55,765
Uh, get your cell phone.
Uh--

384
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:56,908
What are you gonna do
if I call you?

385
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:58,568
Uh, why wod you
have to call me if you--

386
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:00,780
<i>Go, go!
Okay.</i>

387
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,744
(keys jangle)

388
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,149
Did you find anything?

389
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,034
Yes, the ones in the back
are aming--

390
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:15,497
So full of passion
and drama!

391
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:17,866
I think we have
an emerging artist here.

392
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,479
Great. Awesome.
Take whatever you want.

393
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:22,578
We can figure out the details
later. Thank you so much!
Thank you for what?

394
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,698
Thank you so much

395
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,056
For... Always being hungry
when I am.

396
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,327
We're so in tune.
I'm starving. Let's go.

397
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:35,477
Ugh, this is unacceptable, marc.

398
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:38,230
I can't wait for dum-dum
to make things happen for me.

399
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,483
We have to put pressure on claire.
(cell phone ringing)

400
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:41,095
Oh! (snorts)

401
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,788
It's dum-dum-- uh, I mean daniel.

402
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:47,180
Probably misplaced
his beard comb again.

403
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,796
Oh, yes, I forgot you're
daniel's bootlick now.

404
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:54,589
<i>Go ahead. I'll figure out a way to do it myself.
Yes, claire meade was in south dakota.</i>

405
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:56,100
I arranged for the travel myself.

406
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,700
<i>Victoria hartley told you
about south dakota?</i>

407
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,231
<i>She told me her husband
got you pregnant.</i>

408
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:10,955
<i>(woman speaking spanish)</i>

409
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:15,128
<i>Mija, this is amazing.</i>

410
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:17,433
There is a picture in the picture.

411
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:20,324
Where did this come from?
Bobby stopped by earlier.

412
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:24,148
Bobby talercio gave us this tv?
Great. It's probably stolen.

413
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:27,089
Did you get a receipt?
Why do we even have to go there?

414
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,535
You know his family.
They're corrupt.

415
00:20:29,535 --> 00:20:32,497
That is a vicious rumor.
Nobody was ever convicted.

416
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,698
You know, bobby told me over coffee--
wait, wait, wait. You had coffee with him?

417
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:37,293
Yeah, yesterday.
It's no big deal.

418
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:39,859
It is a big deal. I don't want
you hanging out with him.

419
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:42,669
Well, you can't tell me who
I can and can't hang out with.

420
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:46,196
I'm not 17 years old, you know.
Then stop acting like it.

421
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:49,966
<i>It's like you're making the same
mistakes all over again.
Ay, papi, enough.</i>

422
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,527
No, no, no. First,
you break up with archie,

423
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:56,061
And now you're hangin' out with bobby.
What's wrong with bobby?

424
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:59,352
He's a thug. He always was
and he always will be.

425
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:04,589
(sighs)

426
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,389
(gasps)

427
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:18,356
(gasps)

428
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,782
Whoa.

429
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:26,937
(gasps)

430
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,395
(laughing)

431
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:44,850
Oh!

432
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,129
(grunts)

433
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,166
Ooh!

434
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:47,803
Hello, dear.

435
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:54,977
Let's have a little chat, shall we?

436
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,771
What was claire doing
in south dakota?

437
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:04,113
Ow. You're hurting me.
I'm not touching you.

438
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:07,751
. Well, how would I know what
she's doing in south dakota?

439
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:10,549
I don't even know where that country is.
Look at me.

440
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:13,945
No. Marc told me never to
look you directly in the eye.

441
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:17,621
Amanda...
It--it is amanda, right?

442
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:18,227
Yeah.

443
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:19,655
Are you happy here?

444
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:22,904
Answering phones,
getting coffee--

445
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:25,073
Don't you want more
out of life?

446
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:26,881
Actually, I do want
to do more someday,

447
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:29,474
You know, like, in fashion.
I could make that happen.

448
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,149
You could?
Of course.

449
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,259
I may not be in charge now,
but I will be again,

450
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,339
And I could make
your dreams come true.

451
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:39,589
Or I could keep you stuck
behind that reception desk

452
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:41,558
Until your skin
turns the texture

453
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:43,623
Of a weathered louis vuitton
overnight bag.

454
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:49,070
So tell me, what was claire
doing in south dakota?

455
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:58,397
I won't tell you. I promised
mrs. Meade I'd keep her secret.

456
00:22:58,397 --> 00:23:02,003
It's a pity,
because you're the kind of woman

457
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:05,416
That would appreciate
the value of accessorizing.

458
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,238
It pulls
the whole outfit together.

459
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:08,178
(gasps)

460
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:13,752
Damn you.

461
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:21,639
I am not having this
conversation with you again.

462
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:23,359
Why are you still
defending him?

463
00:23:23,642 --> 00:23:26,543
This company is our legacy.
You're letting him destroy it.

464
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:29,512
I mean, all he cares about is his bottom line.
Just admit it, daniel.

465
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:31,747
You don't like that cal
and I are sleeping together.

466
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:34,150
Oh, mom.
And you're letting your emotions
cloud your judgment.

467
00:23:34,184 --> 00:23:36,886
My judgment? You're the one
who's thinking with your...

468
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,454
Not with your brain.

469
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:42,255
Cal hartley is
a ruthless, amoral monster.

470
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:45,924
That is not true. I have
known that man for 30 years.

471
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,827
He's a good man,
and he cares about this company,

472
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,729
And he cares about me.

473
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,533
After everything
I've been through,

474
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,934
I would have hoped
that you would allow me

475
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,670
This little bit of happiness.

476
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:09,912
Did you get this from betty?
"surprise showing of new work

477
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:12,914
From emerging artist
matt hartley."

478
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,717
(groans) my lunch is
emerging from my stomach.

479
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:18,185
(chuckles) we're totally
going though, right?

480
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,955
You're going to matt's opening?

481
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,456
Huh.

482
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:24,800
Could be our second date.

483
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,607
I love you.
Is it too early to say that?

484
00:24:29,607 --> 00:24:31,652
You know what?
I don't care.

485
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:34,557
You're my boyfriend,
and I... Love you.

486
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,501
(grunts)

487
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,125
(clears throat)

488
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:48,201
(Owers voice)
okay, at is up with that?

489
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,194
If I'd known he was
a guh-virgin,

490
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:52,054
I never would have taken
his delicate flower.

491
00:24:52,054 --> 00:24:55,365
This is too much responsibility.
I have to dump him.
No!

492
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:58,037
He's imprinted on you
like a gay duckling.

493
00:24:58,037 --> 00:25:00,592
If you don't wean him off you
slowly, he'll die.

494
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,285
You're right.
Best pot stickers in new york.

495
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:08,084
I know. I told you.

496
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:12,362
Hey, look at this--
"emerging artists."

497
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:13,164
Let's check it out.

498
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:16,093
"emerging artists"?
Let's go back to my place.

499
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:18,185
Cheesy popcorn and a movie.
This will be better.

500
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:21,916
Better than cheesy popcorn?
I doubt it.
It'll be close. Come on.

501
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:24,833
All right, if it's what you
want, I'll do it for you.

502
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:27,614
No, matt.
This is not about me.

503
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:33,897
(all) surprise

504
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:35,706
(both chuckle)

505
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:58,973
These are my paintings.

506
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,397
These are your paintings?
What is this? What did you do?

507
00:26:01,397 --> 00:26:04,779
<i>What did you do?
Matt, these are--</i>

508
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:05,784
Marvelous!

509
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:09,490
You must be the artist.
You know, I-I think there's been some--

510
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,390
I've gotta be honest with you.
When I first saw your work, meh.

511
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:15,947
<i>But then I saw these pieces--</i>

512
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:19,079
The texture, the depth--

513
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,328
The barely concealed hostility.

514
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:26,019
You've got yourself
quite a little muse here.

515
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,539
Come. People are dying
to meet you,

516
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:31,229
And not just people...
(singsongy) people!

517
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,229
Betty.

518
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:41,125
(sighs)

519
00:26:43,242 --> 00:26:47,587
<i>Mija, I... I don't know what to say.
Hey, I do. The dude can paint!</i>

520
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:50,486
I did this so that matt would be
passionate about his art.

521
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:52,801
But all his art is about me.

522
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:55,148
Well, that's not true.

523
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:57,127
Okay, there is a theme,

524
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:59,969
But look, there's a nice
landscape over here

525
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:02,525
With trees and snow.

526
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:05,244
And look.
I don't see you here.

527
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:07,580
Why do all the deers
have braces?

528
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,326
(betty) ugh.

529
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:10,366
I have to go find matt.

530
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:14,969
I'm gonna go have a pomatini.

531
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:16,691
Why don't you ask him
about the receipt?

532
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:20,483
Receipt?
What's he talking about?

533
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:22,827
Oh, he worries, you know?

534
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:25,783
About the tv,
like if it breaks or something,

535
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:27,436
And we have to return it.
(chuckles)

536
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:29,165
There's a receipt, right?

537
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:32,495
Don't worry
about the receipt, okay?

538
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:34,128
Anything goes wrong with the tv,
I'll get you a new one.

539
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:35,568
I'm gonna get a drink.

540
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:41,484
I love it.

541
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:44,883
It reminds me
of late peria drusenferd.

542
00:27:44,883 --> 00:27:47,393
Oh.
Oh, french is so beautiful.

543
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:49,045
<i>That was english.
Oui.</i>

544
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,644
Hey, betty. Great show.
(gasps)

545
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,696
Hey, guys, have you seen matt?

546
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:57,998
The real matt or the matt
who's a human sacrifice

547
00:27:57,998 --> 00:28:01,659
And you're an aztec warrior
cutting out his heart?
Or the matt who's an astronaut

548
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:03,882
And you're an alien embr
bursting out of his chest?
(snickers)

549
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,906
Okay, I get it. What is that?

550
00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:09,287
Oh, this? I bought it.

551
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,185
I don't know why,

552
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:13,172
But it just kind of
spoke to me.

553
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:17,273
(camera shutter clicks)
excuse me.

554
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:19,850
(cell phone beeps)
ugh.

555
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:22,658
Troy, where are you?

556
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:25,528
Diyou follow the directions
I gave you? Uh-huh.

557
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:28,031
Connecticut. Great.

558
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:30,333
(singsongy)
keep going. You're almost here.

559
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,067
(beep)
poor, poor little duckling.

560
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:33,669
Shut up.

561
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:39,240
We should be going. We don't
want to miss matt's big night.

562
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:42,777
You want to explain this to me?

563
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:49,082
Where did you get this?
It doesn't matter.

564
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:52,084
You told me you got rid of the baby.

565
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,186
And I did,

566
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:56,054
Just not the way we discussed.

567
00:28:56,089 --> 00:28:58,590
You lied to me.
I'm sorry.

568
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:00,525
I should have told you.

569
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,093
But everything's fine.
I-I went to south dakota.

570
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:05,295
He's doing very well.

571
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,629
What? You saw him?

572
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,031
Tell me he doesn't know
I'm the father.

573
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,600
No, he doesn't. Wh-wh-wh-why
would you ask me that?

574
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:15,436
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's
because I spent my entire life

575
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,938
Building my business
and my career,

576
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:20,840
And now you tell me there's
some little bastard out there

577
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:24,276
Who could just waltz in here
and demand his cut!
Cal, he's our son.

578
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,678
<i>I already have a son!</i>

579
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:28,447
This is... A fire

580
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:31,450
That I'm gonna have to piss on
before I get burned.

581
00:29:31,484 --> 00:29:34,013
I just--claire,
what were you thinking,

582
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,586
That you would just go out

583
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,028
And find our long lost little boy

584
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:38,868
And we'd wind up
happily ever after? Is that it?

585
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:45,829
You couldn't have
just had the abortion?

586
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:55,354
(indistinct conversations)

587
00:29:56,954 --> 00:29:58,362
Matt!

588
00:29:58,362 --> 00:30:01,498
Do you know how humiliated I am?

589
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:03,822
These paintings
are my private thoughts.

590
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:05,855
No one was supposed to see them.
They make me look crazy.

591
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:08,579
Well, they make me
look like a monster.

592
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:13,258
Is this really how you feel about me?
I painted most of them when we were broken up.

593
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:16,650
There are good ones, too.
Those aren't selling for quite
as much. There's a bidding war

594
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,311
On the one of me climbing
the empire state building,

595
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:21,720
Holding you in my giant, hairy hand.
Look, it is just an outlet, betty.

596
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,451
What, you've never felt angry
with me?

597
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:29,354
Never secretly thought I was acting like a jerk?
No! I mean, yes, of course, everyone feels that,

598
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:32,329
But we don't hang it in a gallery.
I didn't hang them in a gallery. You did.

599
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:38,193
Why did you do this?
Because I... I wanted to surprise you.

600
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:41,210
I wanted to help you feel
passionate about something.

601
00:30:41,244 --> 00:30:44,179
I feel passionate...
About us.

602
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:45,613
No, matt,

603
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:48,082
About something other than us.

604
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:51,318
We spend every minute
of every day together.

605
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:53,954
We wake up together.
We go to work together.

606
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:56,923
We eat together.
We brush our teeth together.

607
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:59,325
I'm sorry you feel smothered
by our relationship.

608
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,897
No, that's what I'm saying.
And maybe the problem isn't
that I have too much passion,

609
00:31:01,897 --> 00:31:03,965
It's that
you don't feel enough.

610
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:11,637
(door closes)

611
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:12,838
(clink)

612
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,651
Mom? I thought you and cal
were going to matt's show.

613
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:33,020
We had a change of plans.

614
00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:35,122
Okay.

615
00:31:35,156 --> 00:31:37,958
Look, I was thinking aut
our conversation today

616
00:31:37,992 --> 00:31:39,459
About cal.

617
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,393
Let's not talk about cal.

618
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:43,561
Believe me, I'd rather not.

619
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:45,596
Just, uh...

620
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:47,498
Wanted to say I'm sorry.

621
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:50,100
I did let it get personal.

622
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:53,069
I meant what I said about
meade being a family business,

623
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:55,238
<i>Our family business.</i>

624
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:57,873
I won't let him
come bween you and me.

625
00:31:57,907 --> 00:32:00,276
Thank you.

626
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,854
(mouth full) mmm!
Thank you. (chuckles)

627
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,323
Oh, my god! Ha you tried
these bacon-wrapped thingies?

628
00:32:14,358 --> 00:32:16,325
To die!
Hilda, you better slow down

629
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:19,061
<i>If you don't want papi to figure
out you're eating for two.</i>

630
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:21,262
Shut up!
Ow!

631
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:24,397
God! Are you okay?
Did you see matt?

632
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:28,867
Well, I tried,
but he just freaked out on me.

633
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:33,671
He said I don't have enough passion.
That son of a bitch.

634
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:36,106
That's a little strong.

635
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:38,442
He is dead! (bobby)
catch you next week.

636
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:42,078
What the hell is your problem?!
What are you talking about?

637
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:43,561
First you bring a hot tv
to my house,

638
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,349
And now you're bribing a cop?
What?

639
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:49,108
Whoa, lady. Nobody's bribing nobody.
Man, you almost had me.

640
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:50,831
You almost had me convinced

641
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:52,529
That you were actually a decent guy.

642
00:32:53,492 --> 00:32:55,325
This is mikey from the neighborhood.
Oh, hey.

643
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:58,011
We played cards last night.
He took me to the cleaners.

644
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:00,762
I'm st making good on it. That's it.
How stupid do you think I am?

645
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:05,107
<i>You know what? Papi was right.
Once a thug, always a thug</i>

646
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:06,200
Hey. Hey!

647
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,824
No.

648
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:12,877
What's up with you, huh? Why are
you all up in my business?

649
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:14,671
I don't know what your business is.

650
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:16,838
I can never tell
if you're telling me the truth

651
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:20,024
Or pulling a fast one.
So I keep you on your toes.
You used to like that.

652
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:25,269
We're not kids anymore, bobby.
Fine. Look, what do you want from me?

653
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,158
I don't know.

654
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:29,267
Maybe I just want to believe
what you're telling me

655
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:31,259
And not drive myself crazy

656
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,613
Thinking that every word
out of your mouth is a con job.

657
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,732
It might make having your baby
a little easier.

658
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:02,946
Hey.

659
00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:04,997
<i>Hey.
Did I hear papi leave?</i>

660
00:34:04,997 --> 00:34:08,005
Yep. Left early,
won't say a word to me.

661
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,008
What about bobby?
No, I haven't spoken to him

662
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,100
Since he freaked out
and took off yesterday.

663
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,646
<i>Maybe papi's right.
Maybe he's not the right guy.</i>

664
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:18,573
Or maybe it just wasn't
the easiest way

665
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,683
For him to find out.
Yeah, I guess.

666
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,241
What aboutatt?
You talked to him?

667
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:26,527
No. I left him a message.
He didn't call back.

668
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:28,891
I mean, even if he did,
I don't know what I'd say.

669
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:31,817
He thinks I'm not passionate enough.
Oh, bull!

670
00:34:32,468 --> 00:34:34,217
Remember when you were 12
and you thought

671
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:35,837
If you didn't marry
a hanson brother

672
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:36,883
You were gonna die?

673
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:38,831
And then in junior high

674
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:40,545
When you found out
that eddie garcia was gay?

675
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,322
And you wanted to kill yourself.
Wait. I didn't tell you...

676
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:46,032
You read my diary?

677
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:49,193
<i>What? That stuff with henry
was so hot.</i>

678
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:50,534
Hilda, how could you?!

679
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:53,850
What? I'm your sister.
I'm nosy. So sue me.

680
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,488
The point is you got
plenty of passion.

681
00:34:56,488 --> 00:35:00,315
And at least you got
a decent guy to focus it on.

682
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,106
Well, maybe you do, too.

683
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:14,771
Hey.

684
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:15,966
Hey.

685
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,827
Can I come in?
It's cold out here.

686
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:22,882
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

687
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:24,349
(door closes)

688
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:29,865
Look, I'm, uh, sorry
about last night.

689
00:35:29,865 --> 00:35:31,822
It was just a bit of a shock.

690
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,123
And I know I haven't given you
much reason

691
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:35,589
To believe I'm a good guy,

692
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:38,449
But I'm a good guy.

693
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:40,427
You know?

694
00:35:40,427 --> 00:35:42,908
I want to be there for you,

695
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,224
For our kid, as much as you'll let me.

696
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:50,899
A little peace offering.

697
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:53,004
Something for the baby.

698
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:57,734
And the receipt's in the bag.
Okay?

699
00:35:57,734 --> 00:35:58,627
(laughs)

700
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:03,441
Oh, marc.
Hide me. Make yourself huge.

701
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,880
Huh?
And bloat. Bloat.

702
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,954
No. (grunts)
hi. Sorry I missed you
last night. For some reason,

703
00:36:08,954 --> 00:36:11,155
I could not follow
those directions you gave me.

704
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:13,510
I wound up in a totally scary
part of town.

705
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,136
I'm lucky I didn't get murdered.
Ha ha. Lucky.

706
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:18,677
Got you a present.
(clears throat)

707
00:36:20,085 --> 00:36:22,581
Unrwear?

708
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:23,802
Matching his and his.

709
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:26,722
We have to talk.
Quack! Quack! Quack!

710
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:27,566
Quack.

711
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:28,790
Baby duck.

712
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,635
Oh.

713
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:33,021
Listen...

714
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:35,959
Before you say anything,

715
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,386
There's, um,
something I want to tell you.

716
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:40,091
This is all new to me, marc--
the boyfriend thing.

717
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:45,346
And I can't believe that I hit
the jackpot on my first try.

718
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:46,531
Look at you.

719
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,266
You're an adonis.

720
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:50,988
You're like
a gay hugh jackman.

721
00:36:52,682 --> 00:36:54,655
I'm just... Really lucky.

722
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:00,281
I'm sorry.
You wanted to say something?

723
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:04,283
Uh, it's just--
I'm going to...

724
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,542
Go slip into these.

725
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:07,499
(laughs)

726
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:09,397
Bye.

727
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,141
Don't judge. He worships me.

728
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:26,433
We need to talk.

729
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,105
Now wait.
Before you say anything,

730
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:33,721
I... Owe you an apology.
I'm sure you had your reasons
for making the decision you did.

731
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,842
It's water under the bridge.

732
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:38,490
Thank you, cal.
I appreciate that.

733
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,206
And now I want you
to pack up your office

734
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:44,394
And get the hell out of my building.
What?

735
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:46,429
I'm backing daniel
and wilhelmina.

736
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:48,764
I want you to take
their buyout offer.

737
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:52,593
Claire, now you know I'll do
almost anything for you,

738
00:37:52,593 --> 00:37:55,725
But when it comes
to running my business,

739
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:58,388
I don't like being told
what to do...

740
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:00,484
By anyone.

741
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,947
In that case,
I'll be contacting tyler--

742
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:07,134
That's our son's name.

743
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:11,787
Tyler.

744
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:14,009
And I'll be providing him proof

745
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:16,226
Of who his biological father is,

746
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:18,193
Along with a breakdown
of your corporate holdings

747
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:19,644
And your net worth.

748
00:38:19,644 --> 00:38:23,663
Oh, and maybe the name
of a paternity lawyer thrown in,

749
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:25,878
Just for good measure.

750
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:27,369
And now,

751
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,488
I want you
out of this company

752
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:34,680
And... Out of my life.

753
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:46,357
What's that?

754
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,837
My diary. This entry is

755
00:38:48,837 --> 00:38:51,342
From the day that you killed
every single one of my pitches.

756
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:53,831
I called you a cretin, which I
think shows a lot of emotion,

757
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,527
Because I don't think

758
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:56,562
That's a word people actually use anymore.
What are you doing?

759
00:38:56,562 --> 00:38:58,618
Two weeks ago when you took me
to dinner at cft,

760
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:02,493
I was so happy, I wrote you a sonnet.
Why are you showing me this?

761
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:08,076
Cause... I may not
put my emotions

762
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:09,784
Up on a 10x10 foot canvas,

763
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:11,948
But that doesn't mean
they're not there.

764
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:16,643
These pages are full
of all kinds of passion.

765
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:17,908
You had a thing
for the hansons?

766
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:20,660
Betty,
I was a jerk yesterday.

767
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,681
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
yelled at you.

768
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:25,331
I shouldn't have shown
your paintings.

769
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:27,907
Bey, you were right.

770
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,171
Look, you made me realize

771
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:33,428
That I need to find
a better balance in my life.

772
00:39:33,428 --> 00:39:36,022
I love you,
and I want us to work,

773
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:38,109
So I need to find something
to pour myself into

774
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,815
To take the pressure off us,
and I don't think it's "mode."

775
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,642
What do you mean?
I'm quitting.

776
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:45,954
Wow.

777
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:50,062
You sure about that?

778
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:50,956
Absolutely.

779
00:39:51,942 --> 00:39:54,000
It's not my passion.

780
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,645
You know,
I need some time alone

781
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,214
So I that can find something
that inspires me

782
00:39:59,248 --> 00:40:01,649
As much as you do.

783
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:05,452
Well, I'm happy for you.
Mm.

784
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,888
But alone? Does that mean
we can't hang out tonight?

785
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:11,224
Yeah, sorry.
I've got some big plans.

786
00:40:11,258 --> 00:40:14,692
Dinner for one,
maybe a movie by myself,

787
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:16,260
Some drinking alone.

788
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:18,162
Sounds nice.
Sounds awful.

789
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:20,230
Do you want to come over?

790
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:21,697
Yeah.

791
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:23,165
I'll see you tonight.

792
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,566
Mm.

793
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,601
(elevator bell dings)
down the hallway to the left.

794
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,703
Not wasting any time I see.

795
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:33,306
There are trends to be set.

796
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:35,910
Kudos on out-maneuvering hartley.

797
00:40:35,944 --> 00:40:38,178
You must have found
one mighty big stick

798
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:40,948
To beat that horse with.
I know you had something to do with this.

799
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:43,117
Claire, whatever are you talking about?

800
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:46,186
Confidential files don't
just land on people's desks

801
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,221
Around here by accident.

802
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:56,028
<i>I don't want daniel to know
about south dakota.</i>

803
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:58,497
Is that understood?

804
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:00,932
Claire, darling,
how can I tell daniel

805
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:02,671
Something I know
absolutely nothing about?

806
00:41:09,332 --> 00:41:10,761
Move it. Out of my way.
