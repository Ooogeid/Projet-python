1
00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:01,908
Previously on Ugly Betty...

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,523
Oh, my god.

3
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:07,400
That nepotistic son of a
bitch gives my job to his...

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,682
His son.

5
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:09,579
Who do you work for?

6
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,177
I'm your new assistant.

7
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:13,922
He made Daniel hire you
'cause he didn't want his son

8
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:16,664
to be tempted to sleep with
his assistants anymore.

9
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:18,650
I'm in love with someone else.

10
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,400
Gina Gambarro?

11
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,135
You broke my plasma!

12
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,209
I'm very unhappy.

13
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,541
It's a setback.

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,290
But it's just a matter of time.

15
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:30,083
Once he's out of the picture,

16
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:33,061
the company will be
ours for the taking.

17
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:11,561
Great bunny.

18
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,482
Oh, thank you.

19
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:16,833
My sister gave that to me when
I graduated from Queens College.

20
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,482
One of america's
best value colleges.

21
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:21,552
Yep, yep, that's the one.

22
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,852
It's sort of a good-luck charm,
seeing as I am doing

23
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:26,522
what I've always wanted to--
magazine publishing.

24
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:29,100
Well, kudos,
and I certainly applaud your efforts

25
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:30,881
at personalizing your desk.

26
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:33,023
So... different.

27
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:34,332
So you.

28
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:35,663
Marc!

29
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:37,230
I have to go.

30
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:42,642
Oh, it was an amazing
night for me, too.

31
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:43,973
Listen, I gotta
get back to work.

32
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:46,711
I will call you very,
very soon, okay?

33
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,101
All right.

34
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,062
No idea who that was.

35
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,423
Good morning, Daniel.
Can I get you some coffee?

36
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:54,162
Actually, I was wondering
if you had a chance

37
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,062
to look at "page six" today.

38
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:56,680
No.

39
00:01:56,695 --> 00:02:00,491
"Daniel Meade's assistant confirms
he was wearing a Dior suit,

40
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:02,610
Gucci tie and Maggini shoes."

41
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,703
Yeah, that's what you wore.
Isn't it?

42
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,262
The Magginis are a problem.

43
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:08,673
But you said that they're the
most comfortable shoes you own.

44
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:11,832
No, no, they are. Unfortunately there's
a whole sweatshop thing with them--

45
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:13,842
cambodian kids,
forced labor, I don't know.

46
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:17,020
Point is, it's best if people
don't know I wear their shoes.

47
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:17,893
Okay.

48
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,582
Listen, Betty.
The press, people in this business--

49
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:23,833
they have a way of taking the truth,
twisting it around.

50
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:25,541
We always got to
protect ourselves,

51
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:27,953
twist it around
ourselves if we need to.

52
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,630
I got it.

53
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:34,030
Oh, hey. I got that Natalie
Whitman meeting in a few minutes.

54
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:37,890
Wow, she's my favorite.
I love those Jenna Fletcher movies,

55
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,630
and her catchphrase,
"you do the math."

56
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:43,900
You know she gains 30 pounds every
single time she does that role?

57
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:46,672
Yeah, and apparently she
hasn't lost any of it.

58
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:49,053
Do you want in on that meeting?

59
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,910
Me? Um, wow!

60
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:55,831
Yes. Yeah, that's amazing.
Thank you, Daniel.

61
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:58,092
Remember, you and me,
we're a team.

62
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:02,233
And I will take that coffee now.
Black, extra sugar. Thanks.

63
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:06,741
Has Wilhelmina Slater,
"Mode" creative director,

64
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:11,010
got over her humiliation of being
passed over for the boss' son?

65
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:12,771
That's the question
on everyone's lips

66
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:15,663
after the recent regime
change when Daniel Meade,

67
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:18,953
slutty scion of parent company,
Meade Publications,

68
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,070
was named new editor in chief.

69
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:24,090
Daniel took over after the hot,
hot death

70
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:27,893
of former editor Fey Sommers
in a fiery car crash.

71
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,842
The world is still in mourning

72
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:33,641
after the fur-loving fashion
martyr lost control of her vehicle

73
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:37,100
after being chased by angry
animal rights activists.

74
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,683
You wanted to see me?

75
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:41,443
Just  checking in.

76
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,192
Yeah, no.
Everything's going terrific.

77
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:44,601
First issue goes
to press tomorrow.

78
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:46,571
Natalie Whitman,
the star of the Jenna Fletcher movies,

79
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:48,182
is our featured layout.

80
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:49,770
"You do the math."

81
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, that's right.

82
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:52,881
Good.

83
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:54,881
Daniel, I don't
need to remind you

84
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:57,450
of the importance
of succeeding here.

85
00:03:57,627 --> 00:04:00,880
"Mode" is a stepping stone for you,
but a significant one.

86
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:03,493
You do well, eventually you'll
end up sitting where I am,

87
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:05,290
running the company.

88
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:07,652
Have you been getting the book?

89
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,241
The book.

90
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:12,563
What book are you
referring to, exactly?

91
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:15,073
"Editor in chief for dummies."

92
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,232
The book, Daniel.

93
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:18,362
The book.

94
00:04:18,378 --> 00:04:20,822
The mock-up of the
entire magazine.

95
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:24,890
Each department submits their
section throughout the day.

96
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:28,571
Photo, style, advertising--

97
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:30,352
all of "mode's" secrets.

98
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,032
The person in charge of the
magazine takes it home overnight

99
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,390
and gives their notes.

100
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,581
The person who controls the
book controls the magazine.

101
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:38,740
Thank you, Edgar.

102
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,771
You're very welcome,
miss Slater.

103
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:43,573
Which is why,
if you're ever going to succeed here,

104
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:46,012
and hopefully be sitting
where I am someday,

105
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:47,920
you have to control it.

106
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:50,451
The book is
your responsibility.

107
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:53,802
And right here we're going to
smooth out all of the chin fat.

108
00:04:53,818 --> 00:04:55,813
Good, good. Tighten that punem.

109
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:58,020
Lean out the arm flab.

110
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,911
Downsize these hips about 15%.

111
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,450
At  least.

112
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,360
And this area right over here.

113
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,001
My breasts?

114
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,032
Lift them up a notch.

115
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,340
Sag begone.

116
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:11,743
It's gonna be great.

117
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:14,220
You are going to look amazing.

118
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:17,283
Okay, I didn't think the
pictures looked too bad.

119
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:19,980
I thought that I looked--
I don't know.

120
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,940
- Normal?
- Yes.

121
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,121
Natalie, you're absolutely right.
You look... normal--

122
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:26,300
wonderfully so.

123
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:28,771
And if this were any other magazine,
that would be fine.

124
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,450
But this is "Mode."

125
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:32,640
And we are not about normal. 

126
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:35,850
We are about... aspirational.

127
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:38,540
So why not,
with the help of modern technology,

128
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:42,603
give yourself the opportunity to look
as stunning as you possibly could?

129
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:44,213
Hmm.

130
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,963
You.

131
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:50,171
- Me?
- Yeah. What do you think?

132
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:54,532
Oh, well, I think you look gr--

133
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:58,161
Natalie, as editor in chief,
I say,

134
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,443
why not take
something that's hot

135
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:02,900
and  make it super hot?

136
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,751
It's a tres good career move,

137
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,930
and remember, we're still trying to
land you "2 million dollar baby."

138
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,590
Okay. I guess you
guys are the experts.

139
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:11,260
I'll let you do your magic.

140
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, it's gonna be fabulous.

141
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,341
Listen, the features people want
to finish your interview...

142
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:19,691
Print out the finished version,
put it in the book.

143
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:22,400
And by the way, why have I
yet to see any sort of concept

144
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,875
on that Beyonce pyromia
spread we talked about?

145
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:26,089
Oh, I'll get right to it.

146
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:27,571
I'd love to see that as well.

147
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:28,243
Yeah, sure.

148
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:31,392
Wilhelmina, do
you have a minute?

149
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,621
For you, Daniel, I have two.

150
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,763
I'm editor in chief.

151
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:39,722
I should be receiving the
book at the end of each day.

152
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:44,361
Well, with all your responsibility,
do you really think you have the time?

153
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:46,391
Take my advice.

154
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,980
Focus on the big picture.
Don't be afraid to delegate.

155
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:51,400
That's what I'm here for.

156
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:56,141
Wilhelmina, certain things
fall under my purview.

157
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:57,910
The book is one of them.

158
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,762
So from now on,

159
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:03,683
I'm going to start reiving
the book every night.

160
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,280
As you wish.

161
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:16,282
That was strong in there.
Very editorial.

162
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:19,171
Well, the book is my responsibility.
It's way too important.

163
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:21,310
You know that scene in the movies
when the guy is on the plane,

164
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,280
and he's handcuffed
to the briefcase?

165
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:25,250
You want to handcuff
yourself to the book?

166
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,152
No, it's--it's a metaphor.

167
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,320
By the way, the next time
you find yourself on the spot

168
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,540
like you did in
there with Natalie,

169
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,161
you just gotta kinda go
with the vibe in the room.

170
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:34,771
Even if I don't agree?

171
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,513
If it's the best thing for
the magazine, definitely.

172
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,462
You know what? I left my P.D.A.
in the conference room.

173
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:40,982
Can you grab that for me?

174
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,702
Sure.

175
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:53,321
Has anyone seen my bunny?

176
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,110
It's, um, pink...

177
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:58,280
green tummy, graduation cap.

178
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,111
No?

179
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:04,273
How dare he embarrass me like
that in front of everyone?

180
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:07,583
The tall jar of mayonnaise is
clearly making a power play.

181
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,953
Well, if that's
what he wants...

182
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:12,201
What are you thinking?

183
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:14,072
We give him the book.

184
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:16,611
Leave the unretouched Natalie
Whitman photos in there,

185
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,853
he signs off, it goes to print,

186
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:22,902
enraged publicists,
celebrities canceling their layouts.

187
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,323
"Mode" in chaos,

188
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:28,691
and you'll be the only guiding
light left to lead the magazine out.

189
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:30,263
Uber clever.

190
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,391
Thank you.

191
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:34,690
Ooh, Marc, at that arch. Ah.

192
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,081
- Hi.
- Hey.

193
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,241
Oh, those look damn good.
Hook me up, girl.

194
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:44,762
- Ooh.
- I'm a vegan.

195
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:47,192
Carnivore here,
through and through.

196
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:54,810
So tell me, what exactly were they
retouching on Ms. "You do the math"?

197
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,022
Everything.

198
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:58,473
I never even realized how
much they do to these people.

199
00:09:58,488 --> 00:10:00,471
The chin, the butt,
the hips, the teeth--

200
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:02,480
Oh, you don't even know.
They ever got their hands on me,

201
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,430
I'd look like a
pre-crack Whitney.

202
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,422
And I never even got to tell
her what I really thought,

203
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,950
which was that she looked
great the way she was.

204
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,513
That's the business we're working in.
Perfection sells fashion.

205
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:14,120
It's all fake and unattainable,
but nobody seems to get it.

206
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:15,272
I get it.

207
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:18,222
Really? Would you buy a
magazine if I was on the cover?

208
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,581
Yeah. "National Geographic."

209
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:23,633
I  would buy any magazine that you

were on the cover of, Christina.

210
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:26,532
Are you trying to suffocate
us with that putrid smell?

211
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:27,572
Oh, they're empanadas.

212
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,712
They're disgusting.

213
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,031
Oh, my god.

214
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:33,073
There is nothing here except
non-caloric space food.

215
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,633
And I am starving.
Can I have one of those, please?

216
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,412
Yeah. Of course, yeah.

217
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:39,560
Oh, wow. You know,
I might as well eat the whole thing,

218
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,571
because they're gonna make me
look like Nicole Richie anyway.

219
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:48,460
So what do you guys think of
the latest Jenna Fletcher movie?

220
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:50,623
And you can be honest,
'cause I'm not one of those actresses

221
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:52,110
with some huge ego.

222
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:53,831
Oh, it was really good.
I enjoyed it.

223
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,553
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

224
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:58,512
So how do you guys 
put up with working here...

225
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,582
Funny thing,
being on the other side,

226
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,673
everyone believing
you've perished.

227
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:06,991
We have to assume Bradford was
behind this "fiery car crash,"

228
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:08,983
but where do we
get the evidence?

229
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:11,340
We have to find a way
to get it out of him.

230
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:14,433
Then he goes to jail and
we take over the company.

231
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:16,821
Simultaneously, we need to
get Daniel out of "Mode."

232
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:19,211
We can't have him waiting in
the wings to take over.

233
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,750
Hopefully I'm making
strides in that direction.

234
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:25,350
So the question is,
how do we get to Bradford?

235
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:29,081
Well, I can't confront him directly.
He'll just fire me.

236
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,983
Then we use Daniel.

237
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,460
I didn't know you spoke german.

238
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:39,890
I don't.

239
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,493
I just own the newspaper.

240
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:43,823
I found something you
should be aware of.

241
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:48,710
Estate sale for Fey Sommers.

242
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:51,440
I can never just be
rid of this woman.

243
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:54,021
Who knew you hated
Fey Sommers that much?

244
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:55,820
Who said I hated her?

245
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:58,573
Anyway, I was thinking I'd break
into the place today, go through,

246
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:00,610
see if there's
anything incriminating.

247
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:02,550
I'll do it.

248
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,613
I have a key.

249
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,600
Besides, you don't know
what's really incriminating.

250
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,421
What's wrong, pumpkin?

251
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:28,631
Nothing.

252
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,083
Oh, wow. The book.
I'll give it to him.

253
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,323
No, no.

254
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:35,352
This is too important.
I'll give it to him directly.

255
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:40,071
Here you go.

256
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:41,611
Wilhelmina's notes
are already inside.

257
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,040
She said pay close attention
to the Fanny Pack article.

258
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:47,870
She's not sure we're hitting
the emotional arc just yet.

259
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,713
- Thank you.
- Toodles.

260
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:05,083
So Wilhelmina's office gave me two
tickets to Pagliacci at the Met.

261
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,402
It's boring as all hell, but there is
a little alcove on the second floor

262
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,540
where we can do all
sorts of naughty things

263
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:12,462
and never get caught.

264
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:21,413
This can wait till the morning.

265
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:23,691
See you tomorrow, Betty.

266
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:25,031
Do you need me to
do anything else?

267
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:26,492
Oh, just keep working.

268
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,592
A little overtime,
and you can afford invisaligns.

269
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:57,043
Hi, this is Daniel.
Leave a message.

270
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,311
Hey, uh, Daniel, it's me.

271
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:02,291
I'm in your office,
and I saw that you left the book out.

272
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,463
Um, I don't know if I should
just leave it here...

273
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:10,153
um, or not.

274
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,423
Um...

275
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:14,441
I mean, I guess I'll just take
the book home for safekeeping,

276
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,181
and I'll bring it back
tomorrow morning.

277
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:18,570
Okay, um... bye.

278
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:44,521
I mean, she was so nice.

279
00:14:44,538 --> 00:14:46,991
She sat there and talked to us,
like, forever.

280
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:48,243
What was her name again? 

281
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,501
Natalie Whitman.

282
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:50,673
Never heard of her.

283
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:53,632
Hello! From the Jenna
Fletcher movies.

284
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:54,991
"You do the math."

285
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,040
Well, dad,
she did have some of your empanadas,

286
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:58,281
and she said they were great.

287
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:00,293
Really? Bueno,
the woman has good taste.

288
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,573
Here.

289
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,890
What's  that?

290
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,770
It's the mock-up for the
next issue of "Mode."

291
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:08,173
- Oh, my god.
- Hey, be careful!

292
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:09,533
You have the book?

293
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,543
Wait, Justin,
how do you even know what the book is?

294
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,320
I saw "Prada" like,
seven times.

295
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:14,833
So how did you get it?

296
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,481
Well, my boss was rushing out
of the office and he forgot it,

297
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:19,423
and I didn't want to just
leave it there, so...

298
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:20,780
Hey, look,
your name on the masthead.

299
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:21,890
Really?

300
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:26,010
Well, sort of.
They spelled it "Betsy" Suarez.

301
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:27,250
Oh.

302
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,152
Ay, what a day.

303
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,082
No matter how many
times I explain it,

304
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,493
no one has a freakin' clue
what an antioxidant is.

305
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:37,532
Look what I found at the door.

306
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:41,202
Wow, 9-volt batteries.

307
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:43,200
Prince charming's really
going the extra mile.

308
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:46,130
Ay, mama, you gotta be a little
bit more forgiving, okay?

309
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,351
Walter cares for you.

310
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:50,390
Well, he should've thought about that
before he left me for Gina Gambarro.

311
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,231
Listen to me. That poor thing--
he didn't stand a chance.

312
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:55,091
That girl is predatory.

313
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:57,401
Is that why they call
her "Gina Hyena"?

314
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,970
Exactly.

315
00:15:58,987 --> 00:15:59,881
What's this?

316
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:02,382
It's a mock-up of the
magazine where Betty works.

317
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,081
It's all nice,
but what's the problem with having

318
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:05,811
some latinas somewhere
in here, huh?

319
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:08,090
You gotta give these things
a little flava, you know?

320
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:10,572
- I'll get some dulce de leche--
- Ew!

321
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,990
Natalie Whitman is still fat.

322
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,893
Oh, wow.

323
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:17,080
Daniel didn't swap out
the unretouched photos.

324
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:19,082
He's gonna put her
in as she really is.

325
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:20,132
That's awful.

326
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,052
Justin! That's great.

327
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:27,471
Oh, I bet you that's Walter.

328
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,251
Ay, Betty, be nice.

329
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,053
Where the hell's my $4,000?

330
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,512
What are you talking about?

331
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,273
Uh, you broke my flat screen.

332
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:38,221
Gina, I did not break your--

333
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:40,321
Listen, you barged
into my house

334
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:42,951
like a little mexican
banshee and slammed my door.

335
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,792
Thing smashed right on
the floor 'cause of you.

336
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:48,072
Well, maybe if you stayed away
from what wasn't yours...

337
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,983
Oh, are you still
hung up over that?

338
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:57,351
Look, I want my money or a comparably
priced 50-inch plasma installed.

339
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:59,000
Bitch, out my house.

340
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,913
- Oh, no, you did not just call me a...
- Oh, yes, I did!

341
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:07,442
Please be careful
with the book.

342
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,192
Gina, leave.

343
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:14,551
Fine.

344
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,123
Have it your way.

345
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,821
But remember, Betty,

346
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,570
I'm a bad seed.

347
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:22,261
I did a year in juvie.

348
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:30,453
Ooh, I'm gonna whup
that girl's ass.

349
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,070
Did I miss something
on the telenovela?

350
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:06,731
See? This is why I don't
want us to have a dog.

351
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,240
Have you guys seen the book?

352
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,022
- What book?
- The book, dad.

353
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:12,683
The "Mode" book.
I came downstairs and it was gone.

354
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,930
- You lost it?
- No, I didn't lose it!

355
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,603
It's just in a place
that I don't know about!

356
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:19,830
It's gotta be here somewhere.

357
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:22,070
If I show up at work
without that book,

358
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:26,133
the entire layout for the magazine--
Daniel's first issue-- is gone,

359
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:27,542
and it goes to print tonight.

360
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:29,932
Come on, people lose things.
Stuff is backed up by computers.

361
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,580
It can't be that big a deal.

362
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:34,052
- What is going on?
- She lost the book.

363
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,083
- I'll go check the living room.
- I'll make you some eggs.

364
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,950
Dad, what is food gonna
do for me right now?

365
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:42,492
It's a crisis. I cook.

366
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,041
Betty!

367
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,642
It was slid under the door.

368
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,230
"I have your precious book.

369
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:56,000
Maybe if I had a
new flat screen TV,

370
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:57,851
I'd have something better
to do with my nights

371
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:00,683
than break into
people's homes." Gina!

372
00:20:00,695 --> 00:20:02,990
Justin, put your headphones on.

373
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:05,540
That bitch!

374
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:11,192
Oh, my god!

375
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:16,572
If that showerhead could pay my bills,
I would marry it.

376
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:21,092
- Hey, uh, Daniel, it's me...
- We're gonna be late.

377
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:23,182
Not that late.

378
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:26,063
Do you like it when
I bite your ear?

379
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:28,141
- Damn it.
- Oh, I guess not.

380
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:30,512
- I gotta call Betty.
- Okay, buzz kill.

381
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:32,993
She took the book home
to her house last night.

382
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:35,380
To Queens? Ew!

383
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:36,812
Hello? 

384
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:39,581
Yeah, this is Daniel
Meade for Betty.

385
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:42,173
I have to tell
him what happened.

386
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,470
Justin, headphones.

387
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:47,641
You do not tell
this man the truth.

388
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:50,001
You lie.
We will get that book back.

389
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:51,730
I promise you.

390
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,693
Hi, Daniel.

391
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:57,183
I  just got your message.
You took the book home?

392
00:20:57,196 --> 00:20:59,630
Yeah, um,
I didn't know where to leave it.

393
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:00,761
Betty, you're an assistant.

394
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:02,883
You never,
ever take that book out of the office.

395
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:05,830
What, did she need it to fix the
wobbly leg under her coffee table?

396
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:09,052
Listen, nothing spilled on it, right?
There's no--no rips, tears, anything?

397
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:11,343
No, no, no, unh-unh.
No, nothing like that.

398
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,512
Fire her. Fire her right now.

399
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:15,992
I would be such a
better assistant.

400
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:17,610
Why don't you go get dressed?

401
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:20,610
Okay, but I'm telling you,
you're gonna get it back,

402
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:24,161
and there's gonna be
chimichurr-o sauce all over it.

403
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:27,390
Listen, uh, Betty,
I know it was an honest mistake.

404
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:29,270
You have it. It's safe.

405
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,790
That-- so that's all
that's important.

406
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:34,640
Yeah, um... it's totally safe.

407
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:36,003
Um...

408
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:39,961
I'm looking at the layout of
Natalie Whitman right now.

409
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:42,191
Um, and by the way,
I think it's very brave and impressive

410
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:44,803
that you used the
original photos.

411
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:47,300
What original photos?

412
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:49,970
You know, the--the unretouched
pictures of Natalie.

413
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:51,671
I never approved that.

414
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,222
Wait, are there unretouched
photos in that book?

415
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:57,711
- Yeah, I thought you had approved them.
- This isn't happening.

416
00:21:57,726 --> 00:22:01,931
Look, if those-- if those photos ever
got out, it would be disastrous, Betty.

417
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:05,680
Okay, Betty,
do not let that book out of your sight.

418
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:08,471
I'm sending a car over to
pick you up right now.

419
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:10,163
Okay, okay.

420
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,441
Yeah, I'm--I'm--I'm holding it.

421
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,923
Bye.

422
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:17,491
I am in big trouble.

423
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:18,551
What?!

424
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:21,383
Hilda just told me that Gina
Gambarro stole your book.

425
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:23,111
Give me the phone.
I'm calling her parents.

426
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:24,752
Dad, I'm not 6.

427
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:27,020
She's right. I'll handle this.

428
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:30,411
I'm gonna show that skank a whole
new use for her curling iron.

429
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:31,533
Hilda, don't.

430
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:35,062
I don't need you guys to fight my
battles. I... can handle this.

431
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:36,833
I'm an adult.

432
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:40,112
Please! Gina, please!

433
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,350
Look, I have
something you want,

434
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:44,600
and you have something I want.

435
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:46,621
Give me my 4 grand so
I can get a new TV,

436
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:47,851
and you get your book back.

437
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,681
I don't have $4,000.

438
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:52,562
Then I probably
won't take a check.

439
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,483
Gina, this is my job.

440
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:56,593
You cannot do this to me.

441
00:22:56,856 --> 00:22:59,441
Oh, look at that.
I accidentally tore a page.

442
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:01,822
No, no, no, no, don't.
You don't do that. Don't do that, Gina.

443
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:04,112
Maybe you learned a
little lesson here.

444
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:06,903
No one screws with
Gina Gambarro.

445
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,562
Then maybe you've
learned a little lesson.

446
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:12,160
Gina Gambarro should always
latch her back door.

447
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:14,421
Get out of my house.

448
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:18,183
I will call the police so fast.

449
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,273
This is trespassing.

450
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:22,002
Oh, what do you call breaking
into our house last night?

451
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:25,230
Look, she replaces my TV,
and she gets her stupid book back.

452
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:29,010
Okay, I am only gonna
ask you one time.

453
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:30,922
Where is it?

454
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:32,722
I don't seem to remember.

455
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:36,553
Well, maybe pulling that weave out
of your head will jog your memory!

456
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,331
It's right here!

457
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,422
Hilda, just stop. Stop.

458
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:57,253
The car's here. It's no use.

459
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:12,581
Look, I just--I need to go to
the office and deal with this.

460
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:15,070
You are paying for this.

461
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:19,762
Well, I guess we
owe you $4,000...

462
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:22,060
and fifty cents.

463
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,002
Hold the elevator.

464
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:29,813
Hold it!

465
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:35,543
That was close.

466
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,951
You get a chance to
look over the book yet?

467
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:42,002
You know, we really can't
proceed until you sign off,

468
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:44,901
and we do go to press
by 6:00 tonight.

469
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,011
I was, uh,
just getting my notes together.

470
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:49,360
I'll be ready for
our meeting at 10:00.

471
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:51,482
What did you think overall?

472
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:53,800
Looks... pretty good...

473
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:57,333
except for the unretouched
photos of Natalie Whitman.

474
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:58,660
Unretouched photos?

475
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:00,982
Yes, somehow they made
it into the mock-up.

476
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:03,122
Lucky I caught that, huh?

477
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,170
Could have been a big one.

478
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:07,503
Actually surprised
you missed it.

479
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,533
- Well, I--
- Don't sweat it.

480
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:11,271
You're probably just reaching
that age where you have

481
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:13,691
to start worrying
about glasses.

482
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:15,742
Happens to everyone.

483
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,682
Love, you're gonna
have to slow down.

484
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,560
I can't understand
what you're saying.

485
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:27,350
Now what exactly is
a Gina Gambarro?

486
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:29,142
My neighbor.
She's the one who has the book,

487
00:25:29,158 --> 00:25:30,852
and she's holding it ransom.

488
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,003
The book?

489
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,921
The book with the unretouched
photographs of Natalie?

490
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:37,362
- Oh, dear.
- This is bad, isn't it?

491
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:40,472
Uh, well, I wouldn't count
on "employee of the month."

492
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,112
Oh, my god!

493
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:47,773
What?

494
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,060
Christina, everything up until
this point has been a big lie.

495
00:25:51,077 --> 00:25:53,163
I didn't get the job
because I was qualified.

496
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:55,541
I got the job because Bradford
Meade didn't want his son

497
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:57,771
to be tempted to sleep
with his assistant.

498
00:25:57,788 --> 00:25:59,871
And you have more
than proven yourself.

499
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:01,461
It doesn't matter.

500
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,411
I keep getting told that I have
to twist the truth to fit in,

501
00:26:04,427 --> 00:26:06,711
and maybe I just don't
belong at "Mode,"

502
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:08,942
and my bunny is paying
the price for it.

503
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:10,073
Your bunny?

504
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:11,821
Listen, sweetheart,
there's an awful lot of information

505
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:13,390
coming out of your mouth right now,
and to be honest,

506
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:15,370
I can't really make
any sense of it.

507
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:17,482
Look, I just need to
come clean to Daniel,

508
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:18,850
tell him the truth.

509
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,690
Well, the truth
might get you fired.

510
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:22,793
Well, I need to do it.

511
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:24,961
Bye, Christina.

512
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:29,211
There's hardly any traffic
on the bridge, miss.

513
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:30,881
We should be there in no time.

514
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:32,460
Great.

515
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:35,070
This must be my lucky day.

516
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:50,083
This must be my lucky day.

517
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:05,752
Vampira told me to let you
know they're still waiting

518
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:07,132
on your notes from the book.

519
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:09,412
Uh, uh, just tell them
I'm--I'm still going over it.

520
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:12,391
I, uh, I ran out of post-its,
okay? Yeah.

521
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:16,550
Oh, and, uh, call Betty again.
Find out where the hell she--

522
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:21,763
Okay! I'm no seeing
the book in your hands.

523
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:22,771
Why is that?

524
00:27:22,785 --> 00:27:24,751
Because Gina Gambarro has it.

525
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:27,942
Gambarro? Gambarro.
Is that a-a new designer?

526
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,022
No, it's an old slut.

527
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:32,911
She broke into my house, and she took
it, and now she's holding it ransom--

528
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:35,212
What? W-w-wait.
You told me you had the book.

529
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:38,133
- You said you were looking at it.
- Yeah, I lied...

530
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:41,410
or I twisted the truth to try
to buy some time and fix it.

531
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,872
Betty, you don't lie to me, ever.
We're on the same team.

532
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:47,753
I mean, we cannot afford to have
those unretouched Natalie proofs

533
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,733
out there in any way,
shape or form,

534
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:52,173
and I-I cannot tell
you how royally screwed

535
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:55,163
she and this entire
magazine could be.

536
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,801
Because there's pictures of
what she actually looks like?

537
00:27:57,815 --> 00:27:59,923
Exactly.

538
00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:02,120
How much does this Gina want?

539
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:04,133
$4,000.

540
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:06,831
Daniel, I-I will pay
you back with interest,

541
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:09,432
or you can take it out of my
check for the next five years.

542
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:10,741
I'm so sorry.

543
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,211
Okay, stop, uh...
we're gonna deal with this later.

544
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,510
Get my checkbook out of my top
drawer and meet me downstairs.

545
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:16,740
We're going to Queens.

546
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:18,692
Daniel, they're all
waiting for you.

547
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:20,691
Oh, right.

548
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:35,891
Well, it looks like our 10:00
meeting is finally beginning.

549
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:39,451
We're all very excited to hear
your thoughts on the book, Daniel.

550
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,830
Where is the book, anyway?

551
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:45,662
Oh, uh,
it's back there in my office.

552
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:47,472
I see it.

553
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,963
Well, don't you need it to go
through your notes with us?

554
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:52,443
Uh, actually,
I just came in to tell you all

555
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,791
I-I think you did a
great job on this issue,

556
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:57,253
and I don't really
have any notes, so...

557
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,950
Well, I do. You mind if I get it
back so I can go through mine?

558
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:04,002
You want the book back.

559
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:06,882
If it's not a problem.

560
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:09,573
Actually, um, I might want
to take one more look at it,

561
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:12,162
just to make sure everything is perfect,
you know?

562
00:29:12,175 --> 00:29:14,812
So why don't we meet back here,
in say, three hours?

563
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:17,010
It's great to see everyone.
Jeff, how's the wife?

564
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:18,052
We're separating.

565
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:19,900
Great to hear it.

566
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:24,233
Our fearless leader.

567
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:33,940
That's it.

568
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:37,033
Who put the bunny
in the toilet?

569
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:39,510
This is not funny!

570
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:41,960
Who thinks this is funny?

571
00:29:42,795 --> 00:29:44,470
Oh, really?

572
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:46,451
Well, whoever's doing this,

573
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:50,130
if you think you can break me
that easily, you're wrong.

574
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,380
You can take my bunny...

575
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:56,150
but you can't take my spirit.

576
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:09,933
Hello there.

577
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:12,343
You have something
that belongs to me.

578
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:14,911
Oh, you.

579
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:16,452
I want that book.

580
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:18,283
I have your money.

581
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:20,141
Well...

582
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:23,550
What are you doing here?

583
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,820
I'm working.

584
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:28,912
What are you doing here?

585
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:30,873
Where did you get the TV?

586
00:30:30,885 --> 00:30:32,473
You guys are a little late.

587
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:34,540
Someone else found
out about the book.

588
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:37,413
Who knew this thing was like
the freakin' dead sea scrolls?

589
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:39,341
Anyway, they came by earlier

590
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:41,791
and gave me enough money
for a new flat screen.

591
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:45,743
L.C.D.-- even
better than plasma.

592
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:46,763
Oh, my god.

593
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:48,950
Someone else has the book?!

594
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:52,821
Mets cap, big sunglasses,
knew all about the book...

595
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:56,733
Of course, if I had known it was you,
I would have held out.

596
00:30:56,747 --> 00:30:59,131
I swear this is purely
a professional visit.

597
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:01,812
There's nothing between us anymore.
We're not even friends.

598
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,241
I don't even like her.

599
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:05,243
Walter, I don't care.

600
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:07,503
- You don't?
- No.

601
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:10,623
- Did you get my gift?
- The batteries? Yeah, thanks.

602
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,040
They'll really come in handy
during hurricane season.

603
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:15,971
No. Don't you remember when
we first started dating,

604
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:18,093
and you stopped by Pro Buy?

605
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:20,201
I was doing shipping
and receiving.

606
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,990
A box of 9-volts.

607
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:26,843
First time we kissed,
you said, "careful"--

608
00:31:26,857 --> 00:31:29,730
"Careful, we're gonna
'cause a spark."

609
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:31,781
Yeah.

610
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,593
Hey there.

611
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,781
Whassup?

612
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,912
We need to talk.

613
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:46,323
We need to figure out who did this,
how they found out

614
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:48,122
and stop them before
it's too late.

615
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,920
I know... I'm so sorry...

616
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:53,410
Rumors are flying around
town that horrifying,

617
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:55,771
unretouched photographs
of Natalie Whitman--

618
00:31:55,785 --> 00:31:59,262
still carrying her Jenna Fletcher
weight like an albatross--

619
00:31:59,277 --> 00:32:01,931
have been lost by
"Mode" magazine.

620
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:03,932
Now if and when they turn up,

621
00:32:03,946 --> 00:32:08,051
we will immediately broadcast
them right here on "Fashion TV."

622
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:09,412
Remember,

623
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:13,582
we only make others feel
bad to make you feel good.

624
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:18,371
I have no idea
how this happened.

625
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:21,621
The book was not in my
possession at the time.

626
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:25,370
Absolutely, I understand
the severity of this.

627
00:32:25,386 --> 00:32:27,641
Though I think it'll just
be Daniel at the meeting.

628
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:30,741
He is, after all,
the editor in chief

629
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:32,840
and the man in charge.

630
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,680
Yes.

631
00:32:36,338 --> 00:32:38,360
How was Queens?

632
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:41,122
Like the lost city
of hoochieville.

633
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:44,001
This Gina Gambarro
didn't miss a beat.

634
00:32:44,017 --> 00:32:46,022
Jumped right for the money.

635
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:50,020
Poor unemployed thing
just couldn't bear

636
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:52,330
missing another
episode of Tyra.

637
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,022
Good work, darling.

638
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:55,842
So you're leaking the pictures?

639
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,282
Ah, of course not.

640
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:59,400
Just the rumor that
they're there.

641
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:02,460
There'll be a great deal of
sweating and hand-wringing.

642
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:06,152
Bradford will realize once and
for all what a dolt his son is.

643
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:10,692
And we swoop in with the missing
proofs and make ourselves...

644
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,362
I'm sorry...

645
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:15,580
make you the hero.

646
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:21,443
Where to, Mr. Meade?

647
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,723
Can you just drive
around for a little bit?

648
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,563
You know,

I could say I was mugged.

649
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:27,543
I could get my golf club.
You could hit me across the face.

650
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:28,820
Break my nose.

651
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:31,363
Daniel, there are a lot of things
I'm willing to do for this job.

652
00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:33,160
That is not one of them.

653
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:35,710
Plus, how are you gonna explain
being in Queens, anyway?

654
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:37,922
Betty, my father could
fire me over this.

655
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,683
Maybe I should just have
them take me to J.F.K.,

656
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:42,500
get a one-way ticket to Paris.
No, Rio.

657
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:44,353
It's cheaper,
women are much hotter...

658
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,101
I could get a little
place in Ipanema.

659
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:47,260
And then what?

660
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:49,200
I don't know. Drink. Party?

661
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:53,411
As long as I escape the pressure of
ting to be something I am clearly not.

662
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:57,671
Daniel, if I can suggest...

663
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:02,130
instead of trying to
escape this or spin it,

664
00:34:02,147 --> 00:34:04,801
why don't you just
tell the truth?

665
00:34:05,317 --> 00:34:07,552
Or you can just blame me.

666
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:11,710
I don't mind being your
fall girl--guy--person.

667
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:13,441
Whatever.

668
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:15,732
If you could just twist
the truth one last time

669
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:19,431
and give me a good recommendation,
I'd really appreciate it.

670
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:26,262
Driver, take us back
to the Meade building.

671
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:31,321
This is an atrocity.

672
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,092
I don't--I don't even
know how to spin this.

673
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,383
This is bad.
This is Mel Gibson bad.

674
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:40,063
We are so incredibly sorry.

675
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,503
You know,
"sorry" is not gonna cut it.

676
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:46,623
If those pictures appear on
the internet, on television,

677
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:51,321
our P.R. firm will never allow any of
our clients anywhere near your magazine.

678
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:53,143
How did this happen?

679
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:57,221
Well, it's um...
it's complicated.

680
00:34:57,235 --> 00:35:01,690
They were in my office's
possession at the time.

681
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,241
What do you intend
to do about it?

682
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:05,133
Well, we have people
out there searching.

683
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,842
We're making phone calls.

684
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,711
We're doing everything
we possibly can.

685
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:10,312
What does--what
does that mean?!

686
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:11,833
Will you put a sock
in it already?

687
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:14,773
What's he gonna do?
Dispatch a commando unit for pictures?

688
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:16,530
Just calm down.

689
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,013
Just trying to protect you.

690
00:35:18,025 --> 00:35:19,381
Then come up with a solution.

691
00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:21,092
I am trying to come
up with a solution.

692
00:35:21,105 --> 00:35:24,003
Do you know how this could hurt your
career if these pictures got out there?

693
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:25,701
No one wants to hire a fatty.

694
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:29,140
What's this gonna publicize,
the fact that you can't lose any weight?

695
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:41,973
You know how in those samurai movies
they'd rather kill themselves

696
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:43,532
than be captured or defeated?

697
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:45,200
Ritual suicide.

698
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:46,720
It's called seppuku.

699
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:48,461
Like the beer?

700
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:51,031
Anyway, this whole situation

701
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:54,092
with you taking the book to
Queens reminded me of that.

702
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:57,443
And I figured, rather than live
with the shame of the screwup

703
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,632
and probably end up
getting fired anyway,

704
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:03,201
wouldn't you rather just quit?

705
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,941
Se-pu-ku, Betty.

706
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:12,233
- You know what?
- Hmm?

707
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:15,001
You really do belong
here more than I do.

708
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:17,763
And I truly hope that you
get everything you deserve.

709
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:20,603
Oh, thank you.

710
00:36:20,616 --> 00:36:22,392
Bye.

711
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:34,333
Can you hold the
elevator, please?

712
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,703
Hey, empanada girl.

713
00:36:37,715 --> 00:36:38,940
Betty, right?

714
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,362
Yeah.

715
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:41,883
God, what happened
to that bunny?

716
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,381
It looks like it was
stuck in a blender.

717
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:46,181
It probably was.

718
00:36:46,195 --> 00:36:48,670
It's had a tough
couple of days.

719
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:51,452
So you moving offices?

720
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:54,652
Actually, um...

721
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm quitting.

722
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,940
But I'm probably
fired anyway, so...

723
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:59,880
What? Why?

724
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:06,393
Look, the whole business with
the book and the photos...

725
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:09,062
it's my fault,
not Daniel's and not "mode's."

726
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:12,263
I was taking care of the
book when it was stolen.

727
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,232
It's just a lowly
assistant screwup,

728
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,561
and I don't want it to
reflect badly on anyone else,

729
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:20,061
and I'm really sorry for
any pain or embarrassment

730
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:22,520
or hurt that it
might cause you, but

731
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:24,350
for what it's worth,

732
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,630
I really did think that those
unretouched photos were beautiful.

733
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:32,862
And the truth is...

734
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:35,700
well, I'd kill to
look like you.

735
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:46,980
It was my fault. No one else's.

736
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:51,561
The book was my responsibility,
and I left it out of my possession.

737
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:53,510
I was careless...

738
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:55,310
stupid.

739
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:57,040
And I know what
you're thinking.

740
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:58,403
No.

741
00:37:58,787 --> 00:38:00,331
No?

742
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:05,500
I'm thinking, for once my son is
actually being honest with me.

743
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:08,980
He's in a meeting!

744
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,311
I need to speak to
him right away.

745
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:13,011
I tried to stop her.

746
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:15,132
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need to speak to you.

747
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,121
Okay.

748
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:18,631
First, you can't fire that
wonderful assistant of yours.

749
00:38:18,648 --> 00:38:19,843
Oh, yes, he can.

750
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:21,781
She inspired me to come
up with a solution

751
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:23,930
to fix this whole problem.

752
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:38,311
Get me Bradford.

753
00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:41,870
He's on line one.

754
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:45,513
Bradford, good news.

755
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:47,743
The book and the
proofs turned up.

756
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:50,421
Well, my people were on
a manhunt and, uh...

757
00:38:50,435 --> 00:38:53,302
what do you mean
it doesn't matter?

758
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:56,392
On--on "Fashion TV"? Wha--

759
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:02,733
In a stunning new twist in
today's major fashionistic drama,

760
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:05,972
Natalie Whitman has decided
to preempt any embarrassment

761
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:08,102
her missing photographs
may have caused

762
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:11,440
by allowing "Mode" magazine
to reveal the real her

763
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:15,190
and publish the pictures
completely unretouched.

764
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:18,060
I just wanna put a spotlight on
the hypocrisy of this business

765
00:39:18,078 --> 00:39:20,913
which seems intent on making
any normal human being

766
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:22,902
feel like an outcast.

767
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:27,280
Does this audacious move by recently
installed editor Daniel Meade

768
00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:30,993
mark the beginning of a newer,
nicer "Mode"?

769
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:32,851
God help us all.

770
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:35,040
Great news, isn't it?

771
00:39:35,596 --> 00:39:37,532
Wonderful.

772
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,623
So it turned up?

773
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:42,381
Anonymously dropped
off at the front desk.

774
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:43,900
Lucky thing.

775
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:45,650
Indeed.

776
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:49,660
I'll make sure it's never
out of my sight again.

777
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,390
Please do that.

778
00:39:51,405 --> 00:39:52,982
Good night, Daniel.

779
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:55,110
Good night, Wilhelmina.

780
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:56,831
Night.

781
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,001
Bastard.

782
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:10,273
Well, I've done the
best I can with it,

783
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:13,350
but to be honest,
I think you're screwed.

784
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:17,102
Well, thank you, Christina.

785
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,520
- Do you have 'em?
- I do.

786
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:24,050
- Here they are.
- Thank you.

787
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:31,151
Bought myself another day so I
can honestly go through this.

788
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:33,712
You know, come here.
Take a look at this.

789
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,912
"Betty Suarez,
executive assistant."

790
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:41,171
You found the error?

791
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,470
That's my job.

792
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:47,583
Oh, um... so these are
american-made, non-sweatshop,

793
00:40:47,598 --> 00:40:51,321
and I promise you they're as
comfortable as the Magginis.

794
00:40:51,538 --> 00:40:54,213
Thank you, Betty, really.

795
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,941
You know I'm actually--
you can go home.

796
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,673
I'm gonna be here
for a little while.

797
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:02,340
Okay. Good night.

798
00:41:05,688 --> 00:41:07,572
Bye, Amanda.

799
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,112
And though my bunny and I
are a little worse for wear,

800
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:12,322
we're here,

801
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:13,880
and we're staying,

802
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:17,862
and it's gonna take a hell of a lot
more to get rid of either one of us.

803
00:41:17,877 --> 00:41:19,812
Good night!

804
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:22,600
Whatever!

805
00:41:23,627 --> 00:41:25,821
I'm still prettier.

806
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:32,092
This is Daniel.

807
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:36,071
It's amazing how little we can
know about the people we love.

808
00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:38,553
Your father, for instance.

809
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:41,281
What? Who is this?

810
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:44,693
He's a man of many,
many secrets, Daniel.

811
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:46,101
Dig a little deeper,

812
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:49,622
and you may find he's capable
of practically anything.
