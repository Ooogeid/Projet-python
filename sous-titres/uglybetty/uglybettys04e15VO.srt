1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,990
Aah!

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,220
Okay, no hat today then.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,490
Ah. sorry. I was an accident.

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,170
Please. I was getting that thing
off her head one way or another.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,400
Does anyone know
where my computer is?

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,670
It's not in my bag. oh, I used it
last night. I think it's on the couch.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,810
Couch. justin, please sit.
have some breakfast.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,080
Uh, too late. since we've
been staying with aunt betty,

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,800
It takes me a month to
get to school in queens.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,560
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,680
My big meeting with the lady
gaga people is today. oh, my god!

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,920
Only one more week till you get
to meet your favorite pop star.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,080
Oh, my god. aunt betty,
I am clinging to that.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,480
Now I feel bad about that hat.
don't worry.

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,350
Bye! bye. I love you.

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,280
Bye! thank you so
much for doing that.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,130
He's been so down lately.
no problem. his house burnt down.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,550
That's a lot for aid.

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,540
Where is my computer? he said couch,
right? oh, you know what?

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,700
I used it after him.

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,260
I was e-mailing clients
to get them to come here.

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,200
What, you're--you're-
you're taking clients here?

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,480
Yeah! that way,
I can charge manhattan prices.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,660
That's cool, right? yeah.
whatever you need.

25
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,280
Just... you know,
use that hair catchy thingy.

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,750
Old plumbing. did you find it?

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,180
I think I put your computer
on one of the suitcases.

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,690
Check justin's. oh,
and I packed a lunch for you.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,920
Ah! yes! here it is.

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,630
Sorry, mija.

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,640
We're making life so
hard for you, aren't we?

32
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,950
Oh, papi, stop. come on,
it's nothing. this is fun.

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,560
All right, I gotta go.

34
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,340
Ah! betty! daniel! hey!

35
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,800
What are you doing here like that?

36
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,860
I, uh, you know, slept here.
you know, um...

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,740
Amanda and I kinda have, uh,
this casual thing going.

38
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,410
No strings. no drama.

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,440
It's nice.

40
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,840
That's great.

41
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,770
So, uh... how's everything
going over there

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,570
With your whole family?

43
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,750
It's... gotta be pretty rough, huh?

44
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,280
Yeah, it's... got its challenges.

45
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,620
You know, nothing I can't handle

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,130
Till the insurance check comes in

47
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,550
And we can start to rebuild.

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,210
Could we talk about this ler when
you have pants on? of course.

49
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,810
Great.

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,930
I need you to oversee
the marchesa test shoot,

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,220
Get daniel's thoughts

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,020
And then bring it to me
so I can do the real work.

53
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,630
Got it. fake notes from daniel,
real notes from you.

54
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,810
So w--why did we stop?
did you break a heel?

55
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,850
Did I step in your shadow again?

56
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,480
Don.

57
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,290
Donald jones.

58
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,810
Wanda?

59
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,200
it that you?

60
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,430
Yes!

61
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,760
Well, it's-- it's "wilhelmina" now.

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
Right. of course. hi.
I'm marc st. j--

63
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,260
You look... terrific,

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,260
25 years later.

65
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,200
Uh, how long you in town for?

66
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,320
Actually, I moved
here about a year ago.

67
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,180
A year ago?
you should've called me.

68
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,350
Oh. yeah, I don't know about that.

69
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,450
We're not quite the same
people we were back then.

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,370
Well, I am the same
old regular guy.

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,920
But you!

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,670
You've gotten quite a reputation.

73
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,400
What was it they said about you
in the paper the other day?

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,520
They called you a-a "
power hgry fashion nazi."

75
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,380
But that's a good thing in your
business though, right? uh--

76
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,080
Yes, yes. we were very
proud of that. i--you know,

77
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,930
I am sti the same old
wanda I used to be.

78
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,150
Still fun, still sweet.

79
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,170
this is all for show.

80
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,140
You should--you should call me.
you'll see.

81
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,240
I-i-i'll check my schedule.

82
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,720
Marc.

83
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,910
Justin!

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,860
Hi. what are you doing here?

85
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,890
Um, I need to talk
to you in private.

86
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,950
Um, is my aunt betty here yet? nope.
about ten minutes away.

87
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,100
Good. I have to tell
you something huge,

88
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,610
But you have to promise not to
tell any of my family. okay?

89
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,200
Okay.

90
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,400
It's about something that I did...

91
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,710
With a friend from acting class.

92
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,270
Oh.

93
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,400
Yes. yes.

94
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,020
Sit down,

95
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,920
Take your time...

96
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,510
And, um, let it out.

97
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,750
These things can be difficult.

98
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,040
Trust me, I know.

99
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,210
It wasn't too long
ago that yours truly

100
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,150
Sat down wand had sympat a
very similar conversation.

101
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,400
No way. you burned
down your house, too?

102
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,950
Boy, did i. y--i'm sorry, what?

103
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,950
I smoked a cigarette in my house,

104
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,240
And I think I started the fire.

105
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,210
Thank you for coming over.

106
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,050
I really need to talk.

107
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah. what's up?
you're stress cooking,

108
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,020
And your shoulders are all
the way up by your mustache.

109
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,680
Yeah, I think I did
a terrible thing.

110
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,530
I promised hilda I'd
hire an electrician

111
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,760
To hang my classy new chandelier.

112
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,280
But when you hired
sal the electrician,

113
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,190
It turned out to be sally
the electrici-anna,

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,860
And you two had a
steamy love affair.

115
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,300
But little did you
know sally was married,

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,270
And now her hubby's coming to get ya.
no. that's not it at all.

117
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,990
Are you sure?

118
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,890
'cause I totally thought that's
where you were going with that.

119
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,260
I need more bacon.

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,540
No, no, no, i-i-i never
hired an electrician.

121
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,180
I did the wiring myself,

122
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,950
And I think I may have caused
our house fire. uncle papi!

123
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,250
Okay, I need to ask you something,

124
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,240
And you have to tell me the truth.

125
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,360
I'm all about the truth,
all right? ask away.

126
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,670
Did you burn down my house? what?!

127
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,000
What the hell kind of
question is that? no!

128
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,140
I'm sorry. it was rude.

129
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,630
Did your family burn down my house?

130
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,700
If you're implying what I
think you're implying...

131
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,530
Well, bobby, don't you think
it is a little bit weird

132
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,540
That my salon went up in flames
just two days after I joked

133
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,640
That the stupid place
should burn down

134
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,320
So I could collect the insurance?

135
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,530
Listen to me,
for the last time, okay?

136
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,810
My family is not in the mafia.

137
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,660
Well, that's not the
story on the street...

138
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,530
"mobby."

139
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,020
I'm gonna pretend, right,

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,850
That you didn't just
call me "mobby."

141
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,110
And you know what else?

142
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,140
Accusing my family of
something like that

143
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,850
When you haven't
even met them yet--

144
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,660
You know, that takes a
big fat set of kiwis.

145
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,540
Oh, hi. good morning.
could you just hold this? thanks.

146
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,780
Did you just get here?

147
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,560
What makes you say that?
amanda, it's 11:30.

148
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,630
Big whoop. I'm filling
in at reception today.

149
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,410
Besides, I'm sleeping with the boss,
so it's all okay.

150
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,940
Oh, how's that going for you?

151
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,140
It is so good. the sex is great,

152
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,070
And he doesn't mind if I date.

153
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,910
And I don't mind that he's
picking out models at 1:00.

154
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,070
Ooh, he is? hmm, this is fun.

155
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,620
That's the jackass who
upstaged me at fashion week.

156
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,720
What's he doing here?

157
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,550
Decorating my world.
I don't know what it is.

158
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,480
There's something that bugs
the hell out of me about him.

159
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,880
Do me favor.
find out why he's here.

160
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,030
On it.

161
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,490
A recent study found

162
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,840
That over 50% of american
women wear glasses.

163
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,420
And because lady
gaga is so well-known

164
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,190
For heoutlandish eyewear,

165
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,760
We thought she would be the
perfect model for "mode's"

166
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,910
Top list of fashion forward
prescription glasses.

167
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,170
We're calling the spread

168
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,080
"lady gaga's lady goggles."

169
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,590
No, we're not.

170
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,960
We're not.

171
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,630
Betty, uh, less talking,
more pictures.

172
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,470
Show us the mock-ups, please.

173
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,100
Sorry.

174
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,940
Um, my--ugh--my dessert.

175
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,580
My dad--he, um...

176
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,630
He packed my dessert...

177
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,500
And it must've gotten
wedged in my computer.

178
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,170
Um... he likes to do that.

179
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,100
Stop. we're nauseated.

180
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,860
Okay. uh...

181
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,070
Still works.

182
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,290
Yay. uh, all right.
so as you will see,

183
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,500
The angle for the spread is...

184
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,200
What is that,
and why is it singing?

185
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,820
I don't know, my nephew
was using my computer

186
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,010
we're in...., this doesn't work

187
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,560
The flan is making it sticky.

188
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,920
Um, I'm sorry. my nephew must've
replaced my lady gaga file

189
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,460
With his lady gaga file.

190
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,470
But you know what?
I can run to grab my flash drive.

191
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,930
Enough! gentlemen,
let's give betty five minutes

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,870
To go get her flash drive
so she can give it to tracy,

193
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,850
Who will be taking
over this account.

194
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,880
Hello?

195
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,550
Oh. hey.

196
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,970
Hi. need some help?

197
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,290
Yes. I'm betty suarez.
there was a fire at my family's home.

198
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,450
I called the insurance company

199
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,240
To see when the check would
be coming, and they said

200
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,040
They can't send it until you determine
the cause. yeah, that's right.

201
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,070
Here, uh, it's right over here.
let me see. uh, suarez? betty.

202
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,040
Suarez. yeah.

203
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,400
Uh... oh, okay. it looks like the,
uh, report was filed today.

204
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,590
Oh! great! so then we'll
be getting the check soon?

205
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,730
I'm--i'm--i'm kidding you.
this is a takeout menu.

206
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,660
Oh. you said your name was
betty's salami, right?

207
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,980
I, no--i have no idea if
your report was filed.

208
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,020
Oh. well, um, can I find out?

209
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,280
Yeah, i-i could check.
yeah, that'd be great.

210
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm jimmy, by the way. hi, jimmy.

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,940
Oh. it looks like your hse
is on the bottom of the list.

212
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,580
Oh.

213
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,180
Well, is there any way
to speed things up?

214
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,940
Welli'm the captain.
I can make anything happen.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Really? great!

216
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm not the captain.

217
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,360
You're not the captain.

218
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,090
But if you keep
falling for my jokes,

219
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,570
I might just fall for you.

220
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,340
Is there anyone else
here I could talk to?

221
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,910
All right. come on. I'm sorry.
I'm just playing with you.

222
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,130
Okay, i-i-i actually have

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,820
A little bit of pull
around here, all right?

224
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,900
My aunt, she's an assistant fire inspector.
not falling for that one.

225
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,750
Uh, no, no, no. no, for reals.
for reals this time, okay?

226
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,200
I could probably get you
moved to the top of the list.

227
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,930
Maybe, uh, I don't know.

228
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,310
Maybe you want to grab some dinner?
we could talk it over.

229
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,250
Um, that's flattering,
but I don't think I can.

230
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,860
Well, okay. well, uh,
maybe tomorrow then.

231
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,630
No, I just don't think
it's a good idea.

232
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,730
Well, all right.

233
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,850
Uh, well, good luck
with everything.

234
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,250
Hope it all works out.

235
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,870
Trust me, kathy,

236
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,960
That hurt you more than it hurt me.

237
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,840
Now the only reason
I am not firing you

238
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,760
Is because you've finally
discovered concealer.

239
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,390
Now get out.

240
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,590
Wow. someone's showing restraint.

241
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,110
See? I can be nice.

242
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,900
but what does it matter?

243
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,990
People still view me

244
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,230
As a drop-dead
gorgeous fashion nazi.

245
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,270
Wow, it sounds like
some of don's words

246
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,530
Are really sticking with you.
well, don was a great guy.

247
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,420
Back in the day, believe it or not,

248
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,910
Being with a simple man like
that actually appealed to me.

249
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,370
Willie... please don't
hit me for saying this,

250
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,410
But your face just softened.

251
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,770
You still like him!

252
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,010
I do.

253
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,510
But you heard him.
he's a regular guy.

254
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,310
And I'm a monster.

255
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,480
I'd doubt he'd even get near me.

256
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,210
But he might get near wanda.

257
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,450
I mean, if you really like him,

258
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,100
Maybe you oughta dust
the old girl off,

259
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,470
Take her for a spin.

260
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,500
Thank you.

261
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,040
Well...

262
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,240
Thanks again for lunch
and all the dinners

263
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,530
And the, uh,
the gentleman's facial,

264
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,210
And it's really nice
to know that I have

265
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,990
Practically no pores, and that's a
good thing. well, you get that from me.

266
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,570
I have to admit, I kind of
feel like I'm freeloading.

267
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,410
Tyler, you're not freeloading.

268
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,720
You're my son.

269
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,680
Oh, this has been the nicest week.

270
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,260
Now go! okay.

271
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,450
I'll see you tonight.

272
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,290
I am freaking.

273
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,570
Amanda. what are you doing?

274
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,560
He is your son!
and he is hot! well done.

275
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,490
When are you gonna
tell daniel? in time.

276
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,800
I just want to enjoy
this a little longer

277
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,390
Before it gets complicated.

278
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,030
So is he gonna live here with us?
I don't know, amanda.

279
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,890
Apparently he was raised with
a very strong work ethic.

280
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,760
He won't stay here
without a job. weird.

281
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,470
I know! he can be one of
our in-house test models.

282
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,980
Oh, he's perfect.
look at that skin.

283
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,640
he gets that from me.

284
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,250
Really?

285
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,910
Are you in a good mood?
'cause I need to ask you a favor.

286
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,230
Actually, I'm in a terrible mood.
I've had a horrible day.

287
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,030
Are you in oh. well, maybe this
I need t will cheer you up.

288
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,220
I need to use your apartment
for a dinner party.

289
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,600
Why would that cheer me up?

290
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,930
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I promised bobby

291
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,430
That I would get
to know his family.

292
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,200
You know, so I don't think...
they're in the mob.

293
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,780
Oh. well, now that I know

294
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,580
It's for something totally
reasonable... I'm sorry.

295
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,920
But you know we'll be out
of your apartment soon.

296
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,070
Ugh. not unless I go out

297
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,030
With the world's most irritating
fireman. what do you mean?

298
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,590
So you go on one
date with this guy,

299
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,450
And we'll move to the top of the list?
you're going. no, I'm not.

300
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,660
Whats the big deal?

301
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,110
It's one slice of pizza and a
little over the sweater. ew!

302
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,810
Well, what, do you want
us out of here or not?

303
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,580
Hilda, I'm not that kind of girl.

304
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,750
Hey, I'm in the shower!

305
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,040
Hey, you.

306
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,730
They always come back.

307
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,450
You're going on a
date with a fireman?

308
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,070
Betty, these are firemen.

309
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,350
This...

310
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,040
Is you. well, marc,

311
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,970
Maybe if you could get a
date with a real fireman,

312
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,610
You wouldn't need
the calendar. mean.

313
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,130
I love it!

314
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,230
Besides, my fireman isn't
exactly chiseled...

315
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,570
Or hairless...

316
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,820
Or coated in oil.
how does he fight fires then?

317
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,260
Oh, I get it. he's one
of these february firemen

318
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,300
Who they make pose with dogs
'cause they're not cute enough.

319
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,790
I guess. I don't even
want to go on this date.

320
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,360
I'm only doing it so that my family

321
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,360
Can get back into
their house quicker.

322
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,940
Well, if you wanna make the date

323
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,500
Quick and painless yet effective,

324
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,810
Then you need to implement my s.
a.a.d.d. system. "sad" system?

325
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,950
Saad-d.

326
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,290
"skip appetizers and don't drink."

327
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,780
Appetizers only prolong a meal,

328
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,580
And alcohol is a gateway
to endless conversation

329
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,640
And... other things which
I'm sure you want to avoid.

330
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,120
Mm. I do. Yes

331
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,760
Marc, in my office now.
oh. uh, wilhelmina,

332
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,590
I hate to ask this because
I know you kicked me off

333
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,980
The lady gaga account, but...

334
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,950
Is it okay if my nephew still comes
to the shoot? marc, tell her "no."

335
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,610
No. and throw away her bagel.

336
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,200
She doesn't need it.

337
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,950
No. no, no, no, no. no.
you're smouthing again.

338
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,770
"smouthing"? smiling w.
it's a very common mistake.

339
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,470
But if you're going to
be our new test model,

340
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,470
You must learn to smize.
smile with my eyes?

341
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,410
now you're getting it.

342
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,600
Can I confess something to you?

343
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,390
What, that you're claire
meade's long lost son

344
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,450
That she put up for adoption,

345
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,980
And you've come to claim
your rightful place

346
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,250
Since the revelation of
your true birth mother

347
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,080
Rock your small town world?

348
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,620
Wow. I mean, i-i was just gonna say

349
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,510
That I'm not really
qualified to be a model.

350
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,120
But... yeah. how did you know?
I think I'm kinda claire's bestie.

351
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,980
They don't have girls
like you in south dakota.

352
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,630
Oh, honey, they don't have
girls like me anywhere.

353
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,370
You're free tonight?

354
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,130
Oh. great!

355
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,100
Um, well, why don't we go to remi?

356
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,720
You know, they always have a
table for me there and, uh...

357
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,800
Or--or--what--you know what?
why don't you pick the place?

358
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,260
Well, you know,
I'm--i'm easy-breezy.

359
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,270
Yes.

360
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,540
Easy-breezy-george-and-wheezy!

361
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,220
That's, uh...

362
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,910
Um, you know what? um, okay.

363
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,460
Why I send my car to
pick you up and w--

364
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,610
Or... you can pick
me up in... a cab,

365
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,320
Because that's what people do.

366
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,940
Great.

367
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,120
I'll see you later.

368
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,440
And you thought you
couldn't be nice.

369
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,570
Get kathy back in here.
I need to kick someone.

370
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,830
Hey. oh, hey.

371
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,640
So... why is he here?

372
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,590
well, he is one of our test models

373
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,000
Wait. no, that's impossible.

374
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,510
I'm the one who hires the models.
oh! oh, that's weird.

375
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,550
That's a total mystery,

376
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,970
Maybe one of those
things we'll never know,

377
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,050
Like what water's made

378
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,490
Of or who invented
canned potato chips.

379
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,400
No, really. did wilhelmina hire him?
no. but who cares?

380
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,370
I want you now and far
from this location.

381
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,760
But, no, wait. okay,
so that only leaves my mother.

382
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,040
Why would my mo--

383
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,660
For once, can we not talk about
your mother when we have sex?

384
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,370
Okay, the talercios
are on their way up.

385
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,310
Remember, no cracks about
them being in the mob.

386
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,550
So what if they are?
who am I to judge?

387
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,730
People do things they
wish they hadn't.

388
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,270
Unforgivable things.

389
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,810
Okay, I don't know
what any of that means.

390
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,020
ay! oh, they're here!

391
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,660
Okay, remember, tonight
isall about ???????????????

392
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,140
All--all right. I got it.
papi, get the door!

393
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,940
Okay! ready? yes.

394
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,560
hello!

395
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,090
Hi! how are you?

396
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,650
Oh, we heard so much about you! mr.

397
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,070
Suarez, how you doing?
this is my ther.

398
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,120
Oh! pleasure to meet you.

399
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,020
Yeah, yeah, so nice to see you.
beautiful. beautiful. my pops, hilda.

400
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,340
You, too. thank you. mr.
suarez, my--my father anthony.

401
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,120
Oh, ignacio. you don't want to shake
with me. I got blood on my hands.

402
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,330
Paper cut from this
damn pastry box.

403
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,450
But tell 'em how worth it it was.

404
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,390
These are the best cannolis
in all of brooklyn.

405
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,320
Ooh! she's right.

406
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,380
I'm telling ya, we'd kill for them.
oh, yeah. she's right.

407
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,540
Let me take your coat. sure.

408
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,270
Hello?

409
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,850
hey, it's, uh, it's jimmy.

410
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,000
Look, I'm sorry. i-i can't make it.

411
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,290
There was a fire,
and... I went in alone.

412
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,310
Things got really bad. oh, no!

413
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,060
Gotcha! oh!

414
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,460
Damn, you're easy!

415
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,080
Look, um, it's, like,
an hour wait for a table.

416
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,910
Ah, it's no problem.

417
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,520
We'll get some appetizers
and booze at the bar. boom!

418
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,020
"skip appetizers and
don't drink. saad-d."

419
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,880
No!

420
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,990
I mean... let's just
go down the street

421
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,870
And grab, like, a quick falafel.

422
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,300
It's, like, 10 degrees out.

423
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,230
Come on, an hour with me?
it'll fly by.

424
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,550
So, jimmy, about my house...

425
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,250
Um, have you spoken to your aunt?

426
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,650
I have not had the chance yet.

427
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,160
I will call her right
after dinner, okay?

428
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,090
Let's just enjoy ourselves.
whoa! sorry.

429
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,710
Wilhelmina. betty?

430
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,650
You two know each other?

431
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,710
Uh, yes. betty is a
friend from work.

432
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,980
What a surprise.

433
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,250
Yeah. uh... okay.

434
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,120
Uh, we're just gonna

435
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,070
Hang out at the bar
till our table's ready.

436
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,910
Oh, that's too bad.
we were just being seated.

437
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,150
Otherwise we'd have a drink
with you. ah! timing.

438
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,470
Well, who runs this jot?

439
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,220
They're gonna make us, uh,
wait in the bar for an hour,

440
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,770
And you guys get a big
comfy booth? jimmy.

441
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,120
Well, why don't you just join us?

442
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,370
I don't mind. she's your friend.

443
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,740
she's my friend. yes.

444
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,780
Uh, betty, join us.

445
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,570
I can't think of anything more fun.

446
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,510
Here you are.

447
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,810
Oh, the scorpion!

448
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,560
Ahh. here's to new...

449
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,730
And old friends. oh.

450
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,320
And... to hot babes. right?

451
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,740
Come on, jump in!
don't leave us hangin'.

452
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,670
here's to friends and hot babes!

453
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,240
Mmm! that is so good! mm!

454
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,710
Maybe we should each get our own.

455
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,680
Yeah.

456
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,400
Oh, no. there's a hair
in the scorpion bowl.

457
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,340
That's disgusting. are you sure?

458
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,370
He's joking. I'm joking.
there's no hair!

459
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,150
There's no hair.
see? she gets me. I love that.

460
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,960
So how do you two know each other?

461
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,520
Oh, we go way, way, way back.

462
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,540
I-i knew this one before she was
the famous wilhelmina slater.

463
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,450
To be honest, i-i'd be afraid
to go out with that woman.

464
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,300
I read somewhere that
she put out a memo

465
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,910
Firing anyone with a visible mole.

466
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,890
Well, haters love to hate. okay?

467
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,020
So tell me. you're her buddy.

468
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,570
Is she still the sweet
girl I remember?

469
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,110
Bobby told us about the fire.
it's a terrible thing.

470
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,900
Ah, excuse me.
yeah, but on the bright side,

471
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,930
You're gonna be getting
a big insurance check,

472
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,210
And you can buy some really
nice upgrades for your salon.

473
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,270
I guess. but I didn't
really want upgrades.

474
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,310
Hilda's beaulities plus
was doing just fine.

475
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,550
Yeah, but still, don't look a gift
horse in the mouth. oh, you're right.

476
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,380
That's interesting.
your son said "gift horse," too.

477
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,550
I tend to look at it as
the loss of my livelihood,

478
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,970
But then again,
I can go negative, so...

479
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,090
You know, uh, mr. s... mmm!

480
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,860
I was thinking... oh,
that looks good.

481
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,360
When you rebuild, marble floors
would look great in the house.

482
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,440
You know? especially with that
new crystal chandelier you got.

483
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,770
Crystal? yeah.

484
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,440
Ooh, very fancy.

485
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,790
Yeah, well, it's not really me.
I'm a simple man.

486
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,310
I may even get rid of it.

487
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,140
What? what are you talking about?

488
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,470
No way. come on, this guy loves
this chandelier. it's true.

489
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,340
Well, listen, if you decide
you wanna go with marble,

490
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,730
You let me know.

491
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,720
I can get you a deal.
we got family in construction.

492
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,380
Really? you have family
in construction? yeah.

493
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,850
I gotta get this. excuse me.

494
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,230
come here a second.

495
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,710
What happened to keeping an open mind? okay.
all right, open mind.

496
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,730
Thank you. mm-hmm.

497
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,370
>ci sar?morte!

498
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,750
Giuro su dio...

499
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,240
>e si concluder?
/i> nella tua morte!

500
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,880
I don't spk italian,

501
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,110
But "morte" means "death," right?

502
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,980
Very good. ah,
he's talking to his brother.

503
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,250
You ever get mad enough
at someone you tell 'em,

504
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,870
"i'm gonna kill ya"?

505
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,250
It's just, uh, it's an expression.

506
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,550
No, no, you don't understand.

507
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm really gonna kill you.

508
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,740
Look, uh, you're gonna
hear what you want to hear.

509
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,890
Wilhelna is so
supportive of all of us.

510
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,540
You know, if someone
is having a problem,

511
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,720
She's probably involved.

512
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,940
And if there are tears,

513
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,610
She's there.

514
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,510
Well, that's right.

515
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,630
Uh, just this morning,
kathy was in my office crying,

516
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,950
And I just rocked her and, uh,
gave her some makeup tips.

517
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,850
Aw. sounds like you guys
have a great time at work.

518
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,740
Well, it's not work.
it's--it really like a family.

519
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,270
Isn't it, betty?

520
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,750
Right.

521
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,440
You know what?

522
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,140
Just yesterday,

523
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,870
I totally screwed up a pitch
to lady gaga's people.

524
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,890
And, you know,

525
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,020
Another boss would've just
taken me off the project.

526
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,810
But wilhelmina, she was just like,
"try again, girl!"

527
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,090
That's right, girl. try again.

528
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,580
And you know what the best part is?

529
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,890
My nephew justin,
he still gets to meet lady gaga,

530
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,740
Who he loves almost as much
as he loves wilhelmina slater.

531
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,810
You know what would
be such a cool thing?

532
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,350
Is if wilhelmina called
justin and told him the news!

533
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,650
Yeah! call him!
he'll love that. yeah!

534
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,360
Do it! do it! do it! do it! do it!

535
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,470
Do it! call him! call him!
call him! call him! it's...

536
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,990
Do it! do it, willie! do it,
willie! do it, willie!

537
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,110
Call him... sorry.

538
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,760
Uh, hello? it's wilhelmina slater.

539
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,690
oh my god! hi.

540
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,810
That's him.

541
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,430
Be at "mode" tuesday at 4:00

542
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,250
Because you are going to
meet lady gaga. shut up!

543
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,880
Oh, my god. thank you so,
so much, wilhelmina.

544
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,660
Uh, nice talking to you! aah!

545
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,390
ooh, she seems really excited.

546
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,610
Thanks, wils.

547
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,860
Uh, betty, why don't we go, um,

548
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,930
Powder our noses? hmm?

549
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,930
Damn, hilda. you know,
you're not even trying.

550
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,970
Well, I'm sorry. but...

551
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,010
But every time one of
them opens their mouth,

552
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,990
A dead body falls out.
hey, that's not funny. come on.

553
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,150
You know, they heard rumors about
you back in the day. oh, please.

554
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,770
What rumors?

555
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,200
You know, rumors, like...
maybe you're not the kind of girl

556
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,240
That their sonhould
be going out with.

557
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,200
But at least they came
here with an open mind.

558
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,930
Are you telling me that
they're here to decide

559
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,990
Whether or not I'm a slut?

560
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,520
Jeez.

561
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,560
wilhelmina, I'm sorry.

562
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,520
You don't haveo give
me back the project.

563
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,730
It's just that my nephew
really wants to meet lady--

564
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,380
Oh, stop apologizing, betty.
playing the gaga card

565
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,080
Might've been the first time
I've ever respected you.

566
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,420
Really?

567
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,010
Now it's time for you and
your chubby municipal worker

568
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,460
To be on your way.

569
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,410
Right.

570
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,830
Um, I'll make up an excuse,
and we'll go.

571
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,410
Not that I'm gonna lose right.
any sleep over it,

572
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,120
But I'm surprised at your
choice of boyfriends.

573
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,420
I would think that even you
could do better than that.

574
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,740
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

575
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,640
I just need him to get my
family's inspection moved up.

576
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,350
Betty suarez--

577
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,580
Using a man to get what she wants?

578
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,710
You are full of surprises tonight.

579
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,560
No. it's not like that.

580
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,920
I--

581
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,200
There are extenuating
circumstances.

582
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,240
This isn't... really me.

583
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,580
And yet here you are.

584
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,300
Girl's gotta do what
a girl's gotta do.

585
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,420
Right?

586
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,580
I mean, it's just weird.
why is my mom hiring models?

587
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,660
Everybody knows that's my job.

588
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,260
And why that guy? I mean,
he's not even that good-looking.

589
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,940
Okay, first of all, he's crazy hot.
and second...

590
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,760
If you're actually
done with your rant,

591
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,140
I think I might have
your answer right here.

592
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
it's only february,

593
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,680
But it's already december
for claire meade--

594
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,520
May/december, that is.

595
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,980
The menopausal meade
matriarch has been spotted

596
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,290
Canoodling over noodles with
an age-inappropriate hottie.

597
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,780
And we don't think his palm

598
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,870
Is the only thing
she's been greasing.

599
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,250
you have got to be kidding me.

600
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,840
I know!

601
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,050
How does he eat pasta and
still look like that?

602
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,770
What are you doing here?

603
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,660
You know what? I already know.

604
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,460
I'm just waiting to talk to mrs. meade.
if you think I'm gonna stand by

605
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,320
And watch you take advantage of
my mother, you don't know me.

606
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,160
You--you got it all wrong, man.

607
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,530
I don't think so.

608
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,880
I think it's time for
you to leave, man.

609
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,400
Okay, you--you need to calm down.
or what? huh?

610
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,180
You gonna calm me down? get up!

611
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,070
I don't want you ever
around my mother!

612
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,090
Do you under-
what the hell is going on?!

613
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,500
this guy is playing you!

614
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,530
He's only interested in his
career and leeching off of you!

615
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,240
Daniel, stop. you don't know what
you're talking about. oh, yes, I do.

616
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,720
Everyone has seen you together.
it's embarrassing!

617
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,670
But it stops right now.

618
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,830
Are you gonna tell him,
or should i? tell me what?

619
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,530
Tyler is not who you think he is.
well, who is he then?

620
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,730
He's your brother.

621
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,770
Well, I hate to cut
this thing short,

622
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,950
But I did promise my dad

623
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,590
That we'd be home
in time for dessert.

624
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,990
He's dying to meet one of america's heroes.
I get that all the time.

625
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,640
Shall we? hey,
you know what? I got an idea.

626
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,350
Why don't you guys come
with us? we can, uh,

627
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,580
We can get some dessert,
we can get a couple of pictures

628
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,700
Of the old man,
and then... karaoke. no, jimmy.

629
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,150
Come on. they don't-
they don't want to.

630
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,600
You know what?
that sounds like fun. what?!

631
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,040
What? obviously, she doesn't want

632
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,330
To be alone with this guy.
why did you do that?

633
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,070
Let's just go back to her
house for a little while.

634
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,250
'cause we're having fun.

635
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,100
They don't want to hang out with us.
come on, she's your friend.

636
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,550
No! betty suarez is not my friend,

637
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,670
And I'm not going back
to some tenement mud hut

638
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,080
In little mexico!
I live in chelsea.

639
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,210
Don, I can't take it anymore!

640
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,550
I'm a bitch!
I'm a stone-cold bitch.

641
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,130
My favorite mome of the day

642
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,070
Is throwing out my breakfast muffin

643
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,150
In front of a homeless person.

644
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,170
Anyone who has a mole is an idiot!

645
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,970
And everything you've
read about me is true,

646
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,190
Or might as well be true.

647
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,800
And as long as we're being honest,

648
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,430
I'm starting to remember
why I really liked you--

649
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,180
The amazing sex. so if you
want to do that again, fine.

650
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,090
But this time, I'm on top.

651
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,230
I'm good with that

652
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,420
Now all I'm saying is,
your boss seems kind of psycho,

653
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,750
Which I did not see coming.

654
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,760
I'm a pretty good
judge of character.

655
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,420
Like, i, uh, I knew right away
that you were the girl for me.

656
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,300
I usually like blondes!
you know what?

657
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,140
I'm not usually the one to be
defending wilhelmina slater,

658
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
But at least she was being honest.

659
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,070
I mean, isn't that better than
what we're doing? what do you mean?

660
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,800
Us on this date?

661
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,220
I mean, I'm only here

662
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,060
So that you can help move my family's
name up the list. wait a minute.

663
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,420
You're using me?

664
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,970
That's awful.
I thought you liked me.

665
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,690
Jimmy, come on.
I mean, you basically said

666
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,110
That if I went out with you, you would help.
whoa. I would never say that.

667
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,580
You kind of did.

668
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,950
You were all like, "oh,
my aunt's a fire inspector,"

669
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,700
And then you got all
wink-y and--and...

670
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,230
I mean, what was that?
that is my thing.

671
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,840
It's charming!

672
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,770
You know what?
I am america's freaking hero.

673
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,000
I don't need any of that
crap to get a date! jimmy--

674
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,500
Forget it! I'm not taking you back!

675
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,070
And your family is going
to the bottom of the list!

676
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,140
And yoi mean,ly is going
this doesn't make any sense.

677
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,930
Why didn't you ever tell me?
it was a long time ago.

678
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,580
You were too young to understand.
but you told us you were in rehab!

679
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,700
Mom, you went away for a year!

680
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,940
I did the best I could
under the circumstances.

681
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,880
Okay. so who's the father, huh?

682
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,950
Obviously, it's not dad.

683
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,350
Don't tell me it was hartley.

684
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,880
You had a kid with him?

685
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,350
I don't believe this.

686
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
Daniel, daniel, please.

687
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,150
No, no. I spent my whole life
thinking you were the victim.

688
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,010
My relationship with dad was crap

689
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,200
Because I always sided with you.

690
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,570
I never thought for a second

691
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,350
That you were just as
screwed up as he was.

692
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,160
This doesn't sound
like you, justin.

693
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,290
Why were you smoking? look,
I was only doing it

694
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,230
To impress someone in
my acting class, though.

695
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,970
Someone I like.

696
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,420
So we're here again.

697
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,560
So you like someone.

698
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,340
Well, tell me about them.

699
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,840
What is... their name?

700
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,600
Lily.

701
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,750
Lily. cool.

702
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,390
Everybody okay? whew! we're full.

703
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,200
Are you done with your puttanesca?

704
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,340
Oh, honey, this is not puttanesca.

705
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,570
Oh. well, apparently
it is when I serve it.

706
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,460
I mean, it is italian for
"whore sauce," right?

707
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,320
Hilda! no, we're not
gonna go there, please.

708
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,400
Bobby, what is she talking about?
I will tell you what I am talking about.

709
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,510
You got some nerve,

710
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,210
Coming here to find out
what kind of person I am

711
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,750
When you and your mafia family
burned down my salon! wait a minute!

712
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,660
What, you think we burned down your salon?
tony, get the coats.

713
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,310
We're out of here, you understand?

714
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,310
Hi, I'm betty. hey,
no one's going anywhere, all right?

715
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,440
I am out of here. hello.

716
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,320
Uh, uh, hilda doesn't think
you burned down her salon.

717
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,330
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
maybe you hired someone.

718
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,920
I don't know how these
things work! what?!

719
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,700
Hilda, please! what is going on?
why is everyone yelling?

720
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,350
Tony, the coats!

721
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,670
I'll get the coats.

722
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,170
We make it a point
not to stay in places

723
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,400
Where people think
we're in the mob.

724
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,680
Not that that happens
that often. ha!

725
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,160
No! okay... what, "no"?

726
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,210
We're gonna figure out a way
for everybody to get along.

727
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,600
That is not gonna happen!

728
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,370
Well, it has to,
ma! this is the woman

729
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,430
I want to spend my life with.
oh, my god!

730
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,120
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I got something to say.

731
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,620
I think bobby is talking.

732
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,770
I started the fire. what?

733
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,630
What? I told you guys I'd hire
an electrician for the dimmer.

734
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,680
I did it myself.

735
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,590
Papi! you could've hurt yourself!

736
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,940
Forget that! he hurt my
business because you had to get

737
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,030
All highfalutin with your fancy
chandelier! no, mom, stop! stop!

738
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,430
It's not grandpa's fault because...

739
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,410
I started the fire.

740
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,230
What? justin, what do you mean?

741
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,780
Well, I was smoking and--

742
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,860
You were what-ing?!

743
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,900
Well, at least our
family doesn't smoke.

744
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,330
Do you have any idea what
you have put us through?!

745
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,880
That's it. you're grounded
until you're dead. you know,

746
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,560
If you want to shave some
years off of it, keep smoking!

747
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,460
At least now we know
that it wasn't my family.

748
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,070
We don't know anything
about your family!

749
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,090
Okay! please, everyone, stop!

750
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,040
It doesn't matter who
started the fire.

751
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,090
What's important is that

752
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,430
We don't start turning
against each other.

753
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,760
We might have to be
here a very long time,

754
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,120
So we need to find a
way to make it work

755
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,550
Without ruining projects
or spitting on hats,

756
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,900
And showers beg taken
at all hours of the day.

757
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,330
Who cares if it was faulty
wiring or smoking or the mob?

758
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,050
No disrespect.

759
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,630
We just have to get through this.
it was a curling iron.

760
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,330
Oh, who's this guy?

761
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,440
Jimmy, what?
what are you doing here?

762
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,340
I was acting like a d-bag.

763
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,420
And you were right.
I did want to go out with you.

764
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,850
That's why I didn't tell you

765
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,580
That they did the
inspection yesterday.

766
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,700
So... yeah. uh, someone left
a curling iron on oh! so!

767
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,970
It was you. hmm?

768
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,600
Nuh-unh! I didn't even
have clients that day!

769
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,540
Besides, I prefer velcro rollers.

770
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,740
Wait. aunt betty...

771
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,830
You had a curl in your
hair the day of the fire.

772
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,600
What?

773
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,260
hmm, if I put in two curls,

774
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,050
It'll ally frame my face.

775
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,280
But one curl makes
more of a statement.

776
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,200
One or two?

777
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,610
One or two?

778
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,770
Betty, get in here!

779
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,880
Oh, my god.

780
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,200
It was me.

781
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,060
Mija, it was an accident.

782
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,300
You have to stop
beating yourself up.

783
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,010
I feel like a terrible person.

784
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,260
Ugh, don't worry.
I'm coming up with a list

785
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,130
Of things you could do
to make it up to us.

786
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,360
Smokers don't get to
make jokes or lists.

787
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,970
It's just...

788
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,820
For the last two days,
all I've been doing

789
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,340
Is trying to get you
guys out of my apartment.

790
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,240
I mean...

791
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,240
I even went on a date
with that annoying fire--

792
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,450
Hey, watch what you say,
you little firebug.

793
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,990
I might not take you out again.
you should probably go.

794
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,020
Leave the ladle.

795
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,870
Hey, amanda, it's me.

796
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,590
Look, I really, uh,
need to see you tonight.

797
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,240
Can--can I come over?

798
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,560
Uh, daniel,
I wish you could, but, um,

799
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,340
I'm kind of busy right now.

800
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,440
Can I call you later
when I get home? no.

801
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,420
No, no, don't-
don't worry about it.

802
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,030
Are you sure?

803
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,470
No, no, it's fine.

804
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,440
I'll just, um, you know,
see you tomorrow.

805
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,080
How can you even talk to that guy?

806
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,650
Okay, you had a bad
moment with him,

807
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,270
But daniel is really great.

808
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:23,300
Well...  thanks for not
ditching me tonight.

809
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,140
I could really use a friend.

810
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,920
Well, you've got one.

811
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,980
Mrs. talerio, I just
want to say one more time

812
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,220
How sorry I am.
it's all right, honey.

813
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,330
You forget about
what we said to you,

814
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,510
And we'll forget about
what you said to us.

815
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,410
And we'll start fresh,
okay? all right. okay.

816
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,870
Dina, come on, let's go. they want to
make out already. I love yous guys.

817
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,520
All right, good night.
get home safe! all right, I love you.

818
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,920
Oh-ho-ho! okay.

819
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,380
I'm glad that worked out.

820
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,140
Oh, yeah? yeah.

821
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,090
Why? because you want to spend
the rest of your life with me?

822
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,930
Aw, come on.

823
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,820
I was just saying that
to calm everybody down.

824
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,110
It's nothing.

825
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,860
What?

826
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,690
You know what,
talericio? forget it.

827
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,540
Come on. no.

828
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,870
I know that you're not

829
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,330
The flower and candy
type of guy, but...

830
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,540
If there ever comes a day,
you better do it right.

831
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,060
Hey, hilda.

832
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,490
Hilda, wait.

833
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,680
I've been carrying this
around a couple of weeks.

834
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,280
Oh, my god.

835
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,660
You know, I figure,
we get through a night like tonight,

836
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,500
We can get through anything, right?

837
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,620
I lost you a long time ago.

838
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,600
I won't let that happen again.

839
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,370
So, yes, I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

840
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,330
Hilda suarez, I love you.

841
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,140
Will you marry me?

842
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,240
You did it right.

843
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,670
Yes.

844
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,300
Well, the good thing is that

845
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,280
We'll get the insurance check soon,

846
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,790
And you'll get your apartment back.
oh, come on, papi.

847
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,250
This has been really fun,

848
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,460
Like a slumber party
that never ends.

849
