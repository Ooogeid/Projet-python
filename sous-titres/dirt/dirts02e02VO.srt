00:00:03,677 --> 00:00:04,715
Hi, Lucy.

3
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:07,552
You ruined my life.

4
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:18,813
You're alright, Lucy.
Yeah, you're alright.

5
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,775
Hello, everyone. Vacation's over.

6
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:22,941
Spiller!

7
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,694
- You're...
- ... alive.

8
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:25,862
How's the injection going?

9
00:00:26,022 --> 00:00:27,364
No, I'm sick.

10
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:29,157
You're sick, I'm sick,
we're all sick.

11
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:31,701
I'm gonna give you
the shot now, okay?

12
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:33,453
I'm starting to feel... normal.

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,621
Holt McLaren.

14
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:35,872
Don Konkey.

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,764
Did you tell her
I tried to visit her?

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,085
Yeah.

17
00:00:40,904 --> 00:00:41,753
No.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,130
- Your name is Kenny?
- Yes. Is that a problem?

19
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,423
Well, it was for the last guy.

20
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,590
What happened to the last guy?

21
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:47,717
He got shot in the head.

22
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:49,152
This is Farber Kaufman.

23
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:50,386
He's a staff reporter

24
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:52,764
who'll be gunning for
all of your jobs.

25
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:54,999
Uh, Lucy, should
I just be following you?

26
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,034
That one's yours.

27
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:57,935
- Excuse me, that is my desk.
- I know.

28
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,214
Is that Sharlee Cates?

29
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:00,479
This is the thanks that I get?

30
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:01,522
Get your camera out.

31
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,149
- Okay.
- Hurry.

32
00:01:03,872 --> 00:01:05,860
Sharlee Cates would be
a great get now.

33
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:07,654
Get it, Don.

34
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,490
Freakin'move!

35
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:11,950
Move!

36
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:18,081
Back off! Back off!

37
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:22,085
Come on! Give me a sad face.

38
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:25,829
Hey, Holt! Hey, come on!

39
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:27,632
Ain't it in bad taste
to be out clubbing

40
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,135
so soon after Julia's death?

41
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:31,511
Bad taste? Yeah.

42
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:34,340
You know what I think is bad taste

43
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,181
is you guys following me
around everywhere I go,

44
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:38,351
asking me this
and that about Julia.

45
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:39,853
- Did you even know her?
- No.

46
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:41,632
No, I didn't think so.

47
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,152
Didn't have the pleasure.

48
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:44,815
You know what's even more funny

49
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,609
<i>about that whole situation is,</i>

50
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:48,681
is now, what?
You're just gonna make

51
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,552
all this money off of her?

52
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:53,408
What, to sell your magazines
and your clip shows?

53
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:55,238
She's dead, bro.

54
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:57,424
Sell your magazines,
your clip shows.

55
00:01:57,544 --> 00:01:58,819
Screw him.

56
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,607
The bitch stabbed Lucy,
now he's defending her?

57
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:03,960
People, people, people,

58
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,180
I didn't get my liver nicked
to have Holt McLaren

59
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,130
on my cover saying
that we're the bad guys.

60
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:10,456
Willa, are you with us?

61
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:11,505
Sorry.

62
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,485
Um, you've got to hear
what somebody sent in.

63
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:16,219
It's anonymous,
but it's really good.

64
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:18,887
- Do you mind if I...
- Yes, anything's better than this.

65
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:19,850
Uncle Jimmy?

66
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,935
God, is that turd still on the air?

67
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:24,679
That turd just syndicated
for two mil an episode.

68
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,357
It's the last great family sitcom.

69
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:27,497
I love his standup.

70
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:30,166
Yeah, this is a slightly
different performance from him.

71
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:32,397
<i>Krista,</i>

72
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:35,126
<i>it's your father calling again.
Thursday night.</i>

73
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,943
<i>You know what, you told me
you were coming down here,</i>

74
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:39,348
<i>so I set aside seats for you
and your goddamn friends,</i>

75
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:40,753
<i>and now I'm about to do a show,</i>

76
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:41,789
<i>and you're not here once again,</i>

77
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:44,214
<i>so I look like an ass
with my dick in my hands</i>

78
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,753
<i>because my frickin'daughter
didn't show up, okay?</i>

79
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,629
<i>Well, listen,
you wanna know something?</i>

80
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,799
<i>You're a stupid little
narcissist, do ya hear me?</i>

81
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,395
<i>I don't care if you're 14 or 15
or however the hell old you are.</i>

82
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:55,820
<i>You say you don't have my love,</i>

83
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,569
<i>you say you don't have my respect.</i>

84
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:00,275
<i>Goddamn it, you don't deserve
my respect, do you hear me?</i>

85
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:02,227
<i>You don't deserve it
because you're selfish,</i>

86
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:04,420
<i>and you're hollow,
and I don't give a shit</i>

87
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,126
<i>about you and your slutty
cheerleader friends!</i>

88
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:09,869
<i>Press "1" to play
the current message again.</i>

89
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,780
And to think I used to hate people
who left long messages.

90
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,928
Is it exclusive?

91
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,243
Well, I'm thinking
that the person who sent it in

92
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,366
is probably spreading it around.

93
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,362
He's a major sitcom star.

94
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:20,699
We gotta find out
who sent it and why,

95
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,454
if it's edited, if it's real,
what's going on.

96
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,248
Yeah, I was gonna
start with his ex-wife.

97
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,290
You think?

98
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:29,503
What's happening?

99
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:30,943
Turn on the news.

100
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:34,127
<i>Hold on, we do now
have an official statement</i>

101
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,533
<i>from the CHP press op confirming</i>

102
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,695
<i>that celebutante Milan Carlton
was just stopped by the police</i>

103
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:44,561
<i>trying to drive onto the 405 freeway
using the off-ramp.</i>

104
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:47,647
<i>It could be a problem for Milan
if she's been drinking...</i>

105
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:50,733
If? The girl drinks so much,
she probably pees rubbing alcohol.

106
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:52,569
<i>Look, you can't even see the sign.</i>

107
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,071
<i>Are you high?
My parents paid for that on-ramp.</i>

108
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:56,447
<i>We can't leave my car.</i>

109
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,740
<i>Ow! That's my boob.</i>

110
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:00,493

115
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,565
All right, let's make room for Milan

116
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:20,605
and her yapping purse-mutt.

117
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,436
The Cupcake House? Whose is this?

118
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:28,395
That's... That's mine.

119
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:30,208
The guy builds a house out of cupcakes.

120
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:31,184
That's the story?

121
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,025
He did it to win the heart
of the woman he loved.

122
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:35,016
She's crazy about cupcakes. It's...

123
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,211
... sweet.

124
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:38,266
Well, sweet.
It's insane, but sweet.

125
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,153
All right, we'll use it next week.

126
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:41,712
But get a better shot of him

127
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,290
eating her icing
off the wall or something.

128
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,493
Well, they broke up.

129
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,466
Not in my magazine. Get the shot.

130
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,783
All right, Milan is our cover,

131
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:49,211
but, of course, she's going to be
everyone's cover,

132
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,520
so what I wanna know is how she's
gonna get out of going to jail.

133
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,037
Yeah, isn't she going to jail
right now on live TV?

134
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:58,824
<i>... night court judge
has rescinded her parole,</i>

135
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,713
<i>mandating her to serve out
the remainder of her sentence</i>

136
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,483
here at the county jail.

137
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:05,824
Milan Carlton is
a spoiled little billionaire

138
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:07,888
who's gotten away with
everything her whole life.

139
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:08,982
Why waste time?

140
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,251
Let's just figure out
how her daddy's

141
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:12,771
gonna use his money
to get his little girl off.

142
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,734
- Did I just say that?
- Yeah.

143
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,778
Oddly aroused.

144
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,229
All right, find out.

145
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,065
That's how we afford
the cappuccino runs.

146
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:21,957
They pay for cappuccino runs?

147
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:23,887
I'm thinking that that
was a figure of speech,

148
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,370
but you can go ask her.

149
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:29,624
Oh, hey, Lucy.

150
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:30,915
Heard about Milan?

151
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,452
Yeah, I'm on my way now.

152
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,802
You and the entire
press corps, right?

153
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:36,713
Everybody knows.

154
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:38,864
<i>You putting cream on your wound?</i>

155
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:40,114
As we speak.

156
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:42,416
<i>You know, Cabernet does not count.</i>

157
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:44,819
Do you have a hidden camera in here?

158
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,277
<i>No, I just know your voice.</i>

159
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:47,641
Plus I heard you sip.

160
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:49,390
Well, it's Pinot, not Cabernet,

161
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,330
and, yes, I will put my cream on

162
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,259
if you get a shot
of Milan in lock-up.

163
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,275
But hurry. She'll be out
before her 10:00 Pilates class.

164
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:57,357
Okay.

165
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:58,477
<i>Thanks.</i>

166
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:00,778
Are you all right?

167
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:01,898
I'm fine.

168
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,159
You really don't like her,
do you? Milan.

169
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,655
Are you kidding?

170
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:07,972
I love her.

171
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:09,372
Get the shot.

172
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,719
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

173
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:14,348
Dude.

174
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:19,924
You got a smoke?

175
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,166
Dude?

176
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,680
You got a cigarette?

177
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:30,518
You're real.

178
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:34,313
Look, if you don't smoke,
just say so. Christ!

179
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,150
Man, this job sucks.

180
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:39,944
I knew you were real!

181
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:42,255
Hey, man.

182
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:43,597
All right?

183
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,873
I'm giving you the finger here!

184
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:51,593
Weird.

185
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:57,127
Lucy?

186
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:58,421
Are you okay?

187
00:06:58,582 --> 00:06:59,582
Yeah.

188
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:01,203
Every time the cleaning crew comes,

189
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,676
they move this to plug in the vacuum,
and they don't put it back.

190
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:05,702
How's America's
favorite sitcom dad?

191
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:09,681
His voicemail attacking his daughter
is now on the web.

192
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,971
Um, it is YouTube's number one hit.

193
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:13,086
If you're gonna leave
everything a mess,

194
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,311
it's not really cleaning, is it?

195
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:15,172
No.

196
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:16,342
What about the ex-wife?

197
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:17,608
Well, the divorce is final,

198
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,683
but they're still having
major custody issues.

199
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:22,416
She and her lawyers
have been court ordered

200
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:24,113
to keep everything
out of the media,

201
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:25,957
so, basically,
if she leaked the tape...

202
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,159
Then she'd be guilty of using us.

203
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,536
Hate when people do that.
Get proof.

204
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,079
Yeah, that's not gonna be easy.

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,667
Did I say easy?

206
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,719
No, easy would be moving the furniture
back after you've vacuumed.

207
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,293
- You want that job?
- No.

208
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:41,328
I'll find out who had access to the
voicemail,

209
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:43,154
the mother, the lawyer, and see
if they shared it with anyone.

210
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:45,051
- Good start.
- Yeah. Okay.

211
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:52,760
Oh, man.

212
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,093
Hurts. Hurts. Hurts. Hurts.

213
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,293
<i>Hey, Don. What's going on?</i>

214
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:20,545
I got a guy here.

215
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:21,878
Don't you always?

216
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:23,858
<i>Yeah, well, he's in booking.</i>

217
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,519
<i>He always gets me in
no matter what.</i>

218
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,610
But this time he says
it's impossible.

219
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,969
But, Don, nothing's impossible.

220
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,638
They got her in a private cell

221
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,350
away from the rest
of the prison population,

222
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,267
so, you know, I can't
sneak in as a guard.

223
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,807
They're having her meals
prepared privately,

224
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:37,936
so catering's out.

225
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:41,898
And she's in a new uniform,
so you can forget about laundry.

226
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,503
Okay, she's in isolation.

227
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:45,986
<i>Yeah, for her safety,</i>

228
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:48,288
for the safety of the rest
of the prison population.

229
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:49,156
That's the quote.

230
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:50,767
Yeah, and bullshit.

231
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:54,675
Okay, I'm thinking.

232
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:58,667
Oh, I put cream on my wound
last night and this morning.

233
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:00,376
Oh, yeah, that's good.

234
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,261
<i>Okay, I got it.</i>

235
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:04,796
<i>Remember that skank from Bel Air,</i>

236
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:06,077
the one with the one-hit song

237
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,549
who killed her husband
with a lawnmower?

238
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,558
You got that great shot
when you were on the rooftop

239
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,915
<i>of her coming out of isolation
to general population.</i>

240
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,222
Get in place.

241
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:15,383
Okay.

242
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,839
Lucy, are they gonna move her?

243
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,911
Someone get me the spokesperson
for the jail on the line.

244
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,542
Oh, they're moving her.

245
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:24,902
They are definitely moving her.

246
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,613
Spokesman for the jail
for you, line two.

247
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,355
- Sam Greer.
- Thank you.

248
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,033
Sam Greer.

249
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:40,458
Hi, it's Lucy Spiller over at Dirt.

250
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:42,578
Yes, my people came to me
with a story,

251
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:45,337
and I wanted to give you the courtesy
of a call before running it.

252
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:46,751
Yeah, it's about
the special treatment

253
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:49,186
that Milan Carlton's
getting in your jail.

254
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:52,085
The personal chef,
the fresh clothes, special cell.

255
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:55,691
I hear she has an acupuncturist
coming this afternoon.

256
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,328
Okay, well, that may be true,
but the rest checks out.

257
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,896
I don't hear you
denying the special cell.

258
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:03,830
Okay, great.

259
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,212
Yeah, get back to me
within the hour,

260
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:06,943
and I will hold the story.

261
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:08,063
Thank you.

262
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:10,642
Any progress?

263
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:13,001
Uh, yeah, Milan's
parents and grandparents

264
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:16,277
have been major contributors
to every major political campaign,

265
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,788
local, national,
republican, democrat.

266
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:20,100
Equal opportunity payola.

267
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,776
Locally they supported
the judges, the DA, the mayor.

268
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:24,847
That'll get her out.

269
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,420
Yeah. Well, she's still in.

270
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,010
Yeah, but you have to
keep up appearances.

271
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:31,592
She did plead guilty once.
Violated her parole.

272
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:33,901
It's hard to get out of that,
even with political contacts.

273
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,793
I guarantee you,
Milan will be sleeping

274
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:37,763
in her own pink,
frilly bed tonight.

275
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,583
What, do you not
trust my instincts?

276
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,063
No, yeah, I do.

277
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:45,439
No, you don't.

278
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,899
No, trust me, I trust you.

279
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,843
All right, how about this?

280
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:54,086
I give you 100-1 odds that
Milan Carlton is home by midnight.

281
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:55,588
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

282
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,402
Milan Carlton will not
spend this night in jail.

283
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,190
Don.

284
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,791
- 100-1?
- Hold on one second.

285
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,834
You're saying that
if I put up 100 bucks...

286
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:08,758
If she gets out by midnight,
I take your 100.

287
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,757
If she spends one second past midnight,
I owe you 10 grand.

288
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,015
10 grand.

289
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:15,469
- How about it?
- Yeah. Okay.

290
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,365
You need to learn a lesson.

291
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,111
<i>Are you in place?</i>

292
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:22,231
Almost.

293
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:24,407
<i>Are you alone?</i>

294
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:25,645
Yeah.

295
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,605
Good. I made the call.
It should happen soon.

296
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:28,766
Okay.

297
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,117
<i>Milan Carlton is being moved</i>

298
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:36,471
<i>out of an isolation cell
in the tower,</i>

299
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:38,824
<i>in with the jail's
general population.</i>

300
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:41,824
<i>This is in no way reaction
to public pressure.</i>

301
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,722
<i>It's part of normal prisoner intake
and processing procedure.</i>

302
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:49,319
<i>Miss Carlton is receiving
no special treatment here.</i>

303
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:51,062
<i>She's an ordinary inmate.</i>

304
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,416
<i>That's the way
she's gonna be treated.</i>

305
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,679
<i>No questions.</i>

306
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:22,429
Hi.

307
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,875
Love you.

308
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:27,596
Ladies and gentlemen,
Drrthas just obtained

309
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:29,607
exclusive photos of Milan Carlton

310
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,122
being transfered to
general jail population.

311
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:34,403
Farber, the bet's still on.

312
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,970
She's gonna be out by midnight.

313
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,300
And when she is,

314
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:38,931
I want to know why.

315
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,592
<i>Dad, why are you eating
spaghetti on the floor?</i>

316
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,690
<i>I'm Petey the dog,
and this is my doggie bowl.</i>

317
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:54,087
It's another Jimmy Darby clip.

318
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,526
It hit an hour ago.
It's already in YouTube's top 5.

319
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:00,328
Makes me feel a lot better
about my father.

320
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:01,585
<i>I'm not drunk!</i>

321
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:03,768
<i>I'm totally friggin'sober!</i>

322
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:05,788
<i>You're drunk, Dad. I'm sober!</i>

323
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,707
This is nothing.
At least he's not hitting anybody.

324
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:10,758
Your father hit you?

325
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,855
How pissed is Lucy gonna be
that I'm behind on this?

326
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,608
Well, it hit an hour ago.
We don't go to press for days.

327
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:19,604
How are you behind?

328
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,757
I just got a call from Darby's ex

329
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:25,299
saying that she had absolutely
nothing to do with leaking either tape,

330
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:26,952
and then I got a call
from her lawyer

331
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,795
giving some not too subtle threats
if we imply that she did.

332
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,404
Well, the ex-wife's
a likely suspect.

333
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,056
She's the one
with something to gain.

334
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:35,150
She can't sue for speculation.

335
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,027
You don't know Lucy Spiller
very well, do you?

336
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:38,153
Really?

337
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:39,587
You'll learn.

338
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,888
Hey, where you going?

339
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,645
Back to school.

340
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,598
Thanks so much.

341
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:47,977
It's always so hard
to find your way around

342
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:49,653
a new school
the first week, you know?

343
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:50,773
Sure.

344
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:52,727
I hate moving, but, um,

345
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:54,694
my dad just got, like, indicted

346
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,464
at his last job in Florida, so...

347
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,029
Here we are.

348
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,579
At least the press isn't camped
outside our lawn anymore.

349
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:03,089
- Sucks.
- Totally.

350
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:07,503
This girl in gym told me
that you were Jimmy Darby's kid,

351
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:08,975
so you, like, know, right?

352
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:10,300
She knows enough
to spot the difference

353
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,521
between a new junior
and an old reporter.

354
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:14,372
- What?
- I'm sorry?

355
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:15,273
Don't say a word, Christa.

356
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:16,575
She's a reporter.

357
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,305
I just transferred here.

358
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,953
From what, early retirement?

359
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:21,196
You're, like, 30.

360
00:14:21,357 --> 00:14:23,394
- I'm 24.
- Whatever.

361
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,137
I told you they'd be all over.

362
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:26,456
Let's have her arrested.

363
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:29,276
All right, look,
I'm really sorry that I lied, but...

364
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,979
everybody is doing this story,
and nobody is getting Christa's side.

365
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,293
And you're here
to do her that favor.

366
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,841
No, I'm just here to get a story.

367
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,806
Look, all I'm saying is that...

368
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,082
You're caught in the middle.

369
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:42,833
I mean, your mother's
the one that leaked the tape.

370
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:44,636
- It's not your fault.
- My mother didn't leak anything.

371
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,771
No, Christa, don't.
No, I'm sick of it. I really am.

372
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:51,085
We fired the maid, the handy man,
the dog walker.

373
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:53,799
And, you know, I really,
really liked our dog walker.

374
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,855
You people are the ones
out there buying this stuff,

375
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:58,025
tempting people to steal and sell.

376
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:00,327
I didn't ask for this, okay?

377
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:01,737
- I'm sorry.
- No.

378
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:03,342
You're not.

379
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:04,773
It's a good story.

380
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:07,575
You think it's easy growing up
with screwed up parents,

381
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:09,861
being the big
online joke at school?

382
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:12,169
Please, just let me get to my class

383
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,208
and leave me
and my messed up family alone.

384
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:17,335
Got your quote?

385
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:18,446
Look, I didn't mean to...

386
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:20,717
I didn't know about the phone message,
but the video?

387
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,083
Christa just thought

388
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:24,342
she could scare her dad
straight or whatever.

389
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:25,853
She borrowed my brother's camera,

390
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:28,788
and totally deleted everything
before she gave it back.

391
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,892
She never intended it to get out.

392
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,327
It was between her...

393
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:34,137
and her father.

394
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:36,558
Period.

395
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:48,909
Farber, you owe me 100 bucks.

396
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,395
- She's getting out?
- Undisclosed medical condition.

397
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:53,876
More like jailophobia.

398
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:55,261
Pay up.

399
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:56,709
You're seriously
gonna take my 100 bucks?

400
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,921
Only if you don't
hand it over willingly.

401
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,503
Oh, come on, like you wouldn't
take my 10 grand?

402
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,590
You know, I wasn't gonna
take your ten grand.

403
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,172
You need to learn a lesson.

404
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,537
Trust my instincts.

405
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:08,511
Best money you ever spent.

406
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:10,423
Thank you.

407
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:15,327
Look at her, all prim and proper.

408
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:19,044
She went in looking like Betty Blowjob,
and out like Laura Bush.

409
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:21,173
You think her mother styled her?

410
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:23,611
No, she's just as retarded as she is.

411
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:25,861
No, that's the work of a pro.

412
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:28,874
Farber, find out who
all went to see her in jail.

413
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,168
If I find out who styled her,
can I win back my hundred?

414
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:32,093
No.

415
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,081
Wow. Nice knee socks.

416
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:37,655
Have anything?

417
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,237
Yeah, I got a great quote
from the daughter.

418
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:40,496
Maybe something from the friend.

419
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,045
Okay, I want to know
who released the tape and why.

420
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:43,296
Yeah, I might have a lead.

421
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:44,742
Have it by recess.

422
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:48,968
Do I look 30?

423
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:53,303
Not in a Catholic school girl uniform,
you don't.

424
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:54,474
Wait, do you want to?

425
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:55,635
What?

426
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:14,075
I thought we weren't talking.

427
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:15,445
<i>Uh, we're not.</i>

428
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:17,706
I'm just calling
to congratulate you.

429
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:21,043
What, is this an interview?

430
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:23,721
<i>Milan Carlton's pretty much
taking over the whole issue.</i>

431
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,241
Lucky you, I don't need a quote.

432
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:27,341
But, unfortunately,
it also means that

433
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:30,329
<i>your PR play outside the club
won't make it into print,</i>

434
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,983
<i>which is really too bad</i>
because that was well played.

435
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:34,284
<i>I didn't play anything.</i>

436
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:36,853
Come on, that wasn't a PR move,

437
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,079
I just said what I felt, you know?

438
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,199
Okay.

439
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:44,560
I wouldn't expect you
to believe me, Lucy.

440
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,776
Good.

441
00:17:54,195 --> 00:17:57,369
But you know,
one thing I've learned...

442
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:00,874
the more energy you put in

443
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:02,515
<i>to being angry with others,</i>

444
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:04,512
the less you have
to face yourself, so...

445
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:06,213
Are you going to therapy now?

446
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:08,789
Maybe.

447
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,522
Well, let's just hope
you can trust him.

448
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:18,350
Well, I gotta catch a flight.

449
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:19,665
Okay.

450
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:21,228
Have a great trip.

451
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:22,389
You, too.

452
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:24,481
I mean...

453
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:27,364
thank you.

454
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:29,677
Bye.

455
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:35,159
Hi.

456
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,661
How long have you been
standing there?

457
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,839
I brought you the pictures
of Milan in jail.

458
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,042
Also her getting out.

459
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,959
- It's been quite a day.
- Yeah.

460
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:49,114
How's Holt?

461
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,297
On the phone just now.

462
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:53,919
How do you know
I was talking to Holt?

463
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,179
Body language.

464
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,724
My body languages says
I'm talking to Holt right now.

465
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:00,504
Before, on the phone.

466
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,755
Now it just says you don't know
where to put your elbows.

467
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,293
Well, they're attached
to my forearms.

468
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:06,755
Let's not read too much into it.

469
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,779
Okay, but if you don't want
people to know about you two...

470
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,166
Don't do that when
you're talking to him.

471
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:12,441
Don't do what?

472
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:14,743
Don, I wasn't doing anything.

473
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,307
Okay, I was not doing that.

474
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:18,017
Okay, now I don't know
what to do with my forearms.

475
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:19,100
- Sorry.
- Okay.

476
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,205
Is this all you have
of her coming out of jail?

477
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:22,371
Yeah.

478
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,633
Looks like Mother Theresa.

479
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:24,829
It's the outfit.

480
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:26,376
Light blue and white.

481
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:27,799
Like Mother Theresa.

482
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,604
All right, get 'em to art.

483
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:31,232
Okay.

484
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,531
Even the network news
is recycling the Milan story.

485
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:43,653
So much for covering
the bombings in Iraq.

486
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:44,824
- Hey, Farber.
- Yeah?

487
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:46,787
She going back to jail or not?

488
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,898
- Wanna lay odds?
- Uh, I don't know.

489
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:51,309
You're smart. You're learning.
Visitors?

490
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:52,915
Her mother and her lawyers.

491
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,704
No red flags, but I'm
still working on it.

492
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:55,824
All right, find something good.

493
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,001
They may just have to have her back.

494
00:19:57,121 --> 00:20:00,387
Hey, Lucy, we got Milan Carlton
on line three.

495
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,139
- Her publicist?
- Her.

496
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:04,816
She said she wants
to speak to you directly.

497
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:06,813
Yeah.

498
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,177
Thank you for taking my call.

499
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:15,280
<i>Always happy to talk to
one of our biggest sellers.</i>

500
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,783
All that circulation,
and I don't make anything out of it.

501
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:19,895
Something tells me you do okay.

502
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:20,888
<i>Not this week.</i>

503
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:24,081
There's a few things
I'd like to clear up,

504
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:26,769
and I was thinking about doing
an interview with your magazine.

505
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:27,716
Of course.

506
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:29,424
<i>I'd like to meet you in person.</i>

507
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:30,481
Can we arrange that?

508
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:32,415
I wish I could come to you,

509
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:34,736
but I'm kind of under
a bit of house arrest here.

510
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,113
I'll come to you.

511
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:38,681
Fabo!

512
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:41,093
I'll have my guy call your guy, okay?

513
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:42,035
Ciao.

514
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:45,831
Fabo.

515
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:39,654
Lucy Spiller. Thank
you so much for coming.

516
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,242
Can Mariella get you something
to drink? Fuzzy water?

517
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:43,559
Oh, I'm good.

518
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,594
Bring her some fuzzy
water. Lemon or lime?

519
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:47,783
Bring her both.

520
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,777
- You remember my boyfriend Ian.
- Hi.

521
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:53,595
Yeah, right, I know your work.

522
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:56,565
Sit. I'm sorry that we
have to meet in here.

523
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,070
Can't use my outdoor pool
anymore because of the paps.

524
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,538
Oh, how awful.

525
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,375
I know. I know.

526
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,353
Poor little rich girl.

527
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:07,502
But you know, everything
I have, I've earned.

528
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:09,324
Yeah, well, somehow I doubt that

529
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:12,091
catalogue shoots and a
reality show paid for all this.

530
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:15,309
- Well, I also have a recording deal.
- Oh, right.

531
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,340
Why are we talking about this?
That's not why you're here.

532
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:20,629
Why am I here?

533
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:22,636
Everyone knows that Dirt hates me.

534
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:24,543
The articles about my weight,

535
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:27,766
my feud with Meggie, that
you think I'm stupid, the DUI.

536
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:29,664
We never said anything
about your weight.

537
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,367
The point is, you hate me. It's fine.

538
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:37,195
That's why I want you
to have the interview.

539
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:40,316
Because everybody will believe it.

540
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:42,983
It won't feel like spin.

541
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,704
So I'm here to give you credibility.

542
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:49,106
Well, that, and score the hottest
celebrity interview of the decade.

543
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:50,868
- The big scoop.
- Yeah?

544
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:52,635
My medical condition.

545
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:54,915
I'm pregnant.

546
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:58,883
- We're having a baby.
- Congratulations.

547
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,309
But why does that mean
you can't be in jail?

548
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:04,643
Is the county going to release
all pregnant women from jail?

549
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,772
Because I have a condition.

550
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:09,964
- It's called hyper... em...
- Hyperemesis.

551
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,265
It's real. They had to let her out.

552
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:14,393
For the welfare of our unborn child.

553
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:18,260
Who has already totally
changed both our lives.

554
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:21,786
We don't have to bother
with all the details here.

555
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:23,487
I've made your job very easy.

556
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:25,242
Here's the entire interview.

557
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,302
Questions, answers,
and I had it typed up.

558
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:32,437
It's free, it's exclusive, and
your job is completely done.

559
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:36,415
Obviously a huge story
for you. You're welcome.

560
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,305
Hyperemesis. Isn't that
basically morning sickness?

561
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:41,857
Hey, women die from it every year.

562
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:44,340
The baby was at risk. We had to

563
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:47,158
- protect the welfare... -
Welfare of our unborn child.

564
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,764
We have a doctor's note.

565
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:52,394
Oh, a celebrity with
a doctor's note. Yeah.

566
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,617
I'm offering you a major interview here.

567
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:56,545
You're offering me a hand job.

568
00:23:56,665 --> 00:23:58,886
This isn't an interview,
it's a press release.

569
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,491
Do you want to do an
interview? Let's talk.

570
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:04,481
'Cause I'm not gonna
publish some PR person's Q&A.

571
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:10,778
You know, when I was in high school,

572
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,697
I used to drive by the big
gates of your parent's house.

573
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,697
It was so huge.

574
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:20,398
I used to think whoever lives inside,
they must have anything they want.

575
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:22,312
They can be anything they want.

576
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:24,380
What did you choose to be?

577
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:25,738
A celebutante?

578
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:29,204
I worked my ass off to become a star.

579
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,922
You're not a singer,

580
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:34,914
you're not an actress, you've
never worked a day in your life.

581
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:37,014
You're a little spoiled
brat who goes clubbing.

582
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:38,164
That's all you've ever achieved.

583
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:41,704
Oh, that and going up an off-ramp
after having one too many chocolatinis.

584
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:44,619
You think I'm just some party girl.

585
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:47,884
I am a brand. I created a brand.

586
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:49,838
You think I'm nothing? Okay.

587
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:53,276
Think about how hard it is to
turn nothing into a major brand,

588
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:55,646
a clothing line, fragrances, makeup.

589
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:58,323
You can call me a slut or a whore
or anything else, but never say

590
00:24:58,443 --> 00:24:59,920
I don't work hard for what I have.

591
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:02,968
Now there's a quote.

592
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:09,039
I'll just say that you admitted
you hate me and that you're biased.

593
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,140
You don't want my Q&A? Fine.

594
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:13,427
I'll go toIcon.

595
00:25:14,086 --> 00:25:16,427
Do as you want. I already have my story.

596
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:28,894
You bought a used
video camera for $2,000?

597
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,272
- Well, it's digital.
- Ah.

598
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:33,450
No, this isn't just any video camera.

599
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:37,702
This is Christa Darby's best
friend's brother's video camera.

600
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:39,665
The one she shot her
father's drunk tape on.

601
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:43,277
The kid was 12. You should've seen
his face when I gave him the cash.

602
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:46,749
Well, I thought you said she deleted
everything before she gave it back.

603
00:25:46,907 --> 00:25:48,874
Oh, dear, sweet geek boy.

604
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:50,844
You have so much to learn.

605
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:53,879
Video camera hard drives are
just like computer hard drives.

606
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:57,482
You can erase them, but the
data is still locked in the code.

607
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,246
And you know how to get that?

608
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,860
Well, no, but Varsha in IT did.

609
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:05,281
It seems that little
Christa did some editing.

610
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,384
Check out the original footage.

611
00:26:10,384 --> 00:26:12,958
<i>- Wait, do Petey. Pretend to be Petey.
- Okay, okay.</i>

612
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:16,597
<i>I'm Petey the dog, and
this is my dog bowl.</i>

613
00:26:19,507 --> 00:26:21,337
<i>Do the drunk guy, Dad.
Do the drunk guy.</i>

614
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:22,985
<i>Okay, drunk.</i>

615
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,003
<i>I'm not drunk!</i>

616
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:27,573
<i>I'm totally friggin'sober!</i>

617
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:29,510
- He wasn't drunk.
<i>- I'm sober!</i>

618
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,689
Well, not as much as he seemed, anyway.

619
00:26:32,077 --> 00:26:33,366
<i>See, the key to playing</i>

620
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:37,266
<i>a drunk is you gotta try
really, really hard to act sober.</i>

621
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,080
It was the daughter?

622
00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:41,762
- Why?
- Well, do you rember that

623
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:44,735
quote she gave me when I was
interviewing her at school?

624
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:48,181
Um, "Do you think it's easy growing
up with parents this screwed up?"

625
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:50,431
She seemed so upset, but

626
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,106
the quote was perfect. She
knew that I would bite at it.

627
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:56,076
Check this out, this
is the reality show that

628
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:58,204
Christa Darby pitched six months ago.

629
00:26:58,338 --> 00:27:00,412
It's all about her life as
a sitcom star's daughter,

630
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:01,753
but nobody was interested.

631
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:04,452
One exec said that
she didn't have a hook.

632
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:06,781
So now that she's famous,
she's trying to resell the show?

633
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,112
Oh, no, even better.

634
00:27:08,268 --> 00:27:09,814
This time it's Parent 911.

635
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:12,910
It's genius. She's gonna help
kids with problem parents.

636
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:14,483
Yup, live on the air.

637
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,471
Secret deal is already in the works.
They're gonna announce it any day now.

638
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:19,074
Making a brand out of nothing.

639
00:27:19,194 --> 00:27:22,731
Lucy, sorry.
Milan's interview is on.

640
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:27,485
<i>I clearly was not okay
to drive that night.</i>

641
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,143
<i>I just thank God that
I didn't hurt anyone.</i>

642
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:34,398
<i>Some people might find
it hard to believe that</i>

643
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:36,768
<i>God has become an
important part of your life.</i>

644
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:42,668
<i>I did a lot of stupid
things when I was young.</i>

645
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,001
What, like last week?

646
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:46,012
<i>Ian has taught me about the bible.</i>

647
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,664
<i>- That whatever other people think,
</i>- My God, she's

648
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:50,572
- got him dressed like a banker.
<i>- God can forgive.</i>

649
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,707
<i>God has blessed us with a child.</i>

650
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,785
<i>- It's time to grow up.</i>
- Great.

651
00:27:57,474 --> 00:28:00,312
We can go with how she tried
to sell the same crap to you.

652
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:02,988
Those are words.

653
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:05,959
We're in a world of images, and
right now the image is of Milan

654
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,397
and her Mother Theresa
colors praising God to Tami G.

655
00:28:12,944 --> 00:28:15,474
I want to meet with Jimmy
Darby tonight. My house.

656
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,757
Um... okay.

657
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:30,827
<i>See, the key to playing</i>

658
00:28:30,947 --> 00:28:34,748
<i>a drunk is you gotta try
really, really hard to act sober.</i>

659
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,626
<i>That's okay. All right.</i>

660
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,976
Why didn't you just
come out with the truth?

661
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:42,700
She's not wrong.

662
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,564
I was drinking that night.

663
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:48,804
Your daughter dubbed lines to make it
look like you thought you were a dog.

664
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:50,656
That doesn't bother you?

665
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:53,082
Did you hear that horrible
voicemail I left her?

666
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:55,728
Don't you think I
deserve some bad press?

667
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,262
And she need some good press.

668
00:28:57,587 --> 00:28:59,472
- To sell her show.
- Wait a minute.

669
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:02,616
- You're talking about my kid.
- Yeah, who stepped on your head

670
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:03,878
to get what she wants.

671
00:29:07,048 --> 00:29:10,058
Listen, I haven't been a great father.

672
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,659
- You don't have kids, do you?
- No

673
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:17,097
Do you want 'em?

674
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:22,087
Okay, we're not here to
talk about me, are we?

675
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:23,831
I guess not.

676
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,558
Listen, I'm not evil.

677
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:29,608
But I wasn't there enough for her.

678
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,048
And I do drink sometimes. And I get
real pissed off. And I break shit.

679
00:29:35,154 --> 00:29:37,798
So if my kid wants to make
a show that helps other kids

680
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:40,058
deal with their crazy families,

681
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:42,186
then I think it's a good thing.

682
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:43,515
Even if it's based on a lie?

683
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:46,612
It won't be a lie because I'm gonna
tell everybody it was my idea to do

684
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:49,698
that, okay? That I told her to
do it, that I made her do it.

685
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,309
- It'll never sell.
- It's my daughter.

686
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:58,200
She's 15, and she might have
something here. You know?

687
00:29:59,112 --> 00:30:00,176
It's her shot.

688
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:02,914
Don't you think that
maybe you and I could

689
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,647
work out something else?

690
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,613
Why don't you just keep hammering me?

691
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,142
I mean, I'm an asshole.

692
00:30:08,963 --> 00:30:10,321
I'm a terrible father.

693
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:12,409
Just keep roasting me

694
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,977
I just need for you to promise
that you'll leave her alone.

695
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:23,102
If you give me a bigger
story, I will bury this one.

696
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:24,612
Okay.

697
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,966
Milan Carlton.

698
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,526
She was a guest star
on your show, right?

699
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,700
The holiday special? Right?

700
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,598
Okay, I want you to call her up.

701
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:38,797
I want you to tell her that you're
having a really hard time with

702
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:41,750
all this bad press you're getting,
and it's just gonna get worse,

703
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:44,945
and you need the name
of her crisis PR person.

704
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:48,168
Not her regular guy, her specialist.

705
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:50,268
Okay.

706
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,714
I'll call her, and I'll get his name.

707
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:59,541
But I gotta tell you, there's no
way in hell her crisis PR manager

708
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,297
is gonna go on record with you.

709
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:05,104
That's okay, I just need his name.

710
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,105
Done.

711
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,057
<i>We know Milan is using a crisis
PR guru named Dillon Frawley.</i>

712
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,375
<i>Obviously, he's not gonna talk.</i>

713
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,797
<i>We need to find a
way to get inside.</i>

714
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:37,520
Go on. Go.

715
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:58,861
What you looking at?

716
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:03,919
Yeah, you should look away.

717
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:06,894
You little rat, ya.

718
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:19,321
<i>You know what? Let's talk about
wardrobe and makeup later,</i>

719
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:22,851
<i>I know how to dress little Miss Priss.
Let's just go over the interview, okay?</i>

720
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:24,540
<i>Fine. I'm Tami G.</i>

721
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:28,272
<i>Milan, you've already been convicted
of one driving under the influence.</i>

722
00:32:28,392 --> 00:32:30,069
<i>Now you've been
arrested a second time.</i>

723
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:32,094
<i>Why should you not go to jail?</i>

724
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:35,193
<i>- We're not gonna let her ask
that. - You want her to ask that.</i>

725
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:37,032
<i>You want to answer
the tough questions,</i>

726
00:32:37,152 --> 00:32:38,585
<i>or at least seem to, okay?</i>

727
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:40,498
<i>So, why should you not go to jail?</i>

728
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,936
<i>Well, first of all, I only
had one glass of wine.</i>

729
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,876
<i>- And that on-ramp was barely
marked. I mean... - No. No. No. No.</i>

730
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:48,088
<i>This is your answer. Watch.</i>

731
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:51,484
<i>I clearly was not okay
to drive that night.</i>

732
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:55,099
<i>I thank God nobody got hurt. Yeah?</i>

733
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:57,190
<i>I'm gonna thank God?</i>

734
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:00,354
<i>- Screw God. - No, honey,
you can screw God off camera.</i>

735
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:03,563
<i>But on camera, trust me.
God is gonna set you free.</i>

736
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:05,589
<i>Listen to me.</i>

737
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:09,619
<i>You hired me so that I can tell you how
to get the public back on your side.</i>

738
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:13,346
<i>It's a Christian nation.
You want forgiveness?</i>

739
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:16,011
<i>Admit your sins,
turn it over to God.</i>

740
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:24,595
<i>I clearly was not okay
to drive that night.</i>

741
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:28,637
<i>I just thank God I
didn't hurt anyone.</i>

742
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:30,724
<i>Nice. Very nice. Now watch.</i>

743
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:37,819
Screw God. That's our cover.

744
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:44,282
Lucy, the camera's hard
drive, where did we get it?

745
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:45,710
Sorry?

746
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,954
Just if anybody sues
or whatever, you know,

747
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:52,019
I'd rather not go to jail.

748
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:56,058
- Don, I always look out for you.
- I know.

749
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,826
I got it from some disgruntled worker.

750
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:02,178
Could be secretarial, could be...

751
00:34:03,516 --> 00:34:06,444
cleaning crew. I'll cover you.

752
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,503
Besides, we're printing the truth.

753
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:11,733
They won't sue us because
it'll just make them look worse.

754
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:12,666
Okay.

755
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:20,133
You're doing good,
Don. I'm proud of you.

756
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:22,407
Thank you.

757
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:27,224
I think I figured out why
you hate Milan so much.

758
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:29,269
She's you.

759
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:31,965
I just gave you a
really nice compliment.

760
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,678
She's all of us.

761
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:35,963
See, we're a nation
of spoiled rich people.

762
00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:40,636
Milan's just so extreme that it
makes us feel better by comparison.

763
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:44,427
But really, she's just the
part of ourselves we loathe.

764
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,165
That's why we need her.

765
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:50,276
Make us feel better, that's her job.

766
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,760
Well, she can't say the
job doesn't pay well.

767
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:54,773
I don't think it makes her happy.

768
00:34:55,442 --> 00:34:58,656
Well, if you think she's unhappy
now, wait till she sees my next cover.

769
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:00,047
Lucy...

770
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:06,115
Holt was on the PR guy's camera, too.

771
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:11,113
- That little speech outside the club?
- No, no, no.

772
00:35:11,787 --> 00:35:13,271
- Is it a story?
- I didn't look.

773
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:16,504
I saw that he was on
there, I didn't watch.

774
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:18,535
I figured it was up to you.

775
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,114
Okay. Thanks.

776
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,960
- All right?
- Thanks.

777
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:31,020
- Good night.
- Good night.

778
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:06,657
<i>You want to humanize, you know?
You wanna focus on the people.</i>

779
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:10,426
<i>Julia was a real person with
a family and a brother...</i>

780
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:13,172
<i>- She didn't have a
brother. - Sister. Right.</i>

781
00:36:13,578 --> 00:36:15,852
<i>You know what? Let's try it. Watch.</i>

782
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:21,556
<i>To you Julia Mallory
is a tabloid story.</i>

783
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:24,031
<i>But she was also a real person,</i>

784
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:27,086
<i>with a mother and a
father and a sister.</i>

785
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:35,808
<i>- Julia wasn't just a tabloid
story. - Nice, but open your arms. </i>

786
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:37,132
<i>You wanna be accessible.</i>

787
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:38,925
<i>- Yo. Yo.
- What... No, no, just...</i>

788
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:41,442
<i>You know what, forget
it. This isn't working.</i>

789
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:44,000
<i>No, no, you know what? I know it's hard.
It's awkward, but you gotta trust me.</i>

790
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,538
<i>No, listen, you don't get it,
'cause I don't give a shit.</i>

791
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:52,162
<i>All right? Come on. Look, dude,
I don't want to be molded.</i>

792
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,591
<i>You know, I'm just gonna
let the chips fall.</i>

793
00:36:56,862 --> 00:36:58,907
<i>Sorry for your time. I'll pay you.</i>

794
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:12,028
I wish you could've been there, buddy.

795
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:16,311
Man, there were so many rats,
you could've dined out for weeks.

796
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:24,063
I miss having our little chats, man.

797
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:25,509
I do.

798
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:32,141
<i>Please, please, please, I have
something very important to say, shh.</i>

799
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,246
<i>I will be going to the Far
East to do some charity work,</i>

800
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:39,239
<i>which is the one thing
that will keep me sane.</i>

801
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:44,518
<i>With everything so negative here,
I can do something positive there.</i>

802
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:47,670
<i>Where people aren't
out to hurt you.</i>

803
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,710
<i>Maybe they'll appreciate me.</i>

804
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:55,357
<i>- Thank you. - Milan? Milan?</i>

805
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,336
<i>Hi, I'm Christa Darby. Tune into
Parent 911 starting next month.</i>

806
00:38:05,669 --> 00:38:07,914
<i>I'll even have my own dad
with me for my first show.</i>

807
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:10,615
<i>- And, wow, we've had some
issues, haven't we? - We have?</i>

808
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:12,682
<i>I don't recall.</i>

809
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:16,812
You know the irony?

810
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:22,181
It was all true. I mean, everything he
said on that first voicemail message.

811
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,410
His daughter is selfish and hollow.

812
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:28,546
Well, at least she came by it honestly.

813
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:31,662
Do you want dinner? I was gonna
get some Chinese.

814
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:33,190
In LA?

815
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:36,043
- Well, I know this place on Pico.
- Really?

816
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,961
I can't. It's past ten, and

817
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:48,463
Liz will kill me if I go out
to dinner with somebody else

818
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,546
instead of coming straight home.

819
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:55,365
I wasn't asking you out,
Farber. I'm working late,

820
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:59,587
- ordering in.
- Uh, I know. Sorry.

821
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:01,071
Well...

822
00:39:02,946 --> 00:39:05,670
- Your girlfriend is one lucky woman.
- Thanks.

823
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:07,803
I wish she would say that.

824
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,515
I was being facetious.

825
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:36,906
- Hello?
- Oh, hey, Lucy. Were you sleeping?

826
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:38,578
<i>It's three in the morning.</i>

827
00:39:39,582 --> 00:39:42,108
You seem to be sleeping a lot
better since you got stabbed.

828
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:44,147
It almost makes it worth it, huh?

829
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:45,768
<i>It's good to sleep.</i>

830
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:49,579
And yet, you're calling at 3 AM.

831
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:52,629
Well, Milan Carlton's on TV.
I thought you oughta know.

832
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:55,120
<i>What are you doing? Oh!</i>

833
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:58,303
Thanks, honey.

834
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,740
<i>... was stopped by authorities
when she took time out </i>

835
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,405
<i>from her Christian relief
work to go topless on a beach</i>

836
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:12,601
<i>in a nation where public
nudity is illegal.</i>

837
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:15,518
<i>When police went through her
handbag, they found a gram of cocaine</i>

838
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:17,329
<i>in the socialite's makeup compact.</i>

839
00:40:18,454 --> 00:40:21,051
<i>The country has a
zero-tolerance policy for drugs,</i>

840
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:24,112
<i>and the penalty for possession
of cocaine is death.</i>

841
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,724
Lucy, are they really gonna execute her?

842
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:29,710
I already mocked up a "Milan
gets the needle" cover.

843
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,965
- Well, actually, it would be a hanging.
- Or a firing squad.

844
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:34,704
My cousin's in the state department.
He said I can be at the embassy

845
00:40:34,824 --> 00:40:36,906
- when she's executed.
- She's not gonna be executed.

846
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:39,139
- She'll get off, like always.
- Really?

847
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:43,860
Well, maybe not like always. It is
a small nation in the Far East, but

848
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,220
she's Milan. They'll work something out.

849
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:51,893
Do you wanna bet? Good boy.

850
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:58,374
<i>The government has decided to
be merciful on Miss Carlton,</i>

851
00:40:58,494 --> 00:40:59,714
<i>and release her from prison...</i>

852
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:02,880
<i>... after receiving
three public lashes.</i>

853
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:18,278
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

854
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,188
<i>Daddy!</i>
