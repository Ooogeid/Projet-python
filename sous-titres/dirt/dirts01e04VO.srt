00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:04,571
<i>Hi. I'm Don Konkey.</i>

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:05,939
<i>I'm a photographer.</i>

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,307
<i>I'm schizophrenic.</i>

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,410
<i>This is Lucy Spiller, the editor
of Drrt Now Magazine.</i>

5
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,678
<i>She helps me figure out
what's real.</i>

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,580
My wall is naked.
I don't like it!

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,750
<i>I got these really great photos
of Prince Tyreese, the basketball star</i>

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,918
- <i>having sex with a stripper.</i>
- These are fantastic.

9
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:23,188
<i>Lucy wanted to use the pictures
to get Prince Tyreese to give her info</i>

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,624
<i>on the missing R&B singer Aundre G.</i>

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,759
Aundre G is dead.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,794
- You want a chance to crack it?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,029
Don't make me regret it.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,464
<i>That's Willa McPherson.</i>

15
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,698
<i>Lucy gave her a hot lead
on a breaking story.</i>

16
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:36,268
But I was obviously wrong because
I gave you the goddamn tip

17
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,459
and you came back with dick!

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,038
- <i>She blew it.</i>
- I'm sorry.

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,607
<i>This is Jack Dawson.
He's a big, big action star.</i>

20
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,308
How do you keep the family together

21
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,544
despite the pressures
of a big Hollywood career?

22
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,546
Well, it is all about family, isn't it?

23
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:52,751
I am officially Jack Dawson's
new interior decorator.

24
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,821
<i>And that's Lucy's brother Leo.</i>

25
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,624
<i>Jack and Leo are sitting in a tree</i>

26
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,360
<i>That's Holt McLaren and his
girlfriend Julia Mallory.</i>

27
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,464
<i>Holt gave Lucy dirt on Kira Klay.
She OD'd and died.</i>

28
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,534
<i>When he found out, he got pissed off
and crashed his car.</i>

29
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,537
<i>Holt's girlfriend got hurt real bad.</i>

30
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,673
<i>And when she went back to work
on her sitcom, she didn't do so well.</i>

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,575
- Cut!
- <i>So they fired her.</i>

32
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,613
<i>Things are going pretty
well for me, though.</i>

33
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,714
<i>After Kira died,
she moved in with me.</i>

34
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,049
<i>Just take more pictures of me.</i>

35
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,485
<i>She used to come out in public
with me all the time.</i>

36
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,321
<i>Now she's more of a home body...</i>

37
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,521
<i>which is cool,</i>

38
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,724
<i>'cause she's about to pop at any minute.</i>

39
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,422
<i>Lucy, it's your mother.</i>

40
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,726
<i>Weren't we supposed to meet at 5:00?
I have it in my book as 5:00.</i>

41
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,429
<i>We have a reservation.
You'd better be coming.</i>

42
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:01,714
Hi, Mom.

43
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,750
Sorry I'm late.

44
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,352
Traffic was bad on Sunset.

45
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,721
Darling, this is Paul Westin.

46
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,523
Hi.

47
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,126
We met in church a few months ago.

48
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,360
Church?

49
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,162
What, did somebody die?

50
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,365
Paul, this is my daughter Lucy.

51
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,867
It's nice to meet you.

52
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,369
- Nice to meet you.
- I joined All Saints'

53
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,704
in Beverly Hills.

54
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,540
I...like the music.

55
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,010
- And what do you like?
- Ah, your mother.

56
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,682
Paul's in real estate.

57
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,650
Um, parking lots, really.

58
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,486
Lucy, Paul and I are going on a cruise

59
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,255
next week to the British Isles.

60
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,122
Nice.

61
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,325
We decided that a trip
like that would be

62
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,595
so much more special if we
were celebrating something.

63
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,631
What are you celebrating?

64
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,867
We're getting married, Lucy.

65
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,607
The day after tomorrow,
right here in the hotel.

66
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,873
I want you and your brother
to give me away.

67
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,876
You're going to need a new dress.

68
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,348
So does Leo know about this?

69
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,682
Oh, yes.

70
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,551
Uh, he's doing the flowers.

71
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,685
Oh, excuse me.

72
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,187
Can I get a Tanqueray and tonic?

73
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,490
And 50 bucks if it's here
before I turn around.

74
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,163
You're a brave man.

75
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,966
You've only just met Paul, darling.

76
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,969
Do you have to alienate him so soon?

77
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:37,276
The mark-up's on your desk.
Michelle wants to see you about

78
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,812
the cover. And you have a 9 am
newsstand meeting.

79
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,282
Oh, here's your coffee.

80
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,350
That's not Spanish leather.

81
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,885
That's raw hide.

82
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,921
Use the color chip until you get it.

83
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,324
Oh, and cancel my plans
with Felicia on Tuesday.

84
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,893
My mother's getting married.

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,629
Does Mom have a name?

86
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:57,930
Well...

87
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,533
I like Bitch-Face, but why don't
we just stick with Dorothy?

88
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,535
Okay. February 20th,

89
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,570
Dorothy's wedding.

90
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,571
That can't be the date.

91
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,208
Well, yesterday was the 18th,
today is the 19th, so...

92
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,245
Is there a problem?

93
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,980
Where's my coffee?

94
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,419
Leo, I swear to God
I'm going to kill her. Call me.

95
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,426
Your car's here.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,762
Can you believe
this whole car bullshit?

97
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,298
I can drive myself to the studio.

98
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,867
That's how they control you.

99
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,437
Especially the first day.
They do it for all the stars.

100
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,539
Are you going to be okay today?

101
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,974
I'm not an invalid.

102
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,376
I'm not saying you--

103
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,414
Look, I just love you, okay?

104
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,288
Hey, Holt?

105
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,124
I love you, too.

106
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,394
Kick ass today, okay?

107
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,902
I'll call you later.

108
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,518
Okay, everybody, change of plans.

109
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,153
We're dropping our three cover options.

110
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,988
Why? We're almost there
with hero pets.

111
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,790
You just answered your own question.

112
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,313
Also because of this. Terry?

113
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:35,227
My source at People tells me
they're running

114
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,928
this photo on their next cover,

115
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,991
with the headline
"Let Us Live in Peace."

116
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:41,594
Supposed to be Aundre G
in seclusion in the Virgin Islands.

117
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:44,218
Just in time for the release
of his new CD. What a coincidence.

118
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,404
Yeah, I think it's bullshit.

119
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,873
Widow G and Aundre's manager
are making huge bucks

120
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,074
off his new CDs.

121
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,610
My sources say that
Aundre G was murdered.

122
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,813
Some sort of dispute with
his manager Tweety McDaniel.

123
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,360
Yeah, Elliot?

124
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:57,193
I'll cover all the businesses
in Saint Croix.

125
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,103
If he's there, someone's had
to have seen him.

126
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:02,015
Good. And, Adam, check out his
girlfriend's relationship with Tweety.

127
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:04,176
Okay, I'll talk to the cops.
They don't usually keep

128
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:06,758
an open Missing Persons file
on someone who's "in seclusion."

129
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,440
I know someone at Repudiator Records.

130
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:11,198
Let me see what I can dig up
on Tweety and Aundre's relationship.

131
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,266
Okay, I want the truth, guys.

132
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,634
And just as badly,

133
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,469
I want to make People Magazine suffer.

134
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,504
So we have 12 hours.

135
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,441
Excuse me. Sorry.

136
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,943
Excuse me. Sorry.

137
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,045
Oh, Lucy, um...

138
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,246
look, I'm really,

139
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,349
really sorry about last week.

140
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,552
- If I can make it up to you--
- It's doubtful.

141
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,755
Oh. Um, well, I can look
into the shooting at his last concert

142
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,589
if that--

143
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,292
Okay, Willa, here you go.

144
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,827
Here is an interview with a stripper

145
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,629
who spent an evening
with Prince Tyreese.

146
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,232
Prince Tyreese the basketball player?

147
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,502
No, Prince Tyreese the heir
to the throne of Ireland.

148
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,539
Write it up, 800 words.
Have it on my desk in an hour.

149
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,678
My dad used to call these
"one-eyed Jacks."

150
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,113
He used to make 'em
for us on Sundays.

151
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,256
Oh, you need a fork.

152
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
<i>Thanks, baby.</i>

153
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,934
A little salt.

154
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,004
I have to go now.

155
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,473
If anything happens--
Well, you know--

156
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,275
You know how to reach me.

157
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,346
Oh, yeah, that's a good one.
Philip K. Dick.

158
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,681
He's the best. You'll like that one.

159
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,291
See you later?

160
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,448
Get in.

161
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,722
You lied to me.

162
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,949
My source at People told me that

163
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,303
they're doing a cover story
that says that Aundre G

164
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:24,163
is alive and well, and

165
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,400
drinking rum out of a coconut
somewhere in the South Caribbean.

166
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,036
That's bullshit.

167
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,504
Prove it.

168
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,708
Why should I?

169
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,545
I don't know what
this shit is all about,

170
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,380
but I'm finished with it.

171
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,549
You know, I got
something for you.

172
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,389
<b>Prince Tyreese:
NOTHIN' BUT BUTT!!!</b>

173
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,924
This is messed up.

174
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:54,392
You told me you gave me
the negatives from those photos.

175
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,295
I did. This is something different.

176
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,231
It's a little interview
with your friend Stormy.

177
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,702
You know, she's quite
eloquent for a stripper.

178
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,504
Blackmail is a crime.

179
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,572
Do you really think that Tweety
should be allowed

180
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,474
to drive around
in a million-dollar Ferrari

181
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,711
while Aundre G's head is
vacuum-packed into a pickle jar?

182
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,480
I already told you everything I know.

183
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,048
You said it was enough.

184
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,051
But now because
of the People story, I can't trust you.

185
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,953
I need facts.

186
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,055
I have a family.

187
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,957
So did Aundre G.

188
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,762
Where's the head?

189
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,866
Tweety said it was
a collector's item.

190
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,801
- Aundre's head?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,703
That's all I know.

Tweety McDaniel, Repudiator Records.

197
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,725
- What does he collect?
- Collect?

198
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,827
He's got money.
It's got to be something.

199
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,195
Cars, hookers, stamps?

200
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,297
Ferraris.

201
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,801
He just bought two quarter horses...
And wine.

202
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,171
- Wine.
- He has over a thousand bottles.

203
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,041
Great. Find out where he keeps them.

204
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,880
I need to see you today.
It's urgent. Call me back.

205
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,383
- Hi.
- Hey.

206
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,788
So, not only is she getting married
on three days' notice to some stranger,

207
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,524
but she's doing it on the anniversary
of Dad's death.

208
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,754
- How sick is that?
- Well, to be honest,

209
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,141
I don't even know if she rembers.

210
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,830
She remembers the day
I got a DUI when I was 20.

211
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,499
In her defense, Lucy, it was Christmas.

212
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,570
Listen, Dad's death was 25 years ago.

213
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,654
There's a lot of
Valium under that bridge.

214
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,606
But it's just a day.

215
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,609
No, it'll never be "just a day" to me.

216
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,247
You don't have to go.

217
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,665
If I don't, she'll only
hold it against me.

218
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,170
God love her.

219
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,934
All right, so why were you whispering
this morning? Are you seeing someone?

220
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,793
Not really.

221
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:12,822
No, come on. Is it a man or a woman?
What am I saying? You are so not bi.

222
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:14,460
You haven't been with a woman in years.

223
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:15,290
Six months.

224
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,469
Whatever.

225
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:18,929
Come on, you can't keep a secret
from your big sister.

226
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,038
What? Tell me the details.

227
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,407
Who? What? Where?

228
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,009
Nothing's going on.

229
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,912
You are lying. It's so obvious.

230
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,814
I wonder how their tuna is here.

231
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,595
I can't believe you're not going

232
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,277
to tell me about your latest conquest.
You always tell me.

233
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:35,821
This time I can't.

234
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,459
- You can't? Or you won't?
- I can't.

235
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,229
And I don't want to.

236
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,299
Let's order.

237
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,973
- So how's it going?
- Well, my penmanship sucks

238
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,989
and I was only half an hour
early this morning,

239
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,675
which I guess is still considered late.

240
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,380
On the bright side, her coffee was
the perfect shade of shit, so I'm happy.

241
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:02,751
You're going to do fine...

242
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,283
just as long as you don't make
the mistake the last guy did.

243
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,219
- And what's that?
- Get married.

244
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,224
- What do you mean?
- When the last guy was getting married,

245
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:12,194
all his wedding prep
interfered with his work.

246
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:14,392
She canned his ass after she caught him
on the phone

247
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,561
- with his cater.
- Shit.

248
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,696
- Are you getting married?
- I have to.

249
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,033
Because of... the baby.

250
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,076
- Don, there you are.
- Oh. Uh, hi, Lucy.

251
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,014
We had a 3:00 appointment.
I've been looking for you.

252
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,316
I...I had to go pee.

253
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,753
- It's 3:50.
- Sorry.

254
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:45,124
This is important. I need you to take
a picture today. It's for the cover.

255
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,232
Aren't you going to wash your hands?

256
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,569
Are you okay?

257
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,506
- Yeah, real good.
- Good, because this is sensitive.

258
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,843
Aundre G the singer, he was murdered.

259
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,079
I need you to go to
the Cabrillo Wine Vault in Sun Valley

260
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,448
and check out
Tweety McDaniel's collection.

261
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,251
You're looking
for Aundre G's head.

262
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,233
Don,

263
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,342
the manager thinks you're a photographer
from Wine Spectator Magazine.

264
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,430
Mm-hmm.

265
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,433
Don, it's clean.

266
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,636
- Your hand.
- Mm, yeah.

267
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,503
Here we go.

268
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,508
- Thank you, Lucy.
- Okay, sweetie.

269
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:21,363
You wouldn't think a guy like
Tweety McDaniel would give a shit

270
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,215
about fine wine, but look at this.

271
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,957
He's got it all fixed up.

272
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,716
That's the front door.
I'll be back in a second.

273
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:28,719
Okay.

274
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,437
Damn.

275
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,650
Basketball star
with a protitute isn't news.

276
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,710
That he wanted her to bang him
in the ass with a strap-on,

277
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,981
that's your lead.

278
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,358
Willa, I'm really starting
to question your commitment.

279
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,429
- My commitment?
- Mm-hmm.

280
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,527
You know, I took some of those drugs

281
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:09,286
that Garbo woman was selling
so that she would trust me.

282
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,972
I don't even take aspirin.
I was sick all night from it.

283
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,140
Who the hell asked you
to take drugs?

284
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:19,912
I just wanted you to know
that I have the balls for the job.

285
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,696
The story didn't call for balls.

286
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,880
It called for brains.
Don't confuse the two.

287
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,523
Willa...

288
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,162
There's a convention of bariatric
surgeons at the W that ends tonight.

289
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,933
Find a Dr. Kozar and ask him about
Venus Smith.

290
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,437
Venus Smith had
her stomach stapled?

291
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,002
I thought she was all
about diet and exercise.

292
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:50,545
Yeah, well, confirm the story.

293
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,544
I may be able to use it next week.

294
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,215
Thanks, Lucy.

295
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,424
<i>Hey.</i>

296
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:10,696
Who said that?

297
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,098
<i>Over here.</i>

298
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,053
Aundre G?

299
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,356
<i>Sure ain't Marie Antoinette.</i>

300
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,069
I'm supposed to take
a few pictures of you.

301
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,572
- <i>Knock yourself out.</i>
- Thanks.

302
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,247
<i>My right side's, my best side.</i>

303
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:03,982
Okay.

304
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,291
- <i>How do I look?</i>
- Pretty good...

305
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,528
You know, considering...
you have no body.

306
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,204
I guess that's it.

307
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,674
- Uh, thanks.
- <i>Hey, hey, where are you going?</i>

308
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,543
Oh, I got to get these
pictures back to Lucy.

309
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,479
She's kind of, like, counting on them.

310
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,147
<i>But you just got here.</i>

311
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,118
<i>Oh, come on, man.
Don't you want to hear me sing?</i>

312
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,586
Sorry.

313
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,967
- Whoa.
- Excuse me.

314
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,608
Badgley Mischka.
What do you think, hmm?

315
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,177
I think I'm in the middle
of my workday.

316
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,696
Well, here's what I'm thinking.

317
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,850
I'm going to be wearing Ralph Lauren
and you always look so pretty in blue.

318
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,820
Mother.

319
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,887
I know. You want to pick it out
yourself, but I was in Beverly Hills...

320
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,526
Mother, you're getting remarried
on the day that Dad died.

321
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,203
Yes.

322
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:25,976
Don't you think that's kind of strange?

323
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,566
Not really.

324
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,271
Your dad did as he chose that day.
Now, so am I.

325
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,544
You act like it's some
kind of retribution.

326
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:37,041
How can you blame him?

327
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,710
It was a hostile act.

328
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:44,216
He did it at home.
There was no note, no explanation.

329
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,586
Why should I honor that day?

330
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,493
Um, because it's a pretty
significant day to me.

331
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,829
Lucy, I took you to that doctor.

332
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,999
We talked about it ad infinitum.
We've read books.

333
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,001
What more could I do?

334
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,005
Well, you could try
being a mother for once.

335
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,612
Listen, I'm sorry.
I've got so much work to do.

336
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,791
It's been his day for 25 years, Lucy.
I want it back.

337
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,167
Who the hell?

338
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,009
- Nice office.
- Mr. McDaniel, um...

339
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,845
I'm sorry, do we have an appointment?

340
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,248
I've been hearing some shit
about your magazine that...

341
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,051
- just don't sit right with me.
- Sorry to hear that.

342
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,829
See, I got people in my offices

343
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,568
telling me some of your people
been asking questions.

344
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,758
- About?
- About my boy Aundre G.

345
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,229
Anybody who knows me knows I dropped
hundred of thousands of my own money

346
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,765
looking for Aundre.
He was like a brother to me.

347
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,467
Well...

348
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,104
of course there's been some interest
in the Aundre G story here.

349
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,607
You know, his disappearance, the new CD,
but I can assure you, Mr. McDaniel--

350
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,108
- Tweety.
- Tweety,

351
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,112
now that we know he's off on some
island somewhere,

352
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,746
- we won't be doing any stories on him.
- Glad to hear that.

353
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,418
Because some of them questions
were kind of like...insulting.

354
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:30,122
I mean, it seemed like your magazine
was looking to dis Tweety.

355
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,615
Well, we never set out
to dis anybody, Tweety.

356
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,255
It's, uh, it's not what--

357
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,497
It's not what we do.

358
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,534
We just seek the truth. That's all.

359
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,772
People be so quick to judge me.

360
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,208
They won't even let their kids spend
the night at my house

361
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,838
because I'm supposed to be some
ghetto violent son-of-a-bitch.

362
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,347
But I can assure you...

363
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,983
my kids don't want for nothing.

364
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,387
- See, Brent...that's your name, right?
- Yes, it is.

365
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,425
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothing.

366
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,428
- Except for God.
- Yeah.

367
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,907
And I ain't going to let nobody
take that from me.

368
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,546
Asthma's a killer, Brent.

369
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,161
- You ought to stay clear of smoke.
- Yeah.

370
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,126
My God, these are horrific.

371
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,928
I love them.

372
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,097
This is going to make
a great cover story.

373
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,099
Yeah?

374
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,569
- He's a nice guy.
- Who?

375
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,772
Aundre. Aundre G.

376
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,875
I don't like the way you're sounding.

377
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,111
Sorry, Lucy.

378
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,581
Don, you have to take your meds, honey.

379
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,348
I know you don't like them, but

380
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,751
do you rember the hospital?

381
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,286
I don't need the hospital;
I'm fine.

382
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,554
The last time I didn't know
where you were,

383
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,491
you were sleeping next to the freeway.

384
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,559
That guy hurt you.

385
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,962
Don, you have to take care of yourself.

386
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:19,998
Okay.

387
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,768
I have another job for you.

388
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,006
Okay.

389
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,765
God...

390
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,001
What is this?

391
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,272
It's dope.

392
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,812
You're yummy.

393
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,950
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,

394
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,087
- I'm going to puke.
- Hey, don't worry.

395
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,056
It happens to everyone
first time they smoke it.

396
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,095
Okay, listen up, everyone.

397
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,665
We're going to crash a cover
on Aundre G's murder.

398
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,100
Check it out.

399
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,037
What do you have?

400
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,810
You can't put that on the cover, Lucy.

401
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,714
We're going to polybag it with
an explicit warning label

402
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,649
and run the headshot inside.

403
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,585
- That is fantastic.
- Isn't it?

404
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,389
All right, keep Barrow out of the loop.
He had a shit-fit last time.

405
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,057
This time we have photos.

406
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,894
The LAPD will be notified when
we go to press. Let's get to work.

407
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,433
The wall is locked.

408
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,679
Hi.

409
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,048
Where've you been?

410
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,916
What do you mean?

411
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,486
I've been home for three hours.

412
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,155
I was out.

413
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,090
Who with?

414
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,795
Garbo. God, what's
with the interrogation?

415
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,831
I thought we were going to have
dinner to celebrate my first day.

416
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,468
Am I supposed to wait around
for you all day?

417
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,470
No, I just thought we had plans.

418
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,873
We were out of weed, Jesus.

419
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,813
- Did you eat already?
- No.

420
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,656
- How was work?
- It was fine.

421
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,694
My stomach's bothering me a little.

422
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,641
Hey, you want a, you want
a grilled cheese sandwich?

423
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,543
Okay.

424
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,919
I can't believe you'd do this to me.

425
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,056
I can't believe you're
banging Jack Dawson.

426
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:42,293
Republican family man,
super action, macho homo,

427
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,696
- Jack Dawson.
- If I wanted you to know,

428
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,532
I'd have told you. Jesus Christ, Lucy.

429
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,535
Well, it's not like
I'm going to publish these.

430
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,204
You know I wouldn't do that, right?

431
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,072
You had your own brother followed

432
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,676
by the stalkerazzi,
so don't act all indignant.

433
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,413
Oh, my God.
This isn't serious, is it?

434
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,415
Yes. I love him and he loves me.

435
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,949
Why is that so hard to believe?

436
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,286
Two people can meet
and actually fall in love.

437
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,622
Oh, Leo... he's a movie star.

438
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,223
I have covered this kind of story

439
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,826
- a thousand times.
- I'm not a story.

440
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,761
I'm your goddamn family.

441
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,364
Can you be happy for anybody?

442
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,033
I meet a terrific person
and you diminish it

443
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,368
like it's some piece of gossip.

444
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,304
Mom finally finds someone she can fall
in love again with after 25 years

445
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,639
and you shit all over that too.

446
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,340
- All right, Leo--
- Don't. Just don't

447
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,943
with the big sister act, okay?

448
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,111
God.

449
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,513
I'm embarrassed for us both.

450
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,287
Kira?

451
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,322
Baby?

452
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,927
Is this it?

453
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,363
Now don't worry. You're going
to be fine, okay?

454
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,365
- I'm not going to go anywhere.
- <i>Okay.</i>

455
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,173
Going to get your head up.
Okay?

456
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,374
You don't want your head
on the floor, sweetheart.

457
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,977
- Here you go.
- <i>Oh, it hurts.</i>

458
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,113
- <i>It hurts!</i>
- No, don't.

459
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,248
<i>Oh, it hurts!</i>

460
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,123
It's okay. Here we go.
Don't cry baby.

461
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,291
It's okay.

462
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,047
<i>Certificate of death.
Steven J. Spiller.</i>

463
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,654
<i>Dearest Lucy, I had a dream,
which was not at all a dream...</i>

464
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,958
<i>I did this for you.
Someday you'll understand, Dad</i>

465
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,471
<i>No!</i>

466
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,520
So, then you became a bariatric surgeon.

467
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,157
Yeah, found my niche, never looked back.

468
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,327
I'm all about helping people, so...

469
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,031
So you think you got
something to work with there?

470
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,132
Oh, yeah!

471
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,135
Yeah, wow. I mean, this is going
to make my thesis much more exciting.

472
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,337
Thank you.

473
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,906
Nice shoes.

474
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,610
They Kate Spade?

475
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,179
Yeah.

476
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,714
You know...

477
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:34,886
I've got a video of me performing
surgery. It's in my room.

478
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,391
Well, that might be helpful.

479
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,495
I also have a few questions about
the types of patients you treat. So...

480
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,099
Come on up. I'd be happy to tell you
anything you want to know.

481
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,535
- Yeah?
- Yeah, okay.

482
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,837
You're doing great, baby.

483
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,406
You're going to be fine!
Come on.

484
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,607
Come on.

485
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,211
Okay. Just push! Okay?

486
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,245
Push!

487
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,785
I can see something!

488
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,724
Here it comes!
Here it comes!

489
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:22,000
Look! Look! It's a boy!

490
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,807
What? What? What?

491
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,011
Oh, here's another one.

492
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,951
Yeah, some patients are very
private about this surgery.

493
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,353
Sure I can't get you anything?

494
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:49,794
They like people to think all it took
was a little exercise and will power.

495
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,131
If they were capable of self-control,

496
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,267
I wouldn't be in business, now would I?

497
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,970
Here's to gluttony.

498
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,624
So, I imagine you treat celebrities.

499
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,393
Oh, they're the worst.

500
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,803
Come on, sit by me.
You can see better.

501
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,172
I can see fine, thanks.

502
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,875
I heard that Venus Smith
got her stomach stapled.

503
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,144
- I mean--
- Come on.

504
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,986
Look, I didn't come up
here to do anything.

505
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,523
That's a load of shit now, isn't it?

506
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,626
You don't think you're the first
reporter to try to pry

507
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,497
privileged client information
from me, do you?

508
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,599
Sure you don't want a drink?

509
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,268
I'm not screwing you.

510
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,511
It's not your precious bloom
that I'm interested in.

511
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,218
- My feet?
- Oh, God, they're so...

512
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,022
small and dainty and alabaster.

513
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,826
I'm guessing a perfect size 8.

514
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,131
You let me be who I have to be
and I'll give you what you want.

515
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,766
Off the record, of course.

516
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,172
No touching.

517
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,241
Good.

518
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,814
Now dangle it.

519
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,250
Dangle it.

520
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,387
No, don't let it drop.

521
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,661
Oh yeah, you make me so hard.

522
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,466
Hold it up.
Hold the goddamn foot up!

523
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,171
Don't close your eyes.
Look at me.

524
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,339
Look at me!
Oh, yeah.

525
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,943
Please, please, please...

526
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,922
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

527
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,275
<i>It's time for me to go, Don.</i>

528
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:55,947
No.

529
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,417
I'm going to make you French toast.

530
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,587
<i>And it's time for you
to go back on your meds.</i>

531
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,826
No, I don't want
to go back on my meds.

532
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,363
They make me feel bad.

533
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,166
<i>You have to.</i>

534
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,171
I don't want to--

535
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,174
I love you.

536
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,912
I don't want to be alone again.

537
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,314
<i>But you won't be.</i>

538
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,383
<i>Okay?</i>

539
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,696
Tristan?

540
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,432
<i>No, it's his son.</i>

541
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,936
<i>You're all he has.</i>

542
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,459
<i>Come here.</i>

543
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,466
Bitter.

544
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,803
<i>That's a good boy.</i>

545
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,393
What happened?

546
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,406
I told you not to go with this story.

547
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,974
I don't work
for you, Brent.

548
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,710
And this time, I had
photographic evidence.

549
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:07,445
Really?

550
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:11,148
Because the cops showed up at
the storage facility and, apparently...

551
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,150
there was no head to be found.

552
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,252
Oh. I guess someone got tipped off.

553
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,322
No head, no confirmation
that Aundre G is really dead

554
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,257
or that the head is actually his.

555
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,526
I mean, the cops are going
to be all over your boy Don.

556
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,563
This story is solid.
I ran the whole thing by legal.

557
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,499
So unless you brought muffins,
I think that we're done here.

558
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,136
Beyond that, these photos...

559
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,039
they're smut.

560
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,041
I'm publishing them as
just venal sensationalism.

561
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,777
This coming from a man who's never had
a magazine subscription

562
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,112
he could read with his pants on.

563
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,847
We don't even know if they're real.

564
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,015
Oh, they're real.

565
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,218
The guy had Aundre G's head
in his wine cellar.

566
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,654
If the cops can't prove it,
that's their problem.

567
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,960
Well...

568
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,196
I hope this sells, because,

569
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,000
you know, the polybagging is going
to blow your budget all to hell.

570
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,503
And, given that this is
the forth week in a row

571
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,472
you've gone over-budget, according
to the terms of your contract,

572
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,742
you just forfeited your annual bonus.

573
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:14,845
That's bullshit.

574
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,283
Polybagging is a production cost.
It's not on the editorial budget.

575
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,186
It is now.

576
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,978
What happened?

577
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,455
Kira.

578
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,381
Tristan.

579
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:33,991
Yeah.

580
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,360
This is a very special day
for the Spiller family.

581
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,429
Twenty-five years ago,

582
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,231
my mother's first husband,

583
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:18,269
my father, hanged himself
in our living room.

584
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,977
Ever since then, I have questioned
the whole idea of love and commitment.

585
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,148
It's nice to see that my mother doesn't
share the same doubt.

586
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,952
And neither does my brother, apparently.

587
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,557
Good for them, and I mean that.

588
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,296
To Mom and Paul.

589
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,266
May the truth never infringe
upon your happiness.

590
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:01,477
Well, instead of being
the day Dad killed himself,

591
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,547
it'll now be the day
you ruined Mom's wedding.

592
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,482
Well done.

593
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,519
At least I showed.

594
