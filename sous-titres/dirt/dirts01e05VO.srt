1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:04,404
<i>My name's Don Conkey.
I take pictures.</i>

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,139
<i>That's my best friend,
Lucy Spiller.</i>

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,376
<i>She's the editor
of Dirt Now Magazine.</i>

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,577
<i>This is my girlfriend, Kira.</i>

5
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,679
<i>She died of a drug overdose.</i>

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,298
<i>- We've been living together since.
- Thanks, baby.</i>

7
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,051
<i>We became
a family last week.</i>

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,454
Oh, wow!
It's a boy!

9
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,831
<i>It's time for you
to go back on your meds.</i>

10
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:26,025
- I don't want to be alone again.
- <i>But you won't be.</i>

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,060
<i>But then she had to go.</i>

12
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,632
<i>That's Lucy's brother, Leo.
He's dating some guy secretly.</i>

13
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,884
Come on, you can't keep a secret
from your big sister.

14
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:35,401
- Nothing's going on.
-  <i>Lucy hates secrets.</i>

15
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,271
<i>She sent me to follow him,
and guess what?</i>

16
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,341
<i>He's dating married
action hero Jack Dawson.</i>

17
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,142
It-- it is all about
family, isn't it?

18
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,345
<i>Leo got really pissed off
when Lucy showed him my photos.</i>

19
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,814
I can't believe you're
banging Jack Dawson.

20
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,316
You had your own brother
followed by the stalkerazzi,

21
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,549
so don't act all indignant.

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,331
It's not like I'm going
to publish these.

23
00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:55,521
<i>Pretty sneaky, sis.</i>

24
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,256
<i>This is Holt McLaren.</i>

25
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,625
<i>His first day on the set
of his big movie went well.</i>

26
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:00,760
I'm fine!

27
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,830
<i>His girlfriend,
Julia, not so much.</i>

28
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,398
<i>This is Prince Tyreese,
the basketball star.</i>

29
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,500
<i>He's helping Lucy
with the Aundre G story.</i>

30
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,735
<i>Some people think he's dead.</i>

31
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,003
Tweety had his head

32
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,705
- in a jar.
- <i>Lucy's one of them.</i>

33
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,674
<i>She asked me to find Aundre G
and take some pictures.</i>

34
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,810
<i>Nice guy.</i>

35
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,177
<i>Lonely.</i>

36
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,578
Seems like your magazine

37
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,013
was looking to dis Tweety.

38
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,247
Now that we know he's off
on some island somewhere,

39
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:25,817
- we won't be doing any stories on him.
- Glad to hear that.

40
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,454
- I told you not to go with this story.
- This story is solid.

41
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,688
<i>I don't know if I told you this, but I'm
a highly-functional schizophrenic.</i>

42
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,193
<i>I'm doing much better...</i>

43
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,663
<i>but I definitely miss
my dead girlfriend.</i>

44
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,098
Kira?

45
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,599
<i>Thank God for the kids.</i>

46
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,404
It's Hollywood's
happiest couple

47
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,307
telling everyone the secret
to their successful marriage.

48
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,987
- Meaning?
- You know, like tips on

49
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:52,511
how they've managedto be successful
where others have failed,

50
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,813
suggestions
for the bedroom,

51
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,815
uh, how to keep
things fresh.

52
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,031
- And how long have they been married?
- A year and...

53
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,503
- two months.
- Let's wait six months and do the story

54
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,302
where she catches him
doing a face-plant

55
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,725
on her personal assistant.

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,960
What is the problem here?

57
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,229
I need a cover,
you need jobs.

58
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,065
Seems like
the perfect match, no?

59
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,233
This is Hollywood.
Someone is getting screwed

60
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,203
and somebody out there
cannot wait to tell you about it.

61
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,471
There's a cover out there
somewhere, okay?

62
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,941
It's not going to just walk
through the front door!

63
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,055
Oh, yeah. Ah!

64
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,723
That's it. Unh!

65
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,329
Unh, incredible.

66
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,866
Oh, dude!
Oh, you're amazing.

67
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,203
Oh...oh, God.

68
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,475
Oh, God!

69
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,411
Get off of me, bitch.

"You Don't Know Jack"</b>

74
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,831
- Uh, Lucy, I--
- Yeah?

75
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,933
Well, I didn't see
my Venus Smith article

76
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,864
- and I was just wondering--
- That's because I'm not running it.

77
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:01,267
Well, I kind of got the impression
it was going to go this week.

78
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:03,376
Really? Where did you
get that impression?

79
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,677
I guess I just
kind of assumed--

80
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,781
Yeah, well, you know
what happens when you assume.

81
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,850
Yes, it makes
an ASS out of U-M-E.

82
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,853
No, it pisses me off.

83
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,723
So is it really
just that arbitrary?

84
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,758
The short answer is,
yes, it is.

85
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,092
But I'll spell it
out for you.

86
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,560
When I was done
reading your piece,

87
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,195
all I remembered
was a typo.

88
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,364
It wasn't bad...
but it was dull.

89
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,633
And that's worse.

90
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,625
What are you doing?

91
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,461
Trying to see how much
we weigh as a couple.

92
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,964
I've lost 91/2 pounds.

93
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,667
What's your secret?

94
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,535
Come on,
this isn't funny.

95
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,771
People just don't
lose weight for no reason.

96
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:06,838
Honey, listen.

97
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,206
Come on, this just
isn't normal.

98
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,175
The blood test
came back negative.

99
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,345
Then maybe they should
take more tests.

100
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,242
Neg-a-tive.

101
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:15,859
- H-- how do we know?
- The doctor says

102
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,517
it's probably just stress.

103
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,819
Just hear me out,
all right?

104
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,221
I mean, with your
new movie and--

105
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,057
and the accident

106
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,857
and taking care of me,

107
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,327
that's a lot.

108
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,461
But I'm doing better now.

109
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,597
So maybe I can
take care of you.

110
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,840
Julia, what are you doing?

111
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,960
I'm just trying to relieve
a little stress. Doctor's orders.

112
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,514
Julia, come on.Just--

113
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,584
Julia...

114
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,819
come on.

115
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,188
Julia, could you just stop?

116
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,462
- I'm sorry.
- Go to hell.

117
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,862
Julia, it's not you.

118
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,366
I'm just nervous about
this damn movie tomorrow.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,602
Julia!

120
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,747
Are you sure?

121
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,983
I'm quite familiar
with the act from

122
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,718
all angles.

123
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,321
And it was
definitely a man?

124
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,458
- It was his trainer.
- What's his name?

125
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,595
Um, all I know is that

126
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,263
he's red-headed and has
a March of the Penguins

127
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,533
bumper sticker on his van.

128
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,636
Suddenly, I don't
feel so special.

129
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,539
I didn't seek him out.

130
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,741
Okay? He seduced me.
I was there

131
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,276
to do a job.
He played me for a fool.

132
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,246
Lucy, I want to expose his lying,

133
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,515
cheating, trainer-blowing ass.

134
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,883
Okay, well,
this just happened,

135
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,685
so why don't you give it
a little time to digest it.

136
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,921
Digest?

137
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,155
Digest what?

138
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,556
Okay, a guy tells you

139
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,591
that he loves you,
that you're the first guy

140
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,094
he's ever been with
or felt this way about. Then,

141
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,031
two days later,
you catch him with his dick

142
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,733
in another guy's mouth?

143
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,161
If you tell me
it's just sex,

144
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:17,868
I'm cool with that. You tell me
you think you're falling in love,

145
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:19,743
that you want me to clear
my schedule for a month

146
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:22,111
to be in New Zealand
while you shoot your next picture,

147
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:23,308
I'm thinking, game on.

148
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,210
Now, honey, I understand.
But as your sister--

149
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,279
I don't want to talk
with my sister, okay?

150
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,247
I want to talk with the editor
of Dirt Now.

151
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,850
Is she in or isn't she?

152
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,952
You have no idea what
you'd be getting yourself into.

153
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,121
- I trust you.
- No, no. This has nothing to do

154
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,255
with trusting me.

155
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:41,327
You want to out one of the biggest
action stars in the world.

156
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,196
I sure as hell
will try to protect you, but

157
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,032
there are no guarantees.

158
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,068
Do you really want
to take that risk?

159
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,938
You bet your ass I do.

160
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,009
Good, because this
is a great Goddamn story.

161
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,215
Hey, little girl.

162
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,684
Yeah, you.

163
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,587
Hey, Diane.

164
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,689
Are you ready?

165
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,857
Okay, Diane. I'm just

166
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,226
going to open your mouth
and then slide this tablet

167
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,262
to the back of your throat.

168
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,898
Oh, yeah.

169
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,667
Oh, you did very good.
Very good.

170
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,635
'Cause you don't
want to get worms.

171
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,072
They can make you
feel real sick.

172
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,608
It's okay now.

173
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,780
Whatcha doing?

174
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,753
Yeah?

175
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,124
Okay.

176
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,714
Hi.

177
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,651
I'm supposed to meet
Jack for a late lunch.

178
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,852
I thought I had punched
the code in right.

179
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,353
He gave it to me
over the weekend.

180
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,788
Yeah, we change that
every week.

181
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,691
He's out back by the pool.

182
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,963
Damn, I've got fabric samples
in my car. Do you mind?

183
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,565
Yeah, make it quick.

184
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,076
You have incredible lips,
you know that?

185
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,647
They're just like Kira's,
thick,

186
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,649
the color of plums.

187
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,653
She used to

188
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,889
suck on her bottom lip
when she was messed up.

189
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,726
Like a pacifier,
you know? Just--

190
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,930
Hey...hey, hey, hey, hey.

191
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,733
What's the matter, kitten?

192
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,234
Hmm?

193
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,970
Kira loved you.

194
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,940
It's Holt she didn't like.

195
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,844
That's 'cause he never
stuck his dick in her.

196
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,014
She didn't think
he was good enough for you.

197
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,950
She loved you.

198
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,653
I can totally see why.

199
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,757
She knew you'd never leak
the pregnancy to the press.

200
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,498
Kira told me
she told you.

201
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,167
She thought maybe you--

202
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,039
you got drunk
and told Holt and he leaked it.

203
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,809
She knew you wouldn't
betray her like that.

204
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,378
She thought it was Holt.

205
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,581
No, Holt never knew.

206
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,286
And if he did,
he'd never betray me.

207
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,355
Oh, Julia.

208
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,090
Julia, come on.

209
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,794
This is Hollywood.

210
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,863
Betrayal should have its own star
on the Walk of Fame.

211
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,109
Hey!

212
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,346
What are you doing?

213
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,714
Shh! Shut up.

214
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,749
Oh, shit.
You're real.

215
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,417
Get him!

216
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,220
Hey, hey, nice pool.
I love the Greek urns.

217
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,724
You know, the Romans, they stole
all the culture from the Greeks.

218
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,859
You know, they liked it,
so they just took it.

219
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,247
Oh!

220
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,707
Sit your--

221
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,843
Found this in his pocket.

222
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,886
- What?
- "What?"

223
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,936
Get him out of here!

224
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,612
When you're done with him,
come get this piece of shit right here.

225
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,993
There you are.
You got a second?

226
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:55,995
Hello?

227
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:57,830
I just said I need
to speak with you.

228
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,432
No, you asked me if I had a second
and, obviously, I don't.

229
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:03,434
Uh, may I ask what's so important
that you can't give me a second here?

230
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:04,470
Don's in jail.

231
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:05,837
Uh, I'm sorry?

232
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,239
Yeah, I'd better
go bail him out.

233
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,075
What? Wait a--
No, no, no, no. No.

234
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,716
Don does not work for Dirt Now.
He's freelance.

235
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:14,980
We are of no obligation
to him whatsoever.

236
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,955
Any interference on our part might
be construed as fidelity--

237
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:19,852
I'm bailing him out
as a friend.

238
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,556
You know what friends are, don't you
Brent? Oh, will you let me finish?

239
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,324
You're setting us up
for a lawsuit.

240
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,192
He has our next
cover pictures on him.

241
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,161
I don't care if he has pictures
of Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton

242
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,230
going down on a ghost
of Frank Sinatra.

243
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,500
How he got them
is my concern.

244
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,969
He got them by being the best
photographer out there.

245
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,437
I know you're
a busy woman, Spiller--

246
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,775
what, with saving the planet
one drunken celebrity at a time--

247
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,576
but there are amended statutes
you might want to gloss over

248
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,379
before you hang
the magazine out to dry.

249
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,681
- You done?
- Yes, I am.

250
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,316
Good. I'm going
to get my next cover.

251
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,320
Love the "friend" angle.

252
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,237
You almost had me
on that one.

253
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,527
It's looking
really beautiful, Holt.

254
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,585
You can take a break,
if you'd like. For a minute.

255
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:05,597
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

256
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,466
Get the girls in, please.

257
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,401
Does that car bring
back some memories.

258
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,704
My dad had a '67 goat.

259
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:12,804
Yeah, it's nice, huh?

260
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,762
If I could lose my virginity all over
again, it'd be in the back seat.

261
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,842
Now, who am I kidding?
It would be in Bora Bora.

262
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,508
But that back seat's a close second.

263
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,846
She's a beauty.

264
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,547
She's yours.

265
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,681
What are you talking about?

266
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,430
I knew you liked it, so I talked to
the agency and they said

267
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:28,712
they would be thrilled to have
you tooling around town

268
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:29,654
in one of their cars.

269
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,491
Shut up. Get the hell out of here.

270
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:33,411
Thank you.

271
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,160
- You're welcome.
- My darlings are ready for you,

272
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:35,964
so step in, please.

273
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,189
- Get in there.
- Honey, you're going to look at him.

274
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,767
And, sweetheart, you are not looking
at a loaf of white bread.

275
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,736
He's important.

276
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,204
That makes you important.

277
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,974
That's it.

278
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,110
I am moist.

279
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,277
Am I right, girls?

280
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,948
Holt, these are going
to be gorgeous.

281
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:56,565
We will definitely hold them till
after the Fincher release.

282
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,450
Oh, my God, seriously.
Who's with me on the moist? Anyone?

283
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:01,273
- Please.
- Okay.

284
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,322
Julia.

285
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,428
Hey, look who's here.

286
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,333
Hey, did you come
to watch the shoot?

287
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,839
Take one of us.
Okay, very nice.

288
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,661
But we need to get back to work,
so could you please...

289
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,445
She's pretty,
isn't she?

290
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,810
Yes, she is. Why-- so why
don't you come and sit down?

291
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,249
You want to
do us together?

292
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,266
- I bet you suck a mean dick.
- Julia.

293
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,353
Okay. All right. Sweetie--

294
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:35,024
Can I get a bottle of water over here?

295
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:37,455
Hey, you're missing
his greatest asset.

296
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,590
Here, honey, turn around.

297
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,915
He's got the best ass
in the business.

298
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,428
Julia, that's enough.

299
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,328
It's nothing, though,
next to his dick.

300
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,564
Julia, that's enough.
Please.

301
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,400
Which he won't
screw me with anymore.

302
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,003
- Come here.
- Can I get that damn water?

303
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,970
Right here.

304
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,440
Why don't you
make love to me anymore?

305
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,609
Do you not love me?

306
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,547
Sweetheart, come on.

307
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,587
Holt, listen.
Listen. Holt.

308
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,560
- Hey, this is about Julia. Listen.
- Sweetie, stop.

309
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,930
- Listen.
- Hey, hey.

310
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,832
Listen.
Listen to me.

311
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,018
More important than how she's behaving
right now is how you handle it.

312
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:26,004
This could ruin her career
if we don't handle it properly.

313
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:28,069
I know she's messed up on
the pain-killers and it's not her fault,

314
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,006
but you've got to be smart here.

315
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,008
- All right.
- Holt...

316
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,009
- let me do what you pay me to do.
- All right!

317
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,572
You can handle this in private,
away from the cameras. Go.

318
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,822
Hi. Yeah, I need a limo
to take Julia Mallory home.

319
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,257
I'm at the photo shoot.

320
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,558
No, I need it now.

321
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,720
Yeah, she needs
to go straight home.

322
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,129
How much?

323
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,697
No, Town Car's fine.

324
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,704
I just want to know,
is that normal procedure?

325
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,306
I busted my ass
on that piece.

326
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:05,343
I mean, tell me if I'm wrong to be upset
and to let it go, it's just that--

327
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,945
Willa,
you want my advice?

328
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,280
Yeah, of course.

329
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,648
Grow a pair.

330
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:10,715
Pardon?

331
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,183
Tough shit.
Your piece got spiked.

332
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,719
Write another one.
End of story.

333
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:18,039
If you'll excuse me, these celebrities
aren't going to screw themselves.

334
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,026
Yeah, all right, Carlson.

335
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,696
Yeah, what happens at The Standard stays
at The Standard, right?

336
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,200
Oh, yeah.

337
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,868
I'll-- I'll talk
to you next week.

338
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,571
Can I help you?

339
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,105
Uh, Nancy?

340
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,108
Yeah, your assistant, she's talking
to one of my associates right now.

341
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,809
But not to worry.
We'll be brief.

342
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,645
Uh...

343
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,244
To be honest, I don't know how I can be
of help to either one of you gentlemen.

344
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:46,167
But how do you know?
We haven't asked you anything yet.

345
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,222
But to be perfectly honest, I think that
you could be of a great help to us.

346
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,191
But then again,
that just may be my

347
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,193
overly optimistic nature.

348
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,327
- What do you want?
- We would like to know

349
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,336
who gave up our boy in
the Aundre G story

350
00:19:58,337 --> 00:19:59,929
that you said you weren't going to run.

351
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:00,966
I don't know.

352
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,101
This nigga, he's something, dude.

353
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:04,922
Okay,

354
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:07,672
now you're going to sit up here
in your big-ass, expensive office,

355
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,227
in your $2,000 suit,
and your five-buck tie,

356
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:13,175
and that punk-ass haircut, and
you're going to look me in my black face

357
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,445
and you're going to tell me
that you don't know shit?

358
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:17,771
Come on, man.
You the man.

359
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,353
You know every detail that happens
in this office, don't you? Am I right?

360
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,635
Am I right? Am I right?

361
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:25,031
- I think you're right.
- You're damn straight I'm right.

362
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:25,832
I'm the publisher.

363
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,096
It's not necessary that I know
who the source of a story is.

364
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,729
Mm-hmm.
You see that, Maurice?

365
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,931
Yeah, I saw it.
You s-saw what?

366
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,756
You looked down
when you said that.

367
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,535
- So what?
- So you're lying.

368
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:37,970
You broke eye contact.

369
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,105
When people lie,
they look away. Yeah.

370
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,041
- That's a big tell, my friend.
- Oh, my God.

371
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,545
What do you, uh--
What do you gentlemen know

372
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,114
about the free press?

373
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,251
Please, illuminate.

374
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,953
Confidentiality
between the journalist

375
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,357
and his or her source
is sacrosanct.

376
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,626
Shield laws give journalists

377
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,495
the legal protection to keep
the identity of a source private,

378
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,432
even when police and prosecutors
are threatening contempt and jail time.

379
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,136
Now, to betray that confidence
is a breach of ethics so great,

380
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,039
it compromises
the very foundation

381
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,875
upon which the whole
of journalism is predicated.

382
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,580
Wow.

383
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,184
Thank you, sir,
for educating two ignorant brothers

384
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,487
in journalistic ethics
in the middle of your busy workday.

385
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,422
Oh... man.

386
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,260
Is that a real KC Haxton?
Haxton's the shit.

387
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,984
Oh, God.

388
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,031
Oh, Don.
Are you okay?

389
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,132
Yeah.

390
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,107
- Do you have the film?
- I think so.

391
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,176
Do you need to go
to the bathroom to get it?

392
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,345
No, it's not there.

393
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,947
Where, then?

394
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,587
What's the quickest and safest way
to remove it from his stomach?

395
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,989
Well, we can send
a tube down his throat,

396
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,003
and then reach in
and grab it with a claw,

397
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,615
or we can do it laparoscopically.

398
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:44,774
It's a little more involved.
We make an incision--

399
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:46,477
- What do you think, Don?
- Claw.

400
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:47,892
Me too.

401
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,701
Will it damage
the canister?

402
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,236
No. Stomach acid,
on the other hand,

403
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,740
can break down just about
anything, given enough time.

404
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,509
How the hell did you swallow
a film canister?

405
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,311
Can I be home by 6?

406
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,214
Please?

407
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,750
That is so cute!

408
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,319
You'd better not be planning
your wedding shit on my dime.

409
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,255
I'm on my lunch.
And it's actually baby shit.

410
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,891
No more tuna fish.
The smell makes me sick.

411
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,926
- Excuse me, Lucy?
- Yeah?

412
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,229
- Selena Torres wants to talk.
- About what?

413
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
Her side of the scandal.

414
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,565
She said that she didn't sleep
with the contestant until

415
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,001
after he won on American Dream.

416
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,469
What's the big deal?
She pretty much already said that.

417
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,739
Yeah, but he's not the only
contestant she slept with.

418
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,108
Why now?

419
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,177
Another one of them is coming forward.
She wants to do a sort of

420
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,780
mea culpa and beat him to the punch.

421
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,782
And why you?

422
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,351
Well, her publicist and
I have a relationship.

423
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,320
No, it's a professional relationship.

424
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,589
Have it to me by noon tomorrow.

425
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:45,957
Okay.

426
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,303
- Hey.
- <i>Hi</i>.

427
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,038
I need to see you tonight.

428
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,240
I can't. I got-- I gotta see Julia.

429
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,875
I think you're going to want to hear
what I have to say.

430
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,011
My house, 8:30.

431
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,200
<i>God, you are so beautiful.</i>

432
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,011
It's okay, baby bird.
You're all right.

433
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,913
You're all right.

434
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,450
There. That better?

435
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,454
Okay. Just relax...

436
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,990
Enjoy the ride.

437
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,269
* Twinkle, twinkle little star. *

438
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,341
<i>* How I wonder... *</i>

439
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,747
<i>* Up above the world so high *</i>

440
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,253
* like a diamond in the sky. *

441
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,225
* Twinkle, twinkle little star. *

442
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,831
*  How I wonder what you are. *

443
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,866
You know who you remind me of?

444
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,536
No.

445
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,238
Bobby Meserve.

446
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,774
Who's that?

447
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,978
He's the first boy I kissed.

448
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,450
Boys had kissed me
before, but...

449
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,188
he was the first boy I kissed.

450
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,092
He was so...

451
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,697
so pretty.

452
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,907
I like the way you look at me.

453
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,279
I love them. What else you got?

454
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,479
This is all of it,

455
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,015
which, considering where if
came from, is pretty damn good.

456
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,050
I think we were lucky.

457
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,887
I think the one with his hands
down your pants is a keeper.

458
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,089
What is it?

459
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,891
You can really see it's me.

460
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,459
Not for long.

461
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,927
Photoshop the shit out of his face.

462
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:10,894
Not a problem.

463
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,030
When Danielle's done,
Mom won't even know it's you.

464
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,099
Sweet.

465
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,567
Thank you.

466
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,369
Come here.

467
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,404
Do you want to stay at my house?

468
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,941
Why? Are you going
to nurse me back to heal?

469
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:24,975
I guess you're right.

470
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,377
It's never really been my calling.

471
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,379
Remember when I was eight
and had chicken pox?

472
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,415
You stood in the doorway of my bedroom
and threw a box of Saltines at me,

473
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,350
and then told Mom and Dad
you'd fed me lunch.

474
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,519
Technically, that was true.

475
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,488
I was not much of a cook either.

476
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,923
The offer still stands.

477
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,191
I know.

478
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,363
Get out of here.

479
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,600
Scott, I love you.
I love you. I love you.

480
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,668
No problem, Will.

481
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,570
She needs to clear the air.
It's a big scoop.

482
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,838
<i>You were my first thought.</i>

483
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,407
<i>Figured if I was going to do a solid</i>
for a reporter,

484
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,541
it may as well be a hottie.

485
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,410
I owe you, Scott. Big time.

486
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,344
<i>See you tonight?</i>

487
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,946
Il Misto, 7:30.

488
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,184
Yes.

489
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,419
Yes!

490
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,723
Hello, Gibson.

491
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,626
I just heard the damnedest story...

492
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,860
so ludicrous,

493
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,363
I had to come tell you in person.

494
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,170
I heard my magazine
went

495
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,206
and bailed out
some psychotic photographer.

496
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,808
Now...

497
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,077
I thought, what kind of

498
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,545
idiot risked my holdings,

499
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,780
not to mention their entire career,

500
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,883
over some addled pap who nabs
the occasional sagging tit or

501
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,654
rumpled ass of some
future Hollywood Square?

502
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,292
Uh, do you mind if I speak frankly?

503
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,426
Oh, by all means.

504
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,096
Why do you give a shit?

505
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,665
Have you seen the sell-through?

506
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,667
Fifty-nine percent.

507
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,336
People Magazine would suck
your dick for those numbers.

508
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,172
Lucy, you haven't
answered my question yet.

509
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,975
- Am I going to get--
- Sued?

510
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,443
Yeah, most likely.

511
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:09,347
But that price tag is going to pale
compared to what you'll pull in.

512
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,549
And besides, you always told me
scared money doesn't make money.

513
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,486
Neither does stupid money.

514
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,553
What's a few million to you?

515
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,790
You just made that clear in your throat.

516
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,794
Don Conkey had this week's cover
sitting inside of him.

517
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,498
It was business. It was really
good business.

518
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:27,766
Okay.

519
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,035
What's the cover?

520
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:35,140
Photos of Jack Dawson
fondling another guy's nutsack.

521
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,976
Jack Dawson?

522
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,417
Well, that's not your average Hollywood
fag story. I'll give you that.

523
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,155
Oh, Lucy.

524
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,422
Well...

525
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,559
I guess I came all this way for nothing.

526
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,229
No, actually, I think it's a pretty
good time to talk about my raise.

527
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,633
Have a seat, sweet pea.

528
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,505
- There you are.
- Hi!

529
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,307
Hi.

530
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:10,741
You look amazing.

531
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,644
- Oh, thank you.
- Scott, party of two.

532
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,577
Follow me.

533
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,712
Um, where's Selena?

534
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,249
Oh, I didn't think we needed
her here at this juncture.

535
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,418
What do you mean?

536
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,453
I have to have this on my editor's desk
by noon tomorrow.

537
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,621
Relax, Will.

538
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,825
Let's have some nice
Italian food, some wine.

539
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,492
Plenty of time, right?

540
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,095
- A bottle of the Santa Margherita.
- Sure.

541
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,996
Pino Grigio's okay?

542
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,932
Scott.

543
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,967
- I need this story.
- Sure...

544
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,802
after we catch up.

545
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,204
I mean, what's the rush? Right?

546
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,942
Do you want me to call Luce, tell her
to cool her heels or something?

547
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,477
Your company reps Venus Smith, right?

548
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,347
Yeah. She's a top-feeder.

549
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,751
Well, I just happen to know the doctor
who stapled her stomach.

550
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,687
There's-- there's no proof
that she actually had that--

551
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,955
Don't screw with me, Scott.

552
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,857
It's not speculative. I know.

553
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,893
I've talked with him. I have his story.

554
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:06,497
Now, you have Selena in my office
tomorrow morning, or I'm running it.

555
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,332
And then I'll have "Luce"

556
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,069
call your boss and tell him
how it was all preventable.

557
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,172
- You're full of shit.
- Try me.

558
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:15,807
Your wine.

559
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,541
Thank you.

560
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,543
It's on him.

561
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,997
<i>Dad, I think it's time.</i>

562
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,168
I know.

563
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,315
People, Us, OK, Star,

564
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,019
everyone's going full bore on
your girlfriend's episode today.

565
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,954
It's her pain meds.

566
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,156
We're adjusting the prescription.

567
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,025
You know what might help sell that?

568
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,628
If you look the press in the eye
when you feed them that bullshit.

569
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,667
What the hell
am I doing here?

570
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:20,271
We're covering it as Julia Mallory's
courageous battle with addiction

571
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,409
and how she's doing better, thanks
to her hot-ass boyfriend, Holt McLaren.

572
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,844
Am I supposed to thank you?

573
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,447
Yes.

574
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,082
But not for that.

575
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,592
Hello?

576
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,498
What the hell are you guys doing here?

577
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,969
Well, if it isn't Mr. Ethics.

578
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,204
I hope you brought your appetite.

579
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,812
Jack Dawson's gay.

580
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,183
And how do you know that?

581
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,250
Because I have pictures of him

582
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,854
and an unidentified man
frolicking by his pool.

583
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,223
We're running it
on tomorrow's cover.

584
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:13,958
Holy shit.

585
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,760
So, unless America is suddenly okay

586
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,963
with their action hero
taking it up the ass...

587
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,999
I think that pretty much opens the path

588
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,435
for you getting the lead
in Hard Charger.

589
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,738
Of course, if you're going to be
the next big action hero,

590
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,040
you're going to have to bulk up.

591
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,643
No, I'm a vegetarian.

592
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,014
Then you're in for a treat.

593
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,752
We're at the top of the food chain.
We can eat whatever we want.

594
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,488
What about its pain and suffering?

595
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,424
I didn't feel a thing.

596
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,629
If God didn't
want us to

597
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,364
eat the weak,

598
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,466
then why did he make them so delicious?

599
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,236
Besides,

600
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,871
this isn't some

601
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,475
indie bullshit where you play
a tortured, love-struck down-and-outer.

602
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,545
No, this is a full-on,

603
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,047
fight-for-your-life,

604
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,315
kill-or-be-killed...

605
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,952
hero-gets-the-girl action movie.

606
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,812
Could you guys please just tell me
what the hell it is you want?

607
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,280
It's simple, really.

608
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,948
We want to make you dinner.

609
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,751
Eh, Maurice, don't burn that garlic.

610
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:47,851
I'm not.

611
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,421
If you burn the garlic, you know
you'll ruin the whole dish.

612
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,355
See,

613
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,025
when you pan-roast garlic

614
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,493
you're turning a starch into a sugar,

615
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,028
and then it makes it really sweet.

616
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,430
But then, if you burn it,
it makes it too bitter.

617
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:04,435
So it just takes a little bit of heat
to render its sweetness.

618
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,071
Eh, you got fennel?

619
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:09,706
What?

620
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,009
- You got fennel, you asshole?
- I-- I don't know!

621
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,345
I don't cook much. No?

622
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,180
Oh, man. Then you are in
for a treat, man.

623
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,883
A home-cooked meal.

624
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,119
And Maurice, he is an incredible cook.

625
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,720
He studied in Italy for two years.

626
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,456
- Two-and-a-half.
- My bad.

627
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,393
Do you know what Maurice is going
to prepare for your dinner?

628
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,532
Your dick.

629
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,201
Wh--

630
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,470
You're joking.

631
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,807
Oh... God, no! No!

632
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,075
God!

633
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,477
That is a nice-size cock
for a white boy.

634
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,312
Oh, G--

635
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,846
You might have some leftover--

636
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,715
Oh, what do you want?
Please! Jesus Christ!

637
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:52,583
What do you want?

638
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,286
You, uh--

639
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,154
Oh, God!

640
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,656
- You know what this shit is?
- No.

641
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,424
This is going to cauterize you

642
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:04,695
so that you don't bleed to death while
you're enjoying your dick dinner.

643
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,597
You see, first...

644
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,000
Maurice is going to chop off your dick.

645
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,836
And then, he's going to slice it

646
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,841
into bite-sized pieces
to make it easier to chew.

647
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,376
And then we're going
to simmer it with some tomato

648
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,011
and some fennel,
if you had some.

649
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,312
What do you want?

650
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,814
I want you to stop

651
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,885
asking me dumb-ass questions
and tell me what I came here for.

652
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,225
Ty-- Tyreese.

653
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,395
T-- Tyreese.

654
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,330
It's Tyreese.

655
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,968
- We friends?
- Yes, we're friends.

656
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,009
Thank you.

657
00:36:58,849 --> 00:36:59,784
Yeah.

658
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,486
You need to season this butcher block.

659
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,721
It's drying out.

660
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,997
So that wasn't so bad, was it?

661
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,765
No, it was good.

662
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,735
Hey, thanks for the heads-up.

663
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,144
Has anyone ever told you
how beautiful you are?

664
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,780
No. You're the first.

665
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,682
Wow, you're tough.

666
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,417
Come on, you're on the verge
of owning this town

667
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,887
and that's the best you can do?
Some generic compliment?

668
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,890
What exactly is beautiful about me?

669
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,325
Be specific.

670
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,094
Is it my...

671
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:44,795
my face?

672
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,131
Is it my ass?

673
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,734
- My eyes--
- Yes, yes, and...

674
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,803
definitely yeah.

675
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,606
You're a moron.

676
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,041
And you're a nine.

677
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,079
Only a nine?

678
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,384
Well, if you want to be a ten,
it's really simple.

679
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,852
Okay, enlighten me.

680
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,857
Shut up.

681
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,368
Good night, Holt.

682
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,805
Yeah, could have been.

683
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,714
Oh, man.

684
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,517
Shit, dawg. Again?

685
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,219
Yeah, man.

686
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,188
You can't be beatin' me
at my own game, now.

687
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,489
Maybe you should stick to the internet.

688
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,459
Fool, you should have seen me
last night down by the airport.

689
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,063
Nigga was cleanin' up.

690
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,867
Well, that must have been with a broom,
'cause I ain't seeing none of that here.

691
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,304
- He got a point.
- Give me them cards, man.

692
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,473
My niggas.

693
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,275
Mind if I sit in on a couple hands?

694
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,610
Shit, man.

695
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,347
Your money'll feel just as good
in my pocket as these punks'.

696
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,385
I wanna sit next to my boy.

697
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,787
You down with that, Prince?

698
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,189
Yeah, Tweet.

699
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,690
Of course, man.

700
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:23,827
All right, whose deal?

701
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,596
Shit, you holdin' the cards, nigga.

702
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,337
Yeah.

703
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,606
Oh, man.

704
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,474
Holy shit.

705
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,511
This must be your lucky night, boy.

706
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,980
- That's how he did it.
- Cool.

707
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,082
Can somebody open the window, man?
It's hot in here.

708
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,118
So, Prince, how's the knee, man?

709
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,687
It's good, Tweet.

710
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,055
- You know, it's just a little strain.
- That's good.

711
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,624
You gotta take care of that shit, man.

712
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,827
You can't play no basketball
if your knees are gone.

713
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,028
Am I right?

714
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:33,197
True.

715
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,466
You in or out?

716
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,603
Listen, I got a little
physical rehab tomorrow.

717
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:40,871
You can't win and run.

718
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,406
Sit down, baby. Hang out.
Come on. Sit down.

719
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:44,408
Sit down.

720
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:51,115
Yes. Knees are very, very important.

721
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,750
Never mind basketball.

722
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,152
Just everyday walking around.

723
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,321
Playing with your kids.

724
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,656
Hell...

725
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,060
You can't even handle your business

726
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,262
if your legs don't work.

727
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,533
Take the anterior cruciate.

728
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,503
Yeah, when that bitch pops...

729
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,838
That's a world of hurt.

730
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,040
Add to that

731
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,408
the medial collateral...

732
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,644
Shit, we're talking major damage.

733
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,148
Now, if done just...

734
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,283
right--

735
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,786
I mean, say it was deliberate.

736
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,054
Chances are...

737
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,323
that nigga never gonna
stand upright again.

738
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,226
Never mind play no basketball.

739
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,395
A lot depends on how it happens.

740
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,700
You fall on the court,
knee on knee, boom!

741
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,203
Most likely, yeah, you walk
away from those all right.

742
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,105
Four to six weeks...

743
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,075
you're back covering Shaq's ass.

744
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:55,713
But say a pipe or a baseball bat...

745
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,349
Now those are different.

746
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,018
Some injuries...

747
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,020
are permanent.

748
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,227
Take my boy,

749
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,762
Aundre G.

750
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,232
You don't mind if he
sits in a hand, do ya?

751
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,534
No, I'm good.

752
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,142
I got a call.

753
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,177
Cops were all up in my shit.

754
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:29,779
It worked out good, though.

755
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,080
Give me a chance to

756
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,551
have some quality time with Mr. G.

757
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,755
Give me some creative space.

758
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,158
Tweet. No, Tweety.
Come on, man...

759
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,927
Tweety, no, man.

760
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,931
Mama!

761
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,333
Don't be such a bitch, Prince.

762
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,468
Have some dignity, nigga.

763
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,437
You scared, Prince?

764
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,073
Go to church.

765
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,675
Tweety does.

766
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,843
Tweety loves church.

767
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,889
<i>Prince Tyreese Attacked!</i>

768
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,525
- Worthless piece of shit!
- Listen to me!

769
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,128
They-- they came to my house.

770
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,365
They were gonna cut my dick off,
and feed it to me.

771
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,032
You gave up a source.

772
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,634
They were going to kill me!

773
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,636
He's done.

774
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,771
They don't even know if he's gonna live.

775
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,475
I did the same thing you would have done
if they threatened to cut your dick off.

776
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,510
You're a riot, Brent.

777
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,478
How do you even live with yourself?

778
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:36,547
Excuse me?

779
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,351
You blackmailed a man to get a story.

780
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,986
Then threatened to ruin him.
And then when the shitstorm

781
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,154
that you created
comes to fruition, it's--

782
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,824
it's me who's the asshole?

783
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,591
- Where are you in all of this?
- I sure

784
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,561
as hell am not the one
who gave up a source.

785
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,762
Give me a--

786
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,299
You know what I remember,
when I first brought you in

787
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,322
as the editor of both
Dirt and Now?

788
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,970
You moved into Pembroke's
old office, and he had that

789
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,340
beautiful antique mirror. Remember that?

790
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,209
My god, it was worth thousands.

791
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,746
First thing you did, before anything
else, was have that taken down.

792
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,147
So?

793
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,950
So maybe it's time to put it back up.

794
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,268
Is that what you think?

795
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,872
That you can just shit all
over me and this magazine?

796
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,206
This is Dirt Now!

797
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,343
We've outsold every other
weekly, two weeks running,

798
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,146
and we're about to make it a third.

799
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,450
So you listen to me,
you insignificant piece of shit.

800
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,585
You're giving me this story.

801
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,154
Because if you don't,

802
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,655
Dirt Now will have a camera

803
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,225
up your client's ass,
every second of every day.

804
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,660
If she so much as blinks

805
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,364
at another contestant, we're gonna
run that she's screwing him.

806
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:04,267
Every pit stain, every ounce
of cellulite, every photograph

807
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,169
that makes her look
semi-retarded will be

808
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,471
splashed full-color in
the pages of our magazine.

809
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,240
And that's just off the top of my head.

810
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,509
Wait until I give it some real thought.

811
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,912
Now you've got 20 minutes

812
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,514
to get her contestant-nailing ass
over here before

813
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:22,052
we make her a pin-up girl for every STD
known to man, and then some.

814
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,993
- Lucy, I'm...
- I'm gonna run this story.

815
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,795
Cover inset.

816
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,363
Thank you.

817
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,132
No, thank you.

818
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,482
<i>You don't know Jack!</i>

819
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,227
- He friendly?
- Sure.

820
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,597
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

821
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,036
You're gonna wanna see this.

822
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,274
Your friend, Leo.

823
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,844
Turns out he's Lucy Spiller's brother.

824
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,914
That tabloid bitch.
