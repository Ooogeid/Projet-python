00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:06,342
<i>Hi, I'm Don Konkey, DirtNow's resident
schizophrenic photographer,</i>

2
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:08,224
<i>and voice-over
extraordinaire.</i>

3
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:12,788
- <i>Last week was a bitch...</i>
- Get back. Get back.

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,459
<i>...especially for
Lucy's assistant Kenny.</i>

5
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,762
<i>Barrow and Willa seemed
to be getting along nicely...</i>

6
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,073
Meet me in the supply closet
in 20 minutes.

7
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:27,095
<i>...really, really, really,
really, really nicely.</i>

8
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:29,535
I've got 13 minutes!

9
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:33,230
<i>Julia came home from rehab,
but her mind seemed elsewhere.</i>

10
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:37,177
<i>Holt seemed happy to see her,
but his mind seemed elsewhere also.</i>

11
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:39,229
I need to be with you.

12
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:42,131
- You mean inside of me?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:44,374
<i>Julia's had it rough lately.</i>

14
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,928
<i>The sex tape of her and Johnny Gage
is still out there</i>

15
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:48,699
<i>and she doesn't know who has it.</i>

16
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:50,849
Who are you trying
to protect, Holt?

17
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:54,169
<i>That's Julia with her
lesbian smack dealer, Garbo.</i>

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,151
<i>Since she left rehab,
she doesn't do either anymore.</i>

19
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,166
Well, at least they caught
Lucy's stalker, right?

20
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,450
<i>Right? Heh.</i>

21
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:33,548
I love you, Holt.

22
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,797
I love you.

23
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:42,935
Holt.

24
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,263
What?

25
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:51,099
What's wrong, baby?

26
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:55,697
What happened?

27
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:59,052
You haven't made love to me
like that in months.

28
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,611
I'm just--
I'm wiped out, all right?

29
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:05,086
But you were so passionate.

30
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:07,385
I was about to come.

31
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:11,163
Here.

32
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,406
All right, fine.
I'll make myself come.

Dirt - Season 01 - Episode 10
"The Sexxx Issue"

36
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,105
<i>Move it!</i>

37
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:00,257
- What is it that you want?
- <i>I want respect!</i>

38
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,524
<i>And I wanti it now!</i>

39
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:05,450
<i>Do you have any idea what it's like
to lose the compass in your life?</i>

40
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,777
<i>We are losing the focus here!</i>

41
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,655
<i>We shouldn't have to
work that hard for love.</i>

42
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,125
<i>The focus is me! Me!
I'm here!</i>

43
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:14,026
<i>God damn it!
I'm still here!</i>

44
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:15,806
Hello.

45
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:23,920
Does it bother you that every time
I look at you I think of anthrax?

46
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,185
You should
feel honored.

47
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:27,730
After 9/11, you were one
of the few non-politicians

48
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,326
to get the gift of deadly
class-five chemicals.

49
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:32,520
I'd rather have
the fruit basket.

50
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:33,970
How are you?

51
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:35,712
I'm fine.

52
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,121
Why?

53
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,115
You're so full of shit.

54
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:44,382
Well, I've never been much
of a navel-gazer.

55
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:48,285
You watched your assistant
take a bullet to the head.

56
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:51,676
Your entire staff and your business
were terrorized.

57
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:53,952
How did Sammy Winter
get my personal number?

58
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:55,489
How did he get
into my car?

59
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,967
I'm still looking into it.

60
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,421
You know better than just
about anybody how easy it is

61
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:02,178
to get into someone's life
and steal their soul.

62
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,541
What we do has nothing to do
with stalking or terrorizing people.

63
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,957
He's not a weirdo.
Give him a call.

64
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,004
It's not just you.

65
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,928
Your entire staff,

66
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:28,298
haven't you noticed
they're pretty wrecked?

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,599
Uh-huh! Mm...
Yes!

68
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:38,406
I was having such a lousy night
until I met your guys.

69
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,071
You're sweet.

70
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:45,879
I love your hair.

71
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,792
Oh, you do?

72
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:49,970
Thank you.
Yours is really pretty, too.

73
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:53,892
My natural color is the color
of shit in a mud puddle.

74
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:59,352
"Roses have thorns
and silver fountains mud."

75
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:02,390
"Clouds and eclipses
stain both moon and sun,

76
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:07,003
and loathsome canker
lives in sweetest bud."

77
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,798
Hot.

78
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,460
It's the 35th sonnet.
It's the best one.

79
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:15,375
You guys know poetry?
That's so awesome. All I know is,

80
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,713
"Here I sit,
brokenhearted..."

81
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,772
You want to know
what's really awesome?

82
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,121
What?

83
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:25,796
That tattoo
in the small of your back.

84
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,872
It keeps going.
Want to see?

85
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:03,006
Shall we move this
to a more private venue?

86
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:19,841
Oh, yeah!

87
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:25,847
Why do I get the feeling
you've done this before?

88
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,622
- I like walking with you.
- Me, too.

89
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,297
- With you.
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,398
Oh, I can't.

91
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:22,465
See?
That wasn't so bad.

92
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,970
You have
really soft hands.

93
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,906
- What a dickhead.
- What?

94
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:29,596
Pussy boy.

95
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:31,203
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

96
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:33,959
Aw, is little Donny scared?
Little Donny Littledick?

97
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,194
Please.
I don't like you. I like her.

98
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:38,036
Don, what's going on?
I don't understand.

99
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,303
"Don, what's going on?
I don't understand."

100
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:45,276
- Don't make fun of her, please!
- That's right, pussy. Beg.

101
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,402
Don!
It's okay!

102
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:51,751
Don!

103
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:54,812
Every single time.
Every single time I have something.

104
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,743
A little bit of
something for me, huh?

105
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:02,291
- Okay, what do you got?
- Celeb tragedies?

106
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:03,528
Okay.

107
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,015
- Plastic surgery disasters?
- No.

108
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:08,479
I think we can get an at-home sit-down
with Julia Roberts,

109
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,204
something classy.

110
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:13,802
People are cutting the magazine
a lot of slack since the...thing.

111
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:17,051
I'm sorry. I think I just dozed
off for a second.

112
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:22,313
Guys, okay.
Okay.

113
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,964
Come on, guys.
We have to have some fun.

114
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,744
Ready?

115
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:29,900
Mmm!

116
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:33,586
Okay, we bag it and make it look like
you have to see the inside.

117
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:36,305
It's our first annual.
It has to be great. It has to be

118
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:38,451
startling. It has to be fun!

119
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,014
Come on!
Sex, celebrity, scandal! Bring it!

120
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:44,179
- "Sex and the Stars."
- Oh, God! Generic! No!

121
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,266
"Battle of the Bulge."

122
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:47,096
Who's packing among
Hollywood leading men.

123
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:49,566
Okay, and make sure while
you're at it, see who's faking it.

124
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,515
- "Celebrity Cameltoe."
- I love it.

125
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:53,967
- "Celeb Mooseknuckle."
- Please!

126
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,636
Is that the male version
for "cameltoe"?

127
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:58,040
- A. K. A, "mangina".
- A. K. A., "mammal-toe".

128
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,940
Oh, gross!
Okay, Kitty Ryder.

129
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:01,983
We don't do porn stars.

130
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:04,465
Well, she dated most
of the starting lineup of the Lakers,

131
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,714
all of Motley Crue.
She's got her own clothing line,

132
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,781
makeup, and sex toys.
She's worth millions.

133
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,446
- Okay, get it.
- "Hollywood Hookers."

134
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:11,479
Only the high-class ones.

135
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,629
- "Sex Toy Parties."
- Yes.

136
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,870
- "Celeb Key Parties."
- Yes.

137
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:16,640
- "Great Movie Orgasms."
- God damn it, yes!

138
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,528
It's not bad.

139
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:26,824
You know, I like it how you guys
have to

140
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:29,745
break into Los Alamos
and steal the plutonium.

141
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,953
Yeah, it's cool, right?

142
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:34,604
And the girl's part's
not bad. Is it cast?

143
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:36,786
They want me
to read some people.

144
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:38,722
Yo, do you mind?

145
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:40,722
Come on, man.

146
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:42,997
I should play it.

147
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:46,921
I mean, I could play
a forensic futurist.

148
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,229
Quinn would probably shit.

149
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,759
He'd never want me to play
fourth bana on an action flick, but...

150
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:56,251
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. For sure.

151
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:59,417
I could get my production company
going while we're working, and

152
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:01,915
we'd be working together.

153
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:03,886
Yeah.

154
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,748
I mean, they're talking
to some people.

155
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:08,792
Who?

156
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:11,490
I don't know,
like, Amanda Peet.

157
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:16,346
Christ.

158
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:19,725
Okay, let--
I'll talk to Teddy.

159
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,948
We'll see if it's worth pursuing,
you know?

160
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:24,657
Yeah, thanks a lot,
Mr. Hollywood.

161
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:33,709
Look, I know you're...what?

162
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,177
Rattled, but,

163
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:38,766
honey, you can't publish our magazine
with a triple-X on it.

164
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,211
Our Wal-Mart rep
actually cried.

165
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,346
They won't stock the issue.

166
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:47,056
- That's 30% right off the top.
- We'll make it up at the newsstand.

167
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,199
Look, I know
what you're doing.

168
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,258
The sex issue, it's a great idea,
I'm just saying lose the triple-X.

169
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:57,325
Brent Barrow, eroding your
freedom of speech one "X" at a time.

170
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,537
- Spiller--
- Mr. Barrow?

171
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:00,936
There's someone waiting
in your office.

172
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,417
Hi.

173
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,268
- How can I help you?
- Nancy said that--

174
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:15,119
I am so disappointed.

175
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:18,191
I was expecting
to see monsters.

176
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:21,076
Some kind of,
you know, demon

177
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:22,823
with fangs and claws.

178
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,640
Can you please just
tell me why you're--

179
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,630
But I walk in here
and I see two regular people

180
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:29,119
I'd expect to meet
in any regular setting.

181
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,606
- Not the devil.
- Oh, not the--

182
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:34,447
- Well, we're certainly not the--
- At least not to look at.

183
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,386
But I guess that makes it easier,
doesn't it?

184
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:37,769
I don't like
where this is going.

185
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,363
Maybe you should
have thought of that

186
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,422
before you took advantage
of my daughter...

187
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:45,863
my virginal,
17-year-old daughter.

188
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:53,709
17.

189
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:55,217
Oh, Daddy.

190
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,076
Um, maybe I should get
someone from legal in here.

191
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:00,850
That's not necessary|right now.
You see,

192
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:02,860
I just wanted to look you two

193
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:04,240
right in the eyes.

194
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:05,911
And that's it?

195
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,542
Well, you tell me.

196
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,464
Is her virginity restored?

197
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,765
Is her innocence intact?

198
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,584
Has she been un-raped?

199
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:17,033
- What ?
- Woaw,w ait a minute.

200
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,181
- Excuse me, she practically raped us.
- Willa.

201
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,249
Thank you.

202
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:23,805
As I was saying,
as the father of a major

203
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:26,762
international superstar,
I have been in
legal quandaries

204
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:28,452
before
pertaining to Rebecca.

205
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:30,501
- Rebecca?
- Banheart.

206
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:34,202
Banheart. You're

207
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,619
- Jimmy Ray Banheart.
- That's right.

208
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:39,788
Rebecca Banheart

209
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,679
is a major brand

210
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,421
with the pop career,
with the reality show,

211
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,993
with the specials and the clothing,
and I have the same plans for Dawni.

212
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,980
Or at least I did.

213
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:52,904
Why would they vanish
just because--

214
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:55,647
Because you
and your friend used her

215
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:57,712
and you threw her away.
You think that's funny?

216
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:58,849
Look at her!

217
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,200
After this thing hits,

218
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,679
she will never be perceived

219
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:03,811
as anything other than a little slut.

220
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:06,166
- Daddy!
- I'm sorry, baby, but that's the facts.

221
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,853
How can we rectify this?

222
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:11,893
It'll be rectified
when you are out on the street

223
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:14,739
begging for change instead of
sitting here in the publisher's office.

224
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,838
If this whole thing never reached the
legal system, you and I could come to

225
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:20,205
some kind of understanding.

226
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,004
An understanding?

227
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:24,602
What are you trying to do?

228
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,997
Are you trying to bribe me
from putting your ass in prison?

229
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:29,581
You're trying to buy me?

230
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:32,444
Do you have any idea
how much money I make

231
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:34,290
managing Rebecca Banheart?

232
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,922
It's not about money.

233
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:37,894
This is about justice.

234
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,835
I didn't mean to suggest--

235
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:43,729
I just--You know, I thought
what we do here might...

236
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:47,473
help Dawni.

237
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:51,529
Oh. You're going to
give her a cover and it's all good.

238
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:59,262
- Lucy.
- What's wrong?

239
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,126
Oh.
Uh, shoot.

240
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,115
She wants to...

241
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:08,419
- Tell me.
- to touch me.

242
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,281
What?

243
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,723
She wants to touch me.
She wants to, um...

244
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,162
I don't know if I can.

245
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,196
Who, Don?

246
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,576
Abby.

247
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,550
All right.

248
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:40,914
Do you remember Lynette?

249
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:43,574
Your stepmother.
I've met her.

250
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:46,239
She was closer to my age
than my dad's.

251
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:54,069
Oh Don.

252
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:58,012
She was an actress. She was in Boom
Boom, All the Tigers, Full Catastrophe.

253
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:00,312
I think I made her feel younger.

254
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:04,728
I was 14.
She called me "little lover."

255
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,445
Sometimes I liked it.

256
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:18,220
Don, you know none of that is
your fault, right?

257
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:22,077
No.

258
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,018
No, Lucy, I don't.

259
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,227
No, Quinn, no.

260
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,439
I don't think you understand
the reality of the situation.

261
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,758
If Teddy Chick doesn't want to hire
the star of the number one sitcom, I--

262
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,840
Well, what if Holt
threatened to walk?

263
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:44,523
You have your head
so far up his ass.

264
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:50,253
No.
No, I'm sorry.

265
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:52,756
I know. Please?

266
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:57,893
No, I am not going
to be the new host of Deal Or No Deal.

267
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:04,036
Nothing.

268
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:05,579
You know what?
I have to go.

269
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:07,284
You know what?
Let's just book it.

270
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,178
Okay.
Nothing.

271
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:11,712
My favorite co-star.

272
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:13,235
Hi, Johnny.

273
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,222
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hey, Jules.

274
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:17,600
- What up?
- Nothing.

275
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:21,234
They're trying to talk me into being
the female lead in Hard Charger, but

276
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,331
I don't know.

277
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:24,121
I thought that was Amanda Peet.

278
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:28,310
What?

279
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,003
That's just a funny
freakin' name.
Amanda Peet.

280
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:34,584
Amanda Pe-et!

281
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,493
You guys are high.

282
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,350
It helps the work.

283
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:40,837
- Are you working?
- Yeah.

284
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:43,716
We're writing a production draft
to our movie.

285
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:46,626
You're doing
a Jeff Stagliano film?

286
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:48,676
Got to keep 'em guessing.

287
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:51,496
These scenes are going
to make theBrown Bunny look likeBarney.

288
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:55,470
We're talking full-frontal
hardcore penetration, non-linear,

289
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:58,104
- radical polemic time.
- Boom.

290
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,139
Themes of death
and loss and grief.

291
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:03,986
Tons of pussy.

292
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:06,526
That sounds great.

293
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,622
Gonna be awesome.

294
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:11,548
Oh, you--
We've never worked together, Jeff?

295
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:16,059
No. That's true.
You've always been Julia Mallory,

296
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,107
America's sweetheart.

297
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,141
Yeah, well,
I'm not really that anymore, am I?

298
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,325
So what's
the girl's part like?

299
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,999
Oh, my God.

300
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:28,380
That would be...holy shit.

301
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:31,420
But, dude...

302
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,580
Right.

303
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,952
She's got to be super young
for the shock value.

304
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:42,267
And then she can't be a star.

305
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,020
You can't see it coming.

306
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,928
And when the thing happens...

307
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,970
Yeah, well, anyway,
good luck with that.

308
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,130
Hey, I'm gonna

309
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:53,759
try to find an actress
to take our order.

310
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:57,753
Bye.

311
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:01,539
You look hot, Jules.

312
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:07,437
You raped me,

313
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:08,944
you piece of shit.

314
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,885
- I what?
- You raped me.

315
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:15,609
Is it rape when you beg me
to do you harder?

316
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,593
So, wait,
you two have been dating,

317
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,861
screwing for some time now.

318
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,025
Yes.

319
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:30,436
And you took home a 17-year-old girl
and had sex with her.

320
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:32,673
Well, yes,
but she didn't
really look--

321
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:36,980
And she just happens
to be Rebecca Banheart's little sister,

322
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:40,000
meaning her father is that
nutjob Ray Jimmy Banheart.

323
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,725
What does he want?

324
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:43,338
He wants me in jail.

325
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,933
But he'll settle
for three covers.

326
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:47,920
Three? Jesus!

327
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:51,581
I've always been mystified by the whole
Rebecca Banheart phenomenon.

328
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,870
What was the hook
of the show? How stupid she is?

329
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:55,372
Stupid is the new black.

330
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:57,484
I think it was the tomato
that clinched it.

331
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,637
Well, somebody offered
her a beefsteak tomato

332
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,894
and she declined on account
of being a vegetarian.

333
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:06,571
And you were captivated
by her underage sister.

334
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,986
Wow. There are just
so many levels here.

335
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:12,020
Look, I know you're loving
the torture, Spiller,

336
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,928
but, really, our sex lives are
of no business

337
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,071
- Brent?
- Yeah?

338
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:16,364
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

339
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:19,554
Okay I have nothing on him in the vault,
so we have to go out, we have to get

340
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,681
every piece of imaginable dirt
on Jimmy Ray Banheart.

341
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:25,685
And cover
the little songbirds while you're at it.

342
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:28,193
I don't care how
seemingly banal it is, just get it.

343
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:29,945
Get medical,
dental, whatever.

344
00:19:30,008 --> 00:19:31,510
Okay.
I'm on my way.

345
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:34,999
If this goes public, it could do some
real damage to this magazine.

346
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,522
This is your problem--
both of you.

347
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:38,946
You need to fix it.

348
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:42,623
- Oh, and Brent?
- Yeah?

349
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,438
We are so doing
the sex issue:

350
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:47,977
polybag, the triple-X.

351
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,639
Now jog in place.

352
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,763
Are you sure
you're listening to my heart?

353
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:01,391
Oh, that's cold and hard.

354
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:07,195
Now open wide
and say, "Ahh."

355
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:11,298
Cut. Great, guys. Take five.
We'll come back for the oral.

356
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:12,988
Mr. Hergopian.

357
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,460
No, I'm Johnson Long.

358
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:19,591
Your real name's Tim Hergopian.
Born in Moose Jaw Saskatchewan, 1974.

359
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:22,192
Could you not announce
my citizenship status, huh?

360
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,616
- Sorry.
- What's up?

361
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,899
Where's Kitty Ryder? She's supposed
to be starring opposite you.

362
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,649
I don't know. Before this film
she never missed a day of work.

363
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:31,276
Any idea where she is?

364
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,739
- Why?
- My boss wants to do a story about her.

365
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:38,071
Nah. Good luck
finding her.

366
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,278
There's, like, 50 P. A. s driving all
over town looking for her right now.

367
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,621
Lucy wants a story.

368
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:50,787
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
I gotta chub up for the oral.

369
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:52,070
Okay.

370
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,648
I hurt my back,

371
00:20:59,101 --> 00:21:00,854
and when I woke up
it was like

372
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:03,842
the world
was over me.

373
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:06,945
I'm not over you.

374
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,698
Oh, God,
I'm so not over you.

375
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:13,614
Every time the Goddamn
doorbell rings I think it might be you.

376
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,103
Sorry.

377
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:19,857
I just disappeared.

378
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:24,323
No. You got clean.
That's huge.

379
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:25,825
I hate it.

380
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:28,015
I can't handle real.

381
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:30,737
I think you can.

382
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:37,079
Make love to me straight.

383
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:46,677
Don't get high,

384
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:48,194
but don't go.

385
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:50,823
Make love with me.

386
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,810
I need it.

387
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:54,397
And then us.

388
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:58,152
Look, this doesn't
happen to me,

389
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:01,833
but I love you.
I'm in love with you, Julia.

390
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,055
- Fix me.
- No.

391
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,814
Please.
Please, fix me.

392
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:08,378
Please.
I need the soft.

393
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:10,318
Then I'll make
you come so good.

394
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:13,311
It's not--
You're not hearing me.

395
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,738
I'm hearing you. I'm just choosing
to ignore that part because

396
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:20,805
I only love you
when I'm high.

397
00:22:22,244 --> 00:22:24,591
I don't love you.
I love Holt.

398
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:28,158
Fix me.

399
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:31,166
- You're a Goddamn user.
- Please!

400
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:34,264
You use me, use my dope, then go back
and use your boyfriend.

401
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,699
You are gonna die using--
the people, the dope.

402
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:47,630
Just sell me
a Goddamn bag of tar.

403
00:22:53,627 --> 00:22:54,848
It's on me. Get out.

404
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:10,403
<i>- Hey, Curtis. Willa.</i>
- Hey, Will.

405
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:15,104
<i>- I need a favor.</i>
- I can't. I'm stepping into a meeting.

406
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:17,647
<i>No, you're not.
Look across the street.</i>

407
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:21,669
<i>Busted.</i>

408
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,127
You know, this whole tabloid
stalker-razzi thing?

409
00:23:26,224 --> 00:23:27,986
It's getting a little creepy.

410
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:30,609
- I actually do have drinks.
- Just give me two minutes.

411
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:34,105
All right. What's up?
One of our artists bangin' a tranny?

412
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:36,516
Probably, but that's not why I'm here.

413
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,880
I need anything on the
Banhearts, especially the father.

414
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:43,009
He was a faith healer
in Alabama or something.

415
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,975
One day God spoke to him and
said that Rebecca's double-

416
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:48,498
D's were meant to be bouncing
around in bad music videos.

417
00:23:48,614 --> 00:23:50,400
That was it. He started
managing them both,

418
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:53,347
and in about a year Rebecca
was on the cover of magazines,

419
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:57,231
"Stick It To Ya" was on the charts,
the reality show was in the works.

420
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:58,502
What about the mother?

421
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,737
They got divorced years ago.

422
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:03,307
I think she still gets a piece
of the royalties or something.

423
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,057
Sure hope I can score today.

424
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:15,371
<i>Oh, you'll score.
It's a sure thing.</i>

425
00:24:15,506 --> 00:24:22,511
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh! Yeah.</i>

426
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:34,726
- Kenny?
<i>- Don?</i>

427
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:36,305
<i>Don, is that you?</i>

428
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,809
It's me, Kenny.
Can you hear me?

429
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:40,903
<i>Don, where am I?</i>

430
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:43,133
<i>I don't like it.
Please help me.</i>

431
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:46,851
- I'm sorry, Kenny.
<i>- Don, it's a--</i>

432
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:49,089
<i>Come back, lover.</i>

433
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:50,626
<i>Lynette?</i>

434
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,613
<i>Please, Don. I don't feel safe.</i>

435
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,215
<i>Don? Donnie? Is that you?</i>

436
00:24:58,024 --> 00:25:00,232
<i>Little Lover.</i>

437
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:10,432
<i>Come here, Donnie.
I've missed you so much.</i>

438
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,359
<i>Miss me?</i>

439
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,791
<i>Don?</i>

440
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:22,818
<i>I brought cookies from work.</i>

441
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,132
<i>Finikia, the little Greek ones.</i>

442
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:34,083
Uh, Abby, I'm really glad it's you.

443
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,759
I'm glad you're glad.

444
00:25:36,658 --> 00:25:40,723
- Can I come in?
- Yeah. Okay.

445
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,732
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

446
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,919
- Whatcha you doing?
- Watching porn. It's for work.

447
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:48,479
Oh, really?

448
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:52,077
- Kitty Ryder, she's the queen of porn.
<i>- You are a big boy.</i>

449
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:54,870
She decided to quit.
Now I have to take her picture.

450
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,079
Why are you watching all of her movies?

451
00:25:57,175 --> 00:26:00,106
- I think she's beautiful.
- Oh, me too.

452
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:02,877
<i>Extra point! Unh!</i>

453
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:07,904
- Can I watch with you?
- Sure.

454
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:11,465
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

455
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,154
Can I have a cookie?

456
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,287
I'm a decent astrologer.
I'd like to do your chart.

457
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,657
- When's your birthday?
- Tomorrow.

458
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,172
Tomorrow?

459
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:58,864
Do you have plans?

460
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:03,388
I was gonna get a cake and let little
Tristan lick some of the frosting off.

461
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,762
- Do you like cake?
- I like cake.

462
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,559
I like it with whipped
cream frosting on

463
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,311
and I like it
with berries on.

464
00:27:15,578 --> 00:27:19,872
One time, Lucy got a cake
from Sweet Lady Jane.

465
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,456
Oh, I wanted to stick
my face into that.

466
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:26,245
I wanted the whole thing to myself.

467
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:28,910
Let me bring you a cake, Don.

468
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:32,652
'Kay.

469
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:43,133
<i>Come on!</i>

470
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,329
It's the door.

471
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:03,486
Don, I need to talk to you.

472
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,545
- Oh, God.
- Hello, Lucy.

473
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:08,887
Hello, Abby.

474
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:12,277
- I guess you're still real.
- I am, thank you. And you?

475
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:14,637
I need to talk to Don for a minute.

476
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:16,459
I'll be in the kitchen.

477
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:21,815
Don, have you been following me?

478
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:25,423
- Have you been taking my picture?
- No. Was I supposed to?

479
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:28,519
No. Did you take this picture?

480
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:31,909
No, Lucy, I would never
take this picture.

481
00:28:32,048 --> 00:28:34,699
The composition is bad,
the light's terrible,

482
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:38,444
and it's pixilated, which means
it's digital, and I don't like digital.

483
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:42,027
Mm, it looks like it's been taken by
a security camera, a cheap one.

484
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:45,253
Probably a nanny camera,
something from the spy store.

485
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:48,463
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

486
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:54,488
- Do you understand what this is?
- Yeah. Do you like him?

487
00:28:58,158 --> 00:29:02,165
Somebody is taking your picture and
you didn't know they were taking it.

488
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:05,230
Yes. Someone is trying to do
something to scare me.

489
00:29:05,306 --> 00:29:06,808
They're doing what we do.

490
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:15,633
Holt. Look at me.

491
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:21,116
Look, I'm sorry it didn't
work out with Hard Charger.

492
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,521
I don't give a shit
about Hard Charger.

493
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:26,487
I just went to Garbo's
and I scored some dope.

494
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:29,427
- Oh, for Christ's sake, Julia!
- Look, there it is.

495
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,005
- Come on. What are you doing?
- That's the purest shit

496
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:35,109
she's ever given me.
And that's enough to put me in a coma.

497
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:36,698
Wait, so you're seeing her again?

498
00:29:36,753 --> 00:29:40,484
No. I'm not seeing her.
And I haven't touched the dope.

499
00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:44,851
I'm seeing you.
I'm seeing the man I love

500
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:48,390
in front of me, disappearing
into his stardom...

501
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,585
just the way I did. And maybe you
have to go through with it.

502
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:54,947
It doesn't matter. It's not about that.
It's about whether the two of us

503
00:29:55,056 --> 00:29:56,300
are gonna make it.

504
00:29:57,266 --> 00:30:00,906
Separately, together...

505
00:30:02,313 --> 00:30:04,065
- Julia--
- Listen, listen.

506
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:09,453
In my program,
they talk about doing

507
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,793
a searching and fearless
moral inventory, and,

508
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:16,815
oh, my God,
I'd been blowing it off

509
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:18,681
because do I not want to look

510
00:30:18,722 --> 00:30:21,319
at all the ways that
I have wronged people,

511
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:23,396
and I've sold
my own self short.

512
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,361
Everywhere I look,

513
00:30:25,496 --> 00:30:28,713
I see someone I've hurt
or someone who's hurt me,

514
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,497
and I know I've hurt you.

515
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:35,005
I know I have. I know you
were honest with me

516
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,587
about the accident,

517
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:41,626
and I just want to be honest with you
and see if there is some ground zero

518
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,211
in this relationship.

519
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:48,916
I slept with Johnny Gage.

520
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,087
And you saw it.

521
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:55,175
And my God, Holt, I can't--

522
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:58,160
I can't tell you how sick
I've been about it,

523
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:02,874
how afraid I've been that you'd leave
if I brought it up or if it got out,

524
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,719
what that would do to us.

525
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:09,082
I kept thinking if I just get high
enough, maybe it would go away,

526
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,026
and it-- it doesn't
matter right now.

527
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:13,580
I was roofied or drugged
with something.

528
00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:19,047
But for all I know, I was
just drunk and high.

529
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:20,973
And I slept with him.

530
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:24,895
Because we were working together,
and isn't that just what we do?

531
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,786
We pretend until it
crosses over, and suddenly,

532
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,706
we've wrecked our whole lives.

533
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:34,064
I mean, we walk around,
playing make-believe,

534
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:38,103
never really thinking about what's
gonna happen when we go off-book.

535
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:42,057
I'm sorry, Holt.

536
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:46,529
I am just so sorry.

537
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,064
Listen to me.

538
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:08,308
- I'm gonna get the sex tape back.
- Okay.

539
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:13,914
And then we're gonna
start from scratch.

540
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,586
All right?

541
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:17,839
Brand new. Right there.

542
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:29,018
Madame Editor...

543
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:34,476
The only thing more annoying than
you being your authentic self,

544
00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:36,372
is you kissing my ass.

545
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:38,409
What a kind thought.

546
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:42,440
I'm worried that you're gonna turn this
Jimmy Ray Banheart character down flat.

547
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:45,815
You really think that we should tank
the magazine,and agree to do three

548
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:48,358
covers on an underage slut
who can't sing.

549
00:32:48,494 --> 00:32:51,684
If her father can take
us down, yes. Yeah.

550
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:53,574
You mean if the father
can take you down.

551
00:32:53,647 --> 00:32:56,019
If you didn't think this scandal could
seriously damage the magazine,

552
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,734
you wouldn't be dealing
with him at all.

553
00:32:57,735 --> 00:32:59,206
I'm not out of moves.

554
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:02,478
And so what. If he goes public,
I'll just, you know...

555
00:33:02,574 --> 00:33:04,597
dump it on you,
and fire your ass.

556
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:09,180
Are you really gonna force me to be the
one to remind you that, a few weeks ago,

557
00:33:09,262 --> 00:33:11,914
I put myself between you
and an armed gunman?

558
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,802
I will make you a promise.

559
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:18,682
This will be the last time that your
dick takes up this much of my time.

560
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:24,028
<i>Don! Are you ready?</i>

561
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:26,270
Hold on! Just one second.

562
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,372
Here you go, buddy.

563
00:33:34,694 --> 00:33:35,792
Okay.

564
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:38,030
Now close your eyes.

565
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,256
Okay.

566
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:04,265
Surprise!

567
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,147
Wow, you really did bring cake!

568
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,088
I know the baker.

569
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:17,132
I thought, um, the way you
described your love of cake,

570
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:18,990
I thought...maybe...

571
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,054
I don't know.

572
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:51,190
He seems creepy to me, but he's got
no record. He's got no D. U. I.'s,

573
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,542
no big tax investigations,

574
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:54,944
he never went all the way
with his high school sweetheart,

575
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:56,487
and he's a damn good manager.

576
00:34:56,578 --> 00:34:58,915
He got Rebecca signed,
and got her magazine covers,

577
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:00,817
before she even had a publicist.

578
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:03,531
- Hollywood Digest.
- Yeah. Three covers.

579
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,722
- Oh, God...
- Holy shit!

580
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:10,650
He pimped Rebecca out, too.

581
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,462
Under which editor?

582
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:14,916
Ray Patterson.

583
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,077
Ray Patterson.

584
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:22,766
You wanna ask my forgiveness
for the way you treated me?

585
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:24,307
I thought I treated you well.

586
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:27,715
You climbed over my smoldering
corpse to get a promotion.

587
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:30,042
Don't be a baby.

588
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:34,316
- You told me you had feelings for me.
- I didn't say which feelings.

589
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:41,392
So. Three covers on Rebecca Banheart,
without even an album to tie them to.

590
00:35:41,457 --> 00:35:44,300
You know how it is, Lucy.
Sometimes, you invent a cover girl.

591
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:45,611
Look at your prom girl murder.

592
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,063
Or there's always the

593
00:35:47,118 --> 00:35:50,810
"Blackmail the horny editor, "after
he bangs your underage daughter" trick.

594
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:53,323
I think we're done here, Lucy.
As if we weren't already.

595
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:55,701
- I have enough to run the story.
- Then run it.

596
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:59,117
I'll deny it. They'll deny it.
It's a double-amputee. No legs.

597
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:01,522
I know you don't trust me,
Ray. I don't blame you.

598
00:36:02,164 --> 00:36:05,144
Look, I'd walk over you
again, if I had the choice.

599
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:07,597
But they're doing
the same thing to us.

600
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:13,091
I'm not asking you to confirm.
I just...want you to look at me.

601
00:36:16,796 --> 00:36:18,272
Just tell me I'm wrong.

602
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:24,395
I owe you one.

603
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:26,008
Yeah, right.

604
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,365
Hello.

605
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:52,355
Oh, yes! Yes. Thank you.

606
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:56,458
Yeah, I really appreciate it, Tom.
You can fax it. Thank you.

607
00:36:58,534 --> 00:36:59,778
Kitty Ryder.

608
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:05,176
Did ya get what you need?

609
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:08,646
Yup.

610
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:16,587
Um...excuse me, Kitty. Hi.

611
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:19,400
My real name's Megan.

612
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:22,503
I was wondering who it would be.

613
00:37:23,198 --> 00:37:26,592
My name is Willa McPherson.
I'm writing a story for a magazine.

614
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:29,039
Do you mind if
I talk to you for a sec?

615
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:30,159
Of course.

616
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:33,373
Okay. Um, can my friend
take some photos?

617
00:37:34,107 --> 00:37:35,149
Sure.

618
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,725
Can I ask you why
you're leaving?

619
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:40,201
I mean, is it..

620
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:43,372
is it the objectification,
or the humiliation?

621
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,148
Oh, gosh. You're all
in knots, aren't you?

622
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:50,389
Yes. I am.

623
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,159
I didn't leave because it was so bad.

624
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:57,965
I left because it was so good.

625
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:00,671
Too good. Too much.

626
00:38:01,368 --> 00:38:03,336
That's all that was wrong with it.

627
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,668
How can you let go of desire, when...

628
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:09,743
every desire you've ever had
is being met on an hourly basis?

629
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:15,291
I was attached to the sex
and the money.

630
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,595
So I was attached to the grief
I felt, at the end of the day,

631
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,233
when it wasn't enough.

632
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,635
If you want nothing,

633
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:29,490
you fear nothing.

634
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:32,688
You need nothing.

635
00:38:38,662 --> 00:38:42,206
- Jimmy Ray. Deena.
- Dawni.

636
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:43,805
Oh, right.

637
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:46,849
But soon, you're hoping the
whole world will know your name,

638
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,951
after the big covers and all.
Isn't that right?

639
00:38:49,048 --> 00:38:51,248
Oh, I was thinkin' more about the name

640
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,350
Lucy Spiller bein' synonymous
with statutory rape.

641
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:59,218
Oh, I don't love being blackmailed
by some snake-oil salesman

642
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:03,165
who pimps out both his underage girls
to jump-start their careers.

643
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:05,235
Hey, Rebecca's got
nothing to do with this.

644
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,320
Really.

645
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:08,903
'Cause I think
it would make a great cover.

646
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:13,776
Yeah. "Sleazy Father Blackmails
to Launch "Talentless Star to Power."

647
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:17,359
"100 Million Dollar Industry
"Built On Shameless Lie."

648
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:19,256
The numbers would be so big.

649
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:27,975
You wanna play?

650
00:39:28,226 --> 00:39:29,757
Cool. We'll play.

651
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:33,846
Let's see what this little
story does to DirtNow.

652
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:39,727
Oh, and, uh, CNN?

653
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:43,029
They're gonna love Brent's
perp walk through the lobby.

654
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:44,563
I can play chicken, too.

655
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:47,351
Uh, sweetie?

656
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:50,194
You forgot your birth certificate.

657
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:52,722
What?

658
00:39:53,155 --> 00:39:54,303
Mommy faxed it over.

659
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:56,539
I think she might have been
under the impression that

660
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:58,687
I need it, to send her
a royalty check.

661
00:39:58,939 --> 00:39:59,953
My bad.

662
00:40:00,054 --> 00:40:03,632
Would you mind if I...
take a look?

663
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:09,400
Bitch is 19.

664
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:13,063
Yeah, you're still a pervert.
You're just not a rapist.

665
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:16,487
And I'm still tempted
to do that other cover.

666
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:19,924
What you want?

667
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:23,924
As long as I have first look
at anything Rebecca Banheart does,

668
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:26,264
and I mean anything...

669
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,668
- You see that?
- Oh...

670
00:40:36,723 --> 00:40:39,227
- She digs me.
- Don't even.

671
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,458
Who let you in?

672
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,826
I'm a big movie star, remember?

673
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,540
That's right.

674
00:41:11,476 --> 00:41:13,192
I want the sex tape back.

675
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:17,683
Close the door.

676
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:27,155
Wait in the vault. I'll be
done in just a minute.

677
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:06,767
Here's the original tape.

678
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,803
And the one copy.

679
00:42:10,222 --> 00:42:11,304
That's it.

680
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:13,778
Oh, it's that easy, huh?

681
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:16,831
It's that easy.

682
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,840
Is this really the tape?

683
00:42:23,797 --> 00:42:25,615
You want me to prove it to you?

684
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:25,877
Paid in full.
