00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:07,173
<i>My name's Don Konkey.
I take pictures.</i>

2
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,613
<i>My best friend, Lucy Spiller,
runs these two magazines.</i>

3
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,849
I want those photos
on my desk tonight.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,483
<i>She works really hard.</i>

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,019
If anything breaks,
I'm reachable.

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,388
Guys, have fun.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:26,226
<i>This is Holt McLaren.
He's a good actor, but he's not hot. </i>

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,127
Screw you.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,797
<i>His girlfriend is Julia Mallory. </i>

10
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,665
<i>She's a big star.</i>

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,834
You just love me.

12
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,203
<i>She's hot.</i>

13
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,407
I'm Lucy Spiller, Now magazine.
I'm a big fan.

14
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,075
Right.

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,312
<i>Lucy got Holt to give her dirt
on this super star Kira Klay.</i>

16
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,517
<i>Kira OD'd.</i>

17
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,320
<i>When Holt found out,
he crashed his car.</i>

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,725
<i>But now, he's hot.</i>

19
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:03,763
<i>Wait!</i>

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,301
<i>This is hard for me, because I have
a tenuous grasp on what's real.</i>

21
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,637
<i>Donny! Donny! Donny!</i>

22
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,305
I'm okay.

23
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,175
<i>I'm a functional
schizophrenic.</i>

24
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,410
<i>Lucy helps me.</i>

25
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,882
<i>And I help her.</i>

26
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,219
<i>Don?</i>

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,721
Don,
listen to me.

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,360
Don.

29
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,098
Are you all right?

30
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,201
Yes, Lucy.

31
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,603
Are you sure?

32
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,839
Do you want me
to call Dr. Shalba?

33
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,007
- No, I was just thinking.
- Okay.

34
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,345
I need a shot of Kira Klay
for the Drrt cover.

35
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,680
She's dead.

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,615
I know, Don.

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,984
I need you
inside the funeral.

38
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,820
I'm gonna put you
in a suit.

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,422
A nice suit.

40
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,124
Okay.

41
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,461
You're gonna blend in
in a suit.

42
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,330
Now, we have a guy
on the inside.

43
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,799
He's got a shaved head
and a pin-striped suit.

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,136
His name is Baby.
You hand him your invite.

45
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,306
- Tell him you're Kira's cousin Dan.
- ...I'm Kira's cousin Dan.

46
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,636
What?

47
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,805
- What?
- Something wrong?

48
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,642
No. No, I'm good.

49
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,528
How are you feelin'?
You wanna get outta here?

50
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,448
No, no, I don't.
I...I feel like we should stay.

51
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,517
I just feel like--

52
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,620
No, it's gonna be okay.

53
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,928
I still don't remember anything
about the accident.

54
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,497
Car came out
of nowhere, huh?

55
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,936
It's a blur.
I just miss her.

56
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,305
I know. I know.
Me, too.

57
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,308
I feel like everybody's
staring at me.

58
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,881
Here.

59
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,852
You saved my life
and you nursed me back to health.

60
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,389
Come on.

61
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:50,530
I was just...
I was just... man.

62
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,498
I was gonna
be a daddy.

63
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,832
And she was
into it, man.

64
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,635
I mean, she was
totally feelin' it.

65
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,971
Yeah.
She was awesome.

66
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,507
When she first moved here,
we hooked up at a party.

67
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,710
Pheww. Awesome.

68
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,717
- Julia looks wrecked, dude.
- Well, she almost died.

69
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:15,288
Tragic times, bro.
I gotta take a piss.

70
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,221
<i>Just get the shot of Kira.</i>

71
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,326
<i>I know you can do it.
I know you can.</i>

<b>Dirt - Season 01
Episode 02 - "Blogan"</b>

76
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,000
We're in a war here.

77
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,071
It may be a war of the absurd,
but it's a war just the same.

78
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,505
First, there was Blaire Marshall,

79
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,915
princess of pop, without
a hit in over a year.

80
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,377
Then there was Logan Hicks,

81
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:45,610
struggling after the breakup

82
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,613
of his boy band Straight Up Lovin'.

83
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,718
But when Blaire met Logan,
there was a media frenzy:

84
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,086
"Blogan."

85
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,380
- And now...
- Hey, sugar tits...

86
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,257
is that bloat or a blump?

87
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,259
Blump.

88
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,428
No couple has ever been so controlling

89
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,598
about their pregnancy and baby pictures.

90
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,998
Clear a path, grease ball.

91
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,367
Hey, tough guy... why don't you

92
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,144
hold her hand and
give us a damn picture?

93
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,858
It started eight months ago with
their pregnancy announcement

94
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:16,008
and an unforgettable pap confrontation.

95
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:17,170
Make my day.

96
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:18,616
Or maybe they didn't teach you how

97
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:20,379
to throw a punch in boy band school.

98
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,181
Get outta my face, bitch!

99
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,786
I hope that girlie punch
was worth it to you!

100
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,989
You just bought me
a first-class trip to Bali!

101
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,427
It's the perfect storm
for a cover story.

102
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,431
This baby picture is what
Wal-Mart mommy wants.

103
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,633
And it's gonna be the next cover of Now.

104
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,672
I want some kick-ass
cover lines by lunch.

105
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,235
I don't have time today for pitches.

106
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:46,272
I'm on my way to Dirt. See ya.

107
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,647
Okay. Let's see what we have.

108
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,849
I think we're close with
the Kira Klay cover.

109
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,587
Now, the other magazines will run
a cover pretty much like this one.

110
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,857
But none of them will run one like this.

111
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,594
I had someone on the funeral photos.

112
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,631
What, is this too hardcore

113
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,035
for you Columbia J-school grads?
This isn't Tiger Beat.

114
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,905
All right, what's out there today?

115
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,542
- Um... celebrity fat farms?
- Do you have art?

116
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,169
More than you would ever want.

117
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,712
All right, I'll put it down for five.

118
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:26,946
Two spreads and a single.

119
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,782
Keep the text tight.
The photos should sell the story.

120
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,261
All right, tell makeup
to watch the adjacencies.

121
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:33,453
I don't want Duncan Hines or

122
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,822
Betty Crocker ads opposite the fatties.

123
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,368
I'm so sorry. Gibson Horne.

124
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,358
His car just pulled up.

125
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,159
Your office.

126
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,494
Terry, take over
the meeting.

127
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,195
I want some
great cover tries

128
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,964
and the book on my desk
in five minutes.

129
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,466
Charge it.

130
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,034
Have your ladies
teased the entire week.

131
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,702
Why don't you
have a seat, Brent.

132
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,205
- Hello, Gibson.
- Hey.

133
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,906
Mmm. How're you doin',
sweet pea?

134
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,708
I'm good!

135
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,574
- Are you sleepin'?
- Not so much.

136
00:07:58,575 --> 00:07:59,596
Oh, you are a beauty.

137
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,795
I'm pretty sure you didn't show up
to compliment me.

138
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:03,616
I wish I could
say you were wrong.

139
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,485
Please, have a seat.

140
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:17,530
Lucy... are you familiar
with, uh... Tina Harrod?

141
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,130
The one who disgraced
her magazine

142
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,433
by Photoshopping
the cover?

143
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,167
No, the one who got
her news stand up

144
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,504
over 150% in less
than a year.

145
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,275
She's got some very
interesting ideas about our operation.

146
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,078
Are you talking
about bringing her in under me?

147
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,313
Um... instead of you.

148
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,350
See, Brent's been
bringin' me up to speed

149
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,756
on the numbers, and seems to me

150
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,125
your spending's out of control.

151
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,803
Well, if you're talking
about overhead--

152
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:44,357
Oh, I'm talkin' about overhead.

153
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
Efficiencies.
Sell through.

154
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,162
Bein' snubbed at the last five
ASME Awards.

155
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,531
Screw the ASMEs.

156
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,682
I mean, they're just
a circle jerk for editors

157
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:56,673
to feel good about writing
5,000-word stories on Abu Ghraib.

158
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,939
The Drrt efficiencies
are strong...

159
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,708
and Now
is turning around.

160
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,778
Well, you're gonna make 'em
for less money. Knock off 20%.

161
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,014
- Oh, come on, Gib.
- Lucy,

162
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,250
do not mistake
fondness for weakness.

163
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,834
I will tolerate a lot of things,

164
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,747
but I will not tolerate
someone losing my money.

165
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,291
We'll find a way.

166
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,860
No, you'll find a way.

167
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,496
Or so help me,
I will bury you.

168
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,771
Now, you all have a nice day.

169
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,377
Damn.

170
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,586
I'm tellin' you,
buddy.

171
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,723
She opened her eyes.
She looked at me.

172
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,658
She was beautiful.

173
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,508
No!
No, no!

174
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,245
Oh, she's not
gonna like that, buddy.

175
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,281
She's not gonna
like that at all.

176
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,753
Okay, everybody.
Listen up.

177
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,287
Swag pile.

178
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,157
Between the watches and the phones
and the wrinkle creams

179
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:29,528
and the free spa vacations, there's
about $20,000 worth of swag here.

180
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,397
Now needs help.

181
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,866
Anybody who can come up
with a really great exclusive on Blogan

182
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,236
gets to pick something
from the pile.

183
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,326
<i>Don!</i>

184
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:05,965
Lucy?

185
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,669
Don, I've left you
five messages.

186
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,070
Open the door.

187
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,608
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

188
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,078
- I need to see the Kira Klay shots.
- Mmm. Okay.

189
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,981
- What?
- It's not ready.

190
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,216
- The shots?
- My house.

191
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,318
I don't care
about your house.

192
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,423
I will be sending over
my housekeeper.

193
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,525
Uh, no! E-Everything's
where it's supposed to be!

194
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,527
Okay.

195
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,494
I'm so sorry, Lucy.

196
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,065
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just, it's filthy.

197
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,533
And I didn't
get the shot.

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,534
What!?

199
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,336
Jesus, Don, this is not the goddamn day!
What happened?

200
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,840
I--I--I was usin' the lapel camera,
and then when I got to her,

201
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,944
I switched to the ChapStick cam 'cause
I wanted it to be perfect, and it was.

202
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,114
It was perfect. There was a shaft
of light from outside, and...

203
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,617
she was beautiful,
she was perfect.

204
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,921
And then I... guess
there was a light leak

205
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,824
when I've never had a light leak
in a ChapStick camera.

206
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,626
I want that
cover and set.

207
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,328
Do you know if she's
being cremated or buried?

208
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,831
No, Lucy, please.

209
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,333
- I'm gonna make some calls.
- She's not gonna like that.

210
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,503
- What?
- Nothin'.

211
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,573
Okay, Don.
Now, I really need your help.

212
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,742
We've got one more shot
at this if we're lucky.

213
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,578
Lucy's under a lot of pressure.

214
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,815
Okay, Don, sweetheart...
would you look at me?

215
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,016
Okay?

216
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,787
This is just like when we were
in school, on the paper, remember?

217
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,090
Okay? We were the only ones
who could write and shoot.

218
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,426
It's just like that.

219
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,761
It's just
the two of us.

220
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,232
- Now, we can't fail.
- I won't fail, Lucy. I won't.

221
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,667
Okay.

222
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,359
Mind if I cut in?

223
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,461
Hey!

224
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,997
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!

225
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,732
Call Security and you don't
make it home tonight.

226
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,401
Or else I pull out a Sharpie,
sign a sneaker or some shit,

227
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,538
and they'll load you
in the trunk for me.

228
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,608
It's good to see you.

229
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,479
You look good.

230
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,382
Thought we had something special.

231
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,350
We did. We do.

232
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,854
So special you set me up?

233
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,722
I wouldn't--uhh!

234
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,260
Uhh...

235
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,363
His name's Don.

236
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,071
Unhh!

237
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,975
He lives in east Hollywood.

238
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,477
I have his card.

239
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,449
- Hey, Lucy, I got something.
- What?

240
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,753
Blaire Marshall just made
a seven-figure deal to pose for Playboy.

241
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,055
Two months
after her due date.

242
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,425
Denise Richard's was six.

243
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,860
Two months?

244
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,528
That's impossible.

245
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,198
Uh... excuse me.

246
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,069
Elliott Greene gets to pick something
from the swag pile.

247
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
Swag pile.

248
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,886
Hey... Hey, what's my sweet
little nephew doing tomorrow?

249
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,222
Brent, get outta my chair.

250
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,491
Ohhh...
I did it.

251
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:56,216
Hey, you know somethin'? You should be
kissin' my ass just a little bit more,

252
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:59,164
considering I probably
just saved your job.

253
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,633
Oh, so after you threaten it,
now you're gonna save it?

254
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,204
Oh, gimme a break.
We both know you want to stay here.

255
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,339
Let me see your little masterpiece.

256
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,209
'Course, editorial's
gonna take the biggest hit.

257
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,811
Well, it's already a wasteland.

258
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,048
Look at these bullshit numbers.

259
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,051
What, y-you're just gonna eliminate
the fact-checking department?

260
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:21,099
How much crack are you smoking?

261
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,430
You know what I love about you?

262
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:26,197
Besides, you know... nothing?
It's that can-do attitude.

263
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:28,936
You know what you can do?
You can get your ass outta my office.

264
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:32,431
I count a 23% reduction
in overhead right there.

265
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,599
20% of which is in editorial.

266
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,769
This is like
a cheap power grab.

267
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,105
Excuse me. I have
two magazines to put out.

268
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,374
I love your proposal, by the way.

269
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,244
It's so colorful. Gib is gonna love it.

270
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,981
- Excuse me, Lucy.
- Thank you.

271
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,551
Oh, she's like 23.

272
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,687
She's way too old for you.

273
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,689
No, 23's good.

274
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,067
<i>* In my own world *</i>

275
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,104
<i>* Underneath my clothes *</i>

276
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,108
<i>* And I can't get off *</i>

277
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,479
<i>* It's been a long, long way down *</i>

278
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,416
<i>* I do it every day and I don't know *</i>

279
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:31,156
<i>* If I want to be here anymore *</i>

280
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:38,296
<i>* Oh, it comes and changes *</i>

281
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:42,400
I've told you guys a million times,
leave the packages at the door.

282
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,569
Don't ring.

283
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,304
It's Holt McLaren.

284
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,042
What are you doing here?

285
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,612
Well, you told me if
I ever need anything...

286
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,880
Well, you gave me your address.

287
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,348
You could've called.

288
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,817
Well, I didn't.

289
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,387
So, can I talk to you?
It'll just take a minute.

290
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,221
Mm-hmm.

291
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,592
You look different.

292
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,727
I was almost asleep.

293
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,363
What's up?

294
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,967
I--I need a favor.

295
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,102
A favor?

296
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,438
What kind of favor?

297
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,074
For Julia.

298
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,452
Look, uh, I wanna...
I wanna do somethin nice for her.

299
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,289
'Cause she's wrecked.

300
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,493
She's on these painkillers.
She can't sleep.

301
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,992
She doesn't even rember
what happened with Kira

302
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,439
and with the accident.

303
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,406
Well, I'm sure you
filled her in on everything.

304
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,903
Yeah. 'Course I did.

305
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,240
She lost her best friend.

306
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,710
So you want to do something nice
and make it all better.

307
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,680
Oh, come on, Lucy, don't give me
your patronizin' bullshit.

308
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,652
Look. Please.
I'm askin' you for a favor, like...

309
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,222
a little piece in your magazine
to make her feel better.

310
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,091
Just a little better, for a minute.

311
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,625
Julia is a part of
a whole feeding frenzy.

312
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,563
People only want to hear
"poor Julia" stories.

313
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,865
What, so... so that's it?

314
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,769
It is if you don't stop the "Aw, shucks,
I'm from West Virginia" thing.

315
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,139
I've invested way too much
time and energy in you.

316
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,241
You had this heroic moment.

317
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,443
The whole world sees you differently.
You are a star now.

318
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,679
You have power.

319
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,316
- All right.
- Ohh...

320
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,051
Then demand things.

321
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,888
If you don't start using
your power, you will lose it.

322
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,659
All right, so-- so give Julia story.

323
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,361
Do it.

324
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,632
- Does Julia know Blaire Marshall?
- Yeah.

325
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,336
They were in Hell House together.

326
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,708
I need an extra 500 for the wait.

327
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,311
Mm-hmm. Okay.

328
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,893
And just get the face.

329
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:10,337
I don't want anyone to be
able to see the crematorium.

330
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,698
I'm really sorry,
but I have to take your picture now.

331
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,800
Lucy needs it.

332
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,970
She has to compete
in a very tough market.

333
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,633
She's a good person.
She just has to compete,

334
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:38,343
'n', yeah. I have-- I gotta help her
because I'm the only one she has, and...

335
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,880
Yeah, I can't fail.

336
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,719
I thought you were great
in From Here to America

337
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,321
and Hell House,
and Made You Look,

338
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,923
and An Earthly September.

339
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,825
That one got five stars,

340
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,562
and your performance
was joyously transcendent,

341
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:01,099
according to Elvis Mitchell,
The New York Times.

342
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,238
All right. We gotta move this one.

343
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,240
Okay.

344
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,944
Been nice talkin' to you.

345
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,280
Bye.

346
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,510
Excuse me. Hey.

347
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,448
Um... I couldn't help but overhear
that you're in the child care field?

348
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,816
That's right.

349
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,151
We just lost our
wonderful person this week,

350
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,322
and I am just desperate.

351
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,191
You don't have an agency?

352
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,360
Oh, no, no. Of course we do.
It's just, um...

353
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,729
you know, we have to go through
a hundred interviews

354
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,765
before we can find someone who's...

355
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,566
you know, who's discreet enough.

356
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,570
- Oh?
- Well, my husband's...

357
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,007
he's... very prominent
in the entertainment industry.

358
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,475
Really?

359
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,777
And who's that?

360
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,983
I'm--I'm so sorry.
I... can't tell you. Um...

361
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,620
you know how it is.
With security and everything,

362
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,490
it's crazy.

363
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,895
It can be so, um,
so isolating sometimes.

364
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,765
I wish we could live
a normal life. You know?

365
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,968
Well, of course you do, dear.

366
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,904
Oh, I'm so sorry! I--

367
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,773
I don't even know you.

368
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,941
Have a wipe, darlin'.

369
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,678
Now...

370
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,548
- You were sayin'?
- Well, I just thought...

371
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,451
you might know who...
you know, the most

372
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,088
discreet celebrity baby nurses
might be.

373
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,156
There's just a handful, dear.

374
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,325
I know.

375
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,560
You know, I was just, um...

376
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,230
talking to that wonderful nurse
who Blaire and Logan are using,

377
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,702
and she was telling me that she had
a friend who might be available. But...

378
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,971
you know, I can't reach them
because...

379
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,274
they've gone into hiding.

380
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,377
Blaire and Logan's baby nurse.

381
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,512
You mean Gabriella.

382
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:28,580
Yes!

383
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:32,073
Yes! Yes, yes. That's right.
That's right. Gabriella.

384
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,452
Mm-hmm.

385
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,622
Um... Lucy?

386
00:22:44,027 --> 00:22:47,274
Hey. I got something
on the baby nurse.

387
00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:48,443
Yeah?

388
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:51,009
Um... name,
number, rates,

389
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,569
a little history, hometown,
immigration status.

390
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:56,651
Nice. You can pick something
from the swag pile.

391
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:00,437
Oh... no, thanks.

392
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:02,842
"No, thanks"?

393
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,503
Well... it sounds
kind of stupid,

394
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:08,100
but, um...
I do it for the story.

395
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,899
Here, check this out.

396
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:15,173
What is it?

397
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:19,405
It's a still from the Altman film
where Blaire played a pregnant runaway.

398
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,329
Wow. She really
looks pregnant.

399
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:22,753
She really does.

400
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:24,660
So?

401
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:28,602
So... she's not
having a baby?

402
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:32,057
But she made a deal with People
to take her first baby pictures.

403
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:36,044
- Black market?
- No.

404
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,188
If she's too vain
to carry a baby,

405
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:40,253
she's way too vain not to have
a little Blogan.

406
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:41,964
Surrogate.

407
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,561
Find out where
this pregnancy pad is.

408
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:47,080
And check into all
of our fertility clinic sources.

409
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:48,989
Willa, listen to me.

410
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,214
If this gets out
in any way,

411
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:52,481
they get onto us,

412
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,014
the whole story's over.

413
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:56,784
Whether she's carrying
a baby or not,

414
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:58,237
this girl's
my next cover.

415
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,949
Do you understand?

416
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,630
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

417
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:46,480
Oh. Oh.
I'm--I'm sorry

418
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:47,684
- That's okay.
- Okay.

419
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,874
So, there was a
break-in last fall

420
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,282
at the Universal
wardrobe house.

421
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:55,615
They claimed a couple of pieces
of costume jewelry and a clown suit.

422
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:56,818
And...

423
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,866
three of the pregnancy
prosthetics

424
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:01,150
built for Blaire Marshall
for the Altman film.

425
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,759
Let me guess.
One for each trimester.

426
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,856
- You got it.
- Oh, this is great.

427
00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:08,021
Okay, just keep
following this story.

428
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,077
Don't leak a word,
not even in-house

429
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,253
I want you to create a secret
edit queue and file your stuff there.

430
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:15,423
I want only dummy text

431
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:17,493
and gray space
up on that wall.

432
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:20,539
- You know what really pisses me off?
- What?

433
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,153
I was the first person
to report this pregnancy...

434
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,140
and she played me.

435
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,017
God, I really don't
appreciate that.

436
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,736
- Stick around.
- Okay.

437
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:34,697
Also, Willa, I'm gonna
want you to write

438
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:35,965
some copy
on a fashion piece

439
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,439
that we're doin'
on Julia Mallory.

440
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,470
It's a many-looks retrospective
kind of thing.

441
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:43,873
She's gonna be coming in and sitting
with you and one of our photo editors.

442
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:46,262
I--I thought we were sticking
to the tragedy angle on her.

443
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:48,558
Yeah, well, we're gonna
go a little counter to that...

444
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:49,747
see how that plays.

445
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,638
Okay.

446
00:25:51,862 --> 00:25:52,651
<i>Holt!</i>

447
00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:54,494
Hey, dude.

448
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:55,945
Hey.

449
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:57,647
Look at you, man...

450
00:25:57,648 --> 00:25:59,099
lean and mean.

451
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:00,931
What are you here for,
a meeting?

452
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:01,892
Yeah.

453
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,841
- Which one?
- Angry Inch.

454
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:04,936
Right.

455
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:07,487
- Passed on it.
- 'Course you did.

456
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,177
Your teeth
look really white.

457
00:26:09,178 --> 00:26:10,898
Did you get veneers
or something?

458
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:12,584
No.

459
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:14,164
I gotta go.

460
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:16,308
Yeah, I heard you got
the Fincher movie.

461
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,003
How's it goin'?

462
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:19,260
It's okay, thanks.

463
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,899
Yeah. I was up
for that shit.

464
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:24,365
Thought it fell apart
in the second act.

465
00:26:24,722 --> 00:26:26,300
But when I sat down
with Fincher...

466
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:27,802
I was, like...

467
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,349
"Holt McLaren could be really awesome
for this part,"

468
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,070
so...who knows?

469
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:34,432
- Maybe I got you the part.
- Listen, Johnny.

470
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,433
You didn't get me
the damn part.

471
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,790
In got the part.

472
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:41,183
I got the part
because people want me.

473
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:43,048
I got the part
because people want me.

474
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:45,817
You're the punch line to a half
a dozen jokes in this town.

475
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:49,510
And the only reason no one has told you
what a total blight you are to humanity

476
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:52,447
is because you make
$5 million a movie.

477
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:56,281
Dude!
What is your damage?

478
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:02,388
Oh, yeah... and I made seven mil
for Subliminal Velocity.

479
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,237
Enjoy it while
it lasts, dude.

480
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:05,990
Say hi to Julia
for me, will you?

481
00:27:10,414 --> 00:27:11,949
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Gabriella.

482
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:14,997
I wanted to come here
in person to tell you that

483
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:16,671
I don't want anything
from you.

484
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:18,423
I don't want
to be famous.

485
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:20,752
And I'm not interested
in your magazine.

486
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:22,958
And I don't
betray my clients.

487
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:26,743
Okay. Well, thanks,
anyway, for coming in.

488
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:28,001
Is that it?

489
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,746
Um... yeah. Willa, you want
to walk her out?

490
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:35,609
Oh, do you want
your parking validated?

491
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:37,549
Oh, no. I didn't
park in your--

492
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,144
I mean, certainly,
if you're going

493
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:41,663
to remain loyal when you're
getting paid half the going rate,

494
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:43,274
then there's nothing
I can say.

495
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,867
What do you mean,
half the going rate?

496
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:47,733
The Tom-Kitten
baby nurse?

497
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:49,387
95 an hour.

498
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,828
That's a 12-hour
minimum.

499
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:54,015
24 when they travel,
and, uh,

500
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:56,080
plus the confidentiality
clause, that's, um--

501
00:27:56,081 --> 00:27:58,199
I don't know.
You do the math.

502
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,132
- But they--they--
- Kyle and Deb?

503
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:01,289
80.

504
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,821
And they're nowhere near the
stars that Blaire and Logan are.

505
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,530
They told me this
was the top rate.

506
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:11,639
And yet you remain loyal.
I think that's fantastic.

507
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:13,579
And what if I didn't?

508
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:15,222
Well, um...

509
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,304
I know that you don't want
to be a star.

510
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:21,242
But, um, I also know
that you're from Flor de Mayo

511
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:24,168
and that your mother and sister are
there with other family members.

512
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,139
- How do you know about my--
- I'm a journalist.

513
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:30,115
And I know that you worry about
them and their standard of living.

514
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,611
And if I help you?

515
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:34,552
Well, there's a farm

516
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:37,772
with some acreage and a very
nice house next to your mother

517
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:40,510
that's for sale
for about $200,000, U.S.

518
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,466
I think that
if you help us...

519
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:45,249
that could be
a very realistic goal.

520
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:48,188
Now, the insiders
are reporting that

521
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:51,255
she's going to induce at the
superstar suiteat Cedars.

522
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,002
They're all camped out there, but

523
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:54,981
I--I don't think they're
gonna go to Cedars.

524
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:57,977
No, I think there'll be too many
unanswered questions there...

525
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:00,496
you know, due to the nature
of the pregnancy.

526
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:02,645
Don't you think?

527
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:05,373
I think you are right.

528
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,751
But they don't tell me
the location.

529
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:09,769
When the baby comes,
they will call,

530
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,631
and then
they will send a car.

531
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:14,757
Okay, well, why don't you
let us worry about that?

532
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,244
Allyouneed to do

533
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,184
is take that baby
to the window

534
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:21,077
for a shot
of California sun.

535
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:23,092
You know how the babies
get jaundice.

536
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,287
It's the house...

537
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:31,388
plus 100,000, U.S.

538
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,611
I want half the money upfront,
nonrefundable.

539
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:37,051
And the other half
if you get your picture.

540
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,467
Congratulations
on your new home.

541
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:43,720
Here, I'll walk you out.

542
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:57,834
Hey.

543
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:01,964
- Hey, I can't see the screen.
- Sorry.

544
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:06,410
Babe?

545
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:08,632
Yeah?

546
00:30:09,037 --> 00:30:10,775
I was thinkin'.
We should, um...

547
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:13,353
we should send somethin'
to Blaire and Logan.

548
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:16,936
You know, some kind
of baby gift?

549
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:19,625
I--I know. Totally.

550
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,160
Where they havin'
the baby?

551
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,488
I should get
the address.

552
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:26,678
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

553
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:29,569
Yes!
Level five.

554
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,450
- What?
- The address.

555
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:36,985
Oh, I know,
you have to call

556
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:40,064
her mom 'cause they're
hiding out there until it's time.

557
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,568
Um, it's in my book.
It's under "B.M., mom."

558
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:45,726
Cool.

559
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,571
Hey...

560
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:54,469
- I love you.
- I loveyou.

561
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,189
I love you.

562
00:31:29,229 --> 00:31:31,828
- Well, was that--
- It was great.

563
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:33,846
But... you didn't...

564
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:34,986
No.

565
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:36,332
Nothin'?

566
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:37,881
No, no, no.
I didn't say nothing

567
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:40,024
- Oh.
- No. No.

568
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,542
I just didn't come.

569
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,198
Sorry.

570
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,873
Oh. No, it was nice.

571
00:31:49,063 --> 00:31:50,936
Well... maybe you could give
me some direction.

572
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:52,595
I could draw you a map.

573
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:54,331
It's not gonna happen.

574
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:02,370
Listen, it's not you.

575
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,764
Okay, I just--I have
better luck alone

576
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,883
Oh. So...

577
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:09,874
a vibrator?

578
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:16,820
You know, they say
you can get, like, desensitized.

579
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:21,355
Yeah. Well, maybe I was never
sensitized to begin with.

580
00:32:22,402 --> 00:32:24,403
What about, um...

581
00:32:25,976 --> 00:32:26,515
Did you...

582
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:28,752
Did you come
the last time?

583
00:32:31,178 --> 00:32:33,489
So... what am I doing here?

584
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,758
I had a really
nice time.

585
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:38,198
There's that word
again, "nice."

586
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,996
And "had." So...

587
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:43,749
does that...
that mean it's over?

588
00:32:44,176 --> 00:32:45,749
I do have
a lot of work to do.

589
00:32:46,171 --> 00:32:50,630
Mmm. So... essentially,
I'm a booty call.

590
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:52,222
Well...

591
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:54,084
yeah.

592
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:58,700
Yeah. I don't know why I'm having
such a problem with that.

593
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,668
You know how many times
I've wanted a chick

594
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:04,735
to turn into a sandwich
when I was done?

595
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,642
I'm a rock musician.

596
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,722
Booty call's
are my stock in trade.

597
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:11,178
Well, then, if anybody
understands, then...

598
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:13,196
Right. Right.
I'll just...

599
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:14,492
grab my stuff.

600
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:16,792
Yeah. Right.

601
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:19,632
You know, I make pancakes from scratch.

602
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:20,805
Mmm. Carbs.

603
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,347
Or I could
get out my guitar

604
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:26,368
and play you some Bon Jovi
sounding bullshit ballad...

605
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:28,044
tell you
I wrote it for you.

606
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:30,424
I've got, like, two more
hours of work to do tonight.

607
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:32,222
Wow.

608
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:35,381
You're like a guy.

609
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:36,988
You really are.

610
00:33:40,388 --> 00:33:41,745
See you later.

611
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:56,878
- This is surreal.
- What?

612
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,870
I don't know. It just seems like we do
a lot to avoid these magazines.

613
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:03,658
Yeah, but this'll be good for you.

614
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,829
All right? It's gonna get you
back in the public eye.

615
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:09,311
You're right.

616
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,255
It's still surreal.

617
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:16,620
Hi! Hi. Thank you guys so much for
coming down. I'm Willa McPherson.

618
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:18,755
- Julia Mallory.
- Holt McLaren.

619
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,113
'Course I know who you both are.
You're my favorite Hollywood couple.

620
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,115
Sorry. Um, follow me.

621
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,475
So, our idea is to do a sort of
"many looks of Julia Mallory" piece.

622
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:33,719
We're gonna pull a bunch of really great
red carpet shots and some candids

623
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,210
and, you know, different haircuts
'cause readers love that kind of thing.

624
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:38,999
And, the art department is this way.

625
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,066
Hello.

626
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:42,442
Oh. This is our
editor-in-chief Lucy Spiller.

627
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,033
- Hi.
- How are you?

628
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:45,955
Thank you so much for doing this for me.

629
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:48,998
Oh, no. Thank you for your
willingness to be a part of the story.

630
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:51,688
And you, the hero.

631
00:34:52,622 --> 00:34:55,772
I know. I wouldn't be here to do
this story if it weren't for him.

632
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,228
No, you wouldn't.

633
00:35:00,438 --> 00:35:02,573
Well, we should, uh,
we should probably do this.

634
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:05,162
Right? She's gotta get
home and get some rest.

635
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:07,106
Oh, okay. Bye.

636
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:09,968
I'll introduce you guys
to the photo editor.

637
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:21,359
Come on. Come on.

638
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,756
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

639
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,486
- What're you-- Prince Tyrese!
- Yeah, that's right!

640
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,755
I'm, uh, a big fan.

641
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:34,491
Bullshit! You set me up
with that skank!

642
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:38,094
Those pho-- Those pictures,
those were great.

643
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:41,864
You-- You were in the hot tub and the
chaise lounge and the whipped cream.

644
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:43,960
And then the strap-on
right in your butt--

645
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,023
You wanna talk about that anymore, huh?

646
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:49,325
Why don't you say that shit again
and see what happens!

647
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:50,159
No.

648
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,728
Who you workin' with?

649
00:35:51,861 --> 00:35:54,079
I'm a small businessman.

650
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,642
- Who hired you for those pictures?
- Nobody! Just me.

651
00:35:57,309 --> 00:35:58,736
You lyin' nutbag!

652
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,031
You hold the third-highest
all-time rebound record.

653
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,847
But your free throw percentage
is hurting the team.

654
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:10,024
In the first three games of the season,
you averaged 22 points a game.

655
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:12,382
That went up to 26 points by game four.

656
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:14,498
Then you fouled out.

657
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:17,282
You son of a bitch!

658
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,921
You're bent.

659
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:23,621
Technically, I'm schizophrenic,
but-- I function.

660
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:29,926
So beautiful.

661
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:32,739
- What?
- So beautiful.

662
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,102
He was my buddy here,
but he's gone... Gone.

663
00:36:46,365 --> 00:36:48,236
Crazy little cockroach.

664
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,670
This shit ain't over!

665
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,079
Okay.

666
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,834
<i>There they are!</i>

667
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:20,616
<i>Cedars will be a zoo.</i>

668
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,811
<i>We'll send some shooters there
to throw people off.</i>

669
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:25,995
Now, the competion
is going to be insane.

670
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,139
<i>But that's okay because
we've got the right information.</i>

671
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,804
Our intel says the baby's going
to be born somewhere else.

672
00:37:36,105 --> 00:37:39,307
Blogan! Blogan!

673
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:45,978
Come on, Blaire. Blaire, over here.

674
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:49,085
Blogan! Get him to turn around.
Blaire! Here!

675
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:20,673
<i>They're gonna be using decoys
and imposters to evade us.</i>

676
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:36,212
But we are gonna be in the
right place at the right time.

677
00:38:58,975 --> 00:39:00,654
Come on, that's not the shot.

678
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:21,733
<i>- Yeah, I got it.
- Yes.</i>

679
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:23,643
Yes!

680
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:26,826
I'm counting on you, Danny;
I thought that was obvious.

681
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:29,754
Yeah. Lakeside. Thursday. Love to Katie.

682
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,729
If Tina Harrod can beat that,
he should give her the job.

683
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,873
How's that feel?

684
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:40,959
To be the first tabloid editor
to put a dead star on the cover?

685
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,654
- It feels great.
- Oh, yeah?

686
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:45,162
Great, like... like pornographer great?

687
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:47,419
Well, you call it what you want.

688
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:51,061
Just about every news outlet in
the world has picked up this story.

689
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,238
The media bloggers are going ape-shit,

690
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,090
and you think that cover's
not gonna pop?

691
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,061
I told you to up the draw.

692
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:03,420
And people made a deal for 1.5 million
for the baby Blogan pictures.

693
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:06,430
We scooped 'em for expenses.

694
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:08,822
No doubt about it. You're the queen.

695
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,636
And you were the only one
who nailed the Blogan thing.

696
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,122
God.

697
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,054
God. I mean, too vain
to carry your own baby.

698
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:19,561
And the exclusive with the surrogate.
It's a great touch.

699
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:23,825
So... what are you gonna do
next week, your highness?

700
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:25,885
- Maybe I'll get lucky.
- Oh, yeah?

701
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,810
You know somebody else
who's gonna die?

702
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:29,854
Some other big celebrity
couple who's gonna

703
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:31,379
fake a baby we can steal pictures of?

704
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,054
'Cause those are the only kind of covers

705
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,042
that are gonna keep us
out of debt every week.

706
00:40:36,006 --> 00:40:38,302
Well, thanks for your concern,
but that's my problem.

707
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:41,867
No, it's not. As of tomorrow,
it's Tina Harrod's problem.

708
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,787
Unless you accept my cuts.

709
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,828
Holy shit.

710
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:25,231
Hi. I want you, Terry, and Janice to
meet me in the office in 15 minutes.

711
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:36,883
- They did a nice job, huh?
- Yeah.

712
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:39,484
Looks awesome.

713
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:42,474
You wanna go out?

714
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:44,265
Are you feelin' up to it?

715
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:46,865
- Yeah. Why not?
- All right.

716
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:49,123
I'll get dressed.

717
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:08,138
<b>HOLT MCLAREN IS READY
FOR HIS CLOSE-UP</b>

718
00:42:17,278 --> 00:42:19,960
Oh, this better be good, sweet pea,
'cause what I was dreamin',

719
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:22,063
ooh, is illegal in most states.

720
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:24,957
Let me just say this, Gibson.

721
00:42:25,185 --> 00:42:26,593
Whatever happens tonight...

722
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:28,850
you will never forget this moment.

723
00:42:29,695 --> 00:42:31,779
This is what we both live for.

724
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:36,158
You want to cut your overhead by 20%?

725
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:39,230
How about 50?

726
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:47,108
We combine the magazines--

727
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:48,898
one monster publication.

728
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:52,494
The credibility of Now with
all the lurid fun of Drrt.

729
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:55,328
Well, it's a glossy tabloid.

730
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:57,057
No. It is more than that.

731
00:42:57,058 --> 00:43:00,067
No, this is People magazine with
a healthy dose of "screw you."

732
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:03,753
It's The National Enquirer without
the penis enlargement ads.

733
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:07,470
Wal-Mart mommy will love it,
and so will the rich sorority girls.

734
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:09,457
You know, when
I bought Now magazine,

735
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,264
I thought I paid my way
into legitimacy.

736
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,163
I bought an institution.

737
00:43:14,164 --> 00:43:17,510
Now magazine brought America through
the second half of the 20th century.

738
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,396
It was solid, and it was
dependable, but it is over.

739
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,999
It's culturally irrelevant.

740
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,772
Well, then I'm culturally irrelevant.

741
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,466
No.

742
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:28,171
Not if you change. Not if
you charge the old with the new.

743
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,880
Look at Blaire and Logan.

744
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:33,600
These are two has-beens that became
huge because they joined forces.

745
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:37,533
We have the chance to
shape American culture.

746
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:40,679
Is this the shape we want
for the culture?

747
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:46,382
You're the one who always says,
"Let the market place decide."

748
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:49,053
This is what the marketplace wants.

749
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:50,673
You need this.

750
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:52,754
No. You need this.

751
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,277
If I do this for you...

752
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:00,373
You name it.
I'll do anything.

753
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:03,938
I know this will succeed.
I know it. I can feel it.

754
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:06,451
Brent Barrow know anything about this?

755
00:44:06,452 --> 00:44:07,624
I came straight to you.

756
00:44:08,054 --> 00:44:09,644
Vision is not a part of his job.

757
00:44:09,645 --> 00:44:10,940
He won't be pleased.

758
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:12,175
I don't give a shit.

759
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:14,459
I don't work for him.

760
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:16,494
And God help you if you're wrong.

761
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,377
I won't be.

762
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,603
You see?

763
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,424
Told ya...

764
00:44:41,523 --> 00:44:48,642
<i>* You know what you do before, *</i>

765
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:59,226
<i>* it was better to be following me. *</i>

766
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:06,264
<i>* Yeah, 'cause I could see clearly *</i>

767
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:43,805
<i>* Occasionally *</i>

768
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:50,712
<i>* Oh, put your faith in me. *</i>

769
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,543
<i> *Follow, follow... *</i>

770
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:16,824
<i>* I relieve your duty *</i>

771
00:46:17,036 --> 00:46:19,525
<i>* Dutifully *</i>

772
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:25,598
<i>* I will take your butter *</i>

773
00:46:25,864 --> 00:46:28,777
<i>* If you won't butter me *</i>

774
00:46:28,778 --> 00:46:35,888
<i>* Follow me down this hole Darlin' *</i>

775
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:38,011
Morning, sweetheart.

776
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:45,686
<i>* Follow me a little blindly *</i>
