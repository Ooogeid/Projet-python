00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:10,151
Hi, Lucy.

3
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:14,184
Julia, what are you doing here?

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,603
You ruined my life.

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,447
I was thinking about
that article you wrote.

6
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,506
It was actually pretty good.

7
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:29,699
But I have some cuts.

8
00:00:50,738 --> 00:00:52,793
You reap what you sow, Lucy.

9
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:41,980
<i>Guess that whole reaping
what you sow thing works both ways.</i>

10
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:45,275

<i>And photographer.</i>

14
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,865
<i>I take photos of celebrities</i>

17
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:59,706
<i>So much to catch you up on,
so try and keep up.</i>

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,585
<i>It all started when Holt McLaren sold
info to Lucy about Kira being pregnant.</i>

19
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,880
<i>After Lucy broke the story,
Kira od'd and died.</i>

20

21
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,384

got really complicated.</i>

00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:18,349
<i>Lucy and Holt kind of had sex.</i>

25
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,130
<i>A lot.</i>

26
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,729
<i>Julia started to slide into
the world of drugs and sex.</i>

27
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,231
Jesus Christ, Julia,
what the hell are you doing?

28
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:28,401
<i>And then leaked her own sex tape,
then claimed she was raped.</i>

29
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:29,926

31
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,491
This is a great cover.

00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,118
<i>I'm really worried about her.</i>

33
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,828

Oh, my God.

37
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,308
<i>Anyway, I'm just really
hoping Lucy wakes up</i>

38
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,576

39
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:42,052
You're all right, Lucy.

40
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:43,911
Yeah, you're all right.

41
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:47,196
You're okay.

42
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:50,149
You got hurt, but now you're okay

43
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,607
cause you're safe.

44
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,598
All right, miss Spiller.

45
00:03:58,568 --> 00:03:59,924
You're all right.

46
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:02,948
Just try to say something.

47
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,501
I think she's asking for her mother.

48
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,211
No, no, no, no. listen.

49
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:14,173
The cover.

50
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:17,870

<i>Welcome To Normal</i>

55
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:39,060
This is great.
This should be a sidebar.

56
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,952
Okay, lose the drop cap on this one.
We're not <i>The New Yorker</i>.

57
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:45,663
I've asked for the sales numbers twice.
What's up?

58
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,248
Terry's bringing them over.

59
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:48,666
Bringing them over? call her.

60
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:51,127
- She needs her rest.
- No, no, Don.

61
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,133
Go.

62
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,332
Don, I'm fine.

63
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,875
That's because
you've been getting a rest.

64
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,530
How's the injection going?

65
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,602
They mix the drugs with sesame oil

66
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:11,279
to cause it to time release.
Just regular sesame oil.

67
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:12,732
Like a stir fry.

68
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,920
Don't... don't...

69
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,125
I can't believe I'm looking at you.

70
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,812
Now I know you were here
the whole time.

71
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,460
I could feel you.

72
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,965
It's night, Don. You got to go home.

73
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,258
You do.
You got to sleep in your own bed.

74
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,088
I don't care how many pizza boxes
or newspapers are piled on it.

75
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,851
You got to go home.

76
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,887
Come on, have some tea.

77
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:49,264
Thank you.

78
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,070
That hurts.

79
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,725
How you doing, buddy?

80
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,568
You're getting bigger all the time.

81
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:07,745
Holt McLaren.

82
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:08,997
Don Konkey.

83
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,259
David fincher described you as an
actor possessed and deeply instinctual.

84
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:16,638
The movie tracked
well with men 18-34,

85
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,261
even better with women.

86
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:19,644
That's good to know.

87
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,380
While your reviews were excellent,

88
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,720
the movie probably
won't receive a nomination

89
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,161
Because it's considered
a <i>genre film</i>.

90
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,358
Listen, man, can I come in?

91
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:30,643
Who told you were I live?

92
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:32,521
A woman, 18 to 34.

93
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:35,261
- Right.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,230
I don't have any beer.

95
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,073
You drink Bud, Corona, Rolling Rock.

96
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,867
I do have some cheese, however.

97
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:48,261
- What's that smell?
- My cat.

98
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,572
Did you tell her
I tried to visit her?

99
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:57,628
No. I, uh...

100
00:06:58,664 --> 00:06:59,964
She needs to rest.

101
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:02,657
I miss her.

102
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:04,835
You're the only who knows,

103
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:07,180
so if you could just
tell her I miss her?

104
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:09,679
- Please?
- Okay.

105
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,956
How's she doing?

106
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:14,228
She thinks she's better than she is.

107
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,371
Yeah? Is she coming home soon?

108
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:18,778
No, two weeks.
There's no infection.

109
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,935
Infection's a killer
with this type of wound.

110
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:22,320
She can't get an infection.

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,191
She's pretty alert, though?

112
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,513
She's Lucy. she's very alert.

113
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:30,635
All right.

114
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:34,900
Spiller?

115
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,376
Animal therapy. Hug a pet.

116
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:39,715
Is that a bearded collie?

117
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,506
It sure is.
Would you like to say hello?

118
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,072
Yeah. Hi.

119
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,384
- What's his name?
- It's Bugsy.

120
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:46,969
Hi, Bugsy. Hi, baby.

121
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:49,514
So how'd you know?
Nobody ever guesses the breed.

122
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:51,933
Because I used to have one
when I was in high school.

123
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:55,042
- Best dog I ever had.
- Spiller. Are you Lucy Spiller?

124
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:55,895
I am.

125
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,226
Oh, my god.

126
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:00,171
What a... just a terrible story.

127
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,938
- You should see the other guy.
- Man, she just...

128
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,368
went crazy, huh?

129
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,156
I guess so.

130
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:09,867
Is it just because you wrote
that article about her?

131
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,161
The dog looks pretty thirsty.

132
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:13,667
No, she's fine.

133
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,606
That's pretty good.

134
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:20,347
You're the only reporter
who's made it into the room.

135
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,629
- No.
- Miles,

136
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,518
let's give the police
department a call.

137
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:26,134
- Or I could deal with him.
- No. look, you're right.

138
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:27,839
But I'm not a tabloid reporter.

139
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,170
I work for the <i>L.A. Weekly</i>.
My name is Farber Kaufman.

140
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,567
I'm a freelancer, okay?

141
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:34,732
I just graduated from Columbia
journalism four months ago.

142
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:35,852
Please.

143
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:38,452
Why would the pretentious snobs
who read the weekly care

144
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,856
what goes on in a tabloid?

145
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:42,670
I pitched it as this kind
of cultural endgame story.

146
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,669
Tabloid culture killed Julia Mallory,

147
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,106
But not before she tried to
kill the tabloid queen.

148
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,238
- You know, that sort of thing.
- First of all, yawn.

149
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:54,358
And the murder attempt,
it seemed personal, almost sexual.

150
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,714
Why did she go to your house,
get inside,

151
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:58,978
and stab you repeatedly?

152
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:01,043
I mean, that's the kind
of violent action

153
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:03,254
that one takes
against their intimate.

154
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,297
That's interesting if that were true.

155
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:10,018
But crazy people imagine
they know you better than they do.

156
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,262
Kaufman.

157
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:14,473
You're the one who wrote the piece
on the Russian mafia last month.

158
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:17,051
That was good.

159
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:21,502
What do you say I triple whatever
you're making and put you on staff?

160
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:24,942
You want me to dig through
Lindsay Lohan's garbage for a living?

161
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:26,525
Come on, give it a shot.

162
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,565
If you don't like it, walk away.

163
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:31,347
Or Miles can give you
a lift to booking.

164
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:43,916
You're getting so big, buddy,

165
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:47,124
There's hardly room
for both of us in the bed anymore.

166
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:49,922
Huh? Is there?

167
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:20,332
<i>You know what normal means, Don?</i>

168
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,974
<i>It means your cat
doesn't talk to you.</i>

169
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,380
I guess you're right, but...

170
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,839
<i>Good-bye, Don.</i>

171
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:42,334
Good-bye, buddy.

172
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:02,832
- You just get bigger.
- I feel like shit.

173
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:04,375
Did you give barrow the changes?

174
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,285
- Could I have your pudding?
- No, honey, I love the pudding.

175
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,815
You can have the applesauce.

176
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,256
Let me see the sales numbers.

177
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,606
I told Barrow he should
bring these over himself.

178
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:14,385
No one wanted to tell you.

179
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:17,791
What's Icon?

180
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,044
We probably should've lied.

181
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:21,309
- What is Icon magazine?
- You need to rest, Lucy.

182
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,728
No, what the hell is Icon magazine?

183
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:27,481
Is that the cover?

184
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,150
I don't think Barrow
really incorporated...

185
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,943
Please, give it to me.

186
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,281
- Give it to me.
- No!

187
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:37,116
Lucy, you shouldn't. She shouldn't.

188
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:39,368
You shouldn't be doing this,
trying to run a magazine

189
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:41,579
out of a hospital bedroom,
you know?

190
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,164
You almost died!

191
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:45,791
And they said that I should be
prepared for the worst.

192
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:47,918
You know, she could die,
your friend could die.

193
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:51,569
Or slip into a permanent
persistent vegetative state,

194
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:53,962
and then eventually
you would have to pull the plug

195
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:56,427
because there's no point in going
on when people...

196
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:57,467
Don.

197
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,350
Here. Let me have it.

198
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,671
It's okay.

199
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:09,339
It's okay.

200
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,776
- I'm okay.
- I'm sorry.

201
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,611
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:20,894
- You can have my pudding.
- Thanks.

203
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:24,682
Thank you.

204
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:37,150
You're kidding, right.
You've got to be kidding me.

205
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,511
Oh, Christ!

206
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,798
My frickin'water broke.

207
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,140
Great.

208
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,142
Wipe it up with that.

209
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,883
I just don't know
what they were thinking.

210
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:49,501
Miss Spiller? Miss Spiller?

211
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,527
First of all, you should be
in a wheelchair.

212
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,139
You should be in this hospital
for at least another week.

213
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,908
This is not just hospital rules.

214
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:57,655
If you walk out, you risk infection...

215
00:12:57,815 --> 00:13:01,158
If I can survive whatever's lurking
in Don's car, I can survive anything.

216
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:14,368
Hello, everyone. Vacation's over.

217
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,351
Hey, Brent.

218
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,063
- You're...
- Alive.

219
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:32,907
Well, yeah.

220
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:36,159
I thought you were out
for another couple of weeks.

221
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,077
- Are you back for good?
- Looks like it.

222
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,329
Oh, thank God.

223
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:44,276
I humbly relinquish my throne.

224
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:46,817
I would like to say, everybody,

225
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:50,916
This has been the most
humbling experience of my life.

226
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:52,668
- Me, too.
- Really?

227
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:54,462
More than that whole underage sex thing?

228
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:55,713
- Well...
- Yeah.

229
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:58,167
We'll save the tears and the group hugs

230
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,342
for later. Now, we have
a magazine to rescue.

231
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:03,182
And this is Farber Kaufman,
he's a staff reporter

232
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,556
Who will be gunning
for all of your jobs.

233
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:07,559
I mean, really?

234
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,413
That's what you came up with?
After my notes.

235
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,121
And after the last two
Julia Mallory covers tanked?

236
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,969
Well, they didn't tank.

237
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,761
- They got beat.
- Yeah, here.

238
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,198
Let me see it.

239
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:21,927
Well, they've just ripped off our design
And did a better cover.

240
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:23,473
Look at it. It's great.

241
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:26,668
They found a publicity shot
of julia mallory holding a knife.

242
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:28,662
Where the hell was my photo department?

243
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,665
This is pathetic.

244
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,709
This story just dropped in our laps...

245
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,960
in my gut...

246
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:36,692
and this is the best...

247
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,870
the best you can do?

248
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,676
Okay, we need to move on.

249
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:45,012
Is that clear?

250
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:48,312
We need to find a new story
where we define the curve.

251
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,476
Hello. Is this thing on?

252
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:52,603
Willa?

253
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:55,235
Oh, God. Um, well,

254
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:58,420
we could do
a Julia Mallory cover with...

255
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,125
with...

256
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:02,479
a reenactment.

257
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,615
You know, we could do it with photos.

258
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,493
It's so much worse than I thought.

259
00:15:07,654 --> 00:15:10,604
Lucy, should I just be following you...

260
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:12,784
That one's yours.
Excuse me. that is my desk.

261
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:13,771
I know.

262
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:18,511
Oh. Well.

263
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:20,005
This is bullshit,

264
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:24,093
bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

265
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:26,551
Has Martina Linn had her baby yet?

266
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:28,452
No, still in the hospital on bed rest.

267
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:31,605
Why is she on bed rest? To try
to keep her away from the mai tais?

268
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,562
It's true. God does write
the best soap operas.

269
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:36,037
Farber, you know this story?

270
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:37,823
- Yeah. A little.
- Catch him up.

271
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:39,349
All righty, then.

272
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:40,672
Chapter 1:

273
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:44,238
Cheap gold digger Martina Linn,
stripper slash model,

274
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,932
Marries 68-year-old
Ukrainian oil tycoon.

275
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:48,709
He gets poisoned by the russian mob...

276
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:50,787
The prince dies, the princess cries,

277
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:54,901
- and she inherits a lot of money.
- Right. exactly. So chapter 2:

278
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,197
His mob buddies say
that it's their money,

279
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,640
so she hires Keith Straub,
sleazy lawyer guy,

280
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,007
who says he can get the money back
from the Russians without her killed.

281
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:06,266
- Let me guess. They fall in love.
- Yeah. He's having a kid with her.

282
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:08,511
So he makes sure
he's tied to her 300 mill.

283
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:11,030
Everyone's gonna cover this
as gold digger makes good.

284
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,941
But she is more than that.

285
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:16,095
When the nuclear blast hits, it's just
gonna be her and the cockroaches.

286
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:17,865
Right. so chapter 3 is the baby.

287
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:20,907
Now, when this baby drops,
you better own this story.

288
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:26,405
And have my office painted.
I've seen enough red.

289
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,367
Willa, you have anything yet?

290
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:32,173
Since three minutes ago?

291
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:34,596
Go talk to her. She's never met
a reporter she didn't like.

292
00:16:34,716 --> 00:16:36,476
Okay. oh, um, Lucy?
- What?

293
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:39,463
- I just wanted to tell you something...
- What?

294
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,838
When I first started working here,
I thought that I could do your job,

295
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,007
That I could just sort of be you.

296
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:47,233
You know? But, when you were
in the hospital,

297
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:49,647
I had a chance to take on
as much of the responsibility

298
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,746
for this magazine as I ever dreamed,

299
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,343
- and...
- And what?

300
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,434
Well, I just... I couldn't do it.

301
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:58,440
I mean, I can dress like you,
I can act like you,

302
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,510
But it's gonna take a long time
before I can run a magazine like you.

303
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:05,623
That's sweet.

304
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:07,978
Did you rehearse that?

305
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:09,848
Yeah.

306
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,913
- Hey, Don.
- Hey, Lucy.

307
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:18,629
- Are you done yet?
- No, I'm still in Dr. Shalba's office.

308
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,870
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- No.

309
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,647
You don't have to. I'm okay.

310
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:24,107
Don, I'm on my way.

311
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,199
- I'm... I'm good.
- All right. Bye.

312
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,216
Bye.

313
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,593
Oh. Willa.

314
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,753
Hi. Keith Straub. How are you?
Good to see you.

315
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,299
- This is Chad.
- I'm the son that doesn't matter.

316
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,358
- Okay. kids, huh?
- Yeah.

317
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,354
And this, of course,

318
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:44,024
- is the stunning Martina Linn.
- Shut up, Keith. I look like a whale.

319
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:47,111
I can't wait for my C-section.

320
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,743
So nice to meet you all.

321
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:52,074
Thank you so much for taking
the time to meet with me.

322
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:54,111
Lucy wanted to be here in person,

323
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:56,516
but she's just out
of the hospital herself, so...

324
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:59,842
No problem, sweetie. We're thrilled
you're interested in the baby pictures.

325
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:02,584
All the magazines are interested.
The more, the merrier.

326
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,614
Well, Lucy wants to do a cover.

327
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:07,958
A whole issue, really,

328
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,551
about how love triumphs
over tragedy and adversity.

329
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:11,760
That's sweet.

330
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:12,624
Yeah.

331
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,514
Are there any wedding bells
in your future?

332
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,316
Oh-ho. no, no, no, no.

333
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:20,930
I've been married twice before,
And both times it was a disaster.

334
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:24,022
I love Keith way too much
to put that curse on him.

335
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:27,568
This baby is our bond of love.
You can quote us on that.

336
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,609
Do you know he got me my inheritance
without me ending up in the dumpster?

337
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:34,074
- Wow.
- He is my savior and my true love.

338
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:35,587
That's another good quote.

339
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:38,599
Speaking of the story, let's get back
to the baby pictures. So,

340
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,328
we're at 750

341
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,281
for the exclusive set right now.

342
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,835
Wow. that's pretty high.

343
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:47,802
- No shit.
- Chaddy, would you go get me a soda?

344
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:50,424
Yes, mama.

345
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,132
Right away, mama.
Anything for you, mama.

346
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:56,224
It was really nice to meet you, Chad.

347
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:59,650
Oh. yeah. You, too. Yeah.

348
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:02,644
- Hi, Don.
- Hi, Dr. Shalba.

349
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:06,190
- How are you feeling today, Don?
- Weird.

350
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:07,802
Weird how?

351
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,500
Well, I... I say weird

352
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,235
because I'm starting to feel normal

353
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,931
and I haven't felt normal
for a long time,

354
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,389
and it feels weird.

355
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,762
Well, we'll keep an eye
on those feelings of normalcy.

356
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:26,558
- They can be pretty scary, huh?
- Yeah.

357
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:29,045
Schizophrenia serves a purpose

358
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,839
for people who suffer from it.

359
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,345
The hallucinations, the flights
of psychosis actually help

360
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,970
lessen the pain and intensity

361
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:38,667
of everyday experience.

362
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:40,577
- Do you follow?
- I do.

363
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:43,290
But I think it's great
that we're trying this.

364
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:52,067
Okay.

365
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:57,030
I'm going to give you
the shot now, all right?

366
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:03,872
And we'll make sure your "normal"
doesn't get too weird.

367
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:06,079
- Dr. Shalba?
- Yes, Don.

368
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,759
Those african masks,

369
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:10,268
they never really spoke, did they?

370
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:11,969
No, Don, they never spoke.

371
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:14,299
I'll see you in a couple of weeks, okay?

372
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:34,145
Hey, come here! You ungrateful bitch!

373
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,445
Holy shit.

374
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,447
Is this the thanks that I get?

375
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,281
- Don, is that Sharlee Cates?
- Who?

376
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:42,150
Sharlee Cates. Get your camera out.

377
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,428
- Hurry.
- Okay, I'm hurrying.

378
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:46,665
You gotta get this shot.
What's on her face?

379
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,376
- What'd she have to do there?
- No. No.

380
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:50,836
- No good.
- No good?

381
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:51,982
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,427
Sharlee Cates would be a great get now.

383
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,970
Please, Lucy, Lucy.

384
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:08,145
Lucy, please.

385
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,608
Get it, Don!

386
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:15,277
What are you doing? I'll kill you!

387
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:16,987
Friggin'move!

388
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:20,198
Get away! Move!

389
00:21:20,442 --> 00:21:22,868
You friggin' paparazzi piece of shit!

390
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:24,744
I'll hit you! move!

391
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,791
Piece of shit!

392
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:34,296
You're crazy.

393
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,384
Oh, shit.

394
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,179
- I popped a staple.
- No.

395
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,015
It's okay. That was great.

396
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:49,478
I'm gonna say another week
of bed rest at the very minimum.

397
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:50,812
- All right.
- Doctor,

398
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:53,561
Carla is freaking in radiology.
You need to get up there.

399
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,238
Why? What is Carla's problem?

400
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:58,273
All I know is that she is shouting
your name like she was on fire.

401
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,070
You want to finish dressing this?

402
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:06,736
You're the magazine lady, Lucy Spiller?

403
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,681
I am.

404
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:10,487
You guys buy stories, right?

405
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:13,066
- Depends.
- Well, nobody's got this one.

406
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,145
Martina Linn's son
Chad is in the hospital.

407
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:17,571
How am I doing?

408
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:19,457
Don? You got cash?

409
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:21,393
Underpants.

410
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:22,525
Go on.

411
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:25,835
My friend at Saint Edmonds
said it was a massive overdose.

412
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:28,231
- Dead?
- Coma.

413
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:30,676
She's a tragedy magnet, that one.

414
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:34,096
Chapter 3.

415
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,100
It's Chad Linn.

416
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:43,218
Tell Lucy Spiller I
got the real story for her...

417
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:46,226
About the old man,
murder, sex, betrayal, everything.

418
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:47,808
But I wanna get paid good.

419
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:49,899
- Hit me back, blondie.
- When did this come in?

420
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:51,608
About an hour before they said he od'd.

421
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:54,644
- I thought he was clean.
- Yeah, apparently not so much.

422
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:57,179
What is this real
story he's talking about?

423
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:59,549
Do I need to call this into the LAPD?

424
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,856
So they can screw it up? No.

425
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:04,947
Don's on the hospital.
Let's see what happens.

426
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:06,739
All right, I gave the
foreigners 500 bucks

427
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,662
so that should keep everybody
out while I talk to Martina.

428
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,533
- Give her a grand.
- What for?

429
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:13,097
Cause we need her.
Tell her it's a down payment.

430
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:15,824
- All right.
- Bob Woodward.

431
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:18,225
See what you can find out
about Sharlee Cates and this broad.

432
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:19,813
- These are great.
- Thank you.

433
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:23,083
I got the pictures of the kid in a coma.

434
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:26,909
And I got a copy of his medical chart.

435
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:29,749
Said he od'd on methadone.

436
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,997
Methadone?

437
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:35,819
What addict accidentally
overdoses on methadone?

438
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,825
They're calling it a suicide.

439
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,253
Something's not right.

440
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,289
You don't call wanting a payday when you

441
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:48,501
are planning to kill yourself.

442
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:52,673
- Ooh, easy.
- It's okay.

443
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:02,195
I guess somebody, you know,

444
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:06,050
knew he would talk and
messed with his dosage.

445
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:09,305
Looks like we got chapter 4.

446
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:12,870
It's great, Don. You feeling good?

447
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:16,192
No.

448
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,870
But I'm feeling normal.

449
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,583
Willa. Hi. Wake up.

450
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:29,282
I need you to get every bit
of audio you can find on Chad Linn.

451
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,318
Get our web guy to help you out.

452
00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,466
Okay. I need it by tomorrow. Thanks.

453
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,230
You need to rest.

454
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:57,671
- Getting it done?
- Ooh!

455
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,213
Oh, yeah. Uhm...

456
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,101
Yeah, we're getting there slowly.

457
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:03,262
Young Chad wasn't the
most articulate guy in town.

458
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,391
- Neither is the mom.
- Oh, she had her baby.

459
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,841
- Really?
- Yeah. 8 pounds, 11 ounces.

460
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,877
Baby Lindee. C-section.

461
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:12,263
If it takes after the mom,
4 of the 8 pounds are tits.

462
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:13,749
Is she photo-friendly?

463
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,573
Yeah. Total gerber baby, apparently.

464
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:19,053
Oh, great. All right,
tell photo to go up to 850.

465
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:20,289
Oh, Mcpherson,

466
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:22,383
I want you to pay that
nurse another 5 grand,

467
00:25:22,543 --> 00:25:26,272
get something from the baby.
I want a diaper, a hair, an ear.

468
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:27,706
- Take it to gateway labs.
- Okay.

469
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:29,605
Oh, um, uh, Lucy, there's a guy...

470
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,422
Hello. Hi, miss Spiller.

471
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,064
It's great to meet you.

472
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:34,664
I was sent over by media helpers.

473
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,856
I think claudia at HR

474
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:37,827
- spoke to you about the assistant job.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

475
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:39,490
- Yes. Oh.
- Let me have your resume.

476
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:40,775
Okay. There you go.

477
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:45,755
Okay. Good.

478
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,087
- You went to college.
- Yes.

479
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,162
You're a big guy. I like that.

480
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:52,780
- Makes me feel safe.
- Oh, great. that's great.

481
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,222
Yeah, listen... I'm sorry to
hear about your recent troubles.

482
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:58,592
If there's anything that I can do
to make things easier around here...

483
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:00,270
You know I'm a crazy bitch, right?

484
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:02,844
Uh, yes, I have heard that you can be...

485
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:05,223
That it can be a bit of a challenge,

486
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:07,298
but I'm certainly ready
to meet that challenge...

487
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:08,736
Okay. That's fantastic. Here.

488
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,931
- You can start right now.
- Fantastic. Yes, great.

489
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:12,990
Thank you. I wasn't
really planning... but yes...

490
00:26:13,242 --> 00:26:15,798
- Thank you.
- Wait, your name is Kenny?

491
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,194
Yes. Is that a problem?

492
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:18,537
Well, it was for the last guy.

493
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:21,490
- What happened to the last guy?
- He got shot in the head.

494
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:26,453
Okay. Ah...

495
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:28,664
- Harsh.
- What?

496
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:31,125
Harsh. I know, I know. Harsh.

497
00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:34,111
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna leave. I just need a second.

498
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:35,796
I just need a second. Harsh.

499
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:38,424
I know, I know, I know. Harsh.

500
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,297
Okay.

501
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:44,013
Okay, I'm good. Uhm, I'm sorry.

502
00:26:44,275 --> 00:26:46,599
I just... I have this
condition and, uhm...

503
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:49,191
I don't want to bore you with it,
but this is the only thing that helps.

504
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:50,909
It's self-soothing.

505
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,568
Otherwise, I faint. So I'm gonna go.

506
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,848
- thank you so much for your time.
- I think you should stay.

507
00:26:56,008 --> 00:26:59,212
- this could be fun.
- Oh, excellent.

508
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,721
Yes. Yes. I think that it could be fun.

509
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:04,539
- And really, when you think about it...
- But you gotta minimize the chatter.

510
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,605
Right. I'm sorry. I get
nervous. Uhm, that's...

511
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:08,996
Oh, okay. Thank you.

512
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,165
Okay. Oh, watch out for anthrax.

513
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:16,585
Oh. Harsh.

514
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,534
Oh, Lucy, so the lady
Sharlee Cates was chasing

515
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:27,935
was the mother of her
assistant Joanne Wentzel.

516
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:29,737
Ex-assistant, rather.

517
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,780
Sharlee was chasing
her ex-assistant's mother?

518
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,349
Apparently.

519
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:36,235
Well, it's a dazzling story. why?

520
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:38,836
The mother Joanne works
at a dermatologist's office.

521
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:42,270
- Bad botox?
- Sharlee Cates is 22, genius.

522
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:46,736
So I looked up your information,

523
00:27:46,954 --> 00:27:49,371
Which we're not supposed to do unless
we're running a check for employers,

524
00:27:49,496 --> 00:27:51,241
but we do it all the time...

525
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:53,910
New girlfriends, landlords, whatever.

526
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,785
Plus this thing kicks
ass over google, so...

527
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:59,297
Had a bit of a gambling
problem in college, huh?

528
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:00,832
Yeah, it's a bummer.

529
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:04,407
Uneven employment history,
and you work for Dirtnow.

530
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,191
- Now.
- You know, it always terrifies me

531
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,842
how much information potential
employers have access to.

532
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,234
I know. It's crazy.

533
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:11,726
Hey, how's it going, Emily?

534
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:16,510
Yeah, I like how the piping is
fitting with the... the... the slacks.

535
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,399
Is that a... that's a choice.

536
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:20,013
Five D. O. I, two kids.

537
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,555
Bikes to work. It's a sad story.
I don't know how she does it.

538
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:25,473
Did you find anything out about
Heather Wentzel, the assistant?

539
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:28,849
Uh, why, is this some kind of big
Sharlee Cates scandal coming down?

540
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,295
All depends on you, Lars.

541
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:32,529
Then you're shit out of luck.
Heather's Wentzel's boring.

542
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:36,458
No arrests, and the Sharlee Cates
gig was her first assistant job, so...

543
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:38,932
What about the mom?

544
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,570
Joanne Wentzel.

545
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,634
Yeah. She almost got fired,

546
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:48,276
because her employer,
Alpha Pharmaceuticals,

547
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,373
accused her of stealing quantities

548
00:28:50,553 --> 00:28:52,558
of prescription drugs
to sell to her clients.

549
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:55,545
Turns out they couldn't prove
anything cause the file was closed.

550
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:59,258
But it wasn't closed to us cause
the mighty corporation sees all...

551
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:04,770
I'm starting to see how all this
comes together. It's cool. Reporting.

552
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:06,611
So am I gonna be in Dirtnow?

553
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:08,324
Well, wouldn't you get fired?

554
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,743
Yeah... I guess.

555
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:12,828
Can I be an anonymous source?

556
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,304
No problem.

557
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,111
Hey, the mother, Joanne Wentzel,

558
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,619
was Sharlee's dealer, okay?
Got her daughter Heather hired

559
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:21,859
as sharlee's assistant.

560
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:23,059
But when Joanne gets busted

561
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:26,216
and stops getting vicodin
and oxy for Sharlee, Sharlee freaked,

562
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,101
okay? I'm basically two calls away

563
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:30,387
from having it locked
up and double-sourced.

564
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,521
Wow. Not bad, Woodward.

565
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:34,025
I know. Right?

566
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:36,896
So Sharlee Cates is
a drug user. Could be.

567
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,229
No, no, no, no. For sure, okay?

568
00:29:38,382 --> 00:29:40,043
I confirmed with Heather,
the assistant she fired,

569
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:43,255
and I got the secondary source.
It's gonna pass legal for sure.

570
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,248
All right, well, it's interesting.
I'll definitely consider it. Thanks.

571
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:48,457
That's it?

572
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:51,545
Your writing could use some work.

573
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,469
Willa, give it a pass.
Dirt it up a little.

574
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:55,037
Uh, do you mean dumb it down?

575
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:58,140
Okay, let's see.

576
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,678
"She's the apotheosis
of bubble gum pop."

577
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:02,797
You're kidding, right?
Any word on Chad Linn?

578
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:04,865
No. Still coma boy, but

579
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:06,465
I did get a tape for you.

580
00:30:06,677 --> 00:30:08,144
- Did your nurse come through?
- I got a hair.

581
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:10,043
Great. I want a lab
report as soon as possible.

582
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:11,720
I don't care what it costs.

583
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:17,726
Chad wants to sell us the story.

584
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,263
He says you tried to kill him.

585
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:22,213
- Chaddie's awake?
- I'm going to make you a deal.

586
00:30:22,373 --> 00:30:24,081
I'll tell your story.

587
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:26,183
You could use the pages
of Dirt to sway the jury.

588
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:27,949
That's bullshit. I just
saw him this morning.

589
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:30,689
Ted williams' head has
a better chance of waking up.

590
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:31,834
Sorry, baby.

591
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:35,970
Well, he was up enough to ask the nurse
to switch him to a more secure room.

592
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:37,262
You can ask the ICU.

593
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,123
You're full of shit.

594
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:43,228
Let's see.

595
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,817
Lucy, it's Chad Linn.

596
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:48,265
I got a real story,
but I want to get paid.

597
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,842
Martina tried to make me die,

598
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:51,864
just like she poisoned the old man.

599
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,438
What'd you do, load his
diet coke with methadone?

600
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:56,459
Don't say anything.

601
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:58,632
I don't know why you
keep sticking up for her.

602
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:00,248
She screwed you, too.

603
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:02,030
Okay, I think it's time
you get the hell out of here.

604
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:03,610
Fine, but if it were me,

605
00:31:03,756 --> 00:31:05,626
and my baby girl was another man's,

606
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:06,775
I'd want to know.

607
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:09,549
That's bullshit. Go.

608
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:13,615
Here you go. This is baby Lindee's dna.

609
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,579
There's a match to a very
large Russian family, the Romanovs.

610
00:31:19,107 --> 00:31:21,490
Isn't that the name
of your late husband?

611
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:24,899
Keith, you're not the father.

612
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:27,714
She's not going to marry you.
You're not going to get a dime.

613
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:29,640
Keith, honey, honestly,
I would never ever...

614
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:32,435
Don't, don't, don't.
Do not bullshit me.

615
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:35,240
So when were you going
to get around to killing me?

616
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:36,765
That's so mean.

617
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:38,440
Why would you say something so hurtful?

618
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,312
Spare me the theatrics, okay?
This isn't one of your soft-porn movies.

619
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,180
You poisoned your husband,
you poisoned your child.

620
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:44,530
It stands to reason that I'm next.

621
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:47,517
You can't let me live, can you?
I know where the bodies are.

622
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,856
Keith, honey, really, it's
just our word against hers.

623
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:55,684
- It don't mean nothing.
- What about me, Martina?

624
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:58,410
- What do I get?
- Just... Just anything you want.

625
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,908
Just draw up the papers. I'll sign it.

626
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,411
I love you.

627
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,130
And you still love me.

628
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,887
What are you going to do?

629
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,880
I'm going to give away half my
money as soon as he gets bored?

630
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,559
Like they all eventually do?

631
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,341
If you say so.

632
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:28,200
You got no story here, you know?

633
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,984
- Really? How so?
- No.

634
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,014
Well, he's not going to talk

635
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,183
because he'd implicate himself.

636
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,571
And even if Chaddie does
come out of his coma,

637
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,313
well, he's...

638
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:43,497
A career addict. Breaks my heart.

639
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:46,796
With a criminal history? Pssh.

640
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,419
He's not a very reliable witness.

641
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:53,268
Yeah, well, I'm not a D.A.

642
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:57,177
I'm a reporter. And
I'm pretty certain that

643
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:00,399
I can report your
confession in this interview.

644
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,681
Yeah, well, knock yourself out.

645
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,330
Really.

646
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:06,230
Because I didn't say any of that.

647
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:08,034
You know Phil Spector?

648
00:33:08,543 --> 00:33:10,864
He killed that woman, shot her dead,

649
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,826
Confessed at the crime scene.

650
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:14,757
And what happened to him?

651
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,283
And I have more money
than him and Robert Blake,

652
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:21,364
and O.J. combined.

653
00:33:33,187 --> 00:33:35,182
Uh, Ms. Spiller, Sharlee
Cates is here. She's...

654
00:33:35,343 --> 00:33:36,138
Move, asswipe.

655
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:37,578
Harsh. Ugh.

656
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:41,094
I have a kid and a marriage, you know?

657
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:42,336
I will sue.

658
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:45,538
It all went through legal.
They're pretty confident.

659
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,533
- But I'm not going to run it.
- What?

660
00:33:49,547 --> 00:33:51,491
I want you to meet someone.

661
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,687
This is Don Konkey.

662
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:55,566
Hi, Sharlee.

663
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,669
- Sounds like Donkey Kong.
- Yeah, it's almost an anagram.

664
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:01,670
Don Konkey, Donkey Kong.

665
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,870
But there's no g in Don Konkey.

666
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,210
Don's going to be your
personal photographer.

667
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,063
He'll need unfettered access.

668
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,850
Oh, that means lots.

669
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:13,238
I really like "love me monday."

670
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:15,819
Thank you.

671
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:19,681
I mean, why have one sad
career-destroying cover

672
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:22,054
when we can have 20
happy, productive ones?

673
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:44,954
I knew Julia Mallory.

674
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:49,089
Not like best friends, but I knew her.

675
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:54,049
Doesn't it make you nervous...

676
00:34:55,864 --> 00:34:58,298
To mess around with
people's lives like this?

677
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,144
Given everything that's happened.

678
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:14,926
No.

679
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,946
Well...

680
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,958
My fans don't want to see
me as a druggy, so, um...

681
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,434
Give me a call, Donkey Kong.

682
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,396
Oh. I'm sorry.

683
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:37,634
Yeah, that'll be good.

684
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:44,266
That's a $12,000 rug.
I hope she's worth it.

685
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:48,849
- Don't sweat it, dude.
- Mm, thank you, dude.

686
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:52,555
You get that that story was just a prop

687
00:35:52,675 --> 00:35:54,813
for Lucy to use with
Sharlee and with you?

688
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,000
It still doesn't excuse
some of your larger sins

689
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,872
of metaphor and syntax in this piece.

690
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,700
Oh, goody.

691
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,668
Journalism class. Go ahead.

692
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,161
"Last may at the coliseum,
Sharlee Cates literally

693
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:13,812
"ripped the hearts out of the audience
with her rendition of'Hey, Jude.'"

694
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:16,926
Help me out here, Willa.
What did she do, exactly?

695
00:36:17,046 --> 00:36:20,181
Did she descend into
the crowd while singing

696
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:23,049
and start tearing out their
still-beating hearts like

697
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,463
some kind of mayan priest
at a ritual sacrifice?

698
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,890
I mean, I'm assuming you
were a journalism major

699
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:32,309
Or at least an english major.

700
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,313
Jesus christ, what do you do?

701
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,658
Just come to work here
and throw out every trace

702
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,173
Of education and...
ethics you ever acquired?

703
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,970
You wouldn't happen to talking
about yourself, just a...

704
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:48,895
Just a little bit, would you?

705
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:57,846
Whatever.

706
00:37:04,104 --> 00:37:07,338
He died a year ago on
the night of a blood moon,

707
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,806
also known as a sanguine moon.

708
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,735
That's tonight.

709
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,544
- A year ago.
- I remember.

710
00:37:17,578 --> 00:37:19,001
Tristan was special.

711
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:22,374
There was no way he was
going to a pet cemetery.

712
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,643
Ramon...

713
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,675
Caretaker here, he understands that.

714
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,468
And I give him a hundred
a month on the side.

715
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,469
I didn't like the way you drove
when we were chasing Sharlee.

716
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:37,629
I'm sorry.

717
00:37:39,062 --> 00:37:41,647
Part of my, uh, being normal.

718
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:45,919
is risk aversion. I'm
developing my risk aversion.

719
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:49,383
I'm developing my risk.

720
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:52,920
Yeah, fear is an
essential survival tool.

721
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,321
Yeah, but fear can also do you in.

722
00:37:57,014 --> 00:37:58,064
I'm over it.

723
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:00,560
What happened to you, Lucy?

724
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,562
I was in a coma,

725
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:08,385
and for a minute I crossed over.

726
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:11,287
It was so nice.

727
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:15,251
Why'd you come back?

728
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,124
I don't know.

729
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:19,919
We'll see.

730
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:24,670
Don't drive like that
when I'm in the car.

731
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:27,117
- Okay?
- Okay.

732
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:35,761
What happened to you?

733
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,798
Since I've been sick, it's been
like looking at one of those

734
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:45,330
old funhouse mirrors.

735
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,583
And then, one day I turn around

736
00:38:51,178 --> 00:38:53,164
And I see the whole real world.

737
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,100
And my cat stopped talking to me.

738
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,086
My walls stopped breathing.

739
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,576
And instead of seeing
the moon in my mind,

740
00:39:05,732 --> 00:39:06,995
I'm really here.

741
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:10,342
I am, right?

742
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:15,342
We both are.

743
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:40,850
Pretty, huh?

744
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,062
