1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,037
<i>My name's Don Konkey.</i>

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,039
<i>I take pictures.</i>

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,776
<i>I'm a functional
schizophrenic.</i>

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,113
- That's good work, Don.
- <i>I work with my friend, Lucy Spiller.</i>

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,049
Tyrese is leaving
training right now.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:20,120
<i>She had me take some pictures
of the basketball star, Prince Tyrese...</i>

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,422
<i>He found out and got mad.</i>

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,493
- Who are you working for?
- Nobody. Just me.

9
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,363
<i>This is Holt McLaren.
He's a good actor.</i>

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,798
You're creepy, man.

11
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,333
<i>He doesn't like me.</i>

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,670
I'd love to do a feature
on you some time.

13
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:42,042
<i>But, he gave Lucy dirt on how Kira Klay
was gonna have a baby.</i>

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>She OD'd,</i>

15
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,180
<i>then she died.</i>

16
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,648
<i>Morning, sweetheart.</i>

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,683
<i>Now, she lives with me.</i>

18
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,219
You saved my life and you
nursed me back to health.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,137
<i>Holt's girlfriend, Julia Mallory
got hurt real bad</i>

20
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:58,237
</i>when Holt got mad and crashed his car.</i>

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,761
<i>She got injured.</i>

22
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,996
<i>Holt got a David Fincher movie.</i>

23
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,531
That's awesome!

24
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,435
You're gonna make it for less money.
Knock off 20%.

25
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,169
<i>Lucy's magazines were in trouble,</i>

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,540
<i>so she convinced Gibson Horne
to merge them into one.</i>

27
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:17,010
The credibility of Now with
all the lurid fun of Drrt.

28
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,945
<i>May God help you
if you're wrong.</i>

29
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,517
It's called "ovophagy".

30
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,388
Sharks battling in the womb,
devouring their brothers and sisters

31
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,757
until only the fittest survive,

32
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,560
which is why we're all here today.
Lucky us.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,996
Now magazine is venerable, respected,

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,564
and hemorrhaging cash.

35
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,600
Dirt has solid sales, but its

36
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,803
readers will always be low-rent,
so the ad revenue isn't there.

37
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,172
These two magazines cannot survive.

38
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,508
So I thought
about the sharks,

39
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,978
turning a liability
into a source of nutrition.

40
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,547
As of today, Dirt and Now

41
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,284
are merging into one new,
single publication.

42
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,055
A tabloid with class.

43
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,890
All the fun of Dirt,

44
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,859
with the prestige of Now.

45
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,794
Now has been

46
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,731
a pillar of the American journalistic
landscape for over 70 years.

47
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,334
We survived McCarthyism,

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,870
we can certainly survive
a dip in sales.

49
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:20,173
First of all, Reginald, I know
how you hate a mixed metaphor,

50
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,964
so I'm gonna have to call
you on the whole

51
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,681
"pillar of the landscape" thing.

52
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,179
Pillars don't hold up landscapes.

53
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,747
Secondly, thank you
for your look backwards.

54
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,647
That will be the last look
in that direction

55
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:32,422
that anyone in these offices ever takes.

56
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,554
With due respect,

57
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,591
I'm not gonna be part of the dismantling
of an American  journalistic icon.

58
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,594
Of course you're not, because,
with due respect,

59
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,530
you're fired. Now get out.

60
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,767
And anyone else who wants
to keep doing the same old tired crap,

61
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,968
please feel free to leave.

62
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,037
Those of you who want
to do something new,

63
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,306
do real reporting,
break stories,

64
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,174
stay.

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,411
I believe in the truth
above all else. And this

66
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,513
is truth.

67
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,348
We have to be sharks.

68
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,552
If we succeed, there's room
for about half of you to stay.

69
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,454
If we fail, we're all finished,
including me.

70
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,126
We have one week to prove
our right to survive

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,195
or get eaten alive.

<b>Dirt - Season 01
Episode 03 - "Ovophagy"</b>

76
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:35,248
First off, we need some hot ass cover
tries. Who wants Cozmo the Pitchball?

77
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,618
Profile on Aundre G.

78
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,554
Yeah, let's launch  a new magazine
with a black R&B star.

79
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,290
That'll really move at K-mart.

80
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,292
The guy vanishes
without a trace.

81
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,964
Four months later, his CDs are
topping the charts. He's a phenomenon.

82
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,632
So he's in rehab,
big deal.

83
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,086
Maybe he pulled a Chappelle.
Anybody check South Africa?

84
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,305
Maybe he figured out that mysterious
disappearance sells a lot of records.

85
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,045
Either way, it's  a great mystery.

86
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:02,974
Everyone's gonna cover
the mystery angle.

87
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,478
This new magazine has to break stories.

88
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,280
Solve it. That's a cover.

89
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,815
- Next?
- Right here.

90
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,518
What about a cover on Hollywood meds?
Who's taking what?

91
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,588
It's a great chip, not a cover.
Work it out. Next!

92
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,257
Um, I--I... have something...

93
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,125
Oh!

94
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,361
Sorry.

95
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,263
McPherson? Wow me.

96
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,266
I--I don't--I'm not really
sure it's anything, really.

97
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,601
But, um, you know Connie Chris?

98
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,738
The former Mouseketeer
turned Christian rocker?

99
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,073
She has a new album, so,

100
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,576
I went to pull some event shots and

101
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,845
there's nothing new
for the last three days.

102
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,214
And she's suddenly
got no P.R. ties.

103
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,315
She's supposed to be launching
a new album,

104
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,883
and she hasn't been seen since Friday.

105
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,826
Maybe she's been called
to the rapture!

106
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:47,829
And we're still here?

107
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,324
Maybe she's shacking up
with Aundre G in South Africa?

108
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,559
Or at least working
with his publicist, right?

109
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,296
- Did you check with her publicist?
- Her assistant says

110
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,131
Connie's got a flu. They're
rescheduling things, no big deal.

111
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,066
Let's dig around and
see what we can find.

112
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,469
We are not running rumors
or chasing other magazines.

113
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,040
We live or die by breaking stories.

114
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,310
We have one week for this cover.
Let's get to work.

115
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,646
You sure you're ready?

116
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,349
Listen, if it's too soon--

117
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,452
I missed two episodes.
If I don't go back, they'll recast me.

118
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,122
Come on, you're Julia Mallory.
They can't recast you.

119
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,792
Listen, if you need more time--

120
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,094
Goddamned back feels like
there's a knife in it.

121
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,463
You want water?

122
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,333
Ahh.

123
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,143
Oh, Jesus, my agent.

124
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,746
I can't deal with Quinn saying
how beautiful I look. I really can't.

125
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,216
- Come on. I'll keep him away.
- Please.

126
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,119
Hey, listen.

127
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,855
You're gonna do great, okay?

128
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,523
This is your show.
They love you.

129
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,225
They who?

130
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,762
Asshole writers didn't even write in
a reason that my character was away.

131
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,432
America loves you.

132
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,501
Come on.

133
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,703
It's gonna be fine.

134
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,538
All right?

135
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,307
There she is.
I told you she'd be ready.

136
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:21,114
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, you look beautiful.

137
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,917
- Hey!
- Hey, listen, I talked to Jeff.

138
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,554
It's your show,
they should go at your pace.

139
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,555
I'm fine.

140
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,057
I know, they should just go
at your pace. Okay?

141
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,694
She should have some quiet time
to get ready before the taping.

142
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,030
All right, well, we're here all day.
Whatever you need.

143
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,832
Thank you.

144
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,667
Oh, hey, Holt.

145
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,837
You know, Teddy Jick is
shooting My Waron the lot.

146
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,538
Oh, with Jack Dawson, right?

147
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,907
Yeah, we're having lunch with Teddy
on the set. You know,

148
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,477
he's got this huge
new action franchise coming up.

149
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,880
Three big summer movies in a row.

150
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,848
He's talking to Dawson, but...

151
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,417
You should meet him.

152
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,214
Why don't you come
to lunch with us?

153
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,720
I'm gonna hang with Julia.

154
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,889
Oh, of course, unless
she needs her quiet.

155
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,157
You'd like Teddy.

156
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
I'm telling you, he's a hoot.

157
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,727
And he's always got something hot.

158
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,730
Smart action picture.
It'd be a great move for you.

159
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,231
You should go.

160
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,900
Are you sure?

161
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,968
Yeah, it could be
good for you.

162
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,638
He's right, I could
use some quiet time.

163
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,774
Just be back
for my taping, okay?

164
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,543
I promise.

165
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,448
You go to Gibson Horne
behind my back to merge the magazines?

166
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,049
The ad pages weren't there.

167
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,320
And you think the advertisers are gonna
line up to buy into your glossy tabloid?

168
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,290
Gibson is behind this new magazine.

169
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:39,224
If you feel you can't
deliver advertisers,

170
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,349
I will gladly pick up
the phone and let him know.

171
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,829
I'll get the ads.

172
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,630
I'll even up the draw.

173
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,935
Heard you showed a video of sharks
eating their siblings in the womb.

174
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,338
Rumor going around you had a twin,
suffered the same fate.

175
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,108
- Yeah, I like my space.
- Yeah.

176
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,485
<i>Hi, this is Don.
Leave a message.</i>

177
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,588
<i>Don, hey, it's me. Pick up.
I need to talk to you.</i>

178
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,597
<i>I know you're there, Don.
Pick up.</i>

179
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,067
I should, uh--
I should get that.

180
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,670
<i>Call her back.
Please.</i>

181
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,275
<i>Okay, call me as soon as you get
this message. Bye.</i>

182
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,244
<i>See?</i>

183
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,514
<i>She's gonna be just fine, Mister.</i>

184
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,253
<i>Please stay with me.</i>

185
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,792
<i>Stay with me.</i>

186
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,028
<i>Stay with me.</i>

187
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,213
So,

188
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,550
Marlon looks Ali McGraw in the face,
and says,

189
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,418
"Pleasure meeting you".

190
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,122
Then he looks down at her breasts,
tips his hat, and says,

191
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,423
"Ladies".

192
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,700
I mean, Evans is standing
right there,

193
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:22,227
his mouth wide open.
I almost shit myself.

194
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,864
Well, listen, I should probably
get back to her taping.

195
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,900
Those things always start late.
Anyway,

196
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,703
I hear great things
on the Fincher picture.

197
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,807
You need a big next move, something
to really-- Hold on a second.

198
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,409
- Dawson!
- Oi.

199
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,810
My man.

200
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,378
You don't holler back?
What's up with that?

201
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,147
How are ya?

202
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,317
Have you met the new you?
Holt McLaren, Jack Dawson.

203
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,318
Mm, hey.

204
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,319
Congratulations on the movie, man.
Good job.

205
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,053
Thank you.

206
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,322
- We'll see how it goes.
- See how it goes, bullshit.

207
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,992
Kid's on fire.
You better watch yourself, Jack.

208
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,462
Press he's getting, you get
too pushy on this next deal,

209
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,296
I might just have to give
the part to him.

210
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,166
Yeah, okay,
I gotta eat this.

211
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,435
Then I gotta get
into touch-ups, all right?

212
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,804
- Good to meet ya.
- You too, man.

213
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,738
Good luck.

214
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,975
<i>Everybody quiet, please!</i>

215
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,075
And,

216
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:10,910
action!

217
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,716
So, do I look sophisticated?

218
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,785
Cut.

219
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,424
"You look like
Thurston Popeye the Third".

220
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:23,466
Oh, I know, I'm sorry.

221
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,157
I'm so sorry, you guys.

222
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,360
Um, is Holt here, yet?

223
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,394
No, Holt is not here.

224
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,664
- Can we do this, please?
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

225
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,333
Okay, we're going again.

226
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,469
And...

227
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,037
Action!

228
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,644
So, do I look sophisticated?

229
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,146
You look like Thurgood--
Uh--um--

230
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,581
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

231
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,049
Look like Thurston Popeye the Third.

232
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,484
Thurston Popeye the Third.

233
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,186
Comedy gold. I got it.
I got it.

234
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,353
I got it.

235
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,124
Reset. Going again, please, right away.

236
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,593
Action.

237
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,665
So, do I look sophisticated?

238
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,802
<i>You look like Thurston
Popeye the Third, dipshit.</i>

239
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,379
Cut.

240
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,221
Ugh, she's gay, she's straight.
She's gay, she's straight.

241
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,691
Rumor fluctuates
more than her weight.

242
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,126
Unless you've got a shot
of her coming up for air,

243
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,694
I'm not interested.

244
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,130
My wall is naked!
I don't like it!

245
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,133
Rema Saunders is waiting
for you in the office.

246
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,069
She's representing
Connie Chris.

247
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,136
Hold my calls.

248
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,506
Hi.

249
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,708
Hi, Lucy.

250
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,076
Congratulations.

251
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,978
- New magazine, very exciting.
- Yes, thank you.

252
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,380
Congratulations to you
on repping Connie Chris.

253
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,347
Thank you.

254
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,884
You're here to give an
exclusive for our first cover?

255
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,489
I'm here with a press release,

256
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,707
and it says that between
non-stop work on her album

257
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,891
and national church functions,
Connie Chris got exhausted

258
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,125
and she'll be fully recovered
and back to work soon.

259
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:11,115
I wanted to give it to you personally,
because it seems that your people

260
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:13,276
- are particularly interested.
- Really?

261
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,334
Yes, staking out her house,
her mother's house,

262
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,366
- her grandmother's house.
- Her grandmother's?

263
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,107
Someone's showing initiative.
Good.

264
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,844
I love press releases.
They are so much fun to translate.

265
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:29,982
Let's see here. "Medical attention".
I'm guessing it's nose job or abortion.

266
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,051
But which?

267
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:37,957
"Exhaustion". Oh, that's tough.
Maybe rehab or psychotic break.

268
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,193
Connie Chris is a role-model
for young people across the country.

269
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,794
I will not have her reputation

270
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,494
- dragged down by so...
- By what, Rema?

271
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,099
You're a publicist.
You don't exist without us.

272
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,736
Give me my first cover.
I'll pay you back.

273
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,693
Come on. We're friends.

274
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:55,834
You don't know what friendship is, Lucy.

275
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,311
I know you're lying about Connie Chris.
I can smell it.

276
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:01,272
Give me the truth,

277
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:03,838
and I'll at least give you the chance
to put your spin on it.

278
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:09,221
You want the truth? I know how
important this first issue is for you.

279
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,924
I know you staked
your entire career on it,

280
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:17,963
and when it all goes to shit for you,
I am gonna throw one huge party.

281
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,666
How's that for the truth?

282
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,236
He grew up in Bel Air.
Don't look under Aundre G.

283
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,094
- It's Andrew Gerber.
- Okay, call him back.

284
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,175
- How are your medical contacts?
- Solid.

285
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,442
Great.
This is Connie Chris' press release.

286
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,615
It says "medical attention".

287
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:34,813
Obviously, she's in a hospital.
Find out which one.

288
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,981
- I'm on it.
- All right.

289
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,854
Julia?
Hey.

290
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,325
Hey, I'm so sorry I missed your taping.

291
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,888
Lucky you. I sucked.

292
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:52,231
- Come on, I'm sure you were great.
- How would you know? You weren't there.

293
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,970
- Maybe you need a little more time off.
- That's funny, that's what they said.

294
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,905
Well, they're concerned
about you, babe.

295
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,308
No, they're concerned about getting 22
a year so they make it to syndication,

296
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,810
that's what
they're concerned about.

297
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,747
- Shit!
- Hey, hey! Babe, hey!

298
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,585
It's gonna take time.
Next week will be better.

299
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,771
I don't want to talk about it.

300
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,603
I'll run lines with you,
whatever you need.

301
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:19,417
I said I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

302
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,682
<i>Reserved Lucy Spiller
Editor in Chief</i>

303
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,298
This is Connie Chris,

304
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,431
Christian pop star. She dropped
off radar last week.

305
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,263
Reliable sources say she's at St. Alma's
private hospital in Northridge.

306
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,966
They happen to have a big
drug treatment program there.

307
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,882
I need cover quality pictures,
plus her chart.

308
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:38,136
Okay.

309
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,607
If this first issue doesn't hit,
it's over.

310
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,147
For both of us.

311
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:45,376
Sorry, your brother called
about dinner again.

312
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,548
Okay, I'm on my way. Lenny, this is Don.
Don, this is my new assistant, Lenny.

313
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,183
- Kenny.
- Whatever.

314
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,687
Tell everyone I'll be back in two hours.
I want to see cover tries.

315
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,457
- They'll all suck. Don't let me down.
- I won't.

316
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,159
I know you won't.

317
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,432
I'm making coq au vin.
We're celebrating.

318
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,502
I'm not celebrating until the first
issue hits 1.1 at the stands.

319
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,839
Always about you, huh?
Maybe I have something to celebrate.

320
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,042
What, did you finally bang
that Latvian busboy at the Rig?

321
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,712
Done and done.
No. This is major.

322
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,817
What? A new commission? Come on,
don't hold out on your big sister.

323
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,210
I didn't want to say because
he was living in Ohio,

324
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,119
and wasn't sure he was
moving back, but he is

325
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,858
and we shook hands today,
so I am officially

326
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:36,061
Jack Dawson's new
interior decorator.

327
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,865
Oh, my God, Leo!
That's so great! It's fantastic!

328
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,702
He loves classic farmhouse.
I convinced him it's my passion.

329
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,905
You know what, you should talk to him.
Let me do a spread.

330
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,075
Inside Jack Dawson's home,
it will be huge for your business.

331
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,078
I just got hired by Jack Dawson.
My business is huge.

332
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,478
Never underestimate
the value of good press.

333
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:56,713
Is this for me or you?

334
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,408
Do I have to spell everything
out for you? Jesus,

335
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:01,607
it would be great PR for you.

336
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,512
And, yes, it would be a great
get for my magazine,

337
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:07,635
which I desperately need right now.

338
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,395
And you wonder
why you're alone.

339
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,066
I'm not alone.
I have my magazine.

340
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,847
I just have this image of you
in your expensive home

341
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,220
with nothing to hold
but your latest issue.

342
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,806
Is that really enough?

343
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,791
Listen, I don't have much time.
Julia thinks I'm out getting smokes.

344
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,726
You look good, Holt.

345
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,163
Getting cut
for a new part?

346
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,167
- Just working on my movie.
- Don't be modest.

347
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,668
I know you had
lunch with Teddy Jick.

348
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,473
I also know that his big action
franchise is still up for grabs.

349
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,910
- You want my advice?
- Not really.

350
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,314
Julia's agents will
try to sign you.

351
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,882
You should make them bring you
an offer on the action movie first.

352
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,487
Tell him you won't sign on a promise,
only a deal.

353
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,756
I'll keep it in mind.

354
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,295
What's eating you?
I'm only looking out for you, here.

355
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,032
You're only looking
out for me?

356
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,838
Kira Klay is dead because of what
I told you and what you published.

357
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,106
Julia's back is screwed up

358
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,049
and she's in constant pain, so don't
tell me you're looking out for me.

359
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,948
Kira Klay was a drug addict who
got pregnant, freaked out, and OD'd.

360
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:38,501
Your girlfriend's in constant
pain because

361
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:40,739
you flipped your car
at 90 miles an hour.

362
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,788
All I've done
is make you look great.

363
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,929
Do you know Connie Chris?

364
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,833
She sings about the Bible,
the Lord, and her virginity.

365
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,737
We don't exactly travel
in the same circle.

366
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,720
You might be surprised. 

367
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:04,231
She's in a private hospital
that specializes in drug rehab.

368
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,581
I need to know young Hollywood's
most discreet celebrity dealer.

369
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,050
And I know this because?

370
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,288
Because if you were to piss into
a paper cup right now,

371
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:17,082
it would probably dissolve.

372
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,962
Connie Chris got her drugs from someone.
I need to know who it is.

373
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,907
There's one dealer.
Sells to all the young actors.

374
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,241
Name?

375
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,012
She calls herself Garbo.

376
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,483
But you're not gonna get anything
from her. She's totally discreet.

377
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,421
So am I.
Don't you know that by now?

378
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,075
- Can I help you?
- Delivery. 8th floor.

379
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,844
Deliveries go to the loading dock
out back, now.

380
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,248
I always take them up to the room,
at least to the nurse's station.

381
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,886
New policy. Loading dock. Our guys'll
get them to the room on time.

382
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,489
- My boss is kinda particular.
- Well, so is mine.

383
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,726
You are not getting upstairs.
We got a big celebrity and...

384
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,829
you'd be surprised what
the press will do to sneak in.

385
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,790
That sucks.

386
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:34,613
Makes it bad for everybody,
doesn't it?

387
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:43,108
I followed your crazy pap.

388
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:44,270
Did you really think

389
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,643
I wouldn't figure out it was you
who sent those pictures?

390
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,352
You're a smart man, Prince.
Of course I thought you'd figure it out.

391
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,320
I was counting on it.

392
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:59,491
Gibson Horne owns this magazine.
He owns your team.

393
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,493
That makes us family.

394
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,264
I don't want to publish
those nasty photos.

395
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,917
That's why I intercepted the negatives
so I could give them back to you,

396
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,605
because that's what family does.
They look out for each other, right?

397
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,245
Okay.

398
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:18,949
So, I do something to look out for you,

399
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,347
give you the negatives,
and you do something for me.

400
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,552
We're looking into the disappearance
of Aundre G.

401
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,889
I know you hang out
with his pals and his manager.

402
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,526
That's a pretty tight circle you're in.
I want that story.

403
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,162
I don't know.
I don't know anything about that.

404
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,501
Ugh, I don't want this to turn into
one of those ugly family fights

405
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,805
where you won't help me
and I won't help you and then...

406
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,353
that picture of you with
the dildo gets out.

407
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:52,784
Wouldn't be good for your image,

408
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:56,148
- let alone your marriage.
- I can't talk about Aundre G.

409
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,384
I can give you
anything else.

410
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,857
How about an exclusive on how
you like taking it up the ass?

411
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,793
Would that work?

412
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,999
Come on.
I always protect my sources.

413
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,636
Whatever you tell me, no one
will ever know it came from you.

414
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,738
I can't.

415
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,416
We go to press
in two days.

416
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,624
Look, I'm sorry I missed dinner,
but I have to work late.

417
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,349
I know I said I'd be there, Mom, but...


418
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,362
Look, I gotta go.
I'm gonna call you back.

419
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,897
Any leads on Connie Chris?

420
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,500
Trying.
Nothing solid yet.

421
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,448
You want a chance to crack it?

422
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,605
Yeah.
Yes.

423
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,744
This is a pager number. It's probably
Connie's dealer. Ask for Garbo.

424
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,416
- Great, thanks.
- Willa, don't page her from here.

425
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,620
I was just
canceling my dinner.

426
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,289
This dealer expects to see a young face.

427
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,092
That's why I picked you.
Don't make me regret it.

428
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,495
Uh, so, what do
they mean,

429
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,798
- time off?
- They want you to get better.

430
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,200
Come back when you're
up to doing the show.

431
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,102
I can do the goddamn
show, all right?

432
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,037
Well, they said they
couldn't use your stuff

433
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,107
from the last taping.
That you seemed

434
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,342
drugged.

435
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,242
Oh!

436
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,676
I told them that you were

437
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,211
still recovering from the accident.

438
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,313
She is still recovering
from the accident.

439
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,314
That's what i told them.

440
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,716
So they're firing me?

441
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,884
They can't fire you.

442
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,185
They can suspend your deal.

443
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,190
Look, you can come back
when you're ready.

444
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,659
The door is open.

445
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,927
This is a chance for you

446
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,096
to take the time you need to get well.

447
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,098
I'm fine, okay?

448
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,367
I'm fine.

449
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,136
Oh, God.

450
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,938
Goddamn it,

451
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,106
are they recasting me?

452
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,275
No!

453
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,457
God, no.

454
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,377
They're... They're talking to
Brittany Murphy

455
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,546
about coming to play your
sister for a few episodes.

456
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,815
Jesus Christ, they are totally
replacing me.

457
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,585
It's just for a few episodes.

458
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,520
And then if it works,

459
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,590
you come back.
Maybe she stays.

460
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,725
It could be a bump for the show.

461
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,928
Okay, just leave.

462
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,328
All right?

463
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,097
Go. You can both go.

464
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,791
Hey, I'm going to the lab.

465
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,459
Swipe card.

466
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,526
Oh, yeah.

467
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,596
I left it in the, uh...

468
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,398
Gotta get these to the lab.

469
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,701
I can call down,
have someone come get them.

470
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,545
Nitrous,

471
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,814
white lightning.
Amyl-snaps?

472
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,557
Are you into natural shit?

473
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,084
I've got a patch of San Pedro cactus
right out of the ovens.

474
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,953
Serious sacred
Native American stuff.

475
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,256
Um, yeah, sure.

476
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,893
- My boyfriend and I actually wanted to
- Shit.

477
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,027
No, no, boys aren't
into natural highs.

478
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,263
You wanna impress him,
go for some Tepanil

479
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,199
or maybe a little Dover's
to even him out.

480
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,303
Uh, we actually wanted to throw
a party for Connie

481
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,905
- when she gets out.
- Connie?

482
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:41,773
Chris?

483
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,309
I told you on the phone,

484
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,279
- we're good friends.
- Really?

485
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,417
I just figured you were a narc. I was
gonna have to kill you before you left.

486
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,089
You brought cash?

487
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,126
- Yeah. About $1900, right?
- Yep.

488
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,201
You gotta try this.

489
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,503
On the house.

490
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,471
I, uh--

491
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,374
Seriously, I need to know
you're not a narc.

492
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,677
Plus, this shit will totally
open your mind.

493
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,378
Come on, just to get you going,

494
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,579
and this,

495
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,481
to keep it coming in waves, all night.

496
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,752
Come on, it'll change your life.

497
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,791
Mm, yeah.

498
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,193
It's like coming, isn't it?

499
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,228
Here.

500
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,010
You're really friends
with Connie Chris?

501
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:54,813
Yeah.

502
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,016
<i>Give her a message for me.</i>

503
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,218
Yeah.

504
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,989
<i>You tell her there is
a dealer in Hollywood...</i>

505
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,126
who think she's
searing hot sexy.

506
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,575
Oh, no, she's fine.

507
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,110
She's sleeping.

508
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,345
<i>Good, good.
And you ?</i>

509
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,614
<i>Teddy Jick loved you, you know.</i>

510
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,849
That's cool.

511
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,183
I know you've been with
Andy forever, but

512
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,185
your career is at a critical place.

513
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,388
Shh!

514
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,090
I'd be honored to work with you, Holt.

515
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,061
Sign with me. <i>I promise
you'd be priority one,</i>

516
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,097
<i>and I'd be on guys
like Jick 24/7 for ya.</i>

517
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,434
I appreciate that, Quinn.

518
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,074
But I won't sign
with you on a promise.

519
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,209
I'll only sign on a deal.

520
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,246
I'll get you a deal.

521
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,816
A big, rich, action picture deal.

522
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,154
<i>You and I are gonna do
really well together, okay?</i>

523
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,655
I look forward to it.

524
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,205
Hey.

525
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,574
I'm gonna go out for a run.

526
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,848
<i>I grew up in a Ohio, that's always
gonna be home for me, but</i>

527
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,445
<i>whenever I'm shooting out here in L.A.,

528
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,586
<i>Justine and the kids, they have
to be here with me.</i>

529
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,522
<i>Are you sure? Because if you
ever need a place to stay...</i>

530
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,803
<i>I'm not sure Justine
would approve of that.</i>

531
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,259
But seriously, you're this
big Hollywood star.

532
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,963
You've got three box-office smashes.
You are...

533
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,997
Two time sexiest
man alive, I think?

534
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,099
Yeah, four years ago.

535
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,867
Oh, but--
You still have my vote.

536
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,669
How do you keep the family together

537
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,904
despite the pressures
of a big Hollywood career?

538
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,539
It is all about
family, isn't it?

539
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,110
<i>Oh, I wish more people
felt the same way you do.</i>

540
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,014
$500, cash.

541
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,787
And all I have to do
is tell you where she is?

542
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,288
Mm-hmm.

543
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,761
They got her in post-op ICU.

544
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,595
Third floor.
How do I get in there?

545
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,830
Oh, nobody gets
into post-op ICU.

546
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,533
Unless you're part of the team.

547
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,336
Patients can't even have
family visitors.

548
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,937
That's why they put her there.

549
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,206
To keep her away from guys like you.

550
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,117
<i>Why do you need Connie Chris?</i>

551
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,261
<i>Just take more pictures of me.</i>

552
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,231
<i>Aren't I beautiful enough?</i>

553
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,033
Oh, you are.

554
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,403
I just--I can't
talk right now.

555
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,172
C'mon, sweetheart.

556
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,274
C'mon.

557
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,609
It's just not alway the right time.

558
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,446
It's just not
the right thing to do.

559
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,748
It's not appropriate
for us to talk.

560
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,051
It's not you.

561
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,405
McPherson,
what have you got?

562
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,272
Huh?

563
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,974
Connie Chris?
Anything?

564
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,043
Um...

565
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,679
- Not yet, no.
- Nothing from the dealer?

566
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,648
Wouldn't admit to knowing her.

567
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,117
Of course she wouldn't.

568
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,387
Do you know why
I gave you that tip?

569
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,390
Do you know why?
Can you tell me why?

570
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,327
Because I have
a young face?

571
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,361
Because you spoke up.

572
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,163
In a room full of people
playing it safe,

573
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,233
you had an idea
and you spoke up.

574
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,469
And I thought maybe
this girl's got the balls for the job.

575
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,003
But I was obviously wrong,

576
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,740
because I gave you the goddamn tip
and you came back with dick.

577
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,076
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

578
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,511
Sorry won't keep
the sharks away.

579
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,994
Hi, it's Lucy Spiller.

580
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,630
I'm about to close on your cover.

581
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,531
You ready to talk?

582
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,669
Okay, we can
meet at my house.

583
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,802
It's private.

584
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,006
You can't run those photos.

585
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,940
My wife, my kids--

586
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,543
I wish I had other options.
I really do.

587
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,344
But I'm looking at
a deadline here,

588
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,813
so unless you tell me
what happened to Aundre G,

589
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,216
you leave me no choice.

590
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,223
Don't make me run
your picture on the cover.

591
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,158
It's beneath both of us.

592
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,625
If I tell you,

593
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,094
they kill me.

594
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,432
I'm not shitting you.

595
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,269
If they knew I was here right now,
they'd kill both of us.

596
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,705
I'm willing
to take the risk.

597
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,776
No one will ever know
where I got this information.

598
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,044
So I tell you what I know,

599
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,046
and you promise never
to run those photos?

600
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,748
I'd give you the negatives.

601
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,490
Aundre G is dead.

602
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,561
They killed him.

603
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,165
His manager,

604
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,466
Tweety McDaniel,

605
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,734
we all hang out.

606
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,170
There's a group of us.

607
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,739
- Poker buddies, right?
- Yeah, pretty much.

608
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,677
So one day Aundre G
just stops coming.

609
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,347
Stories get out he's missing,

610
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,850
got into gang stuff.
You know, nobody knows.

611
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,286
Couple of months later,

612
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,421
another one
of Tweety's clients,

613
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,458
he makes a joke.

614
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,595
Says he's getting better
offers from other labels.

615
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,566
Tweety just goes cold.

616
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,005
Says, Aundre G tried
to leave him, too.

617
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,609
Asks if we want
to visit Aundre.

618
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,312
"A little lesson in loyalty",
he called it.

619
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,647
Visit him?

620
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,350
Tweety had his head, okay?

621
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,254
In a jar.

622
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,924
he said,
"See? Nobody leaves me".

623
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,427
"I got him right here,"

624
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,096
"and he's still
making money for me".

625
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,177
Holt?

626
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,817
Shit!

627
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,206
Okay, come on.

628
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,008
Come on, Holt.

629
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,244
Shit!

630
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,082
Okay.

631
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

632
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,796
Long time, I know.

633
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,467
Yeah.

634
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,370
You seem a little
bit clammy.

635
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,538
Oh.

636
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,275
Since when is Julia Mallory
back doing her own drug runs?

637
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,011
Since her boyfriend
totally flaked on her.

638
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,616
Can I come in?

639
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,184
Always.

640
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,961
There's no way we're running this.
Are you out of your mind?

641
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,230
I sourced it myself.

642
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,432
Nothing sells better than death.

643
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,266
We're gonna get our 1.1 and then some.

644
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,068
Lucy, there is no world

645
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,605
in which Legal is going
to approve this story.

646
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:44,074
The minute this rolls off the press,
the DA's gonna demand your source.

647
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,310
You don't give it to them, they're gonna
get a judge to hold you in contempt,

648
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,546
take you to jail.

649
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,914
I'll run the magazine from jail.

650
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,181
Great publicity.

651
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,016
Yes, and what happens when this...

652
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,352
manager, Tweety McBlack guy

653
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,854
sues us for liable because
we just accused him of murder?

654
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:58,622
He's guilty.

655
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,392
Do you really think he's gonna
rush into court for this one?

656
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,428
30%.

657
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,266
Gibson's interest in
Prince Tyrese's team.

658
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,232
30%.

659
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:09,867
And?

660
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,304
And there are security cameras
in the parking garage.

661
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,805
I saw the tape.

662
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,608
You and Prince Tyrese. I mean,
what else would he be doing there?

663
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,311
Renewing his subscription?

664
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,016
God.

665
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,386
Look, if he wants
to come forward,

666
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,820
be sourced, that's fine.
That's great.

667
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,291
Run the story. If not,
you gotta get a different cover.

668
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,561
I've less than a day to go to press.

669
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,770
Good luck.

670
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,811
Don, listen to me.

671
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,747
I need that Connie Chris story.

672
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,918
It's 8:30 in the morning on
closing day, and I have nothing.

673
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,787
Do you understand?

674
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,689
I would give my left nut
for those photos, Don.

675
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,991
Okay? I swear to God.

676
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,227
Get them for me, will you?

677
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,928
Okay?

678
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,501
Second floor.

679
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,437
Third floor.

680
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,705
East wing.

681
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,640
Post-op ICU.

682
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,042
<i>Mylar.</i>

683
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,248
<i>They put Mylar on the windows
of post-op ICU, Don.</i>

684
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,551
<i>You're not gonna get
the picture from here.</i>

685
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,426
<i>Thank you.</i>

686
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,099
<i>They're really protecting
that girl, huh?</i>

687
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,607
<i>If only somebody had
protected me that way.</i>

688
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,977
<i>You have me.</i>

689
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,681
<i>You don't need
her too, do you?</i>

690
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,950
I promised Lucy I'd get this shot.

691
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,451
<i>Damn Lucy.</i>

692
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,554
<i>It always comes down
to what Lucy wants.</i>

693
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,224
<i>You know, I think</i>

694
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,295
<i>that you're just gonna have to make
a choice between Lucy and I.</i>

695
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,130
Oh, no,

696
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,765
don't make me do that.

697
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,200
<i>The choice is already made, baby.</i>

698
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,603
<i>You can't get the shot.</i>

699
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,003
Good thing we're at the hospital, huh?

700
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,107
I'm gonna need
some surgery.

701
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:03,734
Hey...

702
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,938
What's wrong?
What happened?

703
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,743
I cut off my finger.

704
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,848
I set myself on fire free-basing.

705
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,650
Shit.

706
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,621
I just can't take it anymore,

707
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,457
being God's perfect little child.

708
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,659
I can't take it.

709
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,829
I'm so ugly now, aren't I?

710
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,963
I'm so ugly.

711
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,833
No, you're beautiful.

712
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,969
You're perfect.

713
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,145
I'm sorry.

714
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,947
You are crazy!

715
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,981
Out of your mind insane!

716
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,551
And don't blame this on the
schizophrenia, I know the diff--

717
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,953
Oh, my God, Don!

718
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,390
- These are fantastic.
- Thank you.

719
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,862
Wow, hell of a "say no
to free-basing" poster.

720
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,966
Tell me she told you what drugs she was
using when she set herself on fire.

721
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,236
Heroin and epinephrine.
She said it was like touching God.

722
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,205
She actually said that?

723
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,341
I think I just came a little.

724
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,545
Oh, my God, Don.
You're a genius!

725
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,048
This is the one.

726
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,249
Oh, wow.

727
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,018
That's it.
That's the cover.

728
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,887
<i>Connie Crisp.</i>

729
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,656
I got it in before the close. See?

730
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,191
You said you'd give your
left nut for this photo.

731
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,361
Pinkie was as far as I was gonna go.

732
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,397
We'll cover medical expenses.

733
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,233
Don,

734
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,035
you really saved my neck on this one.

735
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,470
That's good.

736
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:47,805
Thank you.

737
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,243
Solid cover.

738
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,311
See, I knew if I pushed
your buttons just right,

739
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,713
you could pull it out of your ass.

740
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,781
You don't get to talk about my ass.

741
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,250
It's a compliment.

742
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,752
Good first issue.

743
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,189
Nice ass, too.

744
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,959
This is our cover.

745
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,627
The wall is locked.

746
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,497
I want make-readies in
my office in three hours.

747
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,235
Yeah, it looks like home.

748
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:22,940
I spent a lot of time with the pictures
you gave me of the farm you grew up on.

749
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,441
I like it.

750
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,710
Yeah, that really brings me back.

751
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,746
Thank you. Means a lot.

752
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:33,717
Thank you. You have done an amazing
job, Leo. I really appreciate it.

753
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,754
Look, um,

754
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,957
- I have a personal thing to ask.
- Sure.

755
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,126
It's awkward and I don't know
if I should bring it up at all.

756
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,362
So if I'm out of line, I totally
understand, and you can forget

757
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,932
- I ever said anything.
- Leo.

758
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,134
Relax.

759
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,638
I've been thinking the same thing.

760
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,020
Ever since I met you...

761
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,957
I've been thinking the same thing.

762
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,693
Don't be mad, baby.

763
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,164
I mean, I came home to you, didn't I?

764
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,935
- I came home to you.
- <i>Missed you.</i>

765
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,572
<i>Here.</i>

766
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,343
<i>Poor baby.</i>

767
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,014
<i>Come here.</i>

768
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,425
It's too bright in here, baby.

769
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:58,429
Come sleep.

770
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,496
- Where is it?
- Where's the what?

771
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:06,996
Don't mess with me, Frankie.

772
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:10,099
This is a P&W newsstand.
We pay for tier one placement.

773
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,635
Where the hell is Dirt Now?

774
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,104
I dunno, maybe the placement's too good.

775
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,940
I sold out.

776
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,610
What?

777
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,981
But don't worry, I did save
you one copy.

778
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,424
Don't you, ever, ever save one for me.
Do you hear me?

779
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:37,293
You sell them all.
You always sell them all.

780
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,762
Look, keep it.

781
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,832
I'll buy it, and it won't go
against your cover sales.
