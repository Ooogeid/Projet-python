00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:01,921
<i>Previously, on </i>Dirt...

2
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:04,119
How are you feeling today, Don?

3
00:00:04,582 --> 00:00:06,384
- Weird.
- Weird how?

4
00:00:06,544 --> 00:00:09,054
Because I'm starting to feel normal.

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,765
Well, we'll keep an eye
on those feelings of normalcy.

6
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,107
Hey, Brent.

7
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:16,227
- Spiller! You're...
- Alive.

8
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,502
- Are you back for good?
- Looks like it.

9
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:22,981
You can't run those photos.

10
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:25,665
I wish I had other options.
I really do.

11
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:27,533
But I'm looking at a deadline here,

12
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,741
so unless you tell me
what happened to Aundray G,

13
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,117
you leave me no choice.

14
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:33,244
Tweetie had his head, okay?

15
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:35,038
In a jar.

16
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:38,583
Look at my boy.

17
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,395
Aundray G.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,074
Y'all don't mind if he sits in a hand,
do you?

19
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:45,006
Tweetie loves church.

20
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,445
As you all know, I recently spent
some time at St. Edmunds

21
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,808
after a rebuttal to one of my articles.

22
00:00:55,611 --> 00:00:57,033
It is an incredible institution,

23
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:59,270
which I'm sure so many of you
have counted on.

24
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,026
So, Hollywood, please,

25
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:03,727
not that Botox
and call girls aren't important,

26
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:06,653
but if you could take half the money
that you spend on that

27
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:10,101
and leave it here tonight,
we could build this wing in a week.

28
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,524
Thank you so much.

29
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:17,595
There are some malnourished twins
that seem to have rented

30
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:19,291
a permanent stall in the ladies room.

31
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,146
- Coke or vomit?
- Dealer's choice.

32
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:22,940
Oh, I love options.
Knock on the stall,

33
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,226
see if you can borrow a cup of blow.
Take a shooter.

34
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,862
How are you? Good to see you.

35
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:32,285
Farber. Ease up on the Old Spice before
you burn a hole in the ozone layer.

36
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:35,457
W... I'm not sure, but I think an A-list
heterosexual actor

37
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:37,536
just asked me if I'd like to go camping.

38
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,473
Ooh, somebody's about to go Brokeback.

39
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:42,086
I'm sure that's what my parents
took out a second mortgage for

40
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:45,286
- to get me through J-school.
- Oh, come on. Be a team player.

41
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:48,486
- There's no "I" in blow job.
- "I" in... What?

42
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:51,001
- Look at you.
- Hi.

43
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,786
Great night for the hospital, Lucy.

44
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,254
You remember our son, Craig.

45
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:58,121
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- Oh, of course. Hello.

46
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:00,373
Well, you look wonderful.

47
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,001
- Thanks for showing up, Cassie.
- Oh, why wouldn't I?

48
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:05,070
I've weathered much bigger storms

49
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,255
than your magazine's
attempt to discredit me.

50
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:10,482
You did give a hand-job to your
campaign manager in a parking lot.

51
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:12,968
An egregious error in judgment, I admit.

52
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,264
But you'll be happy to know
that we are in counseling

53
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,169
and we have recommitted to the marriage.

54
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:20,127
You know, Lucy, a marriage
is not judged by the actions

55
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:22,343
that one takes in the good times,

56
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:25,232
but rather how you step up
during the moments of crisis.

57
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,192
I already heard that speech on E.T.

58
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,573
Well, regardless,

59
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:32,941
I'm willing to have Dirt
come do a little photo-op

60
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:34,908
of the family
around the breakfast table.

61
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,235
That would be riveting for my readers.

62
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:41,352
Before I left acting, you would
have kissed my ass in Macy's window

63
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:43,249
to get an interview with me
inside my home.

64
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:46,252
Now you're running for Senate,
and Dirt doesn't back politicians.

65
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:50,079
- You have my number.
- I sure do.

66
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,312
Such a shame about Julia Mallory.

67
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:53,593
I always liked her.

68
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,259
Get close to their son, Craig.

69
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,088
Get a read on the happy couple.

70
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,790
Husband looks like he's got a bomb
strapped to his chest.

71
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,233
All right, I'll ice up a nipple
and start chatting.

72
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,042
He may not want to talk,
but I think his 18-year-old hormones

73
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:10,685
might want to meet me for coffee.

74
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,311
Somebody's growing up.

75
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:14,416
Hey, Lucy.

76
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:17,534
Hi, Prince.

77
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,270
Hey, Craig. I'm Willa.

78
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,614
I just, um, heard your father

79
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:27,482
telling someone
what a gifted athlete you are.

80
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:29,796
Actually, my true gift lies
in the oral arts.

81
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,648
Wow, that's smooth.
You should write for Hallmark.

82
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,311
Not to worry. I don't do reporters.

83
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:40,443
I hope everyone at your magazine
gets cancer and dies.

84
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:41,607
Ciao.

85
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:47,389
Got another surgery on...
Next month, coming up.

86
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,538
There's not a day that goes by
I'm not in pain

87
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:52,011
but, you know,
what birth isn't painful, right?

88
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,788
I never meant for that to happen.

89
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:55,546
It's not the way I do business.

90
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,198
I'm truly sorry.

91
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,310
Between the drugs, the women,
and all the other people

92
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,744
I chose to hang out with,

93
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:04,622
it was just a matter of time before
I lost everything I really cared about.

94
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,971
Tweetie did me a favor.

95
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:10,804
Wow. It's amazing
how you can feel that way.

96
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:14,151
Doors and windows
open and shut all the time.

97
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:16,459
You of all people
should know that, Lucy.

98
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,344
Yeah, I try to keep mine locked.

99
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:21,623
Bad things didn't happen to you and I
because we're bad.

100
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:25,171
It happened because we weren't
paying attention to what's important.

101
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,831
Is that why the book?

102
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:29,793
Everyone was talking about my loss
of a basketball career

103
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:32,485
like it was a loss of my God-given gift.

104
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:35,194
People in my life are my God-given gift.

105
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,828
This book is my making amends.

106
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,458
I'll send you a copy.

107
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:41,367
Prince.

108
00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:42,759
Is that you?

109
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,356
Hi, Boots.

110
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,019
What's up?

111
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:48,224
Oh, man.

112
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,251
Well, you gotta give that nigga his due.

113
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:53,085
When he does something,
he does it all the way.

114
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:59,093
She's Tweetie's property.

115
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:01,721
And the one constant with people
who associate with Tweetie

116
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,800
is one day, it'll be their turn.

117
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,563
- Take care, Lucy.
- You, too.

Season 2 Episode 3
<i>God Bless the Child</i>

122
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,182
So, the obvious conclusion is
that he got her pregnant

123
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:35,922
while they were away in Africa filming.

124
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:39,751
Meanwhile, his wife,
seven months pregnant with their third,

125
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,178
sat back in Ojai,
gaining weight like it was a contest.

126
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:43,996
It's nicely played, but it's not him.

127
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:46,070
He had a vasectomy
two weeks before the shoot.

128
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,753
Yeah, but how do we know that?

129
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,978
Because his urologist doesn't pay
his secretary enough.

130
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,815
All right, guys.
What do we know about Tweetie McDaniel?

131
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:56,317
He's violent
and he chopped off Aundray G's head.

132
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,860
Thanks, scoop!

133
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,628
All right, looks like Alan's gonna be
in charge of all things obvious.

134
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:05,118
- Um, Naomi.
- Um, Lil'Boots is his biggest client.

135
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,720
She was at the fundraiser last night.

136
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,270
She's gone platinum twice
since her move from hip-hop to R&B,

137
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,692
and she has an incredible voice.

138
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:13,857
Did you know that "Naomi"
spelled backwards is "I moan"?

139
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:17,255
Did you know I'm a brown belt and
can kick your nuts up into your throat

140
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,548
so deep you'll be able
to wash them when you gargle?

141
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,050
Do you know you're immature?

142
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,885
We do know that.

143
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:25,716
Why don't you two see
what you can dig up on Tweetie?

144
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,914
It's kind of a non-story.
I mean, why now?

145
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,516
Because I like screwing with him.

146
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,812
You don't call people back?

147
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:35,816
My cell's kinda
not been working very well.

148
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:39,576
Think it has anything to do with it
being a six-year-old piece of shit?

149
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:43,186
I want you to do some snooping around
our would-be Senator's house.

150
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:44,441
Do some surveillance.

151
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,615
What, the Hopes? What's the story?

152
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:49,179
Cassie Hope is addicted to drama.
It's her norm.

153
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,985
She can't function without it.

154
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:54,382
So, you want me to sit out
front of the Hopes' house

155
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:55,918
and just kind of wait?

156
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,755
Sure there's not a,
you know, flower show

157
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:00,755
or panda birth I could attend instead?

158
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,379
Looks like somebody
had their irony shots today.

159
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,499
Come on,
that Craig kid's a loose cannon.

160
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,034
Probably knows all that shit
we wrote about his mom is true.

161
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:10,639
- Just give it 24 hours.
- Okay.

162
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,643
Can I take my photograph now?

163
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:14,182
Oh, Don.

164
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:17,054
All right.

165
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:20,443
Oh, that's a lot lighter
than the last time.

166
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,890
All right.

167
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:29,160
That's quite a scrapbook you got
going on there, Donnie.

168
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,887
Mr. Barrow.

169
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:34,247
So what's this I hear about you
snooping around Tweetie McDaniel?

170
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,576
You really wanna know?

171
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:38,307
I know how hard it is for you
to keep a secret.

172
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,672
Maybe you should have used that tongue
when Julia Mallory attacked you.

173
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:43,877
Oh my God,
you could have hacked her to pieces.

174
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,980
- Well, this is fun.
- So, is this your way of punishing me

175
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,643
for screwing up the magazine
when you were in the hospital?

176
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:52,803
Humiliating me by pushing me
to the periphery? I mean...

177
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,486
- I did the best I could.
- I know you did,

178
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:58,815
and that's the problem.
You really did do the best you could.

179
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:00,833
Nicely done.

180
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,596
Look, Brent,
what do you want me to say?

181
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,272
- It doesn't matter.
- No. What you're saying is

182
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:11,119
- "I don't matter".
- Yeah, but in a much nicer way.

183
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,440
Come on.
We've already had this discussion.

184
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:33,391
Right here in front of the neighbors.

185
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:36,561
It doesn't matter, Mom.
You've done it a million times.

186
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:38,688
Nice.

187
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,986
Lucy, I will never doubt you again.

188
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:47,238
Why do you always get to do
what you want to do?

189
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:51,701
You're ridiculous, Mom.

190
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,686
I love you, Mom!

191
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:55,204
Great!

192
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:56,998
Later, Mom!

193
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:58,916
Bye, Mom!

194
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,562
Hey! Hold up a second there, kid.

195
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:11,512
You okay?

196
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:14,356
Who the hell are you?

197
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,669
I'm a photographer...

198
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:19,880
for a magazine.

199
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:23,315
The lady I work for,

200
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:25,735
she'd be really interested
in what you have to say.

201
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:33,915
It's what I do.

202
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,294
Hey, she does that all the time, man.

203
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,431
I don't even have to...

204
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,467
do anything anymore.

205
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,490
You want a...
You want a real story?

206
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:53,512
Sure.

207
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,313
Oof. I gotta eat here more often.

208
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,107
We thought you'd like the salad.

209
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:06,943
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

210
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:08,889
It was a joke.

211
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:11,467
Salad's green, money's green, and...

212
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,950
Ho with an axe to grind.

213
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,910
Is she willing to talk?

214
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,162
I don't know. Call her and ask.

215
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:23,289
I want six orders
of the chicken piccata to go,

216
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:26,273
no skimping on the capers.
Please don't drown it in lemon.

217
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:29,257
And, uh, put it
on Barbie and Dane Cook's tab.

218
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,745
<i>Are you disappointed your bid
for cable giant Andromeda Entertainment</i>

219
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:37,004
<i>was rejected?</i>

220
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:39,891
<i>And do you think it has anything to do
with your unconventional lifestyle?</i>

221
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:42,645
<i>I like women.
I like going to parties.</i>

222
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:47,089
<i>The women in my life walk in through
the front door and leave the same way.</i>

223
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,660
<i>I inherited $50 million when I was 20.</i>

224
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:55,888
<i>In 14 years, I have turned it
into two and a half billion.</i>

225
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:57,952
<i>That is the true fruit of my labor.</i>

226
00:10:58,475 --> 00:10:59,535
<i>The deal</i>

227
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:02,683
<i>fell through because they would like
to keep ownership domestic... simple.</i>

228
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:03,907
<i>Thank you.</i>

229
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,466
They have separate bedrooms.

230
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,067
They haven't slept together in years.
It's all bullshit.

231
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:14,014
Well, I'd like to see that.

232
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,137
- I have something better.
- Yeah?

233
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:18,014
Yep.

234
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:20,048
I think...

235
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:23,018
you're gonna want to see
their wine cellar.

236
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,193
Go ahead.

237
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:41,290
This is a sex dungeon.

238
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:47,224
It's so secret, they don't even know
that I know it's here.

239
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:51,294
Yeah.
When I was six, I heard them down here.

240
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,839
And they thought I was asleep.

241
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,051
Scared the shit out of me.

242
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:57,386
I bet.

243
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,843
They never saw me.

244
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:09,899
This is gonna be an incredible story.

245
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:14,698
Yeah...

246
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,320
but you'll never tell it.

247
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:45,240
You let me out of this, you freak!

248
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,299
What do you want?

249
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:56,404
What do I want? What do I want?

250
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,488
Man.

251
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,848
If I could answer that question...
question...

252
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:09,208
You know, I guess it would be

253
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,169
what we all want, really. You know?

254
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:15,451
Peace on earth, good will towards men.

255
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:16,609
Yes!

256
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,339
No, don't, don't!

257
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:24,487
You shouldn't be upset.

258
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:27,122
It's what I do.

259
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,510
How old were you when Tweetie raped you?

260
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,245
Seventeen,

261
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:40,948
the first time.

262
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,199
What was your relationship like
before that?

263
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:44,401
Relationship?

264
00:13:45,478 --> 00:13:47,621
People don't have relationships
with Tweetie.

265
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:49,959
Just because a dog wags its tail
from time to time

266
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,290
doesn't mean that it won't tear
your throat out, given half the chance.

267
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,575
Were you ever sexual with him
prior to the rape?

268
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:59,143
Everybody who gets into business
with Tweetie gets that way with him.

269
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,571
No matter.

270
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:01,766
Women...

271
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,109
and men.

272
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:04,888
Was it ever consensual?

273
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:08,201
About as consensual as sex
after a beating-down can be.

274
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,514
He did what he did 17 years ago,

275
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,696
and I got my baby girl Alisha
to prove it.

276
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,764
And why are you willing
to come forward now?

277
00:14:14,884 --> 00:14:17,417
You print
that I'm thinking about suing him,

278
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,420
- he'll settle.
- Meaning?

279
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,242
He's got a whole lot more to lose now.

280
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:23,102
Yeah, but a rape 17 years after the fact

281
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:27,040
and back child support aren't exactly
what's needed to bring him to his knees.

282
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,686
Sweetheart, ain't nothing gonna bring
Tweetie McDaniel to his knees.

283
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:32,485
That's your fight.

284
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,685
Right now, I'd be willing to settle
for just a little justice.

285
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:47,190
- What do you want?
- Uh, hi.

286
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,707
I'm Brent Barrow.

287
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,603
Publisher, DirtNow magazine.

288
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,775
I spoke to your lawyer.
He said to come on by.

289
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,950
Adam Proteau?

290
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,070
None other.

291
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,824
Who's this loser?

292
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:12,510
Don't be hurt.

293
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,881
They think Jon Favreau
is going to stop by.

294
00:15:28,363 --> 00:15:29,136
Come.

295
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,862
If I don't sterilize these burns
with vinegar,

296
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:47,457
infection could set in,
and what kind of host would I be

297
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:49,076
if I were to let that happen?

298
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,249
What in God's na...
What is going on...

299
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,791
Who is he?

300
00:15:56,952 --> 00:15:58,059
Please!

301
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,963
Please, your son invited me in.

302
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:02,964
- And then he knocked me out.
- Craig?

303
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,333
He's a liar!

304
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:06,343
- He's a paparazzi, Mom. Hit him.
- Oh, God.

305
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,469
Hit him!

306
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:10,888
How the hell do you explain
how I got in here?

307
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:14,268
I mean, look. Look at my chest,

308
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:16,707
look at my shoulders,
look at my back.

309
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:19,770
Your son invited me in here,

310
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,911
and then he hit me
over the back of the head,

311
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:26,780
- Mom...
- and when I wake up, I'm in this thing.

312
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:29,333
Mom! Mom. He's lying to you, okay?

313
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:31,515
- He was snooping around, all right?
- No, no, no.

314
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:33,459
- No! No! No!
- He saw you...

315
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:37,875
I'm sorry, Mom!

316
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,396
All right? I'm sorry!

317
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:41,047
I did this for you!

318
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:43,646
All right?
He wanted me to talk about you,

319
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:46,427
to lie about you, and try to ruin you.

320
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,345
I was trying to protect you, Mama.

321
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:54,516
- Mom, I was trying to protect you.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

322
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,396
Baby, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

323
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:08,238
No. Maybe later.

324
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:17,969
- Is there something wrong?
- No, no, no. Not at all.

325
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,125
I... I was, um...

326
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:26,215
- I wanna talk to you about Dirt...
- Let me see your penis.

327
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:31,563
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

328
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:36,337
Great. You're a psycho.

329
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:38,210
Okay. Well...

330
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,722
thanks for, you know, everything.

331
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:45,428
You are Brent Barrow,
the publisher of DirtNowmagazine.

332

Average newsstand first

Total ad pages during that time period,
385.

335
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:58,697
Your total circulation at the time
of your editor's stabbing

336
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:03,794
was 1,486,360.

00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:09,001
Your ad sales currently are up

And Gibson Horne, your owner,

341
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:22,777
has been quietly entertaining offers
for your magazine

342
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:26,066
ever since your editor's
unfortunate occurrence.

343
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,692
Is that right?

344
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:32,714
And you're here to convince me
to buy your magazine.

345
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,825
But I must know:

346
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,849
What's in it for Brent Barrow?

347
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,372
May I?

348
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,498
Yeah.

349
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:43,996
But first...

350
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:48,964
Really?

351
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:02,811
Nice.

352
00:19:04,432 --> 00:19:05,731
Small men,

353
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,524
they are angry, not to be trusted.

354
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:10,882
I'm six and three-quarters when erect.

355
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:13,913
Average penis size worldwide
is five and one-quarter.

356
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:18,076
You've beaten me in length,
but I have defeated you in width.

357
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:26,214
I think he's thicker also.

358
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:31,763
Shut up pig! He looks thicker
because his balls are lacking!

359
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:36,720
Let's talk business.

360
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,923
- I'll call you back.
- Uh, hey, Lucy.

361
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:42,235
There's a Tweetie McDaniels
here to see...

362
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,086
There they are.

363
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:46,631
Alex, wait outside.

364
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:50,054
Know what I like about Russians?

365
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:52,033
They're always in a good mood.

366
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:54,592
What do you want?

367
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:58,026
- Mind if I take a seat?
- Oh, you won't be here that long.

368
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,647
Photos of you don't do you justice.

369
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,589
You are a very beautiful woman.

370
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:03,747
That and busy.

371
00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:06,542
I'm with you on that, baby.
There're just so many hours, right?

372
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:08,910
I don't think you got any idea

373
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,882
what a dangerous neighborhood
you inhabit.

374
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,298
Yeah, I'm thinking of getting a dog.

375
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:15,676
I like you. Know that? I really do.

376
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:18,794
I pray to God that what happened
to that poor, unfortunate woman

377
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:20,597
who left your offices earlier today

378
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:23,621
- doesn't happen to you.
- What did you do to her?

379
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:25,510
What's her name again?

380
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,646
Sherri, right?
Yeah, that's it, Sherri.

381
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,774
Seems after Sherri left your offices,

382
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,441
some thugs... ruthless animals,

383
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,276
not like you and me...

384
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:35,208
with no regard for the sanctity of life,

385
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:36,779
beat her like a bad dog.

386
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,031
Is she alive?

387
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:40,830
That's up to you.

388
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:45,919
First Prince, now Sherri.

389
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,908
I'm beginning to think you're bad luck.

390
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:48,959
I'm beginning to think you're bad luck.

391
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:54,947
Yeah, I got him... I
got him right here, Gib.

392
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,797
No, he's sitting right across from me.

393
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:01,958
Magazine and radio.

394
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,204
Yeah. Yeah, here, here. Here he is.

395
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:12,595
Um, excuse me. Would you...

396
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:22,929
Gibson. Long time no see.

397
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,812
- Try not to touch me, okay?
- Okay.

398
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,544
How long have you
known about this place?

399
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:40,029
Since I was six. Oh...

400
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:42,524
Craig.

401
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:49,223
I need you to go upstairs

402
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:51,481
to call Dale and tell him
that you're not feeling well

403
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:55,637
- and that he does not need to pick you
up for lacrosse practice. - Okay, mama.

404
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:04,878
- What do we do?
- Let me go.

405
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,285
I won't say a word. I promise.

406
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:12,506
Oh, yes. A promise from a pap.

407
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:14,894
That's worth its weight in dog shit.

408
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,993
Where have I seen you before?

409
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,719
Who gives a rat's ass where you saw him?
Could be anywhere. They're like flies.

410
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,752
I can't do this.

411
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:26,086
What are you suggesting that we do,
just turn him in? Oh, please

412
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:28,657
Turn in your own flesh and blood.
Is that what you're saying?

413
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:31,603
I love my son every bit as much as you,
so don't get all self-righteous.

414
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:35,967
Call the police. Tell them,
you know, you caught me trespassing.

415
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:38,212
Tell them you were scared.

416
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:41,472
You have every right to
beat me unconscious and tie me up.

417
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,858
Just don't press charges
and everybody's okay, okay?

418
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:50,242
Yes, great. We're just going to walk the
police down to our private S&M dungeon

419
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:51,979
and let them escort you out of here.

420
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,970
My political career, it's
gonna be over before it even starts.

421
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,618
Maybe you shouldn't think
about your career and focus instead

422
00:22:57,738 --> 00:23:01,047
- on what's best for our son.
- My career is what's best for our son.

423
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,801
A working mother,
a good home, the right college.

424
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:06,672
That is what's best for our son, and
that sure as shit is not gonna happen

425
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:09,243
on your lousy,
direct-to-video residuals.

426
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:11,440
You know our couch upstairs
produces more change

427
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,177
than this man's last
two flops combined?

428
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:16,367
Well, maybe if she kept her
dick in her pants and didn't get caugh

429
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:19,380
fondling her campaign manager's balls...
Are you kidding me?

430
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,749
Maybe if you'd get it up more
than twice a year, I...

431
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:24,330
That's not fair.
I'm diabetic and you know it!

432
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,611
Well, I'm sick!
You know? I'm hurt and I'm bleeding.

433
00:23:29,314 --> 00:23:31,992
I have a medical condition

434
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:37,626
which if left unattended,
I could have a seizure and die.

435
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,629
You don't want that on your hands.

436
00:23:39,976 --> 00:23:42,692
You're both textbook codependents.

437
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:47,537
Cassie, your narcissism
is on a Greek god level.

438
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:52,655
And Bill-- Bill,
you should start an enablers' workshop.

439
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:56,960
Please. Please let me go. I swear

440
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,373
you know, I'm harmless.

441
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:09,048
Lucy.

442
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:12,370
Lucy Spiller.

443
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:18,842
I knew I knew you from somewhere.

444
00:24:19,873 --> 00:24:22,792
This is my third message,
and it's a simple one, sweetie.

445
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:25,549
Get a new goddam cell phone.
Call me.

446
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:28,773
Hi. What did the police ask you?

447
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:31,551
Oh, not much. Seems dealing
with Tweetie is nothing new.

448
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:33,785
Seems he's not just
a thorn in your side.

449
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:36,867
What do you mean, my side?
This is aDirtstory.

450
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,171
Well, no offense, but no, it's not.

451
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:42,840
Our readers don't care
about Tweetie McDaniels.

452
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,690
They want to read about Lindsay Lohan's
latest implosion

453
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,737
or whose ass is getting
a beating from gravity.

454
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:52,643
- I just... I... It's reckless, Lucy. I
just think... - Willa, okay. I like you

455
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,211
not as much as these shoes...
but I don't care how you feel.

456
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:57,026
- Lucy? Excuse me.
- What?

457
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:00,724
You might want to take this. She
says it's Tweetie McDaniel's daughter.

458
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:05,664
Do you have children, Don?

459
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:07,425
No.

460
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:10,880
I have a little brother.

461
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:15,335
He's grown now.
It's hard always knowing what to do,

462
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:18,094
always feeling like you're failing them,
failing everyone.

463
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:20,164
Not this mantra.

464
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:25,017
Bill, you're depressed.

465
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:26,602
Have you talked to anyone?

466
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:30,224
Who hasn't he talked to?
I had the friggin'Dalai Lama over here.

467
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:34,274
I see a woman, Dr. Shalba.
She could help.

468
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:38,560
You suffer from depression?
I'm schizophrenic.

469
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:41,117
Depression sort of goes hand in hand.
Sure.

470
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:43,231
I... I got it pretty bad.

471
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:45,774
I tried to kill my friend. No.

472
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:49,750
I almost died myself,
wandering out in the desert.

473
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,927
But Dr. Shalba saved me.
Dr. Shalba and my friend.

474
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:57,052
You know who suffers from depression?
Me.

475
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:02,292
I tried everything I could think of
to help you, snap out of this disease.

476
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:06,399
Cass, this isn't about you.
Oh, yes it is. It is about all of us.

477
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:11,120
You think it's hard living with it,
you should try sleeping with it,

478
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,607
or talking with it, or having...

479
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,127
having any semblance
of a normal life with it.

480
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:18,920
Everything is buried under
this shroud of constant misery.

481
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,469
Are you blaming me for this? For Craig?

482
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:25,223
I'm just saying that your
being submissive down here

483
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:27,843
was fun way back when, but your being
submissive up there

484
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:30,424
and to this disease, it's killing us.

485
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:34,079
I love my son,
and I'd do anything not to harm him.

486
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,794
My little brother, the one who's
grown now,

487
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,224
I loved him so much. I tried.

488
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:49,361
Sometimes things break in such a way
that, you know,

489
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:52,166
the pieces just don't go back together.

490
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:56,413
You gotta learn to accept
and love the pieces that are left.

491
00:26:58,012 --> 00:27:01,113
I understand about Craig.
No, you don't.

492
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:04,533
Nobody understands but Bill and me.

493
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:08,958
The schools,
the teachers, the therapists,

494
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:11,993
all they see is the pathology.

495
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,461
They don't see the beauty...

496
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:16,503
and the kindness.

497
00:27:23,215 --> 00:27:25,179
People only fear what
they don't understand,

498
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:27,475
and they don't understand our Craig.

499
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:35,731
Hey, sleepy boy.

500
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:43,110
Okay. Family meeting upstairs,
and we'll figure out how to right this.

501
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:45,498
Excuse us, Don.

502
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,261
Of course.

503
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,765
Come on, buddy.

504
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:54,340
That was some nap, huh?

505
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,289
Tweetie got Mama
pregnant when she was 17.

506
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,598
I see him in the studio, but that's it.

507
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,182
How long have you been
the voice of Lil'Boots?

508
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:05,120
I've been lipsynching all her music

509
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,034
since she switched over
to R&B 2 years ago.

510
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,057
She never sings any of her own songs?

511
00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:11,976
When she was hard core. But that career
never went nowhere.

512
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:14,196
She wanted to switch over.

513
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:17,063
Girl couldn't carry a tune
if you strapped it on her back.

514
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:20,719
Someone told Tweetie about
me singing gospel in church one day.

515
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:23,435
He had me come in, lay down some tracks.

516
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:25,749
And that's the last time Lil'Boots
ever opened her mouth,

517
00:28:25,869 --> 00:28:27,501
except to say thank you for a check.

518
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:31,806
- All right. Thank you. - You're gonna
pay for my mama's hospital bills, right?

519
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:34,276
- Of course we will.
- Thank you.

520
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,967
You won't leave here without protection.

521
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:42,616
Uh, Gib?
You just made one hell of a deal.

522
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:49,016
Oh, Gib, Gib, Gib. Before
you go... Listen, before you go public

523
00:28:50,094 --> 00:28:51,765
could I be the one to tell Spiller?

524
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:58,040
Gib, you just helped make this
the happiest day of my life.

525
00:29:01,922 --> 00:29:04,908
I know. Okay. All right.

526
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:10,400
Your buzzards and my buzzards
should have the principles

527
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,766
hammered out by the end of the week.
I insist we celebrate. Ciao.

528
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:19,413
Oh, my God. I can't wait
to see the look on Spiller's face.

529
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:33,942
Don.

530
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:38,000
God, this is really hard.

531
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:42,325
May I please go now?

532
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:46,293
Don, I'm very sorry.

533
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:52,698
Let me go. Please.

534
00:29:53,902 --> 00:29:57,523
There's no other way.
We have to kill you.

535
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:08,387
He's gonna kill me. He knows!

536
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,426
Where are you?

537
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,554
I'm in the hotel room you sent me to.
He just called.

538
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:16,241
You're gonna be okay. Kenny, my purse.

539
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:19,299
Let me speak to your bodyguard.
She wants to speak to you.

540
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,982
I got one in the hallway,
one in the lobby, and two in the room.

541
00:30:24,244 --> 00:30:26,652
Nobody's gonna put a hand on this girl.
I'm on my way.

542
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:39,793
This is hard for us, too, Don.
We're not murders.

543
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:41,527
We love our son.

544
00:30:41,961 --> 00:30:44,169
California law says he could be tried
as an adult.

545
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,381
We can't take that chance. Craig
already has two strikes against him.

546
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:52,052
He beat a girl badly. She was a teenager
He thought that she stole his bike.

547
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,071
- She did.
- But this is assault,

548
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,724
kidnapping, torture.

549
00:30:59,182 --> 00:31:03,147
Your son is a sociopath.
And you're not helping him.

550
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:07,099
You broke into our home,
ranting and raving. We were terrified.

551
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:10,237
Bill shot you. End of story.
I have to shoot him?

552
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:11,891
We discussed this, Bill.

553
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:15,351
Are you going to take a more
active role in this family or not?

554
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:21,165
If you shoot me, my boss,
Lucy Spiller, she'll be all over you.

555
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,993
If you think she's gonna believe
this little bullshit,

556
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:27,627
then you're...
you know, you're as nuts as your son.

557
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,032
She'll haunt you till
she finds the truth,

558
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:33,598
and when she does,
you're all gonna go to jail for murder.

559
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:34,692
I'll shoot him.

560
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:38,067
Not now, honey, please. Don's right.
We should think this over for a minute.

561
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:40,831
I can't believe this.
You're gonna pussy out?

562
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:43,856
I hate this family! Honey, we

563
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,138
aren't saying that we're
not going to kill Don,

564
00:31:46,258 --> 00:31:49,222
- we're just going to think it
through a little. - Look at him.

565
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,265
You... You can't save him.
You shut up!

566
00:31:53,988 --> 00:31:56,492
- All right? You shut up.
- He's broke.

567
00:31:56,795 --> 00:31:58,279
Give me the gun. And you know it.

568
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,870
You're the psycho. He's broke.

569
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:01,163
Give me the gun. No!

570
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:03,859
- I know. You know, too.
- Shut up!

571
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:07,395
No, don't do that.
Stop it. Give me the gun, Dad.

572
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:11,271
No! Give me the gun!
Give him the gun, Bill. Cassie!

573
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:12,991
Let him have it.

574
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:14,956
See what he does.
See what the pieces do.

575
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:16,863
No, Craig. Give Mama the gun.

576
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:19,056
Craig, give Mama...
I'm doing this for us!

577
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:21,027
Watch. They're the psychos!

578
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:25,178
See?
Watch. See? See? See the pieces?

579
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:34,863
Craig!

580
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:40,034
Craig. I have the bullets.

581
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:43,434
Give me the gun.

582
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,590
Daddy.

583
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:54,071
I don't want to be bad anymore.

584
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,307
Help me. It's too late.

585
00:32:57,703 --> 00:33:01,382
No, it's not. What do you want?
Money? Position?

586
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:04,926
- Anything. Anything. Please.
- No.

587
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,944
Please. He's my baby.
Please. Please don't take my baby.

588
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:13,931
Anything. Just let us go.
Just let us go. Anything. Anything.

589
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,501
Because... he's not bad.

590
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,701
It's me.

591
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:26,418
It's me. I'm bad. I'm bad.

592
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:29,262
It's me.

593
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:36,029
When he was six years old, he
would give me a hundred kisses before...

594
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:38,756
Cassie. Cassie.

595
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:42,532
Cassie! Stop it. It's over. Honey.

596
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:46,168
It's over. Oh, please.

597
00:33:46,288 --> 00:33:47,070
Come on.

598
00:33:59,668 --> 00:34:01,479
Just leave us, please.

599
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:10,837
I'm... I'm sorry for your loss.

600
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,463
What is it?
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

601
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,598
I don't think I can go
through with this. He knows.

602
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,854
You don't have to. You don't have to.

603
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:30,461
You okay?
It's okay, sweetheart. What's happening?

604
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:33,972
I have asthma.
My inhaler's in the next room.

605
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:35,536
Where? My bag.

606
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:45,774
That's Daddy's girl.

607
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:51,370
Funny thing about some security firms.
Not real big on background checks.

608
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:58,088
I'm sorry. He said he'd kill my mother.

609
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:00,958
Her ma thought she's
gonna blackmail Tweetie.

610
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:04,777
Like I would ever
pay out that skank bitch.

611
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:22,763
Little something? No.

612
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:24,361
Come no, take that edge off you.

613
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:28,955
You fellows make a run for me.

614
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:32,480
It's gonna be a long night.

615
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,260
See this little girl right here?

616
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,252
Oh, you should hear the Spirit
move through her. I'm telling you.

617
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:46,369
Then why is she lip-synching
instead of making her own CDs?

618
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,221
Look at her, bitch.

619
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:55,224
Voice like an angel.
Face like a rhino.

620
00:35:58,478 --> 00:36:00,851
Don't be eyeballing
your daddy like that, baby.

621
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:02,612
Not unless you want
some of what your mama got.

622
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:09,578
Oh, we partying now, huh?

623
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,859
Whoo! Just like home, baby.

624
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,131
Don't look at her.
All eyes on Tweetie.

625
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:24,754
See, I'm the one who's gonna
deliver you. Not the little pig.

626
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:32,953
Oh, ho, Tweetie's in love

627
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:35,939
Sit down, baby. Sit down. Sit down.

628
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:42,477
Whoa. Ooh, look at that face.
Look at that face. She mad now.

629
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:48,292
Alisha, hey.
I got love for you, baby. I do.

630
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:50,869
It's your ma saying
shit that ain't true. Rape?

631
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,185
Rape? Money. Looks.

632
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:58,210
Why would I ever have to resort to that?

633
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:04,183
Your mama, she came. She came
willing and often. In fact, she told me,

634
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:07,554
"Don't worry,
baby, I'm on birth control."

635
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:11,898
Thought she gonna hold
Tweetie hostage for support.

636
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:15,591
Bam! Shit backfired.

637
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:22,567
Your mama didn't want you no more...
no more than I did.

638
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:23,923
Liar. Whoa!

639
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:53,733
Hey, Lucy.
Yeah. I'm... I'm... I'm going home.

640
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:56,072
There's nothing happening here.

641
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,127
