1
00:00:01,677 --> 00:00:02,991
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

2
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:06,006
<i>So much to catch you up on,
so try and keep up.</i>

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,474
<i>Lucy had sex with
Holt McLaren. Again.</i>

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:12,904
<i>Julia had sex with,
well, everybody.</i>

5
00:00:13,196 --> 00:00:16,577
<i>Lucy's brother Leo got physical
with action star Jack Dawson's wife.</i>

6
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:18,511
- Get off of me!
- <i>Not in a good way.</i>

7
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:21,393
<i>Leo told Lucy that she shouldn't
have done the story on Jack Dawson.</i>

8
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:24,725
I asked you more than once:
are you sure you wanna do this, Leo?

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,682
<i>Dawson dropped
all the charges.</i>

10
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,383
I need to get away
from you for a while.

11
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:30,892
- <i>Leo dropped out of sight.</i>
- One of your little walkabouts.

12
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:31,852
You always run away.

13
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:35,490
<i>Lucy has serious abandonment issues
when it comes to family.</i>

14
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,672
<i>Her dad hanged himself
when she was a kid.</i>

15
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:40,404
<i>He left her a note:
"Lucy, I did it for you."</i>

16
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:42,539
<i>"Someday you'll understand."</i>

17
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,190
<i>That was helpful.</i>

18
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:47,997
<i>Julia is still not quite up to snuff
since her and Holt's fender-bender.</i>

19
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,088
<i>Lucy helped set
Julia up in rehab.</i>

20
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:54,495
I made a call. They'll have a bed
ready for her tomorrow.

21
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:55,890
No! No!

22
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:59,069
<i>I don't think Julia's written
her thank-you card yet.</i>

23
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,175
<i>Willa finally got
her own byline.</i>

24
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:03,427
Little Willa wants
to fly solo.

25
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:06,200
This would be a great
cover story.

26
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:07,139
Wow...

27
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:10,505
<i>Speaking of buying lines,
Barrow didn't do so bad himself.</i>

28
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:12,552
You're editorial
material, Willa.

29
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:18,364
<i>Lucy ran this story about a cheerleader
who was killed by her best friend,</i>

30
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,660
<i>after she got pregnant
by the girl's father.</i>

31
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,521
<i>Sort of a man-meets-girl,
man-gets-girl-pregnant,</i>

32
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:26,676
<i>man's-daughter-who-he's-also-
been-sleeping-with- kills-girl story.</i>

33
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:29,386
Daddy calls me Sara when
he puts his love in me.

34
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:32,678
<i>If only she'd get another
cover out of that.</i>

35
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:38,249
What?

36
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:44,601
Reverend Sweet has
consented to an interview,

37
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:48,507
but won't talk to a reporter,
only wants the editor-in-chief.

38
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:02,037
- You're Lucy Spiller.
- Yes.

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,295
- Is that a tape recorder?
- It is. Do you mind?

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,427
So many things rhyme.

41
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:12,368
Goosy Lucy. Juicy Lucy.

42
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:15,532
Children can be just
as cruel as adults.

43
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,873
Tell me about your
relationship with Amber.

44
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:20,711
Amber's father died
when she was very young.

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,565
It's hard to grow up when
a parent is taken suddenly.

46
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,802
Well, you know, don't you?
You lost...

47
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,632
your father.

48
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:34,177
The dead are always with us.

49
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:36,605
Let that be a comfort to you.

50
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:39,385
He loves you very much.

51
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:40,810
He's right here.

52
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,708
Yeah. How old was she when
you first molested her?

53
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,995
He worries that
you're not sleeping.

54
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:49,812
All right, look. If we're going to
conjure the dead, let's talk to Amber.

55
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:52,357
Were you trying
to get her pregnant?

56
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:57,568
Do you know your
Scripture, Lucy?

57
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,392
It's a dreadful thing, to fall into
the hands of the living God.

58
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,262
If you're not going
to answer my questions,

59
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:06,114
there's really no reason
for this interview.

60
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:08,043
He knows you suffer.

61
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:11,269
His death,
so hard to accept.

62
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:12,978
Your father has
a message for you.

63
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,643
- You have time to waste.
- I don't. He wants you to understand.

64
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:18,255
He did it for you.
He did it for you!

65
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,172
Tell him you understand!
End his suffering!

66
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,322
<i>It's hard to grow up when
a parent is taken suddenly.</i>

67
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,929
<i>The dead are always with us.</i>

68
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:36,557
<i>Let that be a comfort to you.</i>

69
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:41,295

<i>His death, so hard to accept.</i>

71

He wants you to understand</i>

72
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,966
<i>that he did it for you!</i>

Proudly Present:

00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:10,644
Dirt - Season 01 Episode 08 -
"The Thing Under the Bed"

77
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:22,651
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

78
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:26,533
Sit. Sit.

79
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,985
I keep eatin' this shit, hopin'
I'll find a finger or a tooth in here,

80
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,739
so I could sue and retire,
but nothing but chicken.

81
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:35,862
Assholes.

82
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:37,352
- Here.
- Oh, no.

83
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,868
So, whatcha got,
pal o' mine?

84
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:42,739
You know that actress
on Birdie, Birdie?

85
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:43,818
Dana Pritchard.

86
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:47,032
Yeah, yeah. I covered her divorce
from that rocker, Perez.

87
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,278
He beat the crap out of her.

88
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,765
But only when
he was...sober.

89
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,510
- It was a good story.
- Mmm.

90
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:57,000
It looks like our little
Dana's gettin' married again.

91
00:04:57,082 --> 00:05:00,941
I just booked her the honeymoon
suite at the Maroma in Canc'n.

92
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,055
- Here--here are the dates.
- Maroma.

93
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,032
Wow. Who's the groom?
Another abusive drummer?

94
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:11,071
I'm a travel agent,
not a psychic, sweetheart.

95
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:13,229
- You don't have a name.
- Mm-mm!

96
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:14,701
Airline tickets?

97
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:16,308
Private plane.

98
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,953
Oh, someone with money.

99
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,827
That makes sense.
Her career isn't bringing it.

100
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:23,246
Maybe he loves her.

101
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,123
Maybe she likes it
in the seat.

102
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,083
That's what I'm holdin' out for.

103
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,605
All right, Tony. Thanks.
Keep me on speed-dial.

104
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:30,508
- All right?
- Yeah.

105
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:33,324
- Keep them Benjamins comin', Legs.
- All right.

106
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,503
He just booked her the honeymoon suite
at the Maroma in Canc`n.

107
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,652
Mm-hm.

108
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,497
- Dana Pritchard.
- Booked a honeymoon suite.

109
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:44,177
She's a B-list actress
with a sinking sitcom.

110
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,488
God, I love the smell
of PR bullshit in the morning.

111
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:49,338
- Well, I don't smell it.
- Really? Take a deep breath.

112
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,772
Dana Pritchard's
15 seconds are over.

113
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:54,517
She had them in front of a club
when someone with a cell phone cam

114
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:58,699
caught her husband, rockstar Joey Perez,
beating her like a bowl of brownie mix.

115
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:02,195
Good footage, number-one
celebrity download for a week.

116
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,168
And then America lost interest.

117
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,608
Dana's been linked
to everyone but Osama.

118
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:10,312
She's an ink-seeker trying to save face
and stick it to Perez.

119
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:13,045
Do not buy in.

120
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,840
We're done!
Stop stalking me.

121
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,505
Look, I called
Dana's hair guru.

122
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:20,769
He's booked for a house call
next Sunday at 8 a. m.

123
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,417
- Two heads.
- Two heads?

124
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,435
Give the story to Nuts 'n' sluts.

125
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,215
Kenny? Aspirin?

126
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,640
Willa, if you really wanna
chase your tail on this,

127
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:30,989
set up a lunch
with her manager.

128
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,668
- Jimmy Rembar.
- Yeah. Pick up the tab.

129
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:33,875
He'll show you his hand.

130
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,816
- Harvard boy can't hold in a fart.
- Thanks.

131
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,441
Got your mother's
service, left word.

132
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,708
Try her car.

133
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:46,298
Oh, God...

134
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:49,642
We got Holt McLaren
on hold for you.

135
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,782
Hola, titty boy.

136
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,730
<i>Uh, hang on.
I've got Holt McLaren for ya.</i>

137
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:58,853
Oh.

138
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:00,524
Oh, thank you.

139
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:01,674
Hey, babe.

140
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,363
<i>Hey yourself.</i>

141
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:06,002
Guess what dope fiend
made level five?

142
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:08,838
So don't bring lunch, okay?
'Cause we're going out <i>on a pass.</i>

143
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,800
Julia...

144
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,732
I'm sorry,
but we're shooting.

145
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:14,809
But,

146
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:18,304
I was-- I was gonna take you to
this place. It's Korean barbeque.

147
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:21,043
<i>Holt? We're ready for you.</i>

148
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,064
Oh, God.
I was counting on it.

149
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,913
Do you have any idea
how hard it is for me here?

150
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,556
I mean, it sucks!

151
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:32,655
It really does.

152
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,001
<i>I'll try to be there
on family day.</i>

153
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,764
- Try?
- <i>Julia, we're shooting nights.</i>

154
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:40,013
<i>It's not easy, rember?</i>

155
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:41,573
"Rember".

156
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:44,535
What's that?
Is that like a dig?

157
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:45,731
<i>Julia...</i>

158
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,846
No, you know what?
You're right.

159
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,271
I'm sorry. You're right.
It's not easy.

160
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,024
I know.
I do rember.

161
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,669
Yeah, what a nightmare.
I mean, learn the role.

162
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,722
Memorize a billion lines.

163
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:03,299
Hit your mark without looking down.
What else?

164
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,513
Oh, that's right.

165
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:07,175
Shove your finger so far up your
own ass that you need a P. A.

166
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:09,304
- <i>to place your personal calls--</i>
- I did call you,

167
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:10,961
and they put me on hold.

168
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:14,553
Do you have any idea it takes them
20 minutes to track you down?

169
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,553
Time out, Julia.
Time out.

170
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:19,773
Julia!

171
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:29,938
Dana Pritchard?
Where'd you get that one?

172
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,425
Under my pillow
from the Truth Fairy.

173
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:34,830
- Who's the groom?
- What who?

174
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:37,531
There isn't a who,
and there isn't a what.

175
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,915
Trust me.

176
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:43,569
You know, I put money on this.
I really mouthed off to my boss.

177
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:47,364
She said it was PR play. Now she's gonna
rub my nose-for-news in it.

178
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:51,481
I should just quit this job.
I'm lousy at it.

179
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,995
I'm negotiating an exclusive
with People Magazine.

180
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:01,933
That's all I can tell you.

181
00:09:03,364 --> 00:09:05,734
People'spaying
for Dana Pritchard?

182
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:08,185
No offense, but that's--

183
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,106
Who's the groom?
Jesus of Nazareth?

184
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:13,777
What's the offer?

185
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:16,302
Come on, just give me the offer.
I'll take it back to Lucy,

186
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,842
and we'll get a war going.

187
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:19,704
Half a million.

188
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,487
Groom?

189
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:23,356
Jimmy, come on.

190
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:25,725
If People Magazine knows,
we have to know.

191
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,086
- Be fair.
- You guys wanna get in the game?

192
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:29,998
I'll take a higher
offer to Dana.

193
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:33,247
You make the buy, you get the groom.
Not before.

194
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:36,165
And you got to promise me,
no digging.

195
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,613
No digging.

196
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:39,361
No photographers on her.

197
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,168
You have my word.

198
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,827
In a hurry?

199
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:53,452
I'll make fresh.

200
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:55,364
Who doesn't like fresh?

201
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:07,373
So...

202
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:11,584
what's the most we've ever paid
for an exclusive cover story?

203
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:13,760
What's Lucy buying?

204
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:16,598
- I didn't say she was buying.
- You're avoiding the question.

205
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,522
Like you're avoiding me?

206
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,859
Not true.

207
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,666
Look, we coupled.

208
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,484
That doesn't
make us a couple.

209
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,000
You can relax. I'm not expecting
to meet your mother.

210
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,593
Well, that's good.
She's dead.

211
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:31,660
Willa?

212
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:33,233
- She wants you.
- Okay.

213
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:35,989
You're a big boy.

214
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:37,760
Pour your own.

215
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:41,590
Congratulations.
Your gut's a winner.

216
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:44,487
We're in the game.
I've offered $600,000.

217
00:10:44,488 --> 00:10:46,681
But I don't like
dancing in the dark.

218
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,584
I'm gonna team you up
with Don Konkey.

219
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:56,836
- Mom?
- In here, hun.

220
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:58,584
I've left you
two messages.

221
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:00,728
Wait a minute.
Are you sick?

222
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,616
Don't come in here
if you've got anything.

223
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:06,379
I, um-- I scheduled
a nip/tuck for tomorrow.

224
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,660
- I can't catch anything.
- No, I'm not sick. I just--

225
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:11,041
- I haven't slept, that's all.
- Oh, that's not new.

226
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,030
You never slept,
even when you were a baby.

227
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:15,294
Suck and scream and suck and scream,
all night long.

228
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:16,736
I thought you were
gonna kill me.

229
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,333
Did you know
a Reverend Sweet?

230
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:21,770
By the way, I'm gonna need a ride
after the procedure tomorrow.

231
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:23,999
I'm obviously not
gonna be able to drive, and your

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,529
- stepfather's in Washington.
- Okay, I'll send a car for you.

233
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:29,799
I'll pick you up.

234
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,593
He talked to me about my father.
Do you know him?

235
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,967
He talked to me about my father.
Do you know him?

236
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:39,389
Your father never set foot
inside a church.

237
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,951
You can go to the bank
on that one.

238
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,114
Was there anything else
that Dad may have left for me?

239
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,592
Something else that
maybe he wanted me to see?

240
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:49,890
What about those boxes from
Chicago, from his office--

241
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:53,348
No, Lucy! No! When are you gonna be
done with your obsessing?

242
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:55,908
The man didn't think about you.
He only thought about himself.

243
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:57,857
And for that, you put him
on a pedestal?

244
00:11:57,858 --> 00:12:01,073
I, on the other hand, go without
so that I can pay for your therapy.

245
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:03,930
- I stayed for the third act--
- Yes, you paid for my therapy!

246
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,857
And I'm Mother Medea!

247
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:08,953
This is where I come in.

248
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:13,462
Please don't mention my procedure
to your brother. Leo always worries.

249
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,045
I haven't talked to Leo
in a long time.

250
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:19,636
He calls me
every Sunday night.

251
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,581
Where is he?

252
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,605
Oh, if he
isn't calling you,

253
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:27,508
maybe he doesn't
want you to know.

254
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,191
- Have you ever used medication?
- Benzos, off and on.

255
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:37,982
Does anyone in your family
have a history of insomnia?

256
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:38,803
I don't know.

257
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:41,430
Do you have trouble
falling asleep or staying asleep?

258
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:43,812
I sleep alone--
Uh, I mean, both.

259
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:45,290
Hallucinations?

260
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:46,639
Paranoia?

261
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:47,807
At night.

262
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:54,165
Take a deep,
cleansing breath.

263
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,984
Have you ever been
hypnotized before?

264
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,693
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,183
This isn't gonna work.

266
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:04,784
That fountain
just makes me want to pee.

267
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,705
What are you afraid of?

268
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:12,466
<i>County correctional, Unit 5.</i>

269
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,223
Hi. This is Lucy Spiller
from DirtNow.

270
00:13:15,224 --> 00:13:18,243
I'd like to set up another
interview with Thomas Sweet.

271
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:19,815
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

272
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:21,889
I'm sorry?

273
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,340
<i>The press release
went out two hours ago.</i>

274
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:27,032
<i>Thomas Sweet was murdered
in his cell this morning.</i>

275
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:36,581
<i>The dead are always with us.</i>

276
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,363
<i>Let that be a comfort to you.</i>

277
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:43,398
<i>He worries that
you're not sleeping.</i>

278
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,981
<b>Dearest Lucy, I had a dream wich was not
at all a dream.</b>

279
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:04,239
<b>I did this for you.
Someday you'll understand. Dad.</b>

280
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,212
Is anyone there?

281
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:52,081
See Dana Pritchard.

282
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,559
See Dana's dog.

283
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,128
See two idiots on a bench
waiting for her.

284
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,735
You know, you're shooting film of a
woman with a plastic bag over her hand,

285
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,374
waiting for her dog to shit.

286
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,668
Start preparing room
for your Pulitzer.

287
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:07,157
Constipated.

288
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,802
Probably feeding it
dry food.

289
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:12,970
I'll use that
as my lead.

290
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:19,786
Mommy shouldn't be drinking
juice from the baby's bottle.

291
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:21,815
So call Social Services.

292
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,732
Besides, I'm not a mother,
and this isn't juice.

293
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:26,703
Oh, there's our story:

294
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:29,225
little dog buried alive
in silicone avalanche.

295
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,899
You know,
we're not getting squat.

296
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,497
We'll follow her home
and wait till it gets dark.

297
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:40,495
- And do what?
- Go through her garbage.

298
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,516
I'm gonna need
some more juice.

299
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,867
This is all we could find
in Dana's trash cans.

300
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:55,064
Well, I can see why she shreds.
The horse has a tighter ass.

301
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,346
- Where is this, Montana?
- It's a family ranch.

302
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:00,830
When the divorce got ugly,
Dana ran home to Daddy.

303
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,840
That's her trainer,
Hope Duggan.

304
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:06,173
She was there the night that Dana
got decked by Perez in public.

305
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,079
Peoplecame back at 6:50. If I'm
going to 7, I need to know why.

306
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:13,798
- Anything on the mystery groom?
- Ground Zero.

307
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,295
Your mother. Please bring her hat
and sunglasses when you pick her up.

308
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,196
- What smells like garbage?
- Garbage.

309
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:26,390
Okay, so the trainer's inside. Can we
give her a reason to cough up a name?

310
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:30,441
She's from Ohio. Used to train
at L. A. Fitness. I'll dig.

311
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:36,391
- Don, what are you doing?
- Old bank statement.

312
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,452
- We don't need that.
- I'm almost finished!

313
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:42,856
Okay, but when you're done,
don't start another.

314
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,452
- Okay.
- Okay.

315
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,880
It's Holt McLaren again.

316
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,086
Dr. Tucker told me
that I could talk to her.

317
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:00,293
I understand.
Yeah.

318
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,692
Well, okay, when-
when are you gonna see him?

319
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:12,351
Listen, I hear you. I know
she lost her phone privileges.

320
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:16,858
It's my fault.
I upset her, all right?

321
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,144
So if I can talk to her,

322
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:22,262
- it'll make her feel better.
- <i>Hey, look, that's Holt McLaren!</i>

323
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:30,069
<i>Hey, Holt, over here!
Holt, right here!</i>

324
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,773
What?

325
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:39,943
Okay if I leave?
I have a Lamaze class.

326
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:41,939
- Fine.
- And don't forget,

327
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,390
stop at Mom's house. Get
her hat and sunglasses.

328
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:47,470
Mom's? What are we,
brother and sister now?

329
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,606
Excuse me.

330
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:52,210
Please tell me you have something
on the Dana Pritchard front.

331
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,592
I have something
on the Dana Pritchard front.

332
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:56,700
I got a lead
on the trainer.

333
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,485
A source told me that her ex bartends
at Peachey's Cabaret,

334
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,977
- so I'm going over there now.
- Great.

335
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:06,700
Look, not that it's any
of my business, but, um...

336
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:08,759
- melatonin?
- Excuse me?

337
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,806
Well, it just helps regulate
your sleep cycle, so...

338
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:16,430
I'll sleep when they put
a stake in my heart.

339
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:21,426
- She's not kidding, is she?
- Nope.

340
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:48,334
Crassotrea virginica:
the Eastern oyster.

341
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:51,844
I had them shipped overnight from
Chesapeake Bay. Help yourself.

342
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,575
Nothing says oysters
like a Riesling from Alsace.

343
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:01,814
You know, there's a lot I
could learn from a man like you.

344
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:06,528
I wouldn't mind
taking your class.

345
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:26,045
- I still have to work.
- Oh.

346
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:29,346
- Your big exclusive cover?
- Mm.

347
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:36,522
- How much is Lucy paying?
- Mmm.

348
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,452
We can talk dirty,
but we can't talk Dirt.

349
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,170
Anymore rules?

350
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,400
How about...
a pre-not-nup?

351
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:58,175
Six weeks, and then
we both walk away.

352
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:03,597
No obligations,
no expectations.

353
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:06,889
And no crying.
No cards at Christmas.

354
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:09,919
Option to extend.

355
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:14,842
What? Oh.
Oh, ohh...

356
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:17,613
I thought we were
negotiating.

357
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:21,343
Later.
I told you work.

358
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,486
Thanks for dinner.

359
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:18,994
Hi, Leo. It's me.

360
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:22,937
I saw Mom, and...

361
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:26,146
she said that you call her
every Sunday night.

362
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:30,309
I want to believe her because
that means that you're okay.

363
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:35,275
She may just be trying
to hurt me, though.

364
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,185
So can you please call me
and tell me you're okay?

365
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:44,826
You don't have to talk to me. You
could just tell me you're all right.

366
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:48,084
Please?

367
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:33,438
Beer!

368
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:34,575
I need beer.

369
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,443
Uh, could you make that two, please?

370
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:38,837
Hope Duggan's ex work here?

371
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:40,964
I'm her ex. What do you want?

372
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:45,512
She's still not out to clients?
My bad.

373
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:47,854
Oh, no problem. Just looking
for a good trainer.

374
00:23:47,855 --> 00:23:49,638
She's gone private, but you can ask.

375
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:51,139
That's her over there.

376
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:52,981
Holy shit.

377
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:55,319
That's Dana Pritchard.

378
00:23:57,592 --> 00:23:59,488
Can you get that?

379
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,549
Mind if I lead?

380
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,260
You're pitching girl-on-girl?

381
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,316
You better have more than one dance.

382
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:33,964
Hope moved into
Dana's house this morning.

383
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:35,415
Moved in?

384
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:37,039
Two trips for U-Haul.

385
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,686
They're seen everywhere together.

386
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:40,867
Listen to what Dana
told ET last week.

387
00:24:41,017 --> 00:24:42,814
"I'm spending time with girlfriends.

388
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:45,463
Only a woman can understand
what I'm going through."

389
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:47,687
She was married to Joey Perez.

390
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,862
Wouldn't that make you
wanna bat for the other team?

391
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:53,399
People magazine is fighting us
for a B-lister on a shit-com.

392
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,950
- It's the only explanation.
- All right.

393
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,216
Out of the closet and up the aisle.

394
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,840
Get confirmation.
Start with Hope's family.

395
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,721
Don?

396
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:10,901
I need a favor.
Nothing to do with work.

397
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:12,257
Okay.

398
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:25,993
It's you.

399
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:30,880
- Can you find out where that was taken?
- Is that your dad?

400
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,913
I don't know who it is.

401
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,462
Do you want to?

402
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,007
- Can you do that?
- I don't know. Usually I have a name.

403
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,757
It's important to you.

404
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:44,977
I don't know.
I don't-- probably not.

405
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,969
It's just another thing
to keep me awake.

406
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,568
A ground-breaking study in 1999,

407
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:52,170
led by Eve Van Cauter
at the University of Chicago,

408
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:54,981
she showed that just six days
of sleep restricted to four hours

409
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:59,377
pushed 11 healthy young male
volunteers into a pre-diabetic state.

410
00:26:00,128 --> 00:26:02,000
- You need to sleep, Lucy.
- I will.

411
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:03,921
You're late for your mother.

412
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,342
Ready?

413
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,465
Oh, Lucy. Oh, baby girl.

414
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:19,445
You got the good drugs.

415
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:23,708
Tucked and tight now.

416
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:25,769
Tight as a tick.

417
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:30,521
No, no. That's not right.
Tight as a drum.

418
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:33,964
You'd never know I'd given birth.

419
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:35,467
You know,

420
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,227
you had a huge head.

421
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:40,096
Like your father.

422
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:43,486
I could never find a hat for him
that would fit his fat head.

423
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:45,082
Was that the problem?

424
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:47,673
The hood didn't fit?

425
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:52,995
Maybe you shouldn't leave
your toys under the bed, Mom.

426
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,030
Did-- Did you find the sadie maisie
under the bed?

427
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:03,360
Those aren't toys, sweetheart.

428
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:05,285
They're objects of love and trust.

429
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:08,945
You can't be afraid
you're gonna get hurt.

430
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:12,579
No, I won't tell you our safe word.

431
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:14,821
Uh, don't-- don't ask.

432
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:19,053
It's not that I don't trust you,
but I promised Paul I wouldn't.

433
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:20,828
But you can ask me anything else,

434
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:22,332
and I'll tell you the truth.

435
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:23,551
Why start now?

436
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,565
I've never lied to you.
I'm your mother.

437
00:27:25,974 --> 00:27:29,700
A mother and a daughter
shouldn't keep secrets.

438
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:38,460
This is me, isn't it?

439
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,816
Who's that man?

440
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,627
Spiller and Sealove.

441
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:49,347
Silent partner.

442
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,641
Dad had a partner?

443
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:55,015
I said, don't trust Alan Sealove.

444
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:58,406
He's a soulless rat bastard.

445
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:01,900
He'll ruin you, he'll ruin
this whole family, and he did.

446
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:03,875
Everything went to hell.

447
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,916
He's the one who should
be strung up by the neck.

448
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:12,548
Lucy, please, get me a basin quickly.
Would you, honey?

449
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:15,240
- I think I'm gonna puke.
- Oh, God.

450
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:18,101
Oh, hurry, hurry.

451
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:39,160
You put a photographer on her.

452
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:42,976
We know that Hope Duggin is the groom.

453
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:44,614
Listen, Jimmy.

454
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:46,162
Either you take the check from <i>Dirt</i>

455
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:48,065
or we'll scoop the wedding
with these photos.

456
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,344
Okay, this is nuts.

457
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:50,869
You're begging for a lawsuit.

458
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,215
Not if we print these photos
and the facts.

459
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:55,478
They're living together.
Hope is gay,

460
00:28:55,506 --> 00:28:57,938
and Dana has a mysterious
wedding in the works.

461
00:28:57,994 --> 00:29:00,417
You gave me your word
you wouldn't dig.

462
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:04,332
Lucy would have just put
somebody else on the story.

463
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,661
Talk to Dana, Jimmy.

464
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,802
She might not be
telling you everything.

465
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:13,004
Lucy needs an answer
by the end of business.

466
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,806
It was taken at
Twilight Ridge, Minnesota,

467
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:24,399
143 miles west of Bemidji.

468
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,360
Minnesota? Are you sure?

469
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:28,332
Yeah. Quanti di Angelo.

470
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:31,063
The factory is still in business
making quality dress gloves

471
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,308
for the police and military throughout
Canada and the United States

472
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:36,214
since 1937.

473
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:38,158
They're sending me a catalog.

474
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:43,379
I don't know about the man.
I'm sorry.

475
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,483
His name was Alan Sealove.

476
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,768
- He was in business with my father.
- The glove business?

477
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:51,665
Commercial real estate.

478
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,830
It's a nice picture of you, Lucy.
You look happy.

479
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:58,037
I was three.

480
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:01,680
Thanks for doing this.

481
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:04,544
- You're a good friend.
- Does it help?

482
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:06,136
Can you sleep now?

483
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:09,648
It helps a lot.

484
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:17,079
Hey.

485
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,924
What are you doing here?

486
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,389
Barbeque wings.

487
00:30:24,942 --> 00:30:26,369
These are cold.

488
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:28,416
Sorry.

489
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:35,103
- You're acting like a two-year-old.
- You're treating me like one.

490
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:37,460
What the hell? I mean,
you bring her the Happy Meal

491
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,425
and she's gonna be fine?

492
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:41,218
I'm sorry.

493
00:30:41,703 --> 00:30:43,646
Look, babe, I love you.
Let's just start over.

494
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:45,587
Stop. Stop saying you love me

495
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,380
What do you want me to say?

496
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,968
Say I embarrassed you.

497
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:51,405
Say that you don't wanna get
photographed with a druggie

498
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:53,020
who's got snot in her hair.

499
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:54,593
Be honest with me.

500
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:55,954
Look, baby, you're depressed.

501
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:58,321
So let's-- let's talk to Dr. Tucker
about your meds.

502
00:30:58,353 --> 00:31:00,118
It's not the meds.

503
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:01,689
God.

504
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:04,386
What are you waiting for?

505
00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:08,991
All right, if you're not gonna say it...

506
00:31:09,207 --> 00:31:10,522
I will.

507
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,390
We're over.

508
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:15,071
Yeah.

509
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:18,551
We've been over for a long time.

510
00:31:19,284 --> 00:31:21,781
- Since before I got here.
- All right, come on.

511
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:24,292
Seriously, you're not
making any sense here.

512
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:25,566
You know it.

513
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:27,519
I know it.

514
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:29,227
I-- I don't know it.

515
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,331
We just didn't want to say it.

516
00:31:34,396 --> 00:31:36,020
And now I'm saying it.

517
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:39,150
Wait, Julia. Come here.

518
00:31:39,301 --> 00:31:40,577
Don't. I gotta--

519
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:42,233
Hey, who's gonna clean up.

520
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:44,186
What happened here?

521
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:48,233
Nothing.

522
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:12,897
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

523
00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:16,936
I'm sorry.

524
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,352
Don't ever do that again.
You scared the shit out of me.

525
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:26,787
I'm sorry.

526
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:30,026
I don't know, I just wanted
to see if you were still awake.

527
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,552
I'm awake.

528
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:46,018
You're working, huh?

529
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:49,517
No, it was just some business
papers of my father's.

530
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,409
You know what,
I should have called first.

531
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:56,531
I mean, it's late. I can go.

532
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:57,987
No, stay.

533
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:03,132
I'm awake, and you're here.
You want a drink?

534
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,146
No, I'm good. Thank you.

535
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,699
You and your dad?

536
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:19,966
No, that's...
my father's business partner.

537
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,947
My dad must have taken the picture.

538
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:26,195
It was in Minnesota,
but I don't remember it at all.

539
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,092
What kind of business is he in?

540
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:29,792
Commercial real estate.

541
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:34,475
I was 15 when he died.

542
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,613
That's the first thing you've
ever told me about yourself.

543
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,002
Well, personal, I mean.

544
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:51,833
I told you I have never had an orgasm
with anyone but you.

545
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:54,115
That's not personal enough?

546
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:59,547
Do you trust me?

547
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,190
I don't even like you.

548
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:05,434
I don't like you either.

549
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,185
Then we're safe.

550
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,177
Will you choke me?

551
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:32,843
Harder.

552
00:34:32,975 --> 00:34:34,242
Harder.

553
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:47,813
Okay, no.

554
00:34:57,551 --> 00:34:59,222
Come on.

555
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:21,037
Hi, my name is Alex.

556
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:23,094
Hi, Alex.

557
00:35:25,193 --> 00:35:26,363
That's Holt McLaren.

558
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:28,902
Glad you could come.
Have a seat.

559
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:35,656
I'm Holt.

560
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:37,440
Hi, Holt.

561
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:39,862
I'm here to support Julia.

562
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:45,221
Julia, why don't you start.

563
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,643
How are you doing?

564
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,521
I'm up and down.

565
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,216
I saw you in the time-out room again.

566
00:35:57,299 --> 00:35:59,318
I didn't hurt anybody.

567
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:04,304
He brought food and I threw it.

568
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:08,191
Are you ready to tell
Holt you're sorry?

569
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:13,796
I'm sorry.

570
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,453
I wanted to talk to you.

571
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:21,749
What is it you want to say?

572
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,306
I was speeding.

573
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:29,902
Tell Julia.

574
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:38,131
I was speeding.

575
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:42,505
Julia, Holt is speaking to you.

576
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:52,130
And you can't remember any of it.

577
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:58,178
But you were scared.

578
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,192
And you wanted me to stop,
but I just went faster.

579
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:07,389
You could have been killed.
It would have been my fault.

580
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,675
Bullshit.

581
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:11,212
You pulled her out of the car.
I saw it on the news.

582
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:12,626
This is Julia's time.

583
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,538
I don't even know who you are.

584
00:37:20,495 --> 00:37:22,993
You know what,
I don't know me either.

585
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,204
You lied.

586
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:30,660
I didn't want to lose you.

587
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:06,185
It's okay, baby.

588
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:10,230
It's okay.

589
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,014
Dana Pritchard.

590
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:20,136
No, she's he here.
She's waiting for you outside.

591
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:23,704
All right. Send her in.

592
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:25,197
Okay.

593
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,496
I want to talk to you myself.

594
00:38:28,497 --> 00:38:31,020
No boy games, no pissing contest.

595
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:33,266
No pissing.

596
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,814
You offered seven,
I'll take seven. Game over.

597
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:37,344
<i>Dirt</i> gets the exclusive.

598
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:38,174
Good choice.

599
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,889
Let's not pretend I had one.

600
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:42,670
Now leave Hope Dugan alone.

601
00:38:42,814 --> 00:38:44,588
No more following her around.

602
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:46,400
No more calling her family.

603
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:49,290
They're Catholic, for Christ's sakes.
If they found out she was gay,

604
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,269
they'd shit themselves.

605
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:53,886
Maybe she should tell them before
the cover hits the checkout stand.

606
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:56,589
Hope's not my lover.
She's my friend.

607
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,817
She was there for me on the worst
night of my life, and then some.

608
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,253
She stood by me.

609
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:03,910
I'm not gonna sell her out
for the better glossy.

610
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:05,610
Do we have a deal?

611
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:07,131
Do we have a groom?

612
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:09,478
Joey and I are getting back together.

613
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,600
Joey, your ex.

614
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,938
I assume you've dropped the lawsuit?

615
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:17,628
My eardrum will heal.

616
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,872
I meant the exposure to Hep C.

617
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:21,687
If you want to write about the Hep C,

618
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:23,585
and all his whores, that's fine.

619
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,707
I'm not pretending it didn't happen.

620
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:28,792
It was the drugs and alcohol.
He wasn't in control.

621
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,956
I didn't understand, but...

622
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:32,111
now I do.

623
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:33,566
He's in AA.

624
00:39:33,656 --> 00:39:34,697
Again.

625
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,664
Yeah. Again.

626
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:38,946
Some people would call you a saint.

627
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,115
And you're thinking I'm a dumb shit.

628
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:47,308
You know when you go into a club,
and they stamp your hand?

629
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:50,444
It means you can get back
in without having to pay.

630
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,561
That stamp is love.

631
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,439
Love doesn't make you pay.
Love forgives.

632
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,211
Someday, you'll understand.

633
00:40:06,563 --> 00:40:09,512
Three weeks ago, she was charging
him with spousal rape.

634
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,928
Well, it has to be
a magical love connection.

635
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:14,710
How do you forgive
somebody like Joey Perez?

636
00:40:14,776 --> 00:40:17,658
Believe me. There's no
better way to punish a man.

637
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:19,644
I never let anybody forgive me.

638
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,536
- But why marry him?
- Better the devil she knows.

639
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:26,828
Another cover in your cap.

640
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:37,003
I blew a source on this one.

641
00:40:37,028 --> 00:40:38,946
Speaking figuratively, of course.

642
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:42,072
Not that it's any of your business.

643
00:40:42,618 --> 00:40:44,691
It was her manager.
I broke a promise.

644
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,790
No--

645
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:47,414
Which one?

646
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:52,810
There are only three, sweetheart.

647
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:57,632
The check is in the mail.

648
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,238
This will only hurt a little.

649
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:08,095
That's two. What's the third?

650
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:11,168
I won't come in your mouth.

651
00:41:12,783 --> 00:41:14,834
But I want you to.

652
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,516
"Look in your trunk"

653
00:43:04,788 --> 00:43:06,046
Don?

654
00:43:09,975 --> 00:43:11,994
- Hey!
- Hi.

655
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:20,641
You want some tea?

656
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:24,284
No, thanks. I just wanna sit
here for a minute.

657
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,058
Here.

658
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:42,861
You can sleep here.

659
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,917
No. I'm just gonna stay for a minute.
