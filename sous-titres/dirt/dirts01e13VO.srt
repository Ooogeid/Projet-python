1
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:03,786
<i>I'm Don Konkey.</i>

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,902
<i>I'm Don Konkey.
I'm... Don Konkey.</i>

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,688
- <i>Leave me alone.</i>
- You know what you have to do.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,836
Don.

5
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,097
<i>No, goddamn it!</i>

6
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,505
You know you have to kill Lucy.

7
00:00:15,546 --> 00:00:18,033
<i>Too much is happening!
Too much is happening!</i>

8
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:20,576
- You have to kill her to save her.
- <i>It's all coming undone.</i>

9
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:22,820
<i>They still haven't caught
Lucy's stalker.</i>

10
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,403
Do you know anyone with
any kind of mental illness?

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,998
- Paranoia? Schizophrenia?
- No. No one springs to mind.

12
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:30,534
<i>Stop looking at me.</i>

13
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,121
<i>Johnny Gage is telling the public that</i>

14
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,488
<i>he gave the sex tape
of him and Julia to Lucy</i>

15
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:36,349
<i>in exchange for
favorable coverage in Drrrt.</i>

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,263
<i>...may come back
to bite her on the ass.</i>

17
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:41,254
<i>The only other person
who has ever even seen this tape</i>

18
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,430
<i> is Lucy Spiller at DirtNow.</i>

19
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:45,917
<i>Julia going public about
Johnny Gage raping her</i>

20
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:48,336
<i>only to find out that
she was using the tape</i>

21
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:51,849
- <i>to get her stalled career going.</i>
- Just keep this story on the inside.

22
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,117
And... you can own me.

23
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,532
- I don't mind being owned.
- <i>Oh, poor, poor Julia.</i>

24
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,798
This is a great cover.

25
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:05,072
- <i>Willa dumped Barrow...</i>
- I can't do this anymore.

26
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,147
<i>...no matter how hard he tried
to encourage her to come back.</i>

27
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:09,933
Did I do something wrong?

28
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,637
- You know you have to kill Lucy.
- <i>Can you just tell me why?</i>

29
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,068
<i>Please?</i>

30
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,309
Don, I can't take it.

31
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,419
I need to hear from you.

32
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,508
If I've done something to hurt you,
we can talk about it,

33
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:34,449
but you have to call me back.

34
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,989
I have a lot of people out ther
looking for you. Please--

35
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:57,646
<i>Donald, you have been given a sacred
task. Don't turn you back on God.</i>

36
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,117
Why are you doing this to me?
She's my friend.

37
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,866
- <i>Kill her Donny.</i>
- Tristan!

38
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:08,034
<i>Ivane eam, Don,
et desine eius dolorem.</i>

39
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,013
<i>Ita missa est.</i>

40
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,326
<i>Ita missa est.</i>

41
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,016
- <i>The mass is over?
- That's right, Donald.</i>

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,342
<i>The mass is over.</i>

43
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:23,761
<i>It is time.</i>

44
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,356
So every second
of my private life on camera,

45
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,144
and we can't find a frame of this jerk?

46
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,478
Someone knew enough
to cut the power in the right place,

47
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:43,367
- take out the cameras.
- That's reassuring.

48
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,221
Have you heard
from your friend Don yet?

49
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:46,472
It's not Don.

50
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,018
He's schizophrenic.

51
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,519
And he's the perfect stalking machine.

52
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,813
The surveillance, the photography,
all the methodologies--

53
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,508
Okay, so find out.

54
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,843
Just find him first.

55
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,221
He's never disappeared
for this long before.

56
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,403
If I have to choose between this asshole
who's stalking me and Don,

57
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:07,396
- I say find Don.
- Your car is here.

58
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,289
Oh, great.
As if my life isn't absurd enough,

59
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:12,612
now I have to go
to a fake fashion show.

60
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,144
Look, America is shitting itself for
the Best New Model finale.

61
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,503
Get me a photo of
America shitting itself,

62
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,033
and I'll put that on the cover.

63
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,114
Bet if I chopped off one of their heads,
you'd put it on the cover.

64
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:34,672
I just might.

65
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,431
Maybe I should pitch the cover
to Tina Harrod.

66
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,593
I'm sure it's just the kind of pap
Tina's magazine would gobble up.

67
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:45,299
Of course, they only have two-thirds
the circulation of DirtNow.

68
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,675
But I wasn't talking about her magazine.

69
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,599
I heard she's taking over yours.

70
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,819
Call 911!

71
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:10,776
Terry, pull the cover.

72
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,361
<i>She's not breathing!</i>

73
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:20,960

Dirt - Season 01 Episode 13
"Ita Missa Est"

76
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:08,393
Easy there, Don.

77
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,878
- That's a close call, buddy.
- Sorry.

78
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,791
No, it's cool.

79
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:17,307
What are you doing in my car?
You're not even real.

80
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,521
You really feel qualified
to make that judgment, Don?

81
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,560
Are you?

82
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,291
Please, just tell me who sent you here.

83
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,565
Who sent me?
You don't know?

84
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:33,455
You've been chosen.

85
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,092
You don't have a choice.
This one's not about free will.

86
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,754
Schopenhauer's got nothing to
do with this shit, Don.

87
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,433
This is His will.

88
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,319
That's right.

89
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,462
With fear and trembling,
find your salvation.

90
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,671
You're gonna do it, right, buddy?

91
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,938
You're gonna kill this bitch, right?

92
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,371
Okay, let's go with the family angle
and do a box on the anorexia.

93
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,626
Family's gone radio silent.
All no comment.

94
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,157
Really? Oh, my God, somebody said no?
Well, let's all go home.

95
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:19,988
What other photos do you have?

96
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:22,968
I have all the publicity crap,
a few candids, and some frame grabs.

97
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,728
Okay, you need to get more.
Let's get a shooter inside the funeral.

98
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:29,516
- What about Don Konkey?
- Don Konkey is my contact.

99
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:31,061
I'll deal with Don Konkey.

100
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:33,510
Track the autopsy.

101
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:35,820
She was anorexic.
I mean, her liver probably--

102
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:36,865
Probably?

103
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,840
Until you can show me your doctorate,

104
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:42,025
maybe you should just flash your tits
to the coroner and find out for sure.

105
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,119
Lucy.

106
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,770
I just heard from
my source at Vanity Fair.

107
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,995
Holt McLaren is
giving them an exclusive.

108
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:50,100
Son of a bitch.

109
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:56,455
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

110
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,452
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

111
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,158
Wanna go in my office?

112
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,730
That's... no.

113
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,163
No, I wanted to--

114
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,899
I wanted to ask you if you know

115
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,890
what the temperature is around
here for me with Lucy.

116
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,116
I've been in the doghouse
for a while, and I just--

117
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,401
I thought you were wondering about--
Nah, never mind.

118
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:25,736
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,290
Well, actually, you and I had
a pretty clear arrangement.

120
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,394
I mean, since you're on the editorial
side of things and I'm the publisher,

121
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:34,034
we agreed not to talk shop.

122
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,617
Right.

123
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,741
Right. No, I'm--
You're absolutely right.

124
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:39,848
I crossed the line.

125
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,784
But I'm willing to make a trade.

126
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,209
Okay, I think.

127
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,662
I'll tell you about Lucy.
You tell me about us.

128
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,626
- What about us?
- You tell me. About us.

129
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,827
Tonight, for example.

130
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,870
You first.

131
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,052
I wouldn't worry about what
Lucy Spiller's thinking about you.

132
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,911
Her numbers are
down four weeks in a row.

133
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,125
She's got much bigger
things to worry about than you.

134
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,587
Like Tina Harrod.

135
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,077
Your turn.

136
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,250
I'm 23.

137
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,533
You're not.

138
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,829
All right, there are literally a million
40-year-old women in Los Angeles

139
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:27,164
who would gladly
go out with you. So just...

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,302
grow up, Brent.

141
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,577
Holt, come on.
How many times can I say I'm sorry?

142
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:39,693
I'm done.

143
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,656
Baby...

144
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,563
Holt, please.
Come on.

145
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,627
Come here, baby.
Look, it's me.

146
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:50,991
- It's me.
- Yeah, and who the hell is that?

147
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,756
Is that the Julia that
was so terrified to go

148
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,560
into public because
the tape was out there?

149
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:58,389
Or the Julia who released the tape
to amp up her own career?

150
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:01,122
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

151
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:05,075
Okay? I don't know. I don't know
any of the answers, if I ever did.

152
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,756
You sat right here

153
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,077
in this bed and looked in
my eyes as we destroyed that tape.

154
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,746
And you kept a secret copy, Julia?
A goddamned secret!

155
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:18,475
So what? So what? So you could
give your career a jump-start!

156
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:22,220
- Have you ever been so scared?
- Scared of what?

157
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,345
Everything.

158
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:27,335
I mean, so much so that you lose
your way and you do things

159
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,424
that even while you--
you don't know yourself, so you

160
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,132
close your eyes, and you cut a deal
with a part of yourself

161
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:35,883
that you didn't even know existed.

162
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,441
Listen to me.

163
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,835
Listen to me!

164
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,287
Stay the hell  away from me.

165
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:29,779
Do you understand me?

166
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,679
- Do you understand me?
- No!

167
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:33,730
Stay the hell away from me.

168
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,931
You need somebody to talk to,
why don't you call Johnny Gage?

169
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,203
Gah, I mean, there's even  a secret blog
of disgruntled Lucy Spiller employees.

170
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,975

171
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,566
Yeah, it's D-B-A-G,
if you're interested.

172
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,379
Yeah, it would be pretty

173
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,265
bad  if any of that shit got leaked.

174
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,350
Rumor has it that Gibson
is in talks with Tina Harrod.

175
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,929
Okay.

176
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,286
Just get it done.

177
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,137
I gotta go.

178
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,492
Don.

179
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,507
Thank God you're here.

180
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,037
Sorry, Lucy.

181
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,184
You're sorry?
Honey, I'm so glad to see you.

182
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,855
- Mass is over.
- What? What mass?

183
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,994
Don... you're really freaking me out.

184
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,549
No! No, I won't!

185
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,851
No, no! No, I won't!

186
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,587
They want me to
kill my best friend, but--

187
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,324
Go to hell!

188
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,135
Don!

189
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,373
Hey. Kira!

190
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,676
They want me to kill my best friend.

191
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,620
They want me to kill her, but I
wouldn't do it. I won't do it.

192
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,182
It's okay. It's okay.

193
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,590
It's going to be all right.

194
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,662
Let's get back into your car,

195
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,164
drive to her office.

196
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,701
Okay? But on the way,
maybe we'll stop at Panda Express

197
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,136
and get some of those egg rolls

198
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,038
that you love so much.

199
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,741
And then slit the bitch's throat.

200
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,179
I missed you.

201
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,949
No.

202
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,794
Don.

203
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,496
Don, we never do what I want to do.

204
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,900
Don! Don!

205
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,671
Don, you're gonna die out there
if you don't go back and kill her.

206
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,425
I know.

207
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,925
Don!

208
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,487
My friend called me
as soon as it went up.

209
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,849
Goddamn bloggers.

210
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:51,957
- I'm sure it's all bullshit.
- Where's Brent Barrow?

211
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:04,837
Lucy!

212
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,732
- This isn't exactly--
- Shut up, Brent.

213
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,173
Hi, sweetie!

214
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,706
Tina.

215
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:11,731
Oh, do you two, um--
Do you two know each other?

216
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:13,078
Yeah, we do.

217
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,415
Yeah, we were stringers together
at the Post when we got out of college.

218
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,497
What are you doing here?

219
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:20,436
- Uh, well, we were just--
- We were--

220
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,087
Is it "Bring a jackal to work" day?

221
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,576
Thank God, Lucy.
You haven't changed.

222
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,329
Tina and I were on
the MPA panel together

223
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,873
for the national magazine conference.

224
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,130
Yes. Would you please put
those big guns down

225
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:32,559
and give a girl a hug?

226
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,000
Okay, that's great.

227
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,902
Oh, my God, look at you.

228
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,433
Brent, how do you not jump this girl's
bones every day of the week?

229
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,474
I mean, you are just gorgeous.

230
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,082
So they didn't renew your
contract at Celebrity Suck-up?

231
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,446
Oh, honey, I set my sights
way higher thanDirtNow.

232
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,724
And yet here you are.

233
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,685
- Yeah, well--
- Did they offer you my job? Yes or no.

234
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,287
Even if they did, I wouldn't take it.

235
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,890
Hon, I just had another baby.

236
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,791
I'd like to have a lighter schedule,

237
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,881
I'd like to have something
that gets me home by 6.

238
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,662
Oh, please. You'd sell
that little newborn

239
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,522
for a shot at my desk
and we both know it.

240
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:07,291
Well, you know what?
If she doesn't stop

241
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:09,669
crying through the night,
I may just take you up on that.

242
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,508
Come on, walk me around.

243
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,817
- I'll talk to you later.
- Mm-hmm. Bye.

244
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,303
I love this place.
Look at the energy in here.

245
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,820
Excuse me, Tina?

246
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,834
- I don't know if  you remember me.
- Terry!

247
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,591
Are you kidding?
You were my favorite intern ever.

248
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,293
Oh, you know, Lisa told me--

249
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,595
- Yeah.
- You are!

250
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,497
- How far along?
- You're pregnant?

251
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,500
Yeah. I told you
I was gonna need maternity.

252
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,202
- Oh, that's right.
- You know what?

253
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,170
Take longer than you think you need.

254
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,172
- So good to see you.
- Me too.

255
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,560
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

256
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,043
Sweetheart.

257
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,311
She's a gem.
I think you'd better hold on to her.

258
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,099
- I will.
- All right, sweetie.

259
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,750
I know that you're real busy, so--
See ya later.

260
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,885
Um, Lucy.

261
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,156
So, my contact at the coroner's office
wouldn't leak a copy of the autopsy,

262
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,858
but I got the highlights.

263
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,126
Which are?

264
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,696
She had enough Dexfenfluramine in

265
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:10,995
her system to put
Weight Watchers out of business.

266
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:14,700
Oh, wow. So a model on
an illegal weight-loss drug? Shocking.

267
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,003
Find out who gave it to her.
Maybe that's a story.

268
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:23,701
- This is your last chance. Friday.
- Okay, no bullshit.

269
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,877
Is Gibson floating
my job out to Tina Harrod?

270
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:28,503
Jesus Christ, Lucy, what is it
gonna take to get you to knock?

271
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:29,624
Blow me.

272
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,383
- Deal.
- Yeah, right.

273
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,146
Save it for the next intern.

274
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,028
Look, your job is
not in jeopardy, okay?

275
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,492
Yes, your numbers are down, and the
whole Johnny Gage thing doesn't help.

276
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,828
But, like I said, Tina and I are--

277
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,696
On the full of shit committee, I got it.

278
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,966
My God, why do I bother?

279
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,051
You're not gonna listen to
a word I say, anyway.

280
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,465
- All right.
- Hey, don't forget our deal.

281
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:57,109
Brent, you would have a better shot
at getting struck by lightning twice

282
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,244
while holding a winning lottery ticket.

283
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,318
Hi. What's up?

284
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,489
Thanks to the Lojack you had
installed for your friend's walkabouts,

285
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,756
- we have the car.
- What about Don?

286
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,958
Just the car.

287
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,285
It's at the edge of
Joshua Tree near 29 Palms.

288
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:16,695
What are they doing to find him?

289
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,162
It's a very big place.

290
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:19,788
It's too windy to track his footprints.

291
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,449
- Helicopter.
- The park service chopper is

292
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:23,649
- busy with another rescue.
- What are you saying, Gareth?

293
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,439
I'm not exactly in
the search and rescue--

294
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:28,107
I don't give a shit what your
exact job description is,

295
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,175
and I don't care  what you think of him.

296
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,044
Don Konkey is my friend.

297
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,746
Find me a goddamn helicopter.

298
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,531
I'm here to set the record straight.

299
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:51,306
Yes, I did release the video
of me and Johnny Gage on the Internet.

300
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,990
And all I can say is

301
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,938
I wasn't thinking clearly.

302
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,841
But the facts of what happened
that night haven't changed.

303
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:06,145
Johnny Gage did rape me.

304
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,780
And in my fear and confusion,

305
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:13,118
I thought I could turn a horrible
trauma into something positive and

306
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,321
I know now how
wrong that was,

307
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,314
and I'm here to apologize.

308
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,392
Julia, last time you were here,
you talked about the shame you felt

309
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:22,719
at having been raped.

310
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,996
Yes, I did, and I still feel that way.

311
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,733
Not so ashamed that it stopped
you from figuring out how to profit

312
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,635
- from the experience.
- No, I--

313
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,437
I wasn't trying to
profit from it. I was

314
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,472
trying to  take control back.

315
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,655
When you're a victim
of a crime like rape,

316
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,045
there is a sense of
helplessness and loss--

317
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,748
So you blatantly lied to your fans,

318
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,950
to the people who
told you their accounts,

319
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,654
to people who trusted you and derived
strength and hope from your story?

320
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,523
I couldn't control the transgression,

321
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,726
so at least I wanted
to control the release.

322
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,863
That's what Grandma Ruth back
in Lubbock used to call a $2.00 lie.

323
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,055
It doesn't make any sense.

324
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:02,417
No matter what you call it,
it's still a lie, right?

325
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,144
I'm just afraid I'm never
gonna see him alive again.

326
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,412
Of course you are.

327
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,421
I never tell him what a
good friend he is to me.

328
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,094
He really is my friend.

329
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,833
No, no, no, I can't!

330
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,402
You can't just say I'm a messenger

331
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,637
and then, you know, if I--

332
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,073
They can do what they want,
you daft bastard.

333
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,562
Who are they?

334
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,811
The forces. The ones who control you.

335
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,747
No, I'm sick.

336
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,592
You're sick. I'm sick.
We're all sick.

337
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,645
The forces that
told you to kill her,

338
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:55,482
they're gonna make you
kill yourself, now.

339
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,718
You don't have to die, Don.

340
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,625
Donnie.

341
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,227
Please, Donnie.
Can we kill Lucy?

342
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,230
And then we can go back
to our place and make love.

343
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,819
It's been too long.

344
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,842
I can't, Kira.

345
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,438
But then you'll die.

346
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,574
The dead slut has a point.

347
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,176
Don't waste your breath on them.

348
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,579
Can't you see he's knackered?

349
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,382
Here's a bit of science for you,
Donnie, on your way out.

350
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:24,944
The forces...

351
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:28,647
The forces that want  you to kill
yourself, that want you to kill her,

352
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,097
they're you.

353
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,595
The phone calls are coming
from inside the house, mate.

354
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,059
All you need to do now, mate,

355
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,302
is drag this kindly old blade
across your cowardly old throat

356
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,319
then peace.

357
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,541
It's the only way.
I can't kill Lucy.

358
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,990
Well, hurry up.
It's freezing, hey, will ya?

359
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:57,749
Isn't it, Kira? Ping ping.

360
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,424
Tristan?

361
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:19,600
- Hello?
<i>- He's alive.</i>

362
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:21,899
<i>He's in the hospital in Palm Desert.</i>

363
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:23,799
<i>The chopper you hired
found him in the park.</i>

364
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:25,961
<i>He's dehydrated
and a little confused, but</i>

365
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:26,999
<i>he'll be fine.</i>

366
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,268
Okay, great. I'll--

367
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,547
I'll get in my car--

368
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:32,034
<i>He's being airlifted to Cedars
first thing in the morning.</i>

369
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:33,361
<i>Get some rest.</i>

370
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:34,840
<i>He's okay.</i>

371
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,641
Thank you.

372
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:50,388
- Yes?
- Hi, it's Tina.

373
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:51,905
Did I wake you?

374
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,827
No Tina. I'm not sleeping.

375
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:58,982
Um, honey, listen. Do you rember
that Jay Kim from the Times?

376
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:01,838
<i>Well, he called and he
wants me to comment</i>

377
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:03,998
<i>on this rumor that's going around</i>

378
00:24:04,072 --> 00:24:08,091
that I'm going to be
taking over at DirtNow.

379
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:10,971
I can't wait to hear what you said.

380
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:13,562
Well, I said I love the magazine,
but that, you know,

381
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:18,499
severed heads and sex issues,
uh, it's just not my wheelhouse.

382
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:21,260
<i>I leave the dirt up to
my old friend, Lucy.</i>

383
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:22,663
Your old friend?

384
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:25,356
Yeah, you know what?
Can we just please--

385
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:29,647
clear the air and just get rid of all
these bullshit rumors and just--

386
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,506
you know, let's just have lunch.

387
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:33,409
Can we have lunch tomorrow at the Ivy?

388
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,776
The Ivy?

389
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:37,605
That's a nice
scene-setter for the Times.

390
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,994
You want to have lunch,
let's do it at my office.

391
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,611
<i>- 1:00 tomorrow.</i>
- Great.

392
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,094
I'll pick it up.

393
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:44,782
- No, I'll have it catered.
- Okay.

394
00:24:44,978 --> 00:24:46,194
Fantastic.

395
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,436
Oh, remember, I only like veggies.

396
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:50,418
I don't eat anything with a face.

397
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,832
Since when?

398
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:55,119
I'm really excited. Okay, good.
I can't wait to see that famous vault.

399
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:56,864
Okay. Bye.

400
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,600
Good-bye, Lucy.

401
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:16,717
Hi, Don.

402
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,236
Lucy?

403
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:24,257
You're all right.

404
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,006
Yes.

405
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:28,612
Yes, sweetie, I'm right here.

406
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:32,561
I'm right here.
The doctor says you're gonna be fine.

407
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:34,516
I didn't kill you.

408
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:36,375
No, baby, you didn't kill me.

409
00:25:39,612 --> 00:25:40,992
Honey, it's okay.

410
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:44,750
It's okay. It's okay.

411
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:49,612
So glad you're all right.

412
00:25:53,713 --> 00:25:54,738
Lucy?

413
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:57,840
Do you need something?

414
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:02,195
What?

415
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:04,931
I'm gonna start--
start taking my monthly

416
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:07,637
injections so I'm never
off my meds ever again.

417
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:09,428
That's great news, Don.

418
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:10,589
And, um...

419
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:14,843
I'm gonna sign over my medical
power of attorney to you.

420
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:19,476
Why don't we talk about that
when you're feeling better?

421
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:23,174
I can't trust myself when
I'm really, really sick.

422
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,603
I trust you.

423
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,379
Promise me you'll do
whatever you have to do,

424
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:38,344
even if that means
putting me somewhere.

425
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,387
Don, no one is ever
gonna put you anywhere.

426
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:47,164
Promise me.

427
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,978
I promise you.

428
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,835
Thank you, Lucy.

429
00:27:04,996 --> 00:27:06,421
You get some rest.

430
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:08,540
Yeah, you, um--

431
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:11,159
Call me if you need me, right?

432
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,087
Of course.

433
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,879
"...I'm so sorry that
I wasn't there for you."

434
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:41,734
And I said, "So did you have a nice
little funeral in the backyard?"

435
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:44,458
And she goes, "Mom, it's a pigeon.
I threw it in the trash."

436
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:46,964
- She reminds me so much of you.
- Get her a good therapist.

437
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:48,293
I already have.

438
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:51,512
I'm telling you, Lucy, you've gotta get
a kid. You would be such a good mom.

439
00:27:51,513 --> 00:27:53,777
Well, that's a whole new twist
on sucking your fingers.

440
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:56,396
You know, you can play that tough
girl all you want, but I know you.

441
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:59,410
I also know you, so let's put away
these little baby pictures

442
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,702
and tell me what the hell
were you doing in Brent's office?

443
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,992
Oh, God.

444
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:05,612
Lucy, honey,

445
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:08,976
if I was actually vying for your job,
do you think that I would just walk

446
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:12,270
into the offices of DirtNow and have
a meeting with your publisher?

447
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:14,293
Well, I don't know, Tina.
Would you?

448
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,541
Wow, you really just don't
trust anybody, do you?

449
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:21,604
You do have to trust somebody, sweetie.

450
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:25,090
This is no way to live.
You don't have to be alone.

451
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,978
Who says I'm alone?

452
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,592
Okay, I don't know.
Great!

453
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:32,191
Who is he?

454
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:35,465
- Or, you know, or who is she?
- Oh, God.

455
00:28:35,677 --> 00:28:37,102
What?

456
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,654
What happened between you
and I was a one-time thing.

457
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,985
Yeah, okay.
It was actually four.

458
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:44,988
But who's counting?

459
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:48,373
Please, come on. Who's the hero?
Let me know. Do I know him?

460
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,588
- No comment.
- Really?

461
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,207
Is he famous?

462
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:55,288
Married?

463
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,092
Married and famous?

464
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,830
All right, doesn't matter.
I don't care.

465
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:04,489
I don't care.
I'm just glad that you're happy.

466
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,833
- And I'm really glad that we did this.
- I am, too. This is nice.

467
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,915
Honey, I'm serious. I don't want
any more bad blood between us.

468
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:11,494
I really don't.

469
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:14,615
Not until the music stops and
you make a run for my chair.

470
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,583
Honey, life is not a battle.

471
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:21,299
You have got to stop
looking for the enemy.

472
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:22,838
You're gonna get what you ask for.

473
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:24,011
- Really?
- Yeah.

474
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:27,117
Oh, cause when I was eight,
I asked for a pony.

475
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,440
Sorry.

476
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:30,751
But I'll tell you this:

477
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:32,990
- you got a really big heart.
- Thank you.

478
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,615
And I wish you'd let it
show a little bit more.

479
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,528
I really do, and I'm telling you,
I promise, I am not--

480
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,550
I'm not after your job.

481
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,122
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

482
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:47,119
Well, I'd put it in writing if
I thought that'd make a difference.

483
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,912
But, I know that that won't, so...

484
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:52,416
Thank you for lunch.

485
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:15,536
You can't just go to Vanity Fair.
It doesn't work like that.

486
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,558
You've gotta be kidding me.

487
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,990
Lucy, it's a profile.

488
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:23,883
- There's no scandal attached to it.
- Okay, well, let me do your profile.

489
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:26,146
- On the cover?
- Yeah.

490
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:30,889
Life after Julia.
Your new found fame.

491
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,936
Your childhood. I, uh--

492
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:36,330
Our readers want more than
just nanny blowjob stories.

493
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,183
Well, why don't you talk to Steven,
my publicity now, all right?

494
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,422
Wait.

495
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:48,097
- Are you having hurt feelings?
- Why would I be having hurt feelings?

496
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:50,900
Because maybe you thought
I wanted to see you for another reason?

497
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:53,322
Well, did you?

498
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:55,465
Did you?

499
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:13,061
I actually did call
just for the article.

500
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:18,550
Your publicist won't talk to DirtNow.

501
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,077
So you didn't call me,
you had me meet you?

502
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,885
Nice try, Lucy.

503
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,932
It's okay, you know?

504
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:30,810
- What?
- That you want me.

505
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:38,363
You think the whole world revolves
around you and your glorious cock.

506
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,108
You're such a goddamn narcissist.

507
00:31:41,277 --> 00:31:44,744
Yeah? And what does that make you?
A narcissist lover?

508
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:47,609
- Do you think I love you, Holt?
- Well, do you?

509
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,766
I might have, um...

510
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:58,645
- I think I might have fallen--
- God damn it, you were followed.

511
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,029
Oh, shit.

512
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:02,594
Put your seatbelt on.

513
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:14,961
What the hellare you doing?

514
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:17,032
Given both our situations,
we're a story.

515
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:18,795
- Yeah? How do you figure?
- I'd run it.

516
00:32:20,392 --> 00:32:22,196
We're gonna start with
the Fincher premiere.

517
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,870
You're gonna get
really cozy and personal.

518
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,278
- What?
- Your cover story. I'm multitasking.

519
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:31,093
Shit.

520
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:35,090
Oh, God.

521
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,671
My God, that guy
really wants the shot.

522
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,746
Whoa, holy shit, Lucy!
It's not like they have guns!

523
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,189
Yeah, it's worse.
He has cameras.

524
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:50,248
It's okay. Hold on.

525
00:32:58,377 --> 00:32:59,442
Okay. Get out.

526
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,906
- What?
- I'll call you later.

527
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:03,357
How am I supposed to
get back to my car?

528
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:06,411
You're a movie star with your
very own cell phone. Figure it out.

529
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:08,068
Come here.

530
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,808
- What?
- We have your stalker.

531
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,986
<i>- Where?</i>
- Your house.

532
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:24,106
Oh, my God. Okay, arrest him
and get him out of there.

533
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:27,144
It's more complicated.
You need to get over here.

534
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,880
Why? Who is it?

535
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:29,997
<i>Gareth?</i>

536
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:33,120
Shit.

537
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:56,872
Okay, tell me who it is.

538
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,106
I'm sorry, Lucy.

539
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:01,649
Don't tell me that it's Don, because--

540
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:02,958
I can't take it.

541
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:15,012
It's not him.

542
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,728
We found the images he
sent you on his computer.

543
00:34:20,463 --> 00:34:21,715
Leo?

544
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,181
It was me, Lucy.

545
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:36,651
Don't arrest him,
but just get him away from me.

546
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:37,807
Lucy.

547
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,812
What on Earth could you
possibly have to say to me?

548
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:43,531
After what happened with
Jack Dawson, I was so hurt,

549
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,804
and so angry,

550
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:49,617
and I couldn't get you to see what
you were doing to people. To me.

551
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:50,735
To yourself.

552
00:34:51,117 --> 00:34:54,295
I wanted you to feel the same terror
and helplessness as your victims.

553
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:55,605
My victims?

554
00:34:55,836 --> 00:34:58,629
- Oh, Jesus, Leo.
- I'm sorry, Lucy.

555
00:35:00,575 --> 00:35:02,727
- It went too far.
- You think?

556
00:35:03,824 --> 00:35:06,386
You think maybe it went
just a little too far?

557
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:12,930
You think maybe you were just projecting
a little bit of your anger about Dad?

558
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,607
Or at your pathetic family?

559
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:19,762
Or at your own life?
At your sexual indecision?

560
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,786
Or your endless quest for God or peace?

561
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:27,057
You're a goddamn idiot.

562
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:32,951
You terrorized the one person
who loves you unconditionally

563
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,975
because you're uncomfortable
with her career.

564
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:38,792
Way to go.

565
00:35:41,084 --> 00:35:42,586
Before I walked out,

566
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:45,302
I was standing on a chair

567
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:48,487
in my living room with a noose

568
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:50,182
around my neck.

569
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,186
I was ready, Lucy.

570
00:35:53,746 --> 00:35:55,460
I was gonna be just like him.

571
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:57,785
No note,

572
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,039
no explanation.

573
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:03,255
No real attachments.
So the best--

574
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:07,454
that I could do was to try to reach
out to my sister to try to put a dent

575
00:36:08,238 --> 00:36:11,397
in her perfect little system
of justification and denial.

576
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:16,076
I was trying to reach you
because I love you,

577
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,499
and I can't just sit by

578
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:21,561
and watch you slip away
like he did. I'm sorry,

579
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:22,983
Lucy.

580
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:36,397
- Lucy.
- What?

581
00:36:40,692 --> 00:36:41,925
I did it for you.

582
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:03,617
The pharmacist has you on speed dial.

583
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:07,503
Well, when you're a celebrity, all
kinds of whack jobs get your number.

584
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:09,563
Oh, I'll say.

585
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:13,879
But I got his phone records, and
you and this whack job go way back.

586
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:17,858
42 phone calls from
November 12th to the 20th,

587
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:20,324
the longest being 35 minutes. And--

588
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:23,438
then there is the question of the
credit cards to pay for the drugs.

589
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:27,603
You got your story.
What do you need me for?

590
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,415
I wouldn't want to be
responsible for taking down

591
00:37:30,492 --> 00:37:33,034
- your dazzlingly mediocre show.
- Is that right?

592
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:34,652
Could be.

593
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:36,573
And what does Lucy
get out of the deal?

594
00:37:36,939 --> 00:37:38,210
Lucy gets nothing.

595
00:37:38,808 --> 00:37:43,007
Willa, however, takes this little tidbit
and puts it in her own personal vault,

596
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:44,865
and owns you

597
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:49,193
and your first of many favors to come is
exclusive access to Lexus Falk family--

598
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,025
- I don't know if I can deliver that.
- You can and you will.

599
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:54,061
Any gossip in the fashion world,

600
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:57,566
any supermodel bullshit,
any anything comes to me.

601
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,359
Your mother must be proud.

602
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:04,033
Yours, too, what with
the drug deaths, and all.

603
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:14,506
Lucy, we have the family
on the model story.

604
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:16,143
<i>I thought it was a shut-out.</i>

605
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:18,416
I guess we got lucky.

606
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:20,958
Nice work, McPherson.
Lock it up.

607
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:34,053
Honey, I promise.
I'm leaving in five minutes.

608
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:36,499
<i>- Tina, it's Lucy.</i>
- Oh, hi.

609
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:38,194
I thought you were
my other half.

610
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,299
<i>What's up?</i>

611
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,852
I see you signed your contract.

612
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:43,911
That's right.
Tina is off the market.

613
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:45,895
But hey, I gotta tell you,
that rumor really--

614
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:47,012
Nicely played.

615
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:48,842
I just wanted to wish you well.

616
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:52,174
Aw, right back at ya, sweetie.
Hey, listen, let's keep in touch, okay?

617
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:54,398
Why don't you come over
for dinner, see the baby?

618
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:55,612
Again with the baby?

619
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,020
<i>I'd like that.</i>

620
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:01,082
Okay, great. All right, honey,
I've gotta run, though, okay?

621
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,931
- You take care of yourself.
<i>- You, too.</i>

622
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:04,805
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Okay, bye-bye.

623
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:07,405
I'm so sorry about that.

624
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,429
Do you want something to drink?
Like a water or soda?

625
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:13,107
- You can't have wine, right?
- Um, right.

626
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,743
All right, well, let's get one
thing straight. You're my hero.

627
00:39:16,974 --> 00:39:18,650
You really are, and I mean that.

628
00:39:18,707 --> 00:39:20,942
What you have been through
since Kira's death, I--

629
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:22,521
I just can't imagine.

630
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:26,337
Um, you said on the phone you
might be able to do an article?

631
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,788
Yeah. You mean, to repair the
damage of the sex tape? All that?

632
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:34,960
You're just trying to
keep your career afloat.

633
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:38,344
That Lucy Spiller, she had no right.

634
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:40,656
No right.

635
00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:50,049
Come on! You know what? You just got
caught in Lucy's celebrity dollhouse.

636
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,129
You didn't do anything wrong.

637
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:55,696
Your boyfriend was her source.
None of this press is your fault,

638
00:39:55,754 --> 00:39:59,067
so please, just know that.
You really have
to know that.

639
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:02,072
Her source?

640
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:03,766
Holt?

641
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:06,521
- Oh, I know.
- No, I know him.

642
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,680
He would never be a source.

643
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:15,493
Okay.
Well, you know what, I really, uh--

644
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:19,422
I really did not want
to have to show you this.

645
00:40:19,557 --> 00:40:24,796
But I think it's better that you see
it now, you know, from me, than, um--

646
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:31,670
He was-- he was more than her source.

647
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:56,302
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

648
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:07,321
You ready?

649
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:10,346
You know it's intense out there.

650
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:14,294
All right.

651
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:21,850
Lumina, Lucy Spiller.

652
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:25,254
Tell my brother that I'm
putting his shit in the driveway,

653
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,180
and if it's not gone by morning,

654
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,933
I'm giving it to the gardeners.

655
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:43,791
Hi, Lucy.

656
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:48,163
Julia, what are you doing here?

657
00:42:48,356 --> 00:42:50,494
You ruined my life.

658
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:53,441
I'm sorry.

659
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,348
I was thinking about
that article you wrote.

660
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:01,583
It was actually pretty good.

661
00:43:04,258 --> 00:43:05,625
But I have some cuts.

662
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:25,083
- Hello?
- Don...

663
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:28,608
I need you to get
to my house right away.

664
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,491
Don't call 911

665
00:44:33,281 --> 00:44:35,438
<i>until after you get the pictures.</i>

666
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:36,594
Okay.

667
00:45:08,977 --> 00:45:10,094
<i>Lucy?</i>

668
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:23,685
It's okay, Lucy.
Help is on its way.

669
00:45:24,465 --> 00:45:26,044
You're going to be okay.

670
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:32,998
I didn't do this! It was the forces.
I didn't do this!

671
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:35,014
I didn't do this!

672
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:43,547
Oh, my God!

673
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:48,452
Oh, my God!
