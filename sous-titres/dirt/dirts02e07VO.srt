2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:04,466
- Ted.
- Ted?

3
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,344
He's not the right one.

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,668
I thought that maybe we could do
the press room together.

5
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:20,460
Don't take this the wrong way,
Sharlee,

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,567
but we're... we're...
we're done here.

7
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:25,320
You've built an empire on nothing.

8
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:27,405
You're welcome.

9
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:28,782
Don, I need this.

10
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:30,533
Sharlee and Mia, that is it.

11
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:33,203
I'm sorry, Lucy, you know,
there's nothing there.

12
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:35,455
Give me the recorder.

13
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:37,164
Don, give it to me.

14
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:39,542
She is not a person,
she is a product.

15
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,813
I figured that,
after we slept together,

16
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,594
the least I could do is give you
my personal email address.

17
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:57,663
A little something
for all your efforts tonight.

18
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:00,397
One of my assistants just
dropped in the room.

19
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:07,935
All right!

20
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:31,728
<i>Lucy, it's your mother.
Paul's birthday is coming up.</i>

21
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:33,861
<i>I'm going in for another
touch-up this morning,</i>

22
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:35,822
<i>but I want the surgery
to be his surprise...</i>

23
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,754
<i>you know, his little present.</i>

24
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:40,634
<i>I'll be away for a few days,
and I'll be in a lot of pain,</i>

25
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:43,100
<i>which should make you very happy.</i>

26
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,956
<i>Okay. Well, I gotta go.</i>

27
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:49,146
<i>Eduardo, my Kundalini yoga
master, is here.</i>

28
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,716
<i>And just so you know,</i>

29
00:01:50,836 --> 00:01:53,124
<i>I was younger than you
when I got my first touch-up.</i>

30
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:54,967
<i>You should think about it.</i>

31
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,488
Hello?

32
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:03,449
Holy shit.

33
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:22,161
He looks like a very large Smurf.

34
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:25,981
That can happen
when someone continues to breathe

35
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,289
with little or no oxygen

36
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,068
entering the lungs.

37
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,832
Okay, well, then,
what's with the...

38
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:33,950
Erection?

39
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,885
Suffocating must have really,

40
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:39,495
really...

41
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,249
excited your friend... sexually.

42
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:48,004
Then I can positively say that
that is Brent Barrow.

Season 2 Episode 7
<i>In Lieu of Flowers...</i>

47
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,661
- Good morning, Lucy.
- Gather everybody in the bullpen.

48
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,651
Hey, Perri Tatum,
former sitcom queen,

49
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:15,904
- Trim N'Fit spokes person...
- Love her. Go.

50
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,875
According to my source at the ad
agency that handles Trim N'Fit...

51
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:20,131
This sucks.

52
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:21,842
The copy, not your idea. Go ahead.

53
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:24,082
She supposed to shoot her
quarterly weight loss photos,

54
00:03:24,242 --> 00:03:27,252
the only problem is that she's packed on
about 30 of the 80 pounds she lost.

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,463
Loving it more. What's the story?

56
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,532
Her people have contacted
a handful of doctors

57
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:34,300
about Perri coming in
for a little lipo,

58
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,332
you know, so it'll appear
the diet's working.

59
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:38,359
The problem is,
Perri has a heart condition

60
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,731
that ups her chances of dying
in surgery to, like, one in a hundred.

61
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:45,343
So every doctor has turned her down,
except for this one surgeon up in Ojai

62
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:48,484
who's willing to do the surgery
if she signs a waiver.

63
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:52,237
God, I love stupid celebrities.
Just makes my life so much easier.

64
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,563
That's really good work.

65
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,885
Don't screw it up with
your Harvard words.

66
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:57,740
Okay, everyone.

67
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,816
Our publisher,
Brent Barrow, is dead.

68
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:02,745
What?

69
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:03,706
Yes.

70
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,956
He passed out in his garage

71
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:09,376
while his car was running,
and died of carbon monoxide poisoning.

72
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:12,630
There's a service on Thursday.
Kenny will e-mail you the details.

73
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,465
You're all expected to attend,

74
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,503
even those of you
who couldn't stand him,

75
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,636
and we all know who we are.

76
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:36,020
He literally partied himself to death.

77
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:40,033
And you could really see it
sticking up through the body bag?

78
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:40,953
Yes.

79
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:43,540
Yes. It was horrible.

80
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,331
That's too bad,

81
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:49,277
because if he had
ever done anything else

82
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:51,590
of note in his life,
he'd be my next cover.

83
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,601
So why is this bugging you so much?

84
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:54,806
I don't know.

85
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,675
Poor thing, he just tried so hard.

86
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:01,418
It was pathetic. I mean,
the guy died trying to fit in.

87
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,297
You know what?

88
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,114
When I first moved to Hollywood,

89
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:09,265
someone told me to be careful
what you ask for,

90
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:11,197
because you just might get it.

91
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:14,290
I think he got what he asked for.

92
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,625
I don't think you have to
be careful what you ask for,

93
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,278
you just have to be very specific.

94
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:19,864
Really?

95
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:21,178
Yeah, okay.

96
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:22,324
What?

97
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,243
What are you thinking?

98
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:31,483
Just thinking about
how beautiful you are.

99
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,923
I'm sorry I'm obsessing on this.

100
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,770
I should be obsessing
about the fact

101
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,845
you're gonna do a movie
with Claire Leland, the black widow.

102
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:45,941
She does want me,
and she's gonna seduce me, so...

103
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:48,099
I'm sure she's gonna try.
What are you gonna do?

104
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,557
Hey, take it easy.

105
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:52,997
I've been over the edge.
I'm not going back.

106
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:54,148
Oh, yeah?

107
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:56,554
Besides, I already have
one woman I can't handle.

108
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:58,589
What the hell am I gonna do
with another one?

109
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,524
So you gonna keep talking...

110
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,013
Or are you gonna give me
a reason not to succumb

111
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,395
to Claire Leland's little
evil seduction?

112
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:10,123
- God, you're such a little shit.
- Come here.

113
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,209
- No.
- I swear, I won't do anything.

114
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:14,871
- I swear. It'd be good.
- I know.

115
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,941
Wouldn't it be good? Too bad.

116
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:27,851
- Oh, yeah.
- I got it.

117
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,893
- No, I think that's mine.
- My God. You kicked me in the face.

118
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:32,803
Your feet smell terrible.

119
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,689
It's mine. Farber.

120
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:39,434
Right now?

121
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:42,030
Right. Jesus,
I mean, you know, of course.

122
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,387
Give me a second.

123
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:47,756
What?

124
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:50,199
I hate to do this, but...

125
00:06:50,364 --> 00:06:51,947
I have to leave.

126
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,082
- Where?
- Just help a friend.

127
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,169
He's... He's in trouble.

128
00:06:56,824 --> 00:06:58,339
Car trouble? Girlfriend trouble?

129
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,840
The kind of trouble with red
flashing lights and a siren.

130
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,842
What'd he get busted for?

131
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,447
It's totally stupid.

132
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:07,180
That's it?

133
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,016
You're not even gonna tell me
what this is really about?

134
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,976
I just did. It's totally stupid.

135
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,401
What?

136
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:19,821
- You don't believe me?
- No, no, no, I believe you.

137
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,235
Yes. It's just...

138
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,004
Nothing. Forget it.
Just go. It's fine.

139
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:37,335
If you're gonna snoop,

140
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:40,413
which I guarantee
that you're going to now,

141
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:43,345
you're not gonna find much.
So knock yourself out.

142
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:51,144
Thanks for bailing me out, man.

143
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,083
I'm kind of surprised you called me.

144
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:57,353
Other than playing poker,
it's not like we hang out.

145
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:58,976
No one else is around.

146
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,253
It's, like, party weekend, so...

147
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,454
They're all down in Palm Springs.

148
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,994
Actually,
there's a reason I called you.

149
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,259
You work for Dirt.

150
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:17,488
What, you want me
to write about this?

151
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,906
Wait, wait, here...
How's this for a title?

152
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:21,629
Former teen heartthrob busted

153
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,921
barebacking bartender in bathroom.

154
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,851
It was just a blowjob,
for Christ's sake.

155
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,541
What do the cops think goes on

156
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,111
in a place called
the Iron Fist anyway?

157
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,385
How much trouble am I in, man?

158
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,325
I mean, is this gonna get out?

159
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:42,037
- I mean, there's a police report.
- But not under my stage name.

160
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:43,984
You gotta help bury this, man.

161
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:47,012
Keep it out of Dirt.
I just landed this role.

162
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,873
First decent role
I've had in 7 years.

163
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,367
Since the series ended.

164
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,369
It's funded by this Christian group

165
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:56,617
that doesn't even know I'm gay.

166
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,483
If this gets out, I'm out.

167
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:01,586
I am flat broke, Farber.

168
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:04,379
I seriously need this paycheck.

169
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,591
I'll do what I can.

170
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:10,601
Okay. Once this
paycheck comes in...

171
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:13,872
screw these right-wingers
or those 12-year-old girls

172
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,001
that ever had a crush on me...

173
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,935
I will come out in Dirt.

174
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:19,605
Your story. Exclusive.

175
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:22,773
Hell, I'll probably get a parade

176
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:25,135
out of this or something.
Stupid reality show.

177
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,052
As soon as the check clears, man.

178
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:29,134
Because,
if my boss finds out about this,

179
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:32,116
I'm gonna be the one bending
over and grabbing my ankles.

180
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:08,659
Where'd you learn to eat, a barn?

181
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,267
I'm sorry. It's like
a thousand degrees hot.

182
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:13,937
I don't know
why they serve it this way.

183
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:16,953
I usually have better
manners... table manners.

184
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:18,746
- My brother, Jason...
- It's okay.

185
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,787
It's... Just slurp softer.

186
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:23,708
I am sorry.

187
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,220
I said it's okay.

188
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,964
- No, about this.
- What are you... My God!

189
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,974
You people have
no boundaries! Stop it!

190
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:33,562
Gee.

191
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:35,763
Lucy Spiller from DirtNow magazine,

192
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,598
she knows about your surgery.

193
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:40,559
You go in for the lipo,
she's gonna write about it.

194
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,436
That is none of her business.

195
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:51,487
As our Lord and Savior, God's son,

196
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:52,946
said on the cross,

197
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:54,702
it is finished.

198
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,578
So our Lord will welcome

199
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:02,831
Brent Barrow into Heaven.

200
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:06,276
And Brent Barrow is
now feasting at God's table.

201
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:09,505
And we must feel a joy for Brent

202
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:13,676
because there will come a day
when we all

203
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:16,227
will be feasting
at God's table with him.

204
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:20,059
Now, if any of Brent's friends,
family,

205
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,227
or colleagues wish
to say a few words,

206
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:27,079
I encourage you to please stand
and speak from your heart.

207
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,341
Are you off your medication?

208
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,128
Astute.

209
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:50,587
Daring.

210
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:52,281
Ambitious.

211
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:58,553
So, I kinda figured

212
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:01,182
that you owed me
for the other night.

213
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,517
- Jesus, here?
- Yes.

214
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:11,955
A step ahead in a world
where most people

215
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:14,402
are two steps behind.

216
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:16,488
Many people find these

217
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:18,949
qualities abrasive,

218
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:22,535
but I found in Brent

219
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,703
a kindred spirit.

220
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:30,152
Let God be his judge!

221
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,045
Because if I hear of anyone

222
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:35,618
under my employ making judgments,

223
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:38,908
you will be terminated.

224
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,110
<i>Adieu</i>, Brent Barrow.

225
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:58,139
I will miss you, my friend.

226
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:18,156
You know, if I thought
he wouldn't throw up on the rug,

227
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:20,112
I'd invite him over for dinner.

228
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,098
I'd invite him anyway.

229
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,315
- If you don't mind me watching...
- God!

230
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:30,770
Keep going.
You won't be the first ones.

231
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:33,983
Jesus.

232
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,140
Hey, Lucy, your brother's
been on hold for 30 minutes.

233
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,978
He says it's urgent.

234
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:57,916
Kenny, you'll learn
that my brother's entire life is urgent.

235
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,968
Unfortunately, none of it ever
turns out to be very important.

236
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:12,278
<i>There was a problem
with Mom's plastic surgery.</i>

237
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:14,327
<i>She died.</i>

238
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,532
So, was it important?

239
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:26,611
Yes, it was.

240
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:29,079
My mother's dead.

241
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:33,730
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,503
What about if I can sleep over,
you know?

243
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,259
I'll call Jason and...
He won't mind.

244
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:54,329
I'm okay, sweetie. Thank you.

245
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:56,625
I'm fine.

246
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:08,327
Okay, I'm not.

247
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:09,875
Death...

248
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:14,416
I get it. It's guaranteed,
I understand that.

249
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,044
But why does it seem
that everybody is oblivious

250
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:21,204
to the fact that they're swimming
in deep water until they drown?

251
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,926
Because we're stupid.

252
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:27,325
We all do stupid things, Lucy.
I have, you have.

253
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,581
We just don't think
they're gonna kill us.

254
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,397
You know, about...

255
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:41,602
the Sharlee tape, I'm... I'm sorry.

256
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:42,820
It's okay.

257
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,586
It's not okay, it's just that...

258
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:50,160
I'm glad to see that you're
healthy enough to stand up to me.

259
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,633
All right, I'm on dut...
If you need me, you...

260
00:15:57,753 --> 00:15:58,738
Thank you.

261
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,690
Hey, your story on that singer
and her extreme sport boyfriend?

262
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,173
All true according to TMZ.

263
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:08,440
They have a video of some stripper
giving him a pretty racy lap dance.

264
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,849
That's perfect. See if we can get
some stills for the article.

265
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:24,647
Mitchell Bianchi.

266
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,137
Detective Ortiz?

267
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:39,305
Hi. It's Willa McPherson.
Did you like the champagne?

268
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,029
Great! Listen, I'm trying
to track an arrest sheet

269
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,392
for a Mitchell Bianchi,
very early wednesday morning.

270
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:50,554
Yeah, still the same fax number.

271
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,364
How's the shoot going?

272
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:04,943
Lucy, I'm so sorry
to hear about your mom.

273
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,925
<i>I'm kinda sorry that I had
to hear it from my publicist.</i>

274
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,175
I'm sorry...

275
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,295
You're working and I just...

276
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,079
I didn't want to bother you.

277
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,956
Come on, Lucy,
you can't bullshit me.

278
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:22,136
All right Holt, I don't want
to talk about this, okay?

279
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,329
Let me just get through
the next couple of days.

280
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,068
All right. I'm gonna come back to LA

281
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:29,580
- as soon as we wrap tonight, all right?
- No!

282
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,970
This is not the way I want
people to find out about us.

283
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:38,121
Hello?

284
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,982
<i>I'm here.</i>

285
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:44,730
All right, I don't need you angry
with me right now. Not over this.

286
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:48,028
Let me just figure this out on my own.

287
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:53,663
You know what most people do?

288
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:55,661
They lean on each other.

289
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,662
<i>It's called being
in a relationship.</i>

290
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:00,847
You're not most people, Holt.

291
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:04,421
I don't even think I am anymore...

292
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:08,201
<i>let me just deal here and you focus
on making a great movie.</i>

293
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,050
I don't function well inside this box.

294
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:12,961
I know.

295
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:15,532
I'll call you, okay?

296
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:21,534
Holy shit!

297
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,148
I used to kiss
your poster every night.

298
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:30,726
"Giving oral assistance to another
male in a public restroom..."

299
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:32,968
I guess my fantasy
of us having a big wedding

300
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:35,938
and lots of babies
is certainly not happening.

301
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:42,661
So, these are some of Mom's favorite
outfits and she loved yellow roses,

302
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:45,664
so I ordered an arrangement
from you and me.

303
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,553
Her favorite outfits
and yellow roses. I'm here.

304
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,258
Paul wrote a poem for the memorial.

305
00:18:57,378 --> 00:18:59,280
- A poem?
- Six verses.

306
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:02,835
You gotta say something
for the senior shack-up.

307
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:06,105
Do you want to say anything
at the memorial?

308
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:08,417
I've said enough.

309
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,051
She loved you.

310
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:15,532
That wasn't the issue.
We didn't like each other.

311
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:19,437
Nah, I'll go with the heels.

312
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,308
What am I saying? She's in a box.

313
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,959
I just wish there was something
we could've done to stop her.

314
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,423
Leo, plastic surgery
was her opiate.

315
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:29,087
No one could have stopped her.

316
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,935
You know, the one thing I know
Mom would have wanted was

317
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:36,405
to look great in her casket
to make her friends envious.

318
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:38,597
But with the botched surgery...

319
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,041
What's for lunch, Perri?

320
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,047
I'd like to eat in peace, guys.

321
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:54,321
Come on. What's on the menu?

322
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:56,155
A turkey hot dog.

323
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:59,325
Okay? It's on my diet
for Christ's sakes. Come on!

324
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:00,945
I like it, I like it.

325
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:03,288
Come on, Perri. Come on, Perri.

326
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,706
Come on, hon. Give us
a show, give us a show.

327
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:07,179
Come on, get up!

328
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:10,365
Show us what you got!
All right! Here we go!

329
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,021
I am fat!

330
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:15,637
Okay? So what?

331
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:16,850
Yeah! I like it!

332
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,409
Is this what you want?
You want me to go...

333
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,473
My fat ass! Okay?

334
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,605
How about these? Big titties!
That turn you boys on, huh?

335
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,492
Don't wanna miss my belly!

336
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:30,494
Come on, take Tatum's fat belly!

337
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:35,213
You know what?
Now it's my turn to shoot!

338
00:20:52,424 --> 00:20:53,518
Oh, shit.

339
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,840
Oh, shit. What did I do?

340
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:02,278
You just became the patron
Saint of celebrities.

341
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:10,084
After placing the implants,
we will enlarge both aureoles,

342
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:12,805
making sure
that they're symmetrical.

343
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:15,569
Excuse me, I'm in the
middle of a consultation.

344
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,058
Your tits are fine.

345
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:19,660
Could you wait outside?

346
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:23,000
- Who are you?
- I'm Lucy Spiller.

347
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,579
- You killed my mother.
- I didn't kill her.

348
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:28,040
She had internal bleeding
from scar tissue...

349
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,001
Scar tissue from too many surgeries.
Surgeries you performed, doctor.

350
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:34,378
- I'm calling the police.
- You ought to call your lawyer.

351
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,580
- You can't...
- I can.

352
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,576
And the ensuing article
will not only cover

353
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,386
the 3 people who died from
your surgeries over the last 17 years,

354
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,222
but also how you're
a devoted family man

355
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:46,655
and an elder at
your Hillcrest Presbyterian Church

356
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:49,489
while you keep a junkie mistress
in the Marina.

357
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:52,404
I'm sorry about your mother,
but I could not know...

358
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:54,398
I haven't even gotten
to the best part.

359
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,537
- What's this?
- This is your patient list.

360
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:00,696
It's a "Who's who"
and the surgeries they've had done.

361
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,241
It's gonna make
for great copy, isn't it?

362
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,217
I mean, it's gonna
kill your business,

363
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:07,367
but, man, am I gonna sell
some magazines!

364
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:10,638
What do you want?
Free plastic surgery?

365
00:22:10,992 --> 00:22:13,262
- For life?
- Hello?

366
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:15,801
You just killed my mother!

367
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,364
- Can you believe this guy?
- Unbelievable.

368
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:22,991
Dr. Sandburn, if you want to keep off
the cover of my magazine,

369
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:25,194
you're going to make
my mother look better in death

370
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:26,723
than she ever did in life.

371
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,791
- I'm not a mortician.
- You're right, you're better.

372
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:32,117
So cancel your Botox
and your butt lifts

373
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:35,292
for the next couple of days,
because my mother's memorial is friday

374
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:36,863
and it's open-casket.

375
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,574
And by the way, from now on you're
going to be my go-to guy for stars

376
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,568
and what they have done.

377
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:44,956
I'll call you.

378
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:47,431
Leo, be a man. Punch him.

379
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:56,104
Sorry.

380
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:10,349
- Hey, Sharlee, what'd you buy?
- Just some stuff for the baby.

381
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,928
Move! You guys, please move.

382
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:14,647
- Hi, Don.
- Hi.

383
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:19,376
- Come on, Sharlee.
- Come on, Sharlee.

384
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:21,251
That's a good family photo!

385
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,340
Love the boots, Sharlee!

386
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,879
Come on, turn around!

387
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:27,900
Come on!

388
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:29,988
Freakin'move!

389
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:31,871
Get out of my face!

390
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:33,622
Come on, Sharlee, come on!

391
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:36,241
Move! Get the hell out of my way!

392
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:39,231
Don't be so rude, Sharlee, come on!

393
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:46,191
It's okay, baby Romy.
We're gonna get home in a second.

394
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:47,583
Okay.

395
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,805
- Come on, Sharlee.
- Freakin'paparazzi!

396
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:52,905
- Whoa, Piece of shit! Move!
- Hey, your stroller,

397
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,101
sweet cheeks!

398
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,074
Sharlee, come on!
Stay with us, Sharlee.

399
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:58,614
Shit!

400
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:00,232
Stupid door!

401
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:04,153
Get out of my face!

402
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:07,864
Whoa! Hey, Sharlee,
the car's rolling.

403
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,117
The door's locked!

404
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:11,835
- Romy!
- Mom.

405
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:14,080
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

406
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:16,290
Please... Move!

407
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:18,782
Can you open the door?

408
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:20,040
Help me!

409
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,296
Romy!

410
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:22,776
Romy!

411
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,507
Romy! Oh, my God.

412
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:26,921
Romy! Can you help me?

413
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,721
Romy! Oh, my God!
Somebody please help!

414
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,597
Oh, my God. Oh!

415
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:35,684
Stop! Romy!

416
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,060
Romy!

417
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:55,778
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

418
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,688
Are you okay?

419
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,590
Thank you, Don.

420
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:16,378
I'm sorry I didn't get the shot, Lucy,
but the truck

421
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:18,890
was rolling down the h...
and the baby

422
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,769
- was crying--
- Don, you did a great thing, seriously.

423
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,331
I mean, just don't ever
let it happen again.

424
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:24,679
Hey, there you are! Okay,

425
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,193
I just got this from my source
at the emergency call center.

426
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:28,663
It's... It's gold.

427
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:31,448
9-1-1 emergency operator.
Name and location, please?

428
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,210
Perri Tatum! 714 Sky View Drive,
in the Palisades.

429
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,537
I need an ambulance!

430
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:38,372
What seems to be the problem, ma'am?

431
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,583
I was trying to do this colonic and now

432
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:42,463
I'm lying here in... shit!

433
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,503
I just can't get this tube out of...

434
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,922
Just get me a goddamn ambulance!

435
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,872
Un-shittin'- believable!

436
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,860
And I mean that literally.

437
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,522
The woman hates herself so much

438
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:55,083
she tore herself a new asshole.

439
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:56,348
Go get a picture of
Perri in the hospital.

440
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:58,392
You go with him.
Get her side of the story.

441
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:00,437
What are you, a Bobble Head? Go!

442
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,130
Hi, Carol. This is Lucy Spiller.

443
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:12,881
I need some shots of Sharlee
from the grocery store today.

444
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:15,767
Yes, the ones that everyone wants.

445
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:18,695
Yeah. Did you also get some
of Don saving that kid?

446
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:22,000
Okay, great. Throw those in, too.

447
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,818
Yeah, it's a nice thing he did.
I want to give him a gift.

448
00:26:24,938 --> 00:26:26,188
Okay. Thank you.

449
00:26:36,826 --> 00:26:38,661
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

450
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:45,038
- How'd you get in here?
- It's my job.

451
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:48,609
Uh, before you do that, Miss Tatum,
we have a copy of your call to 9-1-1.

452
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,063
Okay? But listen.

453
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:52,791
Dirt Now Magazine
wants your side of the story,

454
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:53,961
exclusively.

455
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:01,622
You run that 9-1-1 call, people are
gonna think I have shit for brains.

456
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,960
Not after hearing the tape.

457
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,544
They won't think you had an
ounce of shit in you, much less brains.

458
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:09,964
You parasites like kicking
people when they're down.

459
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:13,234
We're offering you an
opportunity to kick back,

460
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,774
if you'll take it.

461
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,551
I've seen Lucy Spiller.

462
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:20,622
What's she weigh?

463
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:22,592
About a hundred pounds wet?

464
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,662
Give or take.

465
00:27:26,752 --> 00:27:27,902
You tell her.

466
00:27:28,495 --> 00:27:29,945
She screws me over,

467
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,163
I will hunt her skinny
ass down and I will

468
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:35,397
crush her like a grape.

469
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,960
I'll happily pass along the message.

470
00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:40,747
So you'll talk?

471
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:42,872
Ask.

472
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:47,342
Mitch Stanton.

473
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,502
Not stopping me from having to pee.

474
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:51,519
You know, the ex teen star
of My Dad's the Maid?

475
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:54,702
He just got busted having oral
in the bathroom of a gay bar.

476
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:56,171
'Cause that's never happened.

477
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,304
Unless he was blowing
a senator, who cares?

478
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:00,560
He just got the lead in God's Warrior,

479
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,094
a movie being produced
by Evangelical Films.

480
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,445
You know, the Christian movie company?

481
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:08,759
- I like the irony, but still...
- Oh, could you just read it?

482
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:10,129
- Now?
- Yeah.

483
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:13,624
Well, don't come with me.

484
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:15,294
We're not girlfriends.

485
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,850
All right. I'll run it.

486
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:24,354
In the back of the book.

487
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:25,871
Figures.

488
00:28:27,568 --> 00:28:29,118
Wait for me, my love.

489
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,857
Wait for me...

490
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:34,582
until we finally mate celestially.

491
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,481
We'll make heaven as hot

492
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,900
as hell might wish to be.

493
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,900
And when we then embrace,

494
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:44,626
our spirits free,

495
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,709
we'll blend and

496
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,410
mix and merge

497
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:51,599
ephemerally.

498
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,408
And then at last we'll know,

499
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:55,678
sweet Dorothy,

500
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,016
the meaning

501
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,514
of eternal ecstasy.

502
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:02,121
If deaths come in threes,

503
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,487
I hope he's next.

504
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,955
I should... talk to Paul.

505
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:10,637
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:15,787
Hey, you didn't have to come.

507
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:18,957
No, I love you, Luce, and
I don't mind dead people.

508
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,512
Lucy.

509
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:23,972
Your mother was a wonderful woman.

510
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:26,105
Generous with her time and talents.

511
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:27,602
And such a blithe spirit.

512
00:29:28,343 --> 00:29:30,613
- Thank you.
- One question, darling.

513
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:34,596
Who did your mother? We all agree,
she looks 10 years younger.

514
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,236
She died on his table.

515
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:39,775
Oh! Oh, it's tragic. Really. But...

516
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,243
if she had to go, at least
she went looking her best.

517
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:48,552
I can't believe I was raised
by such a selfish woman.

518
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:51,714
I just... I resent that.

519
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,196
I really resent it!

520
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:55,284
She just had so many insecurities.

521
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:57,506
Well, we all have insecurities, Luce.

522
00:29:57,694 --> 00:29:59,444
But, Don, hers killed her.

523
00:29:59,884 --> 00:30:01,120
She... Okay.

524
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:04,091
You know, I always thought that
one day I would have the chance

525
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,824
to become friends with her, to...

526
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:07,794
to make some sort of peace.

527
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:10,019
And now... now you can't do that.

528
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:12,583
I know.

529
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,188
Yeah, we all need someone
who's got our back.

530
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,234
Thank God I have you.

531
00:30:22,302 --> 00:30:23,488
Always, Luce.

532
00:30:25,272 --> 00:30:26,522
And I have you.

533
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:32,124
But you need someone other than me
you can share your life with.

534
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,080
You have somebody in mind?

535
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:37,116
See?

536
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:39,492
See, I like it when you smile.

537
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,468
Makes me believe that
everything's gonna be all right.

538
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,362
Well, I also smile when I want
to rip somebody's head off.

539
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:49,932
Yeah, but I believe everything's
good when you do that too.

540
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,705
You're sweet.

541
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,697
Hey, this is Holt. Leave a message.

542
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:47,346
Hi.

543
00:31:47,894 --> 00:31:49,577
I was just, um,

544
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:52,131
wanting to call you.

545
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,579
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

546
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:56,549
Bye.

547
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:02,587
Oh, Don.

548
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,536
So sweet.

549
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,196
I gotta thank you.

550
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:15,593
I just learned a valuable lesson

551
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:17,156
- in who to trust!
- You would've done the same thing.

552
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:19,826
No! I would not have
done the same thing.

553
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:22,556
If I had known
you were going to bail out

554
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:24,236
your little gay friend,
I wouldn't have.

555
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:27,406
What's the big secret anyway?
I mean, next time try honesty.

556
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:29,308
You didn't just say that.

557
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:31,325
Look, I've been with guys
that keep secrets from me,

558
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:32,661
and it always ends up in one place:

559
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:36,290
- me getting screwed over.
- Yeah, well, now you know why.

560
00:32:37,718 --> 00:32:39,595
This runs now, and it's
worth nothing, okay?

561
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:41,693
Mitch'll get dumped from the
movie and then he's a non-story.

562
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:44,024
Well, he should've worried about
that before he knobbed some

563
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:45,694
bartender in a toilet.

564
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:48,255
All I'm asking is that you
wait until the movie is shot,

565
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,529
and then he's gonna come out in
the magazine. I mean, that is a cover.

566
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:54,999
It stings getting scooped
by your girlfriend, doesn't it?

567
00:32:56,431 --> 00:32:57,934
Willa stole this story

568
00:32:58,054 --> 00:32:59,566
by sticking a knife in my back.

569
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,684
Well, take it out and get back to work.

570
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:03,654
Trust me, knife wounds heal.

571
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:12,324
Yes.

572
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:16,541
But how much in Euros are we talking?

573
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:19,916
Twenty-two million? Close it.

574
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:23,250
Sorry.

575
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:26,220
Buying a place next to Clooney in Italy.

576
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:30,558
I don't mean to take you away
from your busy day. I...

577
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:34,306
wanted to tell you how sorry
I am about your mother.

578
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:36,808
Well, you sent flowers.

579
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,066
- I did?
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:42,237
Oh. Well, I wanted you to
hear it from my lips.

581
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:44,920
Thank you.

582
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,790
While I was at Brent's...

583
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:50,253
collecting some

584
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:52,124
things I'd left there, I

585
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:55,572
discovered a collection
of homemade sex tapes.

586
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:58,331
- You know, it doesn't surprise me.
- Granted,

587
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,542
his system isn't
as sophisticated as mine.

588
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,655
I have a multi-camera system
in my bedroom.

589
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,025
The quality of Brent's is crude, but

590
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,411
slyly effective.

591
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:09,830
Okay. And?

592
00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:20,766
I didn't view it. Out of respect.

593
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,525
- Respect?
- You don't believe me?

594
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:28,357
No. I-I believe you.

595
00:34:29,097 --> 00:34:30,847
Because this is bullshit.

596
00:34:31,276 --> 00:34:33,353
Oh, come on. Barrow and me?

597
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:36,535
Give me some credit.
I wouldn't bang him with your dick.

598
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:49,712
Willa with a wig.

599
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,874
That girl never ceases to surprise.

600
00:34:57,172 --> 00:34:58,765
Can I have the rest of those tapes?

601
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:01,906
Just for safe keeping?

602
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,820
I'll have one of my assistants
drop them off.

603
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:13,752
Well, McPherson, I hope it was
as good for you as it was for me.

604
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:23,228
I have a copy of Brent's autopsy.

605
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:27,836
As Lucy said, he died of carbon
monoxide poisoning, but

606
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:30,466
the list of drugs in his system
is pretty startling,

607
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,620
if, um...

608
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,708
if anybody is interested.

609
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,046
Mitch.

610
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:46,074
Oh, my God!

611
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:48,454
You lying sack of shit!
I lost the movie!

612
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,594
I don't even have enough
money to pay my own rent!

613
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:53,118
- Look, I didn't write...
- Somehow, some way...

614
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:56,199
- I'm gonna return this favor, okay?
- Look, Mitch. Stop it! Stop it!

615
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:59,212
Farber didn't write the story
about you. All right? I did.

616
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:01,814
We had a thing and I found out
about you, and I ran with it.

617
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:04,579
- It's not his...
- So what? So what?

618
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:07,986
What am I supposed to do, not hate
Farber now? Is that what you want?

619
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:09,120
Okay.

620
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:11,171
I don't hate him anymore. Feel better?

621
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:12,892
I just think he's pathetic

622
00:36:13,012 --> 00:36:15,362
for hosing a heartless bitch like you.

623
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:43,432
How are you?

624
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:44,977
Okay.

625
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:48,319
I gotta be back to set tomorrow, but I

626
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,289
kinda got the feeling
you need me here tonight.

627
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:53,071
That's sweet.

628
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:56,304
No, but wait a second.
Before you let me in, um,

629
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,802
know something.

630
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,190
Look, as soon as I'm
done with this movie,

631
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:05,233
Julia or no Julia...

632
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:09,446
I'm going public with this relationship.

633
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:12,357
So you have an option.

634
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,217
You have to make a decision here.

635
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,081
If, um...

636
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:19,175
If you don't let me in...

637
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:24,807
that's going to be
the end of us, all right?

638
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:28,038
I'm not going to be happy about it,
but I'll understand,

639
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,162
so...

640
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:33,831
But if you do let me in...

641
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:37,424
We can't hide this anymore.

642
00:37:39,064 --> 00:37:40,814
We can't. I can't do that.

643
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:49,131
So, you gotta... you gotta make the
decision here. You gotta figure it out.

644
00:38:06,694 --> 00:38:08,062
Get you anything?

645
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:10,373
No, I think I'm good.

646
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:22,910
Oh. I want to introduce you to somebody.

647
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:28,150
Holt, this is my mom.

648
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:30,329
Mom, this is Holt.

649
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:36,816
It's nice to, uh, meet you

650
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:38,609
finally,

651
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,511
Mrs. Weston.

652
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:46,531
I just want you to know that
I have every intention of taking

653
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:49,101
full advantage of your daughter tonight.

654
00:38:49,753 --> 00:38:52,003
So if there's any objections, um...

655
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:55,852
let me know, all right?

656
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,021
- Give us a second here?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

657
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:02,191
Let the woman speak. Thank you.

658
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:09,131
Thank you. I appreciate that.

659
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:12,121
She loves me.

660
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:13,773
She does.
I don't know what to tell you,

661
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,979
but she does.

662
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,210
She approves, too.

663
00:39:20,855 --> 00:39:22,484
T H E  E N D

664
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:25,337
Thanks to: ChemicalChiara, Vally,
gi0v3, Yossarian, Hutch.
