00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,471
<i>Hi, I'm Don Konkey.</i>

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,725
<i>Some people think the sex at
Dirt Now is a little much.</i>

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,135
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,954
<i>That's my friend and editor,
Lucy Spiller, having sex.</i>

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:16,008
<i>Lucy's stalker left her a photo
of her and Holt having, well,</>

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,728
<i>sex, which she chose
not to share with him.</i>

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,797
<i>That's Julia Mallory.</i>

8
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:25,386
<i>She's been having a little trouble</i>

9
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:27,616
<i>getting her career going
since she left rehab.</i>

10
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,924
- So, what's the girl's part like?
- She's gotta be super-young.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,802
I'm gonna get the sex tape back.

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,873
Here's the original tape.

13
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:43,144
<i>I Don't think Willa's little threesome
went over very well with Lucy.</i>

14
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,692
This is your problem.
You need to fix it.

15
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,831
Donny?
Is that you?

16
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,559
You little wuver.

17
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,199
<i>I came clean about a secret
that's been bothering me for years.</i>

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,923
- She called me little lover.
- Your stepmother.

19
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,157
I've met her.

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,126
Sometimes I liked it.

21
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,509
Don, you know none
of that is your fault, right?

22
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,365
No, Lucy, I Don't.

23
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,671
<i>We all struggle to stay sane.</i>

24
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,793
<i>I'm schizophrenic,
so for me, it's harder.</i>

25
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,674
<i>I focus on getting the shot.</i>

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,869
<i>I focus on getting the story.</i>

27
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,018
Oh, my God, Don,
you're bleeding.

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,344
No, it's his blood.
I got it on me.

29
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,122
Wait a minute.
Whose blood?

30
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,025
Whose blood, Don?

31
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,973
Jesus, Don, what did you do?

32
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,799
<i>But this shot,</i>

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,092
<i>this story,</i>

34
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,403
<i>it wrecked me.</i>

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,826
<i>This is the story of
how it all fell apart.</i>

36
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,205
<i>It's the story of misplaced trust.</i>

37
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,879
<i>Of deception and betrayal-- </i>

38
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,783
<i>not by our enemies,
but by our friends.</i>

39
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,593
It's the story of America's favorite
spoiled celebutantes.

40
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,343
The inseparable Tuesday Nelson
and Lulu Cagle.

41
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,232
Famous for being famous.

42
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,834
We want to shop where they shop.

43
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,240
Party where they party.

44
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,476
Wear what they wear, or Don't wear.

45
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,543
And get up close and
personal with Lulu's fiance',

46
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,024
boho artist Tommy Spiro,
who pisses on the press,

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,550
won't sit for an interview,

48
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,688
and is currently getting it
on the side

49
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,587
from his true love's best
friend forever, Tuesday.

50
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,293
- What a dog.
- My source is solid.

51
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,029
If we move fast enough, we can expose
this little bastard

52
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,532
before he ruins this
precious friendship.

53
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,133
Okay, this is our cover.

54
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,170
Go on, my little monkeys.

55
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,057
Come here.

56
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,583
Look what somebody threw away.
A perfectly good camera.

57
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,882
Too bad it's got
this shit all over it.

58
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,126
This is our yard, es\.

59
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,401
You Don't litter in our yard, homes.
Huh?

60
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,734
Take this shit.

61
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,754
Remember these two faces. I Don't
want to see you around here again.

62
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,496
I'm not leaving my camera.
I want to get my fu-- oof!

<b>Dirt - Season 01 Episode 11 -
"Pap Smeared"</b>

67
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,561
MTV is optioning out props from
18 seasons' worth of <i>Real World</i> sets.

68
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,630
I want to do a "Best-of" list.

69
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,166
Okay, I'll have one of the interns
go through the DVDs.

70
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,670
- No, I want you to do it.
- That's busywork.

71
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,639
Then get busy.

72
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,112
Already?
I Don't pay you enough.

73
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,549
I didn't get everything you need.

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,385
No, you didn't.
Don, I need her with Tommy.

75
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,088
I'm going back.

76
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,957
- All right, I'm sorry. I love you.
- Ow!

77
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,759
What?

78
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,930
I fell over.

79
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,099
You fell over?

80
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,167
No...

81
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,471
There was a couple of guys.
It's not a great neighborhood.

82
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,007
You got mugged?

83
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,542
I'm okay, but they took my camera.

84
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,980
All right, we'll take care of it.
Here, Don.

85
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,683
I want you to carry this.

86
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,920
It's a stun gun: 300,000 volts.

87
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,357
- Okay?
- No, Lucy, you keep it.

88
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,460
It's all right.
It's my spare.

89
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,509
It's okay.

90
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,098
How does it feel?

91
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,100
I Don't know, and you Don't need
to find out.

92
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,369
Don! This will mess with
your nervous system.

93
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,173
Please, I'm serious.
Don't play with it.

94
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,476
- Okay.
- Don.

95
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,845
I know.

96
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,320
All right, just this once while
I'm here. Just on the leg.

97
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:23,488
Oh, God.

98
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,470
- Fun's over.
- Okay.

99
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,574
Thanks, Lucy.

100
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,519
How you wanna do this?

101
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,988
I Don't know.

102
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,291
Battery acid?

103
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,397
It never was.

104
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,035
We won't talk about it.

105
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,670
Pinky swear.

106
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,772
Come on, pinky swear.

107
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,610
Like Men in Black, with the flashing
light that erases your memory?

108
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,911
Yep.

109
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,883
Or we could just burn it.

110
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,619
Your turn.

111
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,931
Easy there, tough guy.

112
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,469
Is that it?

113
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,438
I think so.

114
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,574
Unless you have something
else you want to break.

115
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,243
What else you got?

116
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,030
- Hey, my brother.
- Hey.

117
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,098
- Tuesday and Lulu in the house?
- For sure.

118
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,001
- Tommy?
- No.

119
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,137
Lulu tossed this, though.

120
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,405
You know that show they're doing, right?

121
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,741
Got today's call times.
100 bucks.

122
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,410
50?

123
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,912
Okay, man.

124
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,952
Thanks.

125
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,219
Hey, want to buy a security tape?

126
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,605
Celebrity upskirts.

127
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,685
I'm good.

128
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,868
Don Konkey.

129
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,268
You hear about this psycho?

130
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,637
He cut off his pinky for a cover shot.

131
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,941
Spiller's got you by the
balls, donkey boy.

132
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,210
Hey, assface, how much you get
for your little finger?

133
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,480
The bitch pay up?

134
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,748
Collin De Quisto.

135
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,007
Last sale, Jessica jogging on the beach.
$1,000 non-exclusive.

136
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,686
If you'd have stayed
longer that day,

137
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,090
you might have got her and
Nick's lunchtime reunion.

138
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,191
Bauer-Griffin got $50,000 for that set.

139
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,060
Double that for international
syndication. That's your problem.

140
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,863
You've got no follow-through.

141
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,901
Screw you, Konkey!

142
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,607
Remember these two faces.

143
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,859
Tina Harrod just pulled her cover
on Denise Richards.

144
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,553
I can't confirm it, but I'm guessing
Tulu and Tommy.

145
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,937
- Does she have pictures?
- Called around the agencies.

146
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:29,956
Nothing's come in, but my source says
she's holding the cover open.

147
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,171
She's seems pretty confident.

148
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,640
Well, it's not over yet.

149
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,424
What's the name of that animal charity
that Tuesday fronts?

150
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,110
Friends of Fin, Feathers, and Fur.

151
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,112
They raised $25,000 in a day

152
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,115
for a duckling that had
its neck broken by a beer bottle.

153
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,116
Wow.

154
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,752
If only the homeless were just a little
cuter and fuzzier.

155
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,188
- You want me to squeeze the charity?
- I know.

156
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,058
However will I sleep?

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,871
Mr. Konkey?

158
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,208
Mr. Konkey?

159
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,614
I found this out there in front
of the store. Is it yours?

160
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,249
No.

161
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,052
My name's Marqui.

162
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,790
How come you Don't shoot digital?

163
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,628
It's not my lens cap.

164
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,264
Yeah, I-- I know.

165
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,602
You get lots of covers.
I've heard of you.

166
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,237
I was just thinking, do you ever--

167
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,339
you need somebody to carry your stuff?
Or...

168
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,541
No.

169
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,144
I Don't want anything--
Any money or anything.

170
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,713
I just want to learn.

171
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,553
- Mr. Romero wants to talk to you.
- Don, they're G 13 pictures.

172
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,322
- Is he with you?
- No.

173
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,791
Get lost.

174
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,227
Get in.

175
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:03,301
Muchachos.

176
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:06,645
Muchachos, never mind.

177
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,105
The mountain will come to Mr. Konkey.

178
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,452
Sorry my shooters roughed you up.

179
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:14,606
Ozzy Romero.

180
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:18,111
You know, we're a new agency.
Need to make a splash.

181
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:20,436
We own this story.

182
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:22,361
Now, you need to find another one.

183
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:26,814
Now, if you want to stick with this job,
you're working for me.

184
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:28,878
Get whatever he shot.

185
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:35,866
- Give it to me!
- Okay, okay.

186
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:37,781
Here you go.

187
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:44,426
I got a job.

188
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,107
Let me know if
you change your mind.

189
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,826
I'll even throw in a bonus to cover
the damages to your car.

190
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,889
You want some of that? Huh?

191
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:10,886
I press send,

192
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:12,842
and your license plates
go to the police.

193
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,744
You've got my number.

194
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:26,623
V*manos.

195
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,719
Need me to give you a ride?

196
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,914
Okay.

197
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:58,571
Hey, let me help you with your bags.

198
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,445
Is this yours?

199
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,516
- Photoshop?
- No.

200
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:32,792
Man.

201
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,908
- Don?
- Oh, hey, Lucy.

202
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:40,203
This yours?

203
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:43,411
He gave me a ride,
'cause those guys wrecked my car.

204
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,480
Marqui Jackson.
It's a pleasure, Miss Spiller.

205
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:47,615
Okay.

206
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,593
- What, the guys who mugged you?
- Mm-hmm.

207
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,242
They're photographers.

208
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:55,610
Ozzy Romero.
G 13 Pictures.

209
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:57,578
Ozzy hires gangbangers, Miss Spiller.

210
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,304
I gave you a stun gun.
Use it.

211
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:01,656
- There were four of them.

212
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,678
- I think he did the right thing.
- Okay.

213
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:06,830
There's a kitchen over there.
Why Don't you help yourself?

214
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:08,238
Don, come here.

215
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:10,209
How's your shoulder?

216
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,763
All right, did you call the police?

217
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,435
Let me deal with that.

218
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:17,848
Okay, here's Tuesday's cell
phone number.

219
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:21,218
- What else do you need?
- New windshield.

220
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:23,325
Tempered glass and two new tires
and...

221
00:14:24,814 --> 00:14:26,326
Little Tristan needs worming.

222
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:28,388
Okay, sweetheart,
I meant to finish the story.

223
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:31,794
- And what's with the bag boy?
- He just wants to learn.

224
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,690
- Marcus! Oh.
- Marqui.

225
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:41,437
Come on in.

226
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:44,678
Okay, you do food runs.

227
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,831
You carry his bags.
You drive him around.

228
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:48,962
He wants you to worm his kitty,
you worm his kitty.

229
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,634
You work for Dirt.
Don't screw up.

230
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:51,997
Yes, ma'am.

231
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,486
I mean, no ma'am.

232
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,639
We're down to the wire.
Do what you have to do.

233
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:57,518
???? murder is fine with me.

234
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,477
- Okay.
- Don.

235
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,088
I'm just kidding.
Just get the shot.

236
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:04,356
Okay.

237
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:12,228
Hey, Chuck, it's me.

238
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:15,389
Do you know a gangbanger by
the name of Ozzy Romero?

239
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:21,006
<i>If you'd like to leave a message,
press 1.</i>

240
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,030
<i>If you'd like to page this person,
press 2.</i>

241
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,378
- What are you doing?
- Tuesday's voice mail.

242
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:27,661
It's an Audix system.

243
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:29,745
I can hack in through the admin box.

244
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:31,326
There's a default code.

245
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,232
<i>Hey, Tues, it's Teresa,
the second AD.</i>

246
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:37,019
<i>Tomorrow's call is
pushed half an hour.</i>

247
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:41,452
<i>Hey Tues ????</i>

248
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:46,527
<i>Miss Nelson, this is Mrs. Blake
from the rental agency.</i>

249
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:49,505
<i>The house is ready for you,
and we've overnighted the contract.</i>

250
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:52,875
<i>Just in case it gets lost, though,
here's the tracking number.</i>

251
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:56,028
- You wanted to see me?
- Shut the door.

252
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,286
You've gotta be kidding me.

253
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:11,591
That's what you
called me in here for?

254
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,767
Well, you seemed a little tense
today, so--

255
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,996
So what, you thought that bending me
over your desk

256
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:19,174
for a round of pump the co-worker
would help me relax?

257
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,849
I thought you enjoyed our little
get-togethers.

258
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:24,132
I do.

259
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:25,896
I mean, I did.
I--

260
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,026
Did I do something wrong?

261
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,750
Could you just pull up your pants?
All I can think of is that

262
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,736
you're out of toilet paper.

263
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:39,035
Look, you're a distraction.

264
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,723
I can't-- I can't do this anymore.

265
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:43,752
If I Don't get my shit together,
I'm out of here.

266
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,196
Willa, look.
Come on.

267
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,845
No, you're not listening to me.

268
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:51,141
She's got me watching
videos of old reality shows.

269
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:54,463
This is the editorial equivalent
of Chinese water torture.

270
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,185
Look, we had fun.
Let's just call it--

271
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,453
call it a day and cash out.

272
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:03,292
What, just like that?

273
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,572
Cold turkey?
You Don't wanna

274
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:08,245
- wean off a little?
- No, look. I told you what I want.

275
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:10,223
I want to focus on work.

276
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,282
Besides, there are plenty of
other women in the office

277
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,669
who would gladly fill the role.

278
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,863
Terry needs to be followed with a mop
every time you walk through the bullpen.

279
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,078
Well, you know, Terry.

280
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,831
And frankly, I Don't really see myself

281
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,687
waking up next to those sideburns
for the rest of my life.

282
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:44,192
We're looking for this tracking number.

283
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,704
We have 10 minutes.

284
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:47,353
What are we looking for?

285
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,507
Tuesday's moving in
to a rental house.

286
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,113
I need the address.
It'll be on the contract.

287
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,787
- Isn't this illegal?
- No.

288
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,318
Private businesses handling deliveries

289
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,449
are not covered by federal statutes.

290
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,969
You know, it's just against
company policy.

291
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:05,130
It is illegal to damage mail boxes
and pennies, though.

292
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:07,433
Okay.

293
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:16,219
At the store, why didn't you shoot
Lulu and Tuesday?

294
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,052
That's not the story.

295
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:21,068
Yeah, but wouldn't you wanna
just get the shot?

296
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:24,409
They just shoot.
They Don't think.

297
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,453
I got it. I got it.

298
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,691
There used to be rules.

299
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,085
Don't become part of the story.

300
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,835
But they just, you know.
They got no patience. They just rush in

301
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,326
without knowing what is it
they want to get.

302
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,579
I mean, they get a shot,

303
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:48,871
but they Don't get a story.

304
00:18:51,051 --> 00:18:52,473
Stories are better.

305
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,208
You let Ozzy take your film.

306
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,993
Empty rolls.
Always carry empty rolls.

307
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,804
Then you've got something to give to
security guards when they pull you over.

308
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:06,686
Is that why you Don't shoot digital?

309
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,604
Ha.
Ozzy's gonna be pissed.

310
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:25,062
No.
Oh, no!

311
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,091
Tristan!

312
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:38,991
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

313
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,457
It's okay.
Daddy's here.

314
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:42,840
It's okay.
Come on, sweetheart.

315
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,283
Come on.

316
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:51,912
Mr. Konkey?

317
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,479
Where were you?

318
00:19:58,555 --> 00:19:59,953
I called and called.

319
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,554
You didn't come.

320
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,190
I'm sorry, buddy.
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,824
Don't look at me like that.

322
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:27,672
Go.

323
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:33,893
Whoa, what are you doing?
Wha, what-- no!

324
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,816
- Put that down! Put it down.
- I'm sorry.

325
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,520
No, just--
Damn it, Jason!

326
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:40,674
It's my bathroom, too!

327
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:44,086
You let the light in Now.
You exposed the film. You've ruined it!

328
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,491
- I gotta pee!
- Well, go pee outside in the yard!

329
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:50,271
- What?
- Jason, come here, sweetie.

330
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:52,459
You get away from him!

331
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,758
Do you think I'm pretty?

332
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:58,141
What's the matter, little lover?

333
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,844
- Jealous?
- Get away from him!

334
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,769
You left for college, Don.

335
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:05,693
What,

336
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:08,511
did you think I was gonna wait for you?

337
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:09,875
- Don?
- Ha ha ha ha ha!

338
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,936
Jason, get away from her!

339
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:15,579
If you touch him again,
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

340
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:18,168
Get over here!
I swear to God I'll kill you!

341
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:20,974
Jason, get over here!
Jason, come over here!

342
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:24,365
Jason! Get your ass over here!
Jason, get over here!

343
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,556
Don--

344
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:29,483
You all right?

345
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:33,217
I'm fine.

346
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,035
Who's Jason?

347
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:37,673
He's my brother.

348
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:48,752
I have a brother.

349
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:51,318
He's in jail.

350
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,128
Jason's in Oregon.

351
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:55,682
It's like jail, but with trees.

352
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,233
You miss him?

353
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:03,127
Yeah.

354
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,193
They go over there.

355
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,377
Kitty Rider. Nice.

356
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:36,005
Do you think julia could have
paid someone to follow you?

357
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:40,457
No, if she thought something was
going on, she'd come out and ask.

358
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:42,029
She doesn't set people up.

359
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,966
This is not a setup.

360
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:48,664
What, you have half the
photographers in hollywood on payroll,

361
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,556
and you Don't know who took this?

362
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,257
Yeah, that's bullshit.

363
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:57,219
You're always laying your traps,
aren't you? Spinning your little webs.

364
00:22:57,271 --> 00:22:59,509
Never have I met a more willing fly.

365
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,511
Yeah, well, not anymore.

366
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,121
That's right.

367
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,238
Paid in full. I remember.

368
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,169
I thought we were done with this.

369
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:12,637
It's not that easy.

370
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:17,740
You know what this shit
could do to me, right?

371
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:22,540
Do you know what-- oh, my god.

372
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,121
Do you know what it would do to me?

373
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,390
Can you stop thinking about
yourself for one goddamn second?

374
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,968
I am the one being stalked here.

375
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:37,363
I'm the one who has a stranger in their
house, taking my picture,

376
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:40,770
following me around!
When I'm alone, when I'm sleeping,

377
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:44,009
and Now with you.
I Don't even know what he wants,

378
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,184
or what he's gonna do next.

379
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:48,450
You're thinking about yourself?

380
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,094
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,750
No, you're not.

382
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,396
You think I deserve this somehow.

383
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:04,060
You can go.

384
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:24,284
You know why I'm the only
guy that can make you come?

385
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:29,467
Because I'm the only one that
hates you as much as you do.

386
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:32,155
Really?

387
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:38,089
Or do you just hate the fact that I'm
the only one you can be yourself with?

388
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,020
It's light out.
Get in the passenger side.

389
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,236
Why?

390
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:30,079
People get nervous when they see
a guy sitting in a parked car.

391
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:34,554
If you're in the passenger side, it
looks like you're waiting for someone.

392
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:38,279
What if she changes her mind, decides

393
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:41,125
to go somewhere else?
How long you gonna wait?

394
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:45,185
Patience, persistence, point of view.

395
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:48,702
Three ps. Like the three rs,

396
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,424
buthey're ps.

397
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:54,555
What's the longest you
ever waited to get the shot?

398
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,844
I Don't know. I Don't think about it.

399
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,901
That must be the hardest
part of the job, huh?

400
00:26:04,816 --> 00:26:06,864
You never get time to sleep.

401
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,674
You're always getting arrested.

402
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,613
People spit on you.

403
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,352
And there's always somebody
new trying to steal your job.

404
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:23,049
My cousin, he's a housepainter.
He was up on a ladder,

405
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:26,112
and he saw buffy the
vampire slayer sunbathing.

406
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,701
He took a picture with his
cell phone, sold it for $5,000.

407
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,519
- Lucky.
- Luck.

408
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,676
Not one of the three ps.

409
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:43,541
You ever take drugs to stay awake?

410
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:45,680
To stay sane.

411
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:51,155
Guess it helps to be
a little crazy, huh?

412
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:09,065
It's me.

413
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:11,167
Well, I recognize the voice.

414
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,690
Ah, you said you didn't want
to wake up to sideburns,so -

415
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:16,086
that's why?

416
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:19,276
I wanted to show you that I was serious.

417
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:24,013
Well, I wasn'T.

418
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,765
You... what?

419
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,865
Serious. About the sideburns.

420
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:34,397
Eh... I mean, I didn't like them,

421
00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:38,729
but that wasn't the dealbreaker.
You didn't have to take me literally.

422
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:47,453
Listen, I've got a sales call
in San Francisco on friday.

423
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:52,133
We could hop the corporate jet then hop
down to this little bed and breakfast

424
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,913
- I know in carmel for the weekend.
- No, I Don't think so.

425
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:56,406
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- No.

426
00:27:56,497 --> 00:27:57,639
Come on.

427
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,674
Let's not make this harder.

428
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:22,349
Would you mind if I... showed you
some... some pictures that I took?

429
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,663
You Don't have to.

430
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:28,110
I... just...

431
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,301
tell me if they suck.

432
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:45,482
You got an eye.

433
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:56,858
This one, the way her hand covers his,

434
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:01,436
the way she leans up on
the balls of her feet.

435
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:05,349
She needs him more. She loves him more.

436
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:09,523
Oh, this is good photo journalism.

437
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,787
You got the story.

438
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:14,757
Yeah? You're not shitting me?

439
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:16,790
I got an eye?

440
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:21,946
Oh, that's great. That's great,

441
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:25,101
'cause I mean... I stink
at everything else, so...

442
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,962
this is it.

443
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,912
It has to be, you know?

444
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,930
Hey, do you mind, uh...

445
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,703
I mean, I won't be on you all
the time, or anything, but...

446
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:40,118
do you mind if I just show
you stuff, get your opinion?

447
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:41,440
Okay.

448
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:42,905
Yeah?

449
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:46,477
Oh, thanks. Really, thanks.

450
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:50,233
I know you can teach me
stuff that's not in books.

451
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:55,915
Thanks for coming.

452
00:29:56,242 --> 00:30:00,208
I welcome the opportunity to
meet a new buyer, miss Spiller.

453
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,462
- Lucy.
- Lucy?

454
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:06,349
Well, Lucy, we're a new agency.
We Don't have a track record yet,

455
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,592
but we'll get there.

456
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:11,588
I hear you have a good relationship with
the community from ur drug dealing days.

457
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,917
- No offense.
- Open secret.

458
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:16,089
I'm hoping we can do business.

459
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,219
Nothing would make me happier.

460
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:20,956
Then you're not exclusive
to my competition?

461
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:22,015
Not at all.

462
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:24,409
- So if I made you an offer?
- The door's wide open.

463
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,991
And I take it we're both talking
about the same photograph?

464
00:30:27,095 --> 00:30:28,194
We are.

465
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:32,042
I'm not talking long lens or
out of focus. I need a cover.

466
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:34,594
You'll see his tongue in her mouth.

467
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,133
- How much?
- May I?

468
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,397
Excuse me.

469
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,145
Sorry. Business. You know.

470
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,920
I think we can make this happen.

471
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:00,595
Impress me.

472
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:03,854
And here I thought I already did.

473
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:28,622
<i>Hi. Ozzy romero just promised
me a cover before closing.</i>

474
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:32,107
<i>He did time for dealing.</i>
He's too dumb to do this alone.

475
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:35,893
Probably knows someone on the inside.
Probably someone he knows from Tommy.

476
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,032
<i>Where are you?</i>

477
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,694
Outside Tuesday's rental.

478
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,315
<i>Okay, forget about the
house. Follow Ozzy's guys.</i>

479
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:43,893
Oh, and Don, he's using a two-way.

480
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,201
I got it.

481
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:47,701
<i>G 13 pictures</i>. Let's go.

482
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:51,785
We spent all night watch
Tuesday's house. Now we're leaving?

483
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,829
Here's the book. I can't
make the newsstand meeting.

484
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:08,355
We'll have to reschedule.

485
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:12,190
Did you lost a bet?

486
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,768
- Lay off willa.
- Excuse me?

487
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,019
You had your fun. Let it go.

488
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:22,014
She's a good reporter. She doesn't
deserve to be watching real world reruns

489
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,605
Wow, did you shave off
your balls as well, brent?

490
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:25,900
Will you lay off her?

491
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:29,609
I can't have my staff thinking that
a barrow blow job is a hall pass.

492
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,812
She dumped me.

493
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:33,322
Does she get points for that?

494
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,913
- Yeah, a few.
- Yeah.

495
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,678
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

496
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:40,136
You want me to warm up a teapot
and have a heart-to-heart?

497
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:41,589
We'd be one heart short.

498
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:44,160
Grow 'em back, brent.
Your balls, I mean.

499
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:45,619
You'll feel better.

500
00:32:54,734 --> 00:32:57,434
Julia?
Hi, it's Laura Baum!

501
00:32:57,486 --> 00:33:00,391
We met when I worked with
jonathan. How are you?

502
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,831
I was his assistant.

503
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,469
- Oh, of course. How are you?
- I'm good. Oh.

504
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,855
Can I just say how great you look?

505
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,537
Seriously, you look great.

506
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:14,739
Thanks. I was supposed to talk to
quinn about the guy ritchie project?

507
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,693
Right. Quinn's on a conference call.
He's hoping to join us later,

508
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:21,572
but he's really slammed.
He's so sorry.

509
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,801
Excuse me a second.

510
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,584
What's the damage?

511
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:30,052
You're shitting me, right? $2,700?

512
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:33,075
It was a goddamn fender bender.

513
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,914
Right, fine.

514
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:39,416
In case you're wondering,
this is why people hate greeks.

515
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:42,811
Uh, maybe i should call quinn.

516
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:44,648
Oh, no, he's got me totally up to speed.

517
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:48,202
It's gonna be $2, 700? I mean,
that's after the deductible.

518
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:50,850
We let these people in our
country, we give them our business,

519
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,516
and it's like, "thanks
for the opportunity.

520
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:56,742
" All right, so maybe we
should just do this later.

521
00:33:57,175 --> 00:34:00,892
No, I'm sorry. It's,
phew. Letting it go.

522
00:34:02,114 --> 00:34:03,710
The guy ritchie project.

523
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:07,440
They love, love, love you,

524
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:10,319
but it's a pass.

525
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,666
It's a pass?

526
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,218
But that was a great meeting.

527
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,163
I Don't understand.

528
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:21,086
I know. It's not fair.

529
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:26,881
That said, how would you
like to be killed on csi?

530
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:29,551
What?

531
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:31,422
Jesus!

532
00:34:31,474 --> 00:34:33,241
- It's a top 10 show.
- I Don't care.

533
00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:35,979
I Don't want people
thinking of me like that.

534
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,743
Julia, the problem is, people
aren't really thinking of you at all.

535
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,959
Get me in again.

536
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:46,014
Honey, I'm sorry.

537
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:48,278
They're going a different way.

538
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:55,092
- Okay. Will you give quinn a message?
- Sure.

539
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,206
All right. I love, love, love him,

540
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:01,024
but I'm going a different way.

541
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,738
Tell him he's fired.

542
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:07,780
Oh, shit.

543
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:23,613
<i>Hey, it's me. Is Ozzy there? Hold on.</i>

544
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:24,927
So you can here everything?

545
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:29,029
They're using push-to-talk.
800 megahertz smr spectrum.

546
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,259
<i>I need to see you kiss
her: in good light, sharp.</i>

547
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,019
<i>Out front, then. Near the street.</i>

548
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,737
That's gotta be the
insider! You got him!

549
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,060
<i>How soon?</i>

550
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:42,522
<i>This isn't a train. Just park yourself.
When we're ready, we'll get there.</i>

551
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:44,109
- Great.
- Let's drive.

552
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,125
Where are we going?

553
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:47,579
Weren't you listening?
"We'll come out. " It's Tommy.

554
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,202
Tommy's the insider. He's
playing both girls for a headline.

555
00:35:58,399 --> 00:35:59,904
Hey, babe.

556
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,291
Hey. How did it go?

557
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:07,554
Julia, hey.

558
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:09,595
What's wrong?

559
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:14,054
They didn't want me.

560
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:17,263
Oh, babe, come on. They're assholes.

561
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:19,474
Hey, Don't cry.

562
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:20,784
Come on.

563
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:23,358
She wants me to do csi.

564
00:36:23,702 --> 00:36:25,007
- Who does?
- Sally.

565
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,853
Suzy, whatever.
Jonathon's old assistant.

566
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:32,308
Jesus, I mean, last week,
she was getting me water.

567
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:34,429
Wait, so quinn wasn't there?

568
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:38,381
- All right, I'm calling him.
- No, I fired that jerk.

569
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:43,638
- You fired him?
- Yeah.

570
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:46,701
God, I even paid ann marie to dress me.

571
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,552
You look beautiful.

572
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:15,655
Keep still.

573
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,803
What if they set us up?

574
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,142
Why aren't they here?

575
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,552
They'll be here.

576
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,104
I could go back to her house.

577
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:39,570
Stay here. Be patient.

578
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:41,364
Just in case. Back up.

579
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:46,014
- I mean, it's been almost four hours.
- We stay here until we get the shot.

580
00:38:00,324 --> 00:38:04,830
What if they change their plans? I'm
gonna go get the scanner from the car.

581
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:06,415
Okay.

582
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,122
Hey, I know you.

583
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:32,333
I'm just on my way home, okay?

584
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:35,129
Bullshit! He's got
the cameras in the car.

585
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:37,735
- Where is he?
- Who?

586
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:39,131
Don't play with me.

587
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,662
Oh, the crazy guy? I ditched him.

588
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:44,529
Why split the sale?

589
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:46,505
That's how you want to play it?

590
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:51,611
You're mr. Tough guy, huh?

591
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,000
You like that?

592
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,617
You want some more?

593
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,750
You like to zap shit, huh?

594
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:15,566
We're gonna kick your ass!

595
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,287
How do you like that, bitch?

596
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,459
What are you gonna do, bitch? What?

597
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,646
Fry, bitch, fry!

598
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,570
Hey, guys, we're missing
the shot! C'mon, let's go!

599
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:10,467
ambulance. 481 vine.

600
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:18,628
You're gonna be okay.

601
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:22,390
Can you-- can you hear me? Don't move!

602
00:40:22,465 --> 00:40:25,023
Yeah, Don't move.
Don't move, Don't move.

603
00:40:25,736 --> 00:40:29,498
You probably got some-- you--

604
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,774
Don.

605
00:40:44,132 --> 00:40:45,730
Don.

606
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:49,371
I'm sorry.

607
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:05,685
No.

608
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:16,488
The ambulance is coming.
The ambulance is coming,

609
00:41:16,563 --> 00:41:18,632
and they're gonna fix you up. Okay?

610
00:41:18,633 --> 00:41:21,456
So you're gonna be okay.
But Don't move, okay?

611
00:41:21,457 --> 00:41:25,200
You Don't move. You can't move,
but, uh, they'll be here soon.

612
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:26,366
I promise.

613
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,359
But I gotta go.

614
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:33,989
I-- I-- I gotta go.

615
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:38,672
Sorry!

616
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:42,242
Come on, people, why am I
still waiting for my mock-up?

617
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,691
Oh, thank god, Don.

618
00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:45,553
Danielle, rush processing!

619
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:47,340
Push it to 3200.

620
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:49,296
It's gonna be a great story.

621
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,468
Oh, my god, you're bleeding.

622
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:57,020
No, it's his blood. I got
it on me, but I did it.

623
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,616
Whose blood? Jesus, what did you do?

624
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:01,367
I got you your cover.

625
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,815
Whose blood, Don?

626
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:06,144
Marqui'S. He's hurt really bad, Lucy.

627
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:08,494
Yeah, I'm sure he's gonna be all right.

628
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:10,006
Don, will you wait in my office?

629
00:42:10,085 --> 00:42:12,709
Images in 15 minutes, but you
need to write the cover line Now.

630
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:14,611
Okay. All right. Don? Don, wait!

631
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:16,309
- Lucy?
- All right!

632
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:18,303
Oh, shit.

633
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:09,582
Lucy?

634
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:12,549
It's the <i>Real World</i>.

635
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,812
What's with the text boxes?

636
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,537
I went back and called the cast members

637
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:20,322
from the past seasons to find out
what they've done since the show,

638
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:22,683
pull quoted the most
interesting stories, and, um...

639
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:24,688
it's a mini "Where are they Now?".

640
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:29,236
You called every cast
member for the past 18 seasons?

641
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,547
Couldn't track a few, but yeah.

642
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:37,472
Well, we Don't have room for
it in this issue, but, uh,

643
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:38,958
I'll keep it on hold.

644
00:43:41,935 --> 00:43:43,815
What's that on your hands?

645
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,522
Oh, my god.

646
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,867
What's going on?

647
00:44:08,843 --> 00:44:09,990
Shut it down.

648
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:12,680
How? We Don't know
where it's coming from.

649
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:19,891
All right, what are you all
looking at? Close the book.

650
00:44:19,947 --> 00:44:21,057
