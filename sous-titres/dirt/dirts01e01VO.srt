1
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,883
Lucy, I just need five minutes
of your time for my new client.

2
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,686
Oh, my gosh,
she look ridiculous.

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,765
<i>I'M GAY!!!</i>

4
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,206
<i>HOLLYWOOD HOOKUP!!!</i>

5
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,149
Hey, sweetie. Listen, Jessica wants
you to print a retraction.

6
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,373
- She's really...
- Not now.

7
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:52,585
Ok. So we'll talk about it...
Yeah, that's good.

8
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,857
<i><u>Celebulimia?!?</u></i>

9
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,498
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,501
What's that, Harvey?

11
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,705
No woman should leave their drink
unattended in these troubled times,

12
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,707
most of all you.

13
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,844
You ever heard of
Jatropha Curcas?

14
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,080
- Your second wife?
- No.

15
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,115
It's a poisonous plant
that grows in the tropics.

16
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,085
Very difficult
to detect,

17
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:29,355
flavorless, and it kills
in about 15 minutes.

18
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,560
Do you have any idea of how
many of these people would

19
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:39,332
like to see you laying on the ground
begging for somebody to call 911?

20
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,904
Damien Fields,
less than 20 feet away.

21
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,741
You have pictures of him blowing
some guy in Griffith Park.

22
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,010
At least we shot
his good side.

23
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:56,349
Cara Valente.
Expose' on her and her nanny.

24
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,884
- Manny.
- Right. Manny.

25
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:04,657
And that time-lapse series on the
hooker parade on and off my yacht.

26
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,828
That was very clever.
And very funny.

27
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,797
It didn't even
make the cover.

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,966
You're hardly Spielberg, Harvey.

29
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,233
Certainly not anymore

30
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,137
after becoming a punch line
in one of your magazines.

31
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,274
You know, that divorce cost me
two out of my three houses.

32
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,710
In Hollywood, that's
practically homeless.

33
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,380
- You know why I'm not afraid?
- Mmh?

34
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,784
Because you and all of your
Hollywood pals read my magazines

35
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:36,022
and secretly love them.
And you know every word is true.

36
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,492
And as much as you all
hate to admit it,

37
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,628
you need me.

38
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,971

Prince Tyrese had the floor
tonight with 26 points

46
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:50,691
and a triple double.
How does it feel?

47
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,132
Feels good. Wish they
could all go down like that.

I'll play good,
don't get hurt.

Make sure I make it to my kid's parent
teacher conference. All right, Tommy.

51
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,476
Wise words indeed
from tonight's Pontiac MVP,

Prince Tyrese.

53
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,014
Keep it.

54
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,385
Sorry.
I'm happily married.

55
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,857
I don't care if you're
on your deathbed,

56
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,792
your mother's on fire, we're
at the brink of a nuclear war.

57
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,629
I want those photos
on my desk tonight.

58
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,265
Okay.
Give my love to Maria.

59
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767
Okay, everybody,
what do you got?

60
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,404
We have about a dozen
really ugly celeb butt shots.

61
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,273
Great.
We have Britney?

62
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,140
Oh, yes.

"Pass the Cottage Cheese."

66
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,049
That's good, but it's
a little too abstract.

We have a lead on the mistress
in the Pagliaca murder trial.

71
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:53,959
Do you have
any confirmation?

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,495
It's gonna cost us
to get her story.

73
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,607
What does she
look like?

74
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,363
Not bad. Slutty.

75
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,565
Good. We love slutty.

76
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,100
Tell her if she doesn't talk to us,

77
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,915
we're gonna run it without
her side anyway.

78
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:05,972
Excuse me.

79
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,117
- Just make it happen.
- Okay.

80
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,520
I got $1,500 and I got
two envelopes.

81
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,189
I need those shots, Don.

82
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,190
No problem.

83
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,649
Okay, anything
on the Blogan bump?

84
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,713
Nothing on the blump,
but I was chilling with

85
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,790
Mary-Kate's trainer's best
friend this weekend,

86
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,769
and she was saying that she
might be going back to rehab.

87
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,038
Really? Anything else on that?

88
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:41,466
No, but I thought we could do, like

89
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,501
a thing about her struggle
with addiction and...

90
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:45,778
Right, her struggle.
Um, okay.

91
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,748
Listen, there is actual reporting
involved in what we do?

92
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:51,461
Our readers want to know
that people actually screw up

93
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,952
and that they actually sleep with
hookers and that they lie,

94
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,856
so no "a friend of a friend."
That would be gossip,

95
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,891
and gossip is what
lands you in court.

96
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,461
The only real defense
we have is the truth,

97
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,597
preferably with photos.

98
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,676
<i>Never send anything over your TREO you
wouldn't want the whole world to see. </i>

99
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,578
Duffy, you're fired.

100
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,682
McPherson, you've got a week
to convince me not to fire you.

101
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,385
Duffy, you have five minutes
to clean out your desk.

102
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,753
Shit.

103
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,088
Remember, the people that
we're going after every day

104
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,087
are not stupid.

105
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,227
They've risen to the top
one way or another,

106
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:36,214
so we have to be faster, bolder,
and smarter than they are.

107
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:39,066
If you think we're behind here,
you should see your sister magazine.

108
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,501
If anything breaks, I'm reachable.
Guys,

109
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,002
have fun.

110
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,883
<i>Hi, Don.
Are you in place?</i>

111
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,117
<i>Yes. The housekeeper
let me in.</i>

112
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,854
I already gave Stormy
half the money up front.

113
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,258
Okay, great. Tyrese is leaving
training right now.

114
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,827
<i>- Are you okay?
- Huh?</i>

115
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,596
<i>- Don?
- Yeah. Hmm.</i>

116
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,899
I don't know.
I'm okay.

117
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,302
<i>Don, are you taking
your medication?</i>

118
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:20,169
Don, have you been
in touch with Dr. Shalbo?

119
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,240
Because I cannot go
to the pharmacy for you.

120
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,810
Okay. Sorry.

121
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,341
Can you still do the work?

122
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,846
<i>- Yes.
- Are you sure?</i>

123
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,623
<i>Do you want someone
to cover the premiere?</i>

124
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:29,714
No, I got it.

125
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,117
<i>Go for Holt McLaren.
Make him mad.</i>

126
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,455
That's right.
Then I'll take over from there.

127
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,763
<i>Oh, Prince!</i>

128
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,068
Unh! Unh!

129
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,092
I think it's your turn now.

130
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,419
Hey, Lucy.
Want some chili fries?

131
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,255
God, no.

132
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,422
Did you get
Prince Tyrese and the hooker?

133
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,024
Yeah.

134
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,125
You got everything?

135
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,294
I got 'em having sex
for two hours,

136
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,162
and the coke,
and he choked her, and the strap-on.

137
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,798
Don, not so loud.

138
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:53,900
Okay.

139
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,687
- Julia!
- Julia!

140
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,601
Johnny! Johnny!

141
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,971
Holt, can you step out while we
get some pictures of the stars?

142
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,185
Holt McLaren?

143
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:47,620
Yeah.

144
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,722
You were great in
"Another Word for Love".

145
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:50,755
Thanks.

146
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,991
I mean really great, like...

147
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,960
like stop-the-presses great.

148
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,829
Yet somehow the presses keep going, huh?

149
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,864
Haven't seen you in the trades lately.

150
00:09:59,024 --> 00:09:59,528
Huh?

151
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,100
Haven't seen you in the trades lately.

152
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,902
I took some time off.

153
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,838
You did, like, seven movies in a row,
and they all bombed.

154
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,074
Yeah, I did.

155
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,071
Countdown, Blown Monkey, Pale Assassin,

156
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,735
The Growling, Hap Patale,
13 Telling House Lane.

157
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,181
That's only six.

158
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,049
Get Even: uncredited cameo.

159
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,220
Wow, you're creepy, man.

160
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,690
You're always great in everything
you do. You know, you're authentic.

161
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,758
Thanks.

162
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,927
Anything coming up?

163
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,328
Huh?

164
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,696
Anything coming up?

165
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,998
Uhm...

166
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,001
I'm, like, in talks in this...
this cool Fincher movie.

167
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,169
It's a great script. We'll see.

168
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,438
It sounds pretty vague.

169
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:39,905
Huh?

170
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,642
Sounds pretty unlikely,
like the movie probably won't happen.

171
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,777
Anyway, take care man.

172
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,216
- Hey, Holt. Holt. Holt, Holt.
- What?

173
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:51,547
They have great chemistry.

174
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,419
And he's not very good, but they're good
together, you know.

175
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,888
They look hot together.

176
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,457
- What?
- There was a rumor

177
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,459
he screwed her on the movie.

178
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,497
- What the hell did you say?
- Ahh, I don't believe it,

179
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,166
but I can find out... d-d-definitively

180
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,567
if you wanna know.

181
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,169
What are you talking about?

182
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:14,373
That way, maybe you could give me a
little piece of gossip, o-or a big one.

183
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,977
And that way, I could help you
get your career out of the toilet.

184
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,114
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

185
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,315
Take it easy!

186
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,689
That's good work, Don.

187
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,791
That's great work.

188
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,726
I want to see that footage first.

189
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,561
Get out of here.

190
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,531
<i>Hey, Holt, why don't you smile, buddy?</i>

191
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,399
Yeah, right here, pal.

192
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,003
<i>The other day...</i>

193
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,705
<i>I was in a fight with this guy.</i>

194
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,775
<i>He was being an idiot.
He was on the floor, you know.</i>

195
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,210
<i>He looks back up at me,</i>

196
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,814
<i>and I'm all like,
"I know Crumb McGuff, bitch."</i>

197
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,183
Guys, right here.
Thank you. Beautiful.

198
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:03,354
Oh, hey, Holt. Bummer about
that a-hole paparazzi dude.

199
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,256
Yeah.

200
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,759
- So what's up, man?
- Huh?

201
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,160
You been workin'?

202
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,198
- Um, I'm developing a couple of things.
- He's got an independent.

203
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,567
Man, you were awesome in "Another
Word for Love", one of my all-times.

204
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,735
Thanks, man.

205
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,772
I thought, damn, this guy's good.

206
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,641
I thought I was gonna have to,
like, move aside.

207
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,112
I'm gonna go sit down.

208
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,749
Hey, keep at it. You got
mad skills, dawg.

209
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,085
Yeah, peace out, bro.

210
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,604
Hi. I'm sorry about earlier.
That photographer's a nut job.

211
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,506
And you give a shit because?

212
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,474
I'm Lucy Spiller, Now magazine.

213
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,343
I'm a big fan.

214
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,345
Right.

215
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,448
Listen, uh...

216
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,318
I would love to do
a feature on you sometime.

217
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,154
"The Actor's Actor."

218
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,922
"Actor's Actor" huh?

219
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,795
Isn't that a nice way of saying
"chronically unemployed"?

220
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,198
We just have to find the right
thing to do together.

221
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,268
Or the right reason.

222
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,303
Bye.

223
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,060
- What an asshole.
- Gee, you think?

224
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,862
Easy there, Tyson.

225
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:23,996
I...

226
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,565
I'm so sorry I ruined
your premiere.

227
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,535
Oh, are you kidding?

228
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,738
You took their minds
of the movie, which sucks.

229
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,874
Come on, you were great, though.

230
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,942
You just love me.

231
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,313
Yeah, I guess I do.

232
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,885
You can do better than that.

233
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,892
Don't you think we've been in
the news enough for one night?

234
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,429
Come on. You really think anybody in
here sees anything but themselves?

235
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,399
Plus it's really dark in here.

236
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,001
It is...

237
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,303
and wet.

238
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,040
Make me come.

239
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,087
- Great performance.
- Thank you.

240
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,589
You know, nobody in Hollywood reads.

241
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,526
It'd be a stretch to call me
"somebody in Hollywood".

242
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:07,198
This whole book, the whole thing happens
because a guy dips a cookie in some tea.

243
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,535
That's not just any cookie.

244
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:12,071
- It's a Madeleine.
- Wow.

245
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,574
She's gorgeous and
she's read Proust.

246
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,211
- Cal.
- Lucy.

247
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:22,981
What?

248
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,251
I think this is the part where you lose
interest because I'm not a player.

249
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,388
- I look that shallow?
- No, you don't look shallow at all.

250
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,358
Well, I might be, just a little.

251
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,193
I think we should get a medal for
sitting through that movie tonight.

252
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,996
- Yeah.
- Or something.

253
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,264
Definitely something.

254
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,702
Uh, that's me.

255
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,904
That's me.

256
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,276
- You think you can catch me?
- If you let me.

257
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,346
Hey, buddy, you like that? Huh?

258
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,316
You like that, buddy?
Sure you do.

259
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,199
Come on. There's somebody at the door.

260
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,804
Mm-hmm.

261
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,182
- Hey, Stormy.
- Hey, Don.

262
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,616
Come on in.

263
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:11,090
I was just playing a little
Hawaiian music for Tristan.

264
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,693
- Oh, I hear it.
- Yeah, he likes that.

265
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,665
Dr. Lucero said the cancer could
go away, but it's not very likely.

266
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,236
- Cats are nocturnal.
- Right.

267
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,705
Listen, do you think I can get
the rest of my money now?

268
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,107
Mm-kay.

269
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:34,613
Here you go. Let go, baby.
Let go. Oh, there.

270
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,421
You put that strap-on right in his butt.

271
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,489
I did.

272
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,658
That was great.
Here you go.

273
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,228
- Thank you.
- Okay.

274
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,331
Good night.
Good night.

275
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,268
She was nice, huh?
Nice lady.

276
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,738
- Kira!
- Hi!

277
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,376
How are you?
Oh, I am so good.

278
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,410
- Hi.
- How are you?

279
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,178
Oh, I'm good.

280
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,248
Your skin,
it's like glowing.

281
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,849
- Really?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,618
You getting laid?

283
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,754
- I wish. Let me show you around.
- Ok.

284
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,261
- Oh, hell, I love it. It's so bohemian.
- Thank you.

285
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:28,901
Oh, Check it out.
This guy gave me some E.

286
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,202
"E".

287
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,173
How retro.

288
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,780
This shit wrecks me.

289
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,193
Dude, come on,
it's just a fridge.

290
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,708
I don't think he can
hear you, bro.

291
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,198
He's pretty cashed.
Holy shit!

292
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,201
That's that guy Holt.
Holt, uh...

293
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,250
- McLaren?
- Yeah.

294
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:04,769
That guy from Another Word for Love?

295
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,836
He was phenomenal!

296
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,006
Yeah, well... What's he
been doing since then?

297
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,342
Standing in front
of this fridge.

298
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,212
Hey, what's up, buddy?

299
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:34,733
Stop.

300
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,369
Oh, yes...

301
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,780
What?
What's wrong, honey?

302
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,784
What is it?
You can talk to me.

303
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,058
I'm pregnant.

304
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,662
Oh, God. Oh, baby.
What?

305
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,264
Who?

306
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,369
Indie art house loser.
Jeff Sagliano.

307
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,504
Oh, crap.

308
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,375
How?

309
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:21,046
I met him at a retrospective that they
were doing at The Egyptian of his films.

310
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,916
Can you imagine that
retrospective of that shit?

311
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,686
I am so totally screwed.

312
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,290
Oh, honey, look, you...
you can always, you know?

313
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,893
No.
I am so totally Catholic.

314
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,395
I can't.

315
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,298
Well, does he know?

316
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,768
No. No. Nobody knows.

317
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,804
Nobody knows except you.

318
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,978
Oh, sweetie.

319
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,713
Oh...

320
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,748
It's okay.

321
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,470
What are you doing?

322
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,172
I got to teach a yoga class.

323
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,644
Hi.

324
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:28,947
Hi.

325
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:34,219
- This is for you.
- What is this?

326
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,657
Just our CD, just in case
you want to give it a listen.

327
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,393
I feel terrible. I didn't
get you anything.

328
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,664
You're in the studio. You think there's
never been a piece of music like it.

329
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,133
Mozart and Dylan
leap to mind.

330
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,738
Then you finish it... and find every
reason in the world to hate it.

331
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,106
Sounds like fun.

332
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,775
Then there's getting people
to actually listen to it

333
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,043
and maybe even buy it.

334
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,613
You have all your press contacts
in here. There's photos.

335
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Yeah. Nothing like being
a desperate musician

336
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,418
trying not to appear
desperate.

337
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,389
How am I doing?
Want to make us famous?

338
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,289
I never told you
what I did for a living.

339
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,694
No. Why? You're not,
like, CIA, are you?

340
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,730
Mm. Wow.
You knew the whole time.

341
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,499
"Want to make us famous?"

342
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,136
Okay, that was just
my feeble attempt at humor.

343
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,970
- Get out.
- What?

344
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,240
- Get out.
- Lucy... What's going on?

345
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,407
I had an amazing time.

346
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,276
I'm sure you did.
It didn't work.

347
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,412
What didn't work? I'm not going
anywhere until we sort this out.

348
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,614
This is sorted out.
Get your shit and go.

349
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,316
That's crazy.
This is crazy.

350
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,153
- Is that a stun gun?
- Yeah.

351
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,053
Now leave.

352
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,055
Lucy, you're not
gonna use a stun--

353
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,973
Cats do much better with
radiation than humans.

354
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,142
How do you know that?

355
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,879
Well, for one thing, they
have fewer pain sensors.

356
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,951
<i>I feel that you could have caught
this cancer earlier, Don.</i>

357
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,119
I do, too, buddy.

358
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,987
Excuse me?

359
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,775
Baby, baby,
I am so sorry.

360
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,511
I mean, what the hell
are they are looking for?

361
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,615
Look, sweetie, I know.
They suck. They are idiots.

362
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,546
If we could just get you
a little press.

363
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:21,360
You know, I got a call from the
"Dancing With the Stars" people.

364
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:24,922
Look, I'm not doing no
"Dancing With the Stars" bullshit.

365
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,258
Honey, it is a hot,
hot show.

366
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,527
- What did Fincher say exactly?
- I don't know

367
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,925
I couldn't get him
on the phone.

368
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:33,531
And then J.J. went on this whole rant
about how you're not hot, not bankable.

369
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,766
All right, all right.

370
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,972
Call me later,
will you, please?

371
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,908
Why did you have guys
up Prince Tyrese?

372
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,576
Is he the basketball player?

373
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,678
Yes, he's the
basketball player.

374
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,547
Oh, come on. We always
have people on him.

375
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:51,383
He's got a squeaky-clean
family-man image,

376
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,817
and he's a total
slime ball.

377
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,553
Did you get
anything on him?

378
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,555
Why, you want him
to autograph your balls?

379
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,890
No, the son of a bitch
loses us every time.

380
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,658
Lucy. Lucy.

381
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,626
What?

382
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,696
You realize Gibson Horne has
a 30% interest in the team, right?

383
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,665
Shame on you, Brent.

384
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,701
As journalists, we're not supposed
to cave to corporate interests.

385
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,835
Oh, my God. Is that how you
get through the night,

386
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,120
pretending
to be a journalist?

387
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:16,441
No, I take pills. How do you get
through the night?

388
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,848
Don Konkey, the last pap
to shoot on film.

389
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:24,748
Hi, Mr. Barrow.

390
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,052
Hey, great job on that Holt
and Julia thing.

391
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,219
That's terrific stuff.

392
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,221
You're a real
play-maker, you know.

393
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:35,891
You let me know if you get
anything on Prince Tyrese.

394
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:37,362
You're always
my first call, Brent.

395
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,613
<i>Donny, I love you.</i>

396
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,288
Go away!

397
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,790
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

398
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,104
Shh! Shh!

399
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,947
If I'm gonna do this,
my name can never be used.

400
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,982
Your name means nothing.

401
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,051
Thanks, buddy.

402
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,653
They wouldn't want to use your name
on something like this.

403
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,656
Well, they can't,
no matter what.

404
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,658
Okay.

405
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,127
And I want some cash.

406
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,531
And I want some kind of good press.
I want stories in your magazines...

407
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,734
Stories that make it
seem like I'm getting offers.

408
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,304
I need to have some idea
of how big a story you have.

409
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,041
It's big.

410
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,744
- Well, do we get it exclusively?
- You do.

411
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,247
And I have to talk to Lucy.
For all I know,

412
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,150
we already know all about it.

413
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,218
You don't.
Nobody does.

414
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,688
I can't talk right now.

415
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,024
They'll want more
than just the one story.

416
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,695
I got as much
as they can handle.

417
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,865
How's your big project?

418
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,469
I--I'll call you.

419
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,387
And you haven't been
seeing a therapist.

420
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,442
Nope.

421
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,412
I'm gonna recommend very strongly,
once again, that you see a therapist.

422
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,513
You have the money,
you have the insurance.

423
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,983
- I have a list here.
- Okay, if I could just--

424
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,419
You can't treat these drugs
like a smorgasbord

425
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,314
and just take the ones
you feel like taking, Don.

426
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:45,865
Ok, if I could just get the Zeldox,

427
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:47,725
Risperdal, the Zyprexa,
and the Ariprazole?

428
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,929
Don, you are one of the lucky people
who have a form of schizophrenia

429
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,499
that's manageable.
Most people aren't so fortunate.

430
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,800
- I know.
- You have to respect the disease

431
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,803
and respect the treatment.

432
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,379
Ok, I'll respect the disease.
But could you give the Zeldox,

433
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,394
the Risperdal, the Zyprexa,
and the Ariprazole?

434
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,578
All right.

435
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,820
But I want to see you
in three weeks.

436
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,989
Thank you.

437
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:20,390
Well, maybe if you don't
want your client

438
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,160
in the Celebrity Big Asses piece,

439
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,396
she should stop
her twice-daily trips to KFC

440
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,833
or stop calling herself
a celebrity. Bye.

441
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:30,822
Good morning, sunshine.

442
00:29:30,864 --> 00:29:32,936
- I'm late for a meeting.
- This won't take long.

443
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,773
Gib asked me to look at some
sale-spending ratios,

444
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,510
and someone needs
a little intervention.

445
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,380
Since when do you have anything to do
with the editorial budget?

446
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,214
Since the owner of the company
asked me to.

447
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,918
I forgot.
Gibson's little warrior.

448
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,521
How is the view
from deep inside his ass?

449
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,590
You know, maybe you should remember
who hired you.

450
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,591
You just wanted to screw me.

451
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,529
Oh, yes. That's right, baby.
The whole world was out to screw you.

452
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,159
- In one way or another.
-  I hired you

453
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,966
'cause you were the one editor out there
that was supposed to run

454
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,254
two magazines
at the same time

455
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:06,941
and make'em twice as successful as
they were under two editors.

456
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:08,505
If you want me to run two magazines,

457
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,642
give me the freedom to run
two magazines.

458
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,810
You're overspending!

459
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,280
I am busting my ass to make
these magazines work!

460
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,450
It's amazing how naked
ambition makes a person

461
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,220
just completely transparent.

462
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,690
Really?
What do you see?

463
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,158
You want my job.

464
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,828
I would kill myself
if I had your job.

465
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,096
- I like to get dirty.
- Hmm.

466
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,271
<i> Don! </i>

467
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,506
<i> Donny! </i>

468
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:42,973
<i> Hey, Dickweed! </i>

469
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:43,708
<i> Donny! </i>

470
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,376
<i> Don, i can read your thoughts! </i>

471
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:50,448
<i> Donny!</i>

472
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,517
<i> Hey, Donny Little-dick.! </i>

473
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,485
I am not. I'm average.

474
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,654
<i> All your thoughts
are in my mind. </i>

475
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,123
Mmm, no!

476
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,659
<i> I love you, Donny.</i>

477
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,097
<i>  I love you, Donny.
Kiss me. </i>

478
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,133
No. No, not here.

479
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,869
<i> I'll scream. I'll scream, Donny.
Kiss me. </i>

480
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,552
No, no, no. No.

481
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:13,738
<i> Just kiss me.</i>

482
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,980
Can I help you?

483
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,683
I need the Zeldox, the Risperdal,
the Zyprexa, and the Ariprazole.

484
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,587
- Okay. Um, it'll be about 45 minutes.
- Okay.

485
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,690
No!

486
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,959
<i>I'm sorry?
Back away, Don! </i>

487
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,227
<i> Run away! </i>

488
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,028
<i> Come on, Don, </i>

489
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,899
<i> Run away! Run away, Don! </i>

490
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,959
- I think babies are beautiful.
- Shut up!

491
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,962
I'm totally cool just being
the baby daddy.

492
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,198
I'm not! I slept
with you once, Jeff!

493
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:51,635
So? I sleep with a lot
of people once.

494
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,105
Right.
That's my point.

495
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,109
Okay, so say someone
else is the baby daddy.

496
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,711
Why are you saying it
like that for?

497
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,780
- Like what?
- Like you're P. Diddy or something.

498
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:08,586
God, I cannot believe
I ever threw you a bang.

499
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,988
Ew.

500
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,739
My publicist told me Dirt magazine

501
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,524
already knows that you're
the baby's daddy

502
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,161
because that whore
Julia Mallory told them.

503
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,596
I hear you, baby.
I totally hear you.

504
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:23,001
- You hear me?
- Loud and clear, Major Tom.

505
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,069
Oh, my God.

506
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,007
Honey, you just go on home.

507
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,111
You got to take it easy
and not get so tweaked.

508
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,462
She thinks I told Dirt.

509
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,098
She thinks I told the magazine.

510
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,237
She says she's never
gonna talk to me again.

511
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,042
I would never do that.
You know I wouldn't.

512
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,213
Kira has nobody.

513
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,052
God, I am so lucky
to have you.

514
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,072
Hi.

515
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,707
Just take whatever
you want, all right?

516
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,243
Don't hurt me.

517
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,579
That's cute.

518
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,748
Well, we're closed, but...

519
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,352
You want a drink or just a wall socket
to charge your stun gun?

520
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,287
You really didn't know
who I was, did you?

521
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,655
I still don't know
who you are.

522
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,424
Who the hell are you,
and why is it such a goddamn big deal?

523
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,260
Anyway, I'm sorry.

524
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,862
There it is.

525
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,866
Doesn't happen often,
but I am.

526
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,190
Or even, like, "I'm sorry
I tasered your nut sack

527
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:06,140
just when you let your guard
down with a woman

528
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:08,206
for the first time since
your ex cheated on you."

529
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,841
I mean, for example.

530
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,276
Wow. That's rough.

531
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,413
- Okay, I'm really sorry.
- See? It's pretty nice.

532
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,915
I'm getting the hang of it.

533
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,125
If you want to give it
another try...

534
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,131
I promise,
no weapons this time.

535
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,704
Oh. Yep. Here it is.

536
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,341
Look. Look.

537
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,144
That's killer.

538
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,814
Ha ha! Hey, look at this.

539
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,050
"Wagging tongues in the rumor mill say

540
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,352
Holt has several big movie
deals in the works."

541
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,421
I wish they'd let me
know about 'em.

542
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:01,225
No, no, it doesn't matter.
If they say you're hot, you'll be hot.

543
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,561
If you say so.

544
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,465
Babe, I am so proud of you.

545
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,736
<i>* And bring those magazines *</i>

546
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:16,040
<i>* And show me which one's
your favorite flaw *</i>

547
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,210
Hello.

548
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,445
Bullshit. Who is this?

549
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,882
Oh, Mr. Fincher.

550
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,185
David, right.

551
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,188
Yeah, it was--it was
just a puff piece, but--

552
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,323
Oh, thank you.

553
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,993
To be--To be in your movie?

554
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,896
What, are you kidding?
Of course.

555
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,465
With Kir--Kira Klay?

556
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,435
No, I didn't know
she was gonna do it.

557
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,637
And Clooney..

558
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,340
That's awesome.

559
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,677
Thanks. Thank you,
thank you.

560
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,079
No, no, listen, I'm gonna work
my ass off on this part.

561
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,882
I'm gonna work my ass off.

562
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,351
Thank you. Thank you.

563
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,237
<i>* Though I am standing *</i>

564
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:27,645
<i>* I am trembling in my knees *</i>

565
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:35,753
<i>* So whisper prayers over me *</i>

566
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:40,490
<i>* And hold me while I dream *</i>

567
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,093
Wait. Hold on.

568
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,095
Hello.

569
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,298
What?

570
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,269
What? Slow down.

571
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,039
Okay.

572
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,142
Okay, thank you.

573
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,579
It's Kira.

574
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,282
She OD'd.

575
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,538
Hey, Don.

576
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,641
What are you doing?

577
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,778
Uh, I like little fudgy rolls.

578
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:38,715
Well, you have money. Why don't you
just buy some little fudgy rolls?

579
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,551
I like 'em from here.

580
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,988
You feeling better?

581
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,325
Much better. The voices--
Much better.

582
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,726
- Oh, good.
- Thank you, Lucy.

583
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:53,864
You're a great photographer, Don.
You don't owe me anything.

584
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,008
Good morning, Mr. Fincher.

585
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,410
Could I get something hot to drink?

586
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,480
Chamomile tea or something?

587
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:10,815
Thanks.

588
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,820
Good morning.

589
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,888
Well, I'm sorry I'm late.

590
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:21,659
Um, I don't know what you know.
I don't know  what you want to know,

591
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,996
um, but I've spent most of the morning
on the phone with Kira's manager,

592
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:30,568
who informs me that she's
had a medical emergency,

593
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,438
and, um, will not
be joining our film.

594
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:39,143
This is the least
of the new bad news.

595
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,115
Apparently, Mr. Clooney
can't see anybody else in the role,

596
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:48,753
and...
although I don't know...

597
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:52,389
how this is gonna shake out
in the next 48 hours,

598
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,425
we're all adults, and, um...

599
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,697
I think we know how
this tends to end up.

600
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:05,269
Have a bagel,
and thank you for coming.

601
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,956
You can send them in.

602
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,966
Now, what can I do for you, besides
receiving your undying gratitude

603
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,936
for the beautiful profile
in my magazine?

604
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,005
I'm not gonna give you
any more dirt,

605
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,442
not about my friends
or my enemies.

606
00:40:45,274 --> 00:40:46,910
Kira's in the hospital
because I told.

607
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,446
Kira's in the hospital
because she's a drug addict.

608
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,647
The point is that you people-

609
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:51,682
Okay, first of all,

610
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,451
you're welcome for the profile,

611
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,286
plus the three other tidbits
that we've managed to place

612
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,223
which any publicist would
sacrifice a left nut for her.

613
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,459
Secondly, you're now a source,

614
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,061
and I think we're gonna do
wonderful things together

615
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,764
me, you, and Don here.

616
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,466
I like this office.

617
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,635
I'm not gonna help you anymore.

618
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,172
- Oh, poor Julia.
- No.

619
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,741
Don't... Don't even go there.

620
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,976
No, when she finds out
about your betrayal.

621
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,779
Think about it. Poor Julia.

622
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,814
I mean, I how how much
she adores you.

623
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,950
She'll either understand,
or she won't.

624
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,485
I don't care.

625
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,887
I love her and she loves me.

626
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,189
- Well, that's brave.
- Screw you.

627
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,358
Hey, Holt,

628
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,060
I think you need to see something.

629
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,161
What?

630
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,105
You know what we love
here at Drrt and Now?

631
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:50,941
- Homemade porn.
- So?

632
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,510
What's that got to do with me?

633
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,278
Have a seat.

634
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,755
<i>I love this feeling.</i>

635
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,533
<i>I can't focus my eyes, Johnny.</i>

636
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,901
<i>It's okay.</i>

637
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,105
<i>Let's take this off.</i>

638
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,608
<i>I'm not sure,
I want to do this.</i>

639
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,544
<i>Sure you do.</i>

640
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,586
<i>Oh, you're so beautiful.</i>

641
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,760
<i>Oh, come on, Johnny.</i>

642
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,137
<i>Do you like that?</i>

643
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,572
<i>Ah, yeah.</i>

644
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,992
I honestly would
rather not leak this.

645
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,763
I'm an actor. That's all
I ever wanted to do.

646
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,899
No, you wanted
to be famous.

647
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,168
There's a big difference.

648
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,705
You can give your dirt
to Don whenever.

649
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,607
Just make sure it
comes in regularly.

650
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,041
Lucy...

651
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,313
Have you ever actually
loved anybody?

652
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:42,953
Nah.

653
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,089
You've got no one.

654
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,091
It's obvious.

655
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:51,095
You've got nothing and no one.

656
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,477
- Don, you can go.
- Hmm?

657
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,345
Go.

658
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,301
Hey!

659
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,407
Paparazzi piece of shit!

660
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,745
It's okay, Tristan.
It's o...

661
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,217
Okay. It's okay.

662
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,973
Hey! Don't fumble!
Don't fumble!

663
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,475
Don't.

664
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,277
Daniel, come around here.

665
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,713
Hey, man.
You can't read?

666
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,947
Private property.

667
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:23,854
What's that?

668
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,255
It's business.

669
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,857
Well, aren't I part of the business?

670
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,226
I said it's just business.

671
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,198
Hey, let's go inside.
Come on, let's go.

672
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,183
You know, I can't smoke this.

673
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,389
- Why?
- 'Cause it makes me too horny.

674
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,475
You like that?

675
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,410
Yes.

676
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:31,882
Hello.

677
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,919
Hey, Mr. Fincher.

678
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,989
David, right.

679
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,191
Yeah.

680
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,061
Yeah?

681
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,297
Really?

682
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,299
Oh, that's great news.

683
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,704
No. No, I haven't
booked anything else.

684
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,875
What, are you kidding?
Of course I do.

685
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,345
Oh, I can't believe Jennifer
signed on to do the part.

686
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,083
Okay. Yeah, I'll be there.

687
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,217
Wow, babe, that's great.

688
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,219
Thank you.

689
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,892
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about
what happened to Kira.

690
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,362
Wait. What?

691
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,565
When?

692
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,036
Yeah, she was... she was
a really good person.

693
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,908
Right. At the memorial.

694
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,410
What happened?

695
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,447
Kira's dead.

696
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,183
Oh, my God.

697
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,252
She had a brain bleed.

698
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:44,688
Oh, my God.

699
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,525
The movie's back on.

700
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,461
I still have the part.

701
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,933
Slow down the car.

702
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,575
What are you doing?
Slow down.

703
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,010
Will you talk to me?

704
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,581
I'm sorry.

705
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,486
Sorry...
Pull the car over.

706
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:18,355
Oh, my God.

707
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,959
Oh, my God.

708
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,261
What the hell are you doing?

709
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:25,395
Oh, my God!

710
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:26,964
Stop the car! Stop it!

711
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,532
Please stop the car!

712
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,973
Oh, my God! Stop it!

713
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,207
Holt!

714
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,142
Stop it, Holt!

715
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,979
Oh, my God!

716
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,693
Hey, come on.

717
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,165
Come here.

718
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,634
All right. Come on. We got
to get you out of here.

719
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,872
Come on.

720
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,409
Come on, sweetie, talk to me.

721
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,049
Hang in there.

Don?

727
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,193
He's dead, Lucy.
We killed him.

728
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,794
No, Don, no.

729
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,763
No, Holt is okay.

730
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:41,531
- It's Kira.
- Tristan.

731
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,766
Tristan is dead.

732
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:44,901
Who's Tristan?

733
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,670
Tristan, my cat!

734
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,539
Oh, a cat.

735
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,340
Jesus, Don...

736
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,210
My best friend, and
we killed him.

737
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,244
We? What are you
talking about?

738
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,413
All that stuff we did,

739

all the bad things.

740
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,117
No, Don, no.

741
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,953
Tristan had cancer, remember?

742
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,588
We didn't kill him.

743
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,523
- We did.
- No, Don.

744
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:07,657
We did.

745
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,792
No, Don.

746
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,894
