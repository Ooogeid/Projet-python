00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:01,795
<i>Previously on </i>Dirt...

2
00:00:01,956 --> 00:00:03,906
I thought we weren't talking.

3
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:07,135
We're not. I'm just calling to
congratulate you.

4
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:10,513
What, is this an interview?

5
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:13,974
How was Holt...
on the phone just now?

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,955
How do you know
I was talking to Holt?

7
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:17,979
Body language.

8
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:20,106
I wasn't doing anything. Okay.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,748
How are you feeling today, Don?

10
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:24,194
Weird.

11
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:25,393
Weird how?

12
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:27,697
'Cause I'm starting to feel normal.

13
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:30,408
Well, we'll keep an eye
on those feelings of normalcy.

14
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:32,620
Lucy, should I just be following you?

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,734
That one's yours.

16
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:36,201
- Excuse me. That is my desk.
- I know.

17
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:40,543
And you're here to
convince me to buy

18
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:43,922
your magazine, but I must know.

19
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:45,632
What's in it for Brent Barrow?

20
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:49,386
May I?

21
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:51,680
Your buzzards
and my buzzards should have

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,015
the principles hammered out
by the end of the week.

23
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:56,601
I insist we celebrate. Ciao.

24
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,880
You are watching the stars
like they're animals in a zoo.

25
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:14,661
You don't have to work tonight, Lucy.

26
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:17,479
You're a studio executive.
If you're working, I'm working.

27
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,707
Look at these people.

28
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:20,657
If there was any more ass kissing,

29
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:22,710
they'd be serving ChapStick
with the champagne.

30
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:25,409
And I didn't invite you here
for a story, either.

31
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:27,668
- Really?
- Really. I wanted to see you.

32
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,050
At your studio's party.

33
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:31,310
So I wanted to impress you.

34
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:34,598
My divorce is final as of Friday.

35
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:36,641
Starlets beware.

36
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:40,895
Actually, I was thinking
of gorgeous, smart,

37
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:42,897
successful magazine editors.

38
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:45,442
I'll try to introduce you to some.

39
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:48,903
Come on. You and I had something.
Maybe the timing was off, but...

40
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:50,829
That's it... the timing.

41
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:51,949
Right.

42
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:54,868
So, who is Dark Guardian?

43
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:59,802
- What do I get if I tell you?
- Depends on how good it is.

44
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:00,915
It's really good.

45
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,840
Why don't you take a look
over my shoulder?

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,915
Black blazer, right by the bar.

47
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:07,756
Paul Trisko?

48
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,633
Our biggest TV cop is about to become
éour biggest movie star.

49
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:14,192
Looks like it might just be
my night tonight.

50
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:17,662
That's a pretty good cover,
but the night's still young.

51
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,296
O'Connor. God.

52
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,950
What a prick.

53
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,485
You really like sleeping alone?

54
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:36,336
Get a picture of Paul Trisko
next to that poster.

55
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:39,245
That Ted Rothman, he likes you.

56
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:44,671
Hi.

57
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,339
- How are you?
- Good.

58
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,768
- Nice to see you.
- It's good to see you.

59
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:50,583
Lucy, this is Jasmine Ford.

60
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,300
Jasmine, this is Lucy Spiller.

61
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,594
- We've met. How are you?
- Great, thank you.

62
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:57,388
Lucy covered me taking care of
my mom after her heart attack.

63
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:00,440
I wish I could say
it was totally altruistic,

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,185
but she was up for Academy Award.

65
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,188
How are you, Holt?

66
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:07,337
Good. Good.

67
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,818
You know, we just started rehearsing
on Fear Tactic, so...

68
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,834
I think you guys are gonna
be good together.

69
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:15,365
How about a cover? Me and Holt?

70
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:18,368
I don't know. Make something up,
like we're the hottest couple in town.

71
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,161
I'll think about it.

72
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:23,623
If my publicist gives you any problem,
Just call me directly.

73
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,096
Holt, Darren Aronofsky.

74
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:28,336
I have to say hi.
Good to see you, Lucy.

75
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:29,733
You, too.

76
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:39,472
Ted Rothman is staring at you.

77
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:42,881
I told you he likes you.

78
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:50,292
- It's so good to see you, Lucy.
- It's good to see you, Ted.

79
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:01,286
I gotta take this.

80
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,034
Rothman.

81
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,922
Maybe we are meant to be together.

82
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,452
What's going on?

83
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,201
Are you shitting me?

84
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,340
All right.
You shouldn't be calling me.

85
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,266
This one goes way higher up
the pay grade.

86
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:26,046
I don't even wanna know about this.

87
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:28,855
Don't even say another word.
Honestly,

88
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,208
just handle it.

89
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:50,585
Did you miss me?

90
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,142
So much.

Season 2 Episode 4
<i>Ties That (Don't) Bind</i>

95
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:11,059
Cellulite, plastic surgery, hero pets,
those are not covers.

96
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,969
- It's been a slow week.
- Not in Hollywood, it wasn't.

97
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,347
Dark Guardian's being played
by Paul Trisko.

98
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,169
- Are you serious?
- Wait. Paul Trisko...

99
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,857
He's the guy on...

100
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:21,720
Do you watch TV? He's a cop.

101
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,552
The show is called The Precinct.

102
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:26,327
- They're releasing his name next week.
- So we run it this week.

103
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:27,372
No, no.

104
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,165
- We gotta get the costume.
- What? Huh?

105
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:31,039
Maybe I'm slightly a comic book nut,

106
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,002
but it's not just about the actor.

107
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:35,588
It's what he wears. Every boy
in the world wants to see it.

108
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:38,716
Someone's got news judgment.
Where is the costume?

109
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:41,010
It won't be at the studio.
They'll be making it in secret.

110
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,261
I'll get Don on it.

111
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:46,235
- Hey, McPherson.
- Yeah.

112
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:47,795
Did you have that call traced?

113
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,352
It's a tape library for the TV show
Snare a Cyber Predator.

114
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,447
Child molester's TV. I like it.

115
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,235
So who made this mysterious
phone call last night?

116
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:59,297
Someone who stays out of the story.

117
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,924
I just don't get it.
They talk to little kids online.

118
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:04,331
Don't these morons ever think
that they could be talking

119
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:05,994
to a cop or, like, a TV show?

120
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:08,871
Apparently not.
Find out what that call was about.

121
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:12,291
The Cyber Predator blogs are hot.

122
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:15,735
- Excuse me?
- The TV show... Snare a Cyber Predator.

123
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:18,046
Blogs are full of rumors.
You know, one of them said

124
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,174
they went online
with a staffer posing as 18,

125
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,378
but on the air, said she was 15.

126
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:24,858
How do you know about my story?

127
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:28,182
In fairness to me, you really should
minimize your browser.

128
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:30,728
- I did minimize it.
- Excuse me.

129
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,230
- You wanna horn in on this.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

130
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,605
I was gonna say I have a friend
who works at the show,

131
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,484
But you know what? It's your story.

132
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,204
- Farber.
- What?

133
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:43,174
Look, I know that you're eerily good
at it, but don't play stupid.

134
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:45,299
- Who is he?
- College roommate.

135
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,079
Oh, God. All right.
On the byline my name goes first.

136
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,804
- Call him.
- You know what?

137
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,500
- I'm not sure I wanna exploit him.
- "Exploit"?

138
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,504
He's performing a public service by
exposing hypocrisy in the news business.

139
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:01,758
- Do you believe your own bullshit?
- No.

140
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,361
My girlfriend dumped me.

141
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,931
She says I write garbage
for a living.

142
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,886
Are we sharing now?

143
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,986
The reason that Liz dumped you is
because you work too many nights.

144
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:16,063
In my defense,
all the women I've slept with

145
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:17,815
say I give them multiple orgasms.

146
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:22,779
Okay, well, as far as
non sequiturs go, not bad.

147
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,049
- Who are you calling?
- A studio security guy.

148
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,252
I've been slipping him cash
and premiere tickets for a year.

149
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:30,912
Hey! How'd you like
that Radiohead concert?

150
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,328
Hey, sweetie!

151
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:39,777
Look gorgeous. How you doin'?

152
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:44,245
You know what? I'm not supposed
to tell you this, but...

153
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,818
you know the shoes
that you wanted the other day?

154
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:49,930
Mom's probably gonna buy them
for you for your next...

155
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:56,858
You little shit!
Who do you work for?

156
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,357
- Stay away from me!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Trisko.

157
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:01,174
- I'm not stalking you.
- Listen to me.

158
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,245
You follow me one more time, I'm
gonna put your ass in a car accident.

159
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:04,612
You'll end up dead. You understand me?

160
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:06,030
You understand me?

161
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,825
Excuse me, sir. You're frightening
your daughter.

162
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:13,521
Goddamn it! Damn it.

163
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,340
<i>The man who comes
to the door thinks</i>

164
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,741
<i>he's meeting
a 13-year-old girl for sex.</i>

165
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,183
<i>Here he comes now.</i>

166
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,093
Hi, Richard. I'm Jonathan.

167
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:28,942
<i>Come on over here.</i>

168
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:30,847
- <i>Let's have a little chat.</i>
- He's creepy.

169
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,348
<i>What do you have in the bag?</i>

170
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,350
<i>Do you have some condoms?</i>

171
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:40,273
<i>It says in your chat transcript
that you'd bring some condoms.</i>

172
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:42,652
<i>You're wondering who I am.</i>

173
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:45,223
<i>Have you ever seen a television show</i>

174
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:47,172
- What?
- <i>called to Snare a Cyber Predator?</i>

175
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,228
General counsel for everything.

176
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,156
Thank you.

177
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:52,785
Progress?

178
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:55,054
I got a list from the studio security

179
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:57,658
of everybody who showed up
after you got the call.

180
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:59,322
- That call didn't happen.
- Right.

181
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,177
It's a total of five people.

182
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:03,611
McPherson,

183
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:05,665
sharing a story?

184
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,050
If I didn't have Human Resources
breathing down my neck,

185
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,552
I'd say you're blowing him.

186
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,334
- Who are the five?
- I got Jonathan Chubb's manager,

187
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:14,554
an agent and a staff lawyer,
and she got...

188
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,995
General counsel for the entire studio
and the head of the studio.

189
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:18,013
O'Connor?

190
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,070
Farber's college roommate works there,

191
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,857
but Farber's feeling
a little bit guilty

192
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:25,651
- about using him.
- That is absolutely not true.

193
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:27,361
It's a good thing.

194
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,783
Thank you. I appreciate that...

195
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,472
making me look like a total asshole.

196
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:33,855
You're welcome.

197
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:36,326
Holt! Holt!

198
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:38,748
Jasmine! Jasmine!

199
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:44,337
Are you two a couple?

200
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,424
We're not here to talk about ourselves.
We're here to support Green Earth,

201
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:50,426
a cause we both strongly believe in.

202
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:53,304
Holt, do you think
the Jews run Hollywood?

203
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:56,724
What? What are you talking about?

204
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:59,644
- Man, come on.
- The Jews. You know, your dad.

205
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:01,604
Do you agree with his opinions?

206
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:05,358
It's never been my belief.

207
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,318
You know, it never has.

208
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:09,820
I don't think any one group
runs Hollywood,

209
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:11,697
Whatever the hell that means.

210
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,742
<i>We're here for a good cause,
so we need to get inside.</i>

211
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:18,711
<i>Holt McLaren facing tough questions
at the Green Earth charity event.</i>

212
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:21,596
<i>The actor's father appeared
on a Los Angeles talk show</i>

213
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:24,293
<i>announcing his new book
God is White.</i>

214
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:26,587
<i>I truly believe Hollywood's bad
for our country.</i>

215
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,963
<i>It's eating away at our morals,</i>

216
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,260
<i>and everybody knows
it's run by homosexuals and liberals</i>

217
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,798
<i>and other elements.</i>

218
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:36,013
<i>Now, my son is a fine actor,</i>

219
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:38,313
<i>but I believe he's afraid</i>

220
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:40,226
<i>to talk about what's right.</i>

221
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:43,396
Get the father in for an interview,
and call Holt's publicist as a courtesy.

222
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:45,564
What's that look on your face?
Are you grinning?

223
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:47,972
We got two great stories,
and Holt's dad's a Nazi.

224
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:49,485
I mean, what could be better?

225
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,351
You dudes from Dirt...

226
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,204
First Farber, now you.

227
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,499
I looked you up. You're schizophrenic.

228
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:06,941
You ran naked across your college quad
screaming, "I am a tomato."

229
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:10,725
I'm thinking, if you had a head
of lettuce, you could've been a salad.

230
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,514
That's not funny.

231
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,387
- And it's not true.
- Sorry.

232
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,931
Medical records
are supposed to be private.

233
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,601
Not to employment agencies, Don.

234
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,292
I am the peeping eyes
of corporate America.

235
00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:25,396
Plus you got yourself a double standard.

236
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,020
You don't want me to snoop on you, but
you want me to do it on other people.

237
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,861
Hypocritical? Maybe? Little bit?

238
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,886
Yeah. You're right.

239
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,243
I need a wardrobe personnel
at Sunset Tower Studios.

240
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:40,914
Okay.

241
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:46,528
Okay, here's one.
Gambling problem, massively in debt.

242
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:47,501
No.

243
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:50,338
- Ooh, crackhead.
- No.

244
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,512
Well...

245
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:53,940
Sick child.

246
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:56,236
Well, that sounds good.

247
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:59,188
Karpova, Anna,
seamstress at Sunset Tower Studios.

248
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:01,891
Uh, kid's got some
crazy rare form of cancer.

249
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:04,393
Insurance doesn't cover everything.

250
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:07,665
My cat had cancer.

251
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:09,783
- Kitten?
- Cat.

252
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:26,624
- Anna?
- Who are you?

253
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:28,709
- Do I know you?
- I'm Don Konkey.

254
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:31,158
Your son's name is Martin.

255
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,131
He has cancer.

256
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:36,761
- He needs surgery. You need money.
- How do you know what my son has?

257
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,751
I'm sorry. I read a file.

258
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,083
I need to know where they make
the Dark Guardian costume.

259
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:45,022
- The movie costume?
- I'll give you a lot of money.

260
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,627
- Why would you pay for that?
- I don't know.

261
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,062
People wanna know things.

262
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,315
- God will punish me for that.
- No.

263
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:53,609
It's in the Bible.
"Money answereth all things,"

264
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,899
Ecclesiastes 10:19.
"We have money for what we want."

265
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,056
"We cannot tell who put it
in our hands," Genesis 43:22.

266
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:02,603
"We may spend the money
for whatever our hearts desire"

267
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:06,307
" in the presence of the Lord
and rejoice," Deuteronomy 14:26.

268
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:08,874
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, but that's not important.

269
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,922
Miracles aren't mystery.

270
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:13,754
We see the hand of God. He wants us to.

271
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,319
Twenty thousand for the Dark Guardian.

272
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:24,439
I don't know.

273
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:35,293
Mr. Petrelli's office just called.
He's the new owner.

274
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:38,013
He wants to meet you tomorrow
at his hotel for lunch.

275
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,070
You do have the lunch
with your mother, though.

276
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,378
Cancel my mother. Hey, Farber, did you
call your friend at Cyber Predator?

277
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:45,446
Yeah, I called him.
I'm having dinner with him.

278
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,955
All right. It's not exploitation,
it's journalism.

279
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:49,707
Hey, Don.

280
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,492
Oh, my God. These are great.

281
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:56,117
Wow. Could Charlie
possibly look any worse?

282
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,369
Look at that dress.

283
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:02,348
I mean, are you kidding? I couldn't
give that away at a yard sale.

284
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,013
I bought it for her as a gift.

285
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,806
I said cover her, not marry her.

286
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,391
She's lonely.

287
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:10,060
Well, we're all lonely, Don.
It's the human condition.

288
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,397
Look, I know it's hard for you
to think of her as another person.

289
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,625
No, I just don't want
to see you get hurt, honey.

290
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:18,776
You know, we all get hurt, Lucy.
It's the human condition.

291
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,942
I need 20,000.

292
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,366
- Twenty thousand?
- Yeah.

293
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,452
God wants her to have the money.

294
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:29,508
- Who, Don?
- Anna. She's my contact.

295
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:33,961
God's not talking to you directly,
right? You're not hearing voices?

296
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:35,920
No. Don't worry, Lucy. I'm fine.

297
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,803
'Cos if your medicine's not working,
you know you have to tell me.

298
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:40,658
God is not talking to me.

299
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,426
But he did ask for 20 grand?

300
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,789
- Yeah.
- All right.

301
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:45,513
I'll get the shot, though.

302
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:47,515
Hey. What the hell is this about?

303
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,580
I turn on the TV and find out
you promised him a cover?

304
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,133
- Are you trying to make this worse?
- We didn't promise a cover.

305
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:57,068
But do you want this getting out
to the competion? Because it will,

306
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,011
and you'll be Photoshopped
with a swastika in front of you.

307
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:01,799
Be great for your career.

308
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,896
You're kidding me, right?

309
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:07,377
He... He's here. I'm gonna talk to him.

310
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:08,501
Oh, God.

311
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:11,961
- The whole general...
- Hey, Pop.

312
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,375
Well, hey, son! You're looking good.

313
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:19,004
Glad you got rid of that earring.
Made you look like a faggot.

314
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,806
Here we go with the "faggot"
thing again, huh?

315
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:23,050
What do you want?

316
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,066
What any father wants...
to protect my child.

317
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,599
We could talk if you'd answer the phone
when your old man calls.

318
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,654
Holt, let him do the interview.

319
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:35,354
You let all these people
tell you what to do.

320
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:38,315
You know who really
runs Hollywood, Holt.

321
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,318
- For God sakes, why don't you...
- "For God"... That's smart.

322
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:44,510
That's a laugh. You save your spine
for special occasions?

323
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,134
Pull it out when your old man's in town?

324
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:48,527
- My old man?
- Yeah.

325
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,702
You're not my old man.
You're just some guy

326
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:52,387
who cruised in and out of our lives

327
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:54,540
when everyone was sick
of you hanging around.

328
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,282
Holt, come on. Let's go.

329
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,669
Oh, can you give us a second here?

330
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:00,129
Okay.

331
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:11,103
What do you want?

332
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:13,223
Huh? How much is it gonna take?

333
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:18,480
I don't want your Hollywood money.

334
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:21,448
You know what I'd do with it?

335
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:23,455
I'd drink it,

336
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,124
and then I'd piss it out when I'm done.

337
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:29,070
Go home.

338
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:34,242
I got something to say,

339
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,991
and I'm gonna say it.

340
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:39,251
People wanna hear my brand of truth.

341
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,839
Well, I don't, all right?

342
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:52,666
- Guy's a sociopath. Scares me to death.
- Can I talk to Lucy? Alone, please?

343
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,695
Oh, I don't know if that's a good idea.

344
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:56,067
Please? Come on.

345
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,483
All right. I'll get the car.

346
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,710
- You don't have to use this.
- Doesn't matter.

347
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,322
He'll talk to whoever will listen.

348
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:11,204
I spent all this time hating him,
and it did me no good.

349
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:14,244
I do it again, and I'm gonna
let him ruin everything I have now.

350
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:17,956
- That's how it works.
- Yeah.

351
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,668
The opposite of love isn't hate,
it's indifference.

352
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,921
And I'm beginning
to understand that, so...

353
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:31,929
You know I'm on your side.

354
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,664
Yeah. Thank you.

355
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,502
Thank you very much.

356
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:48,445
I mean, I don't want to, uh,
pressure you or anything like that.

357
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:51,449
So, you're buying me an expensive dinner

358
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,825
to find out what happened
on Cyber Predator.

359
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:56,067
Is this gesture, like,
totally guilt motivated?

360
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:57,815
Basically, yeah.

361
00:17:57,935 --> 00:17:59,764
I mean, It's bad enough you're a gimp,

362
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:01,749
but to take advantage
of our friendship...

363
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:04,175
That is worth one expensive dinner.

364
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:08,064
Oh, absolutely. You know,
we prefer the term "handicapped."

365
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:09,320
- Oh.
- FYI.

366
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,153
Thank you. I just don't want you
to lose your job.

367
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:14,720
Oh, they won't fire me.
It's bad publicity.

368
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:16,557
Plus I fill, like, three quotas.

369
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:17,689
So,

370
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:20,560
you went to J school to work

371
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:22,685
- for Dirt Now, huh?
- Yeah.

372
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:26,191
You know, you went to film school
to work on a TV show about perverts.

373
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:28,444
We're living the dream, aren't we?

374
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:33,497
Look, what's going on over there?

375
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:38,500
A tape's missing...

376
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,352
from a show done out in Panorama City.

377
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,126
Some editor asked where it is,
the place fills up with lawyers.

378
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:47,013
You have any idea what's on the tape?

379
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:50,048
I know a girl who is an assistant
production manager who might.

380
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:52,899
- Well, can you call her for me?
- How much you gonna pay her?

381
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:53,844
"Pay"?

382
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:56,355
Money. You guys pay, right?

383
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:57,847
It depends on what she has.

384
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:00,017
The head of the studio showed up.

385
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,399
Well, then I'll ask about the money.

386
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,560
Could we do this kind of soon maybe?

387
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:09,026
She gets off around 9:00.
We could meet up, say, 10:00.

388
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,737
And you're not gonna
get in trouble for this?

389
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:14,364
Don't worry. We'll leave me out of it.

390
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,576
These people better show up.

391
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:20,496
When Lucy smells a story and doesn't
get it, she can be such a prick.

392
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,080
Tell me about it.

393
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:24,390
She's also the best in the business,

394
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,367
so, you know, maybe
a little bit of respect is due.

395
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:30,789
I'm sorry. I was addressing
the other side of your mouth.

396
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:33,753
Here they come.

397
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,130
Hi, guys.

398
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:41,894
Tyler Beckman, Willa McPherson.

399
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:43,711
Becky Walters.

400
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:48,857
- So, Becky, what do you know?
- Well, what do you know?

401
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,859
- Missing tape.
- Ah, yes, yes, yes.

402
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:54,028
Missing and probably
shredded, burned and buried,

403
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,448
but I might be able
to get my hands on a copy.

404
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:58,158
How much?

405
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,712
Well, I heard you paid 300 grand
for some stupid wedding pictures.

406
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,271
I get half a million.

407
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,981
To tell you the truth,
I'd almost tell you for nothing.

408
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:08,014
I'm so sick of these dickheads.

409
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:10,580
But I won't. What you get rocks.

410
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,448
What you get is the biggest story

411
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:15,027
since Monica Lewinsky
skimped on her dry cleaning bill...

412
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,593
when I get the cash.

413
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:20,196
Well, we're not authorized
to spend that kind of money,

414
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:21,883
let me just make a phone call.

415
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,209
I hear from you by 12 tomorrow,
or I open the bidding.

416
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:27,329
- Well, if you'd just wait a second...
- Honey, next time come prepared.

417
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:30,983
Oh, and Tyler gets a quarter mill.
A sort of finder's fee.

418
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,568
Let's go.

419
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,778
I thought you wanted
to be kept out of this.

420
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,088
For a quarter mill I can be in.

421
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,907
I'm thinking about pimping my ride.

422
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:40,284
Let's go!

423
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:49,293
Are you out of your goddamn minds?
You let them walk away?

424
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:51,586
- They wanted 750.
- What did you want us to do?

425
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:53,015
Call me!

426
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,725
She wouldn't give us time, okay?
It was a negotiating tactic.

427
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:58,031
Then tell them anything,
that money is no problem.

428
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:00,220
You don't ever risk them
going to the competion!

429
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,464
Come on, McPherson.
You know better than that.

430
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:03,556
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,389
I'm pissed that you screwed up,
but I'm even more pissed off

432
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:11,564
that you're such a chickenshit
you couldn't call and tell me.

433
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:14,457
Oh, hey, Lucy, this just came in.

434
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:18,149
Holt McLaren at a white supremacy rally
when he was a teenager.

435
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:20,810
Call his publicist.

436
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:23,744
Tell her I want to do an interview.
I'll do it myself.

437
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:32,402
This'll be good, man.

438
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:34,735
Tell wardrobe
I'm gonna be a little late.

439
00:21:34,855 --> 00:21:36,505
I need to do an interview,
all right?

440
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,716
Thanks, man.

441
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:42,053
- Hey, there.
- We defended you on our web site.

442
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:45,123
Oh my God, you gotta be kidding me!

443
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:46,892
Obviously my father sent
this to you, right?

444
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:49,179
Is there anything
else you wanna tell me?

445
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:52,146
Campaign donations, an uncle who shot
a civil rights leader?

446
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:54,346
Come on. Let's go in here.

447
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:59,990
- So what is it that you want, Lucy?
- Not to be made a fool of.

448
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,860
Come on. That's bullshit.

449
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:04,814
I mean, what do you care
about any of this?

450
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:07,171
Why do you give a shit
what happens to me?

451
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,441
Is it because you feel something?

452
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:11,582
Don't worry. I'll get over it.

453
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,877
Then if that's the way you feel, then
why don't you join the feeding frenzy?

454
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,089
I mean, we all know
you got plenty of shit on me.

455
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,022
You know that I sold Julia
out for, what...

456
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:22,552
for a magazine cover.
And, hell, she'd

457
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:25,144
- probably still be alive had she not...
- Come on. She didn't die

458
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:26,814
because she knew you.

459
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:29,122
Yeah, we screwed up.

460
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:30,935
We did.

461
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,774
And believe it or not, there isn't a day
that goes by that I don't regret it.

462
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,405
But we did not kill

463
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:38,693
Julia Mallory.

464
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:46,325
I forgot what the rally was.

465
00:22:46,764 --> 00:22:49,014
I mean, come on. I was 10 years old.

466
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:51,566
Look.

467
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,975
My old man came and picked me up. He
told my mom he was taking and my sister

468
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:02,288
to a picnic. I ate hot dogs.

469
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,170
I had my first beer that day.

470
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:08,648
What?

471
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,588
It's crazy.

472
00:23:11,164 --> 00:23:12,174
Tell me.

473
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,561
My old man won a shooting contest.

474
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,454
I mean, these guys were throwing
beer bottles up in the air

475
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:21,984
And he was picking them off like they
were inches in front of his face.

476
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:23,404
And you were proud.

477
00:23:24,182 --> 00:23:25,167
Yeah.

478
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:32,663
You know, all the anger just went away.

479
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,100
And he gave me the gun, and I still have
the damn thing.

480
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,087
I mean, that's crazy, right?

481
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:42,344
No.

482
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,301
Not at all.

483
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,080
I mean, you know,
you think you get where you

484
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,056
you want to go in life and
everything will just settle, you know?

485
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:54,935
It just gets more complicated.

486
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:01,025
You're not the same person
you were six months ago.

487
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:04,884
Neither are you.

488
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:09,971
Do me a favor.

489
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,942
Go out with Jasmine tonight and be seen.

490
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,846
A black girlfriend trumps a Nazi dad.

491
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,480
You said you were on my side, remember?

492
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:27,426
You didn't have to tell me that.

493
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:28,564
I know.

494
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:32,227
I gotta go.

495
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:34,278
Wait. Are you sure? Come on.

496
00:24:35,252 --> 00:24:36,254
Do you?

497
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,717
We can't do this, Holt.

498
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:40,147
No. You can't do this.

499
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:42,250
It's bad.

500
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,034
It's so bad.

501
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:51,448
All we need is one reporter
to start digging and...

502
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:53,754
scandal isn't even the word for it.

503
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:00,602
I might have a career left.
You wouldn't.

504
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:06,682
Oh, come on. This isn't about careers,
but keep telling yourself that.

505
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:10,652
Might convince yourself it's the truth
One of these days, you know?

506
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,406
[speaking Russian]

507
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:32,140
It's just a movie costume.

508
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,451
Look, I signed something

509
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:38,381
- for my job.
- Your son's surgery is $48,000.

510
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,301
The insurance only covers 28.

511
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:43,514
Here's the other 20.

512
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,175
Until recently, my world
was all hallucinations.

513
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:51,708
I never knew what was real,
and now I do.

514
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:54,803
Is a movie costume real? No.

515
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:56,891
Your son is real.

516
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:09,019
Warehouse, 2252 Wilma, downtown,
first floor in the back.

517
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:12,163
Mr. Trisko has a fitting at 11:00.

518
00:26:17,794 --> 00:26:18,662
Thank you.

519
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,877
- What else?
- Okay, best and worst-dressed,

520
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:44,992
you get pages in an hour.

521
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:46,844
Who's gay and who's not,
they're still laying out.

522
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:49,963
Dark Guardian... If they get Don's film,
they can finish in 20 minutes.

523
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,779
We also have soap stars
and their brownstones.

524
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:53,385
Let's push that closer to the daytime

525
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:55,491
Emmys or the end of time,
whichever's first.

526
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,711
Okay.

527
00:26:58,485 --> 00:27:00,955
Um, line one. It's a hospital in Oregon.

528
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:02,790
Someone's been in a car accident,

529
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:04,856
and he gave them your name.

530
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,287
This is Lucy Spiller.

531
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:17,721
Can we get this thing moving?
Where's the costume?

532
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,919
I wanna be out of here
in time to pick up my kid.

533
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:24,403
I'm busy.

534
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:29,651
Yeah?

535
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:32,152
Don, your brother's been
in a car accident.

536
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:33,237
How bad is it?

537
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,491
He's okay, but he needs you.

538
00:27:36,098 --> 00:27:39,424
Okay, he didn't know how to reach you,
so he told them to call me.

539
00:27:39,544 --> 00:27:41,665
I made a reservation...
2:30 to Portland,

540
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,933
and the ticket's waiting.

541
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:45,223
Lucy, I promised I'd get this shot.

542
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,667
I'll get somebody else.

543
00:27:46,902 --> 00:27:48,788
I'm in an air vent.

544
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,517
Don, listen to me.

545
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:52,960
I'm gonna put Kenny on.
Give him your information.

546
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,425
I'll find someone else
to take the shot.

547
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:56,565
Okay? You need to leave, now.

548
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:58,848
Call me when you get there.

549
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,366
Okay. I'm putting Kenny on. Hold on.

550
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,646
- Kenny!
- Yeah.

551
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,908
I want you to find out exactly where
Don is and sent that guy,

552
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:11,682
David... whatever his name is...
with a camera,

553
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:13,193
and tell him
not to wear expensive clothes.

554
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:15,737
- Okay, you have your lunch at 1:00...
- All right.

555
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:16,907
Pick up Don.

556
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:29,781
I'm Lucy.

557
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,234
You must be Adam.

558
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:33,399
Good to put a face to the name.

559
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:36,528
Come. Lunch is on the way.

560
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,811
Please.

561
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,193
Do you like men?

562
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:55,293
- Specifically or generally?
- Lesbians don't care.

563
00:28:56,391 --> 00:28:59,034
Straight women, many of them hate men.

564
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:04,045
- Thank you.
- They should. We treat them like shit.

565
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:08,234
I like some men.

566
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,815
Do you have an editorial philosophy?

567
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:15,492
Figure out what the readers want
before they know what they want,

568
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:17,716
- and give it to them.
- That's not good enough.

569
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:20,287
Make them want what they don't want,

570
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,707
you raise your circulation.

571
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,875
You're very well-paid.

572
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,156
When my contract is up,

573
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:26,725
- you'll have to pay me more.
- Brent Barrow

574
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:29,165
says the web site can
produce more revenue.

575
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:31,481
He wants editorial control.

576
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:34,858
Brent Barrow shouldn't be in control
of the air conditioning.

577
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,426
Let alone the web site.

578
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:39,204
Your story on a TV show,
Cyber Predator...

579
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,797
750 for a source?

580
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:44,743
You want circulation or do you want me
to be cautious?

581
00:29:44,938 --> 00:29:45,999
Touché.

582
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:49,322
I had a call from a friend
at the studio.

583
00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:51,025
They want us to drop the story.

584
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:53,833
I can't think of a better reason
not to drop it.

585
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:55,254
I agree with you.

586
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:56,965
We're gonna get along.

587
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:59,990
In life, as in our dreams,

588
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,910
it's not how far we go together,

589
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:06,223
it's what we do when we get there.

590
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:11,155
Lunch.

591
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:19,037
Oh, boy.

592
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:24,654
I figured out what's wrong
with all of your copy.

593
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:26,824
Well, do tell, Maxwell Perkins.

594
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:29,849
Who's Maxwell Perkins?

595
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:31,415
Enough said.

596
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:33,792
See? That's your problem.

597
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,139
I don't know who this
Perkins is, and, frankly,

598
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:38,953
you know, I really don't give a shit
unless he's got

599
00:30:39,073 --> 00:30:40,801
a three-picture deal at Warner or

600
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,571
he's a terrific source.

601
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:44,319
You, on the other hand, I swear to God,

602
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:47,401
you... you...
You always have to prove that

603
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,323
you're the smartest guy in the class.

604
00:30:50,443 --> 00:30:52,393
And it shows up in your copy.

605
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:56,682
I don't know. Maybe that's what happens
when you go to Harvard, you

606
00:30:56,802 --> 00:30:59,067
feel like you're above all of this. But

607
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:01,305
the truth is, is that you love it.

608
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:03,720
You're just too insecure to admit it.

609
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,208
So...

610
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,161
- do we have a deal?
- When did you get like this?

611
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:11,041
Working for a TV studio.

612
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,832
Um, well, money's not a problem.
Do you have the footage?

613
00:31:13,994 --> 00:31:16,873
Yeah. I used my new cell phone that day.
Really great quality.

614
00:31:16,993 --> 00:31:18,743
I transferred it to this.

615
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:21,128
Yes.

616
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:24,811
Holt McLaren woke up today
to more bad news.

617
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:27,482
In the wake of his father's
attention-grabbing remarks

618
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:29,640
on race, Hollywood and gay people,

619
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,924
his sometime girlfriend Jasmine Ford
seems to have had enough.

620
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:34,635
I did not break up with Holt

621
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:37,497
for the simple reason
we were never an item to begin with.

622
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:40,338
We're just two people
making a movie together.

623
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,853
Holt McLaren comes to us to

624
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:43,663
fire back tomorrow

625
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:46,733
in a special live interview
on Access Hollywood.

626
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:51,895
We spent 750.

627
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,455
We got a bargain.

628
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:56,635
Y-You're kidding me.

629
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:58,192
Where... Where is he?

630
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:00,262
Okay, I'm... I'm going there.

631
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:04,158
The guy running
is their production manager.

632
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:06,341
She says the minute he got the call,
he went crazy.

633
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:08,610
You can see why they burned
and buried their tapes.

634
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,476
Tr-Trust me, get back in the car,

635
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:11,769
- What are you talking about?
- Please.

636
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:12,890
Jesus!

637
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:15,477
Paul Trisko likes 15-year-old girls.

638
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,101
Actually, Lucy, 13.

639
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:21,108
Oh. Well, good-bye,
Dark Guardian, and hello, Neverland.

640
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:23,902
Get back in the car and get out of here!

641
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:25,933
What the hell's he carrying?

642
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:27,781
Teddy bear and a bottle of booze.

643
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:30,826
Oh, well, gotta love a pedophile
who's a romantic.

644
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:35,042
So, do you think this Becky girl
will be okay in court if we get sued?

645
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,416
- She seems smart.
- Tyler would be a great witness.

646
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,689
Yeah, well, the studio
could always say this

647
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:42,410
video had nothing to do
with Cyber Predator.

648
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,310
I think I'll have
to do to Jonathan Chubb

649
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,380
what he does to everyone else.

650
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,850
Congratulations, guys. You did great.

651
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,471
Drink up, go home
and have some terrific sex.

652
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:56,310
Uh, what, you two haven't done it yet?

653
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:57,769
Sorry.

654
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:15,702
Hey, Jason.

655
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:18,247
Donny.

656
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:22,252
Aw, it must be bad if you're here.

657
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:25,196
I haven't seen you in,

658
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,341
what, like, five years?

659
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:29,710
Ten in July.

660
00:33:30,952 --> 00:33:32,330
It's good to see you.

661
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,931
Don't move. You have

662
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,454
a-a fractured arm,

663
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:39,753
and you've broken your leg
in three places.

664
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:41,855
They put you together with titanium,

665
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,714
and you have a grade II, uh, concussion.

666
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:47,402
- I don't remember any of it.
- You were drunk.

667
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,343
Three times over the state limit.

668
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:51,987
Did I hurt anyone?

669
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,329
I don't know. They say y-you hit

670
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,332
a tree and a parked car.

671
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:01,770
You still,

672
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,859
- you know? Yeah.
- Crazy? Yeah.

673
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:07,511
Kind of. Y-You know, b-better.

674
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:10,795
- Nice balloons.
- Yeah.

675
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:13,595
Well, you liked them when you were nine.

676
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:17,053
Broke your leg sliding into third.
It's the same leg.

677
00:34:18,821 --> 00:34:21,471
- How long you staying for?
- I don't know.

678
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:25,124
Does anyone else know?

679
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,995
Let's keep it that way, okay?

680
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:32,550
This is far out, man...

681
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,647
you taking care of me, huh?

682
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:37,017
It's what we do.

683
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:39,474
We take care of each other.

684
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:41,665
So this has been a hard time for you.

685
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:44,219
Well, it's, um...

686
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:46,587
it's difficult having
a father like mine.

687
00:34:47,316 --> 00:34:49,757
But it's been going on for a long time,
so...

688
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,404
So you still carry some resentment?

689
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:56,906
Well, he abandoned my mom and my sister
and me when we were kids, so it's, um...

690
00:34:57,026 --> 00:35:00,477
It's not like I didn't know that he
could say or do stupid things, you know?

691
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:02,680
There are people out there
who are saying that

692
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,021
you should object more
to what he is saying.

693
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:07,543
Well, I probably

694
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:10,083
could've taken a stronger stance.

695
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:12,874
But, you know, I hope that I've made
my feelings pretty clear.

696
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,544
- Yeah?
- I find what he says disgusting.

697
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:18,223
Anything that you would do
differently now?

698
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:20,543
Well, I can't seem to do
the one thing that

699
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:23,000
a lot of people think that I should do.

700
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,151
You know, I just can't pretend
that he's not a human being.

701
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:28,121
He's still my father, so...

702
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,674
We're here with Holt McLaren,
and we will be right back.

703
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:38,910
- Hi.
- How am I doin'?

704
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:41,204
You're doing good. You are...

705
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:44,442
You're serious but emotional.
You are

706
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:46,879
thoughtful but warm.

707
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:48,682
I'd say you get an A.

708
00:35:48,802 --> 00:35:50,609
Who needs a cris manager.
I have you, right?

709
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:53,945
It's nice to know
I can find a new line of work.

710
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:56,490
You just can't stand my
appreciating your help, can you?

711
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:58,770
Yeah, well,

712
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:00,160
it's complicated.

713
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:04,331
You don't think I know that?
I know that better than you. Come on.

714
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:08,376
You ought to get back.
All right. I'll talk to you later.

715
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:11,671
Um, the art department says you have
10 minutes to transmit a new cover.

716
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:13,980
Legal says Cyber Predator
is out of the question.

717
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,045
- That's bullshit!
- Right. Um,

718
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:19,221
- the guy at legal was pretty... ada...
- Send the goddamn cover.

719
00:36:19,483 --> 00:36:21,471
- Okay.
- Lucy, they're...

720
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:23,551
- here.
- Right.

721
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:31,929
Hello.

722
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:34,918
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Sit.

723
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:37,367
There's no need for manners now.

724
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,958
So, this is, uh, quite a charge, Lucy.

725
00:36:45,658 --> 00:36:48,334
Miss Spiller, you're playing
around with people's lives.

726
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:50,402
Neither Mr. Chubb,
nor I, nor Mr. Rothman

727
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:52,422
here knows anything about this.

728
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:56,281
And I can assure you that
Paul Trisko is no pedophile.

729
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:00,272
You might be right, Mr. O'Connor,
'cause he left before he got the chance.

730
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,931
I won't have the integrity of my show
questioned like that.

731
00:37:03,344 --> 00:37:05,192
He was pushed back into a car.

732
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:06,935
Could be anywhere.

733
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:08,456
Maybe he went to a party,

734
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:10,565
wasn't invited, security told him
to go home.

735
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,870
You don't believe I have a tape, do you?

736
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,712
- Do you?
- He was carrying a blue teddy bear

737
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:18,309
and a cheap bottle of scotch,

738
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:20,879
like Vincent's or Barton's... something.

739
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:23,499
The house across the street was 521,

740
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:26,876
and you shot that show at 524 Delaware,
Panorama City.

741
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:28,342
Should I go on?

742
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:32,219
What kind of business are you running?

743
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:34,159
I will get to the bottom of this.

744
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:37,472
I'll go public if I find out that
you covered up for a child molester.

745
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:41,065
It's his show, his production company.
We knew nothing about it.

746
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:44,764
You know, Paul Trisko
will be off the lot in an hour.

747
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:48,059
Well, you sort of just admitted it.

748
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,630
Look, anyone involved will be fired.

749
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:53,899
Then you'll have to fire yourself.

750
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,152
I know that Mr. Rothman
wasn't there, but

751
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:59,938
what were you doing in the show's tape
library at midnight?

752
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:04,200
- That's right. We have that story, too.
- I've heard enough.

753
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,823
I'm getting the hell Out of here.

754
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:13,989
Wait, wait, wait. Right there.

755
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:15,871
Why is Jonathan Chubb
looking at the furniture?

756
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:17,607
Because he's looking for cameras.

757
00:38:17,727 --> 00:38:18,926
That whole losing his temper bullshit,

758
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,894
That's 'cause he knows we have video,
and he's

759
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:23,028
- playing to the balcony.
- Uh, our Paul Trisko tape's

760
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:24,947
been on the web site 21 minutes.

761
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:26,992
- Four million hits. The server crashed.
- Wow.

762
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:30,262
It's all over the news. Every story
mentions DirtNow.

763
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,743
I told you the cover would be fine.
Do you trust me now?

764
00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,312
Yes.

765
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:37,882
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Never trust me.

766
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:46,114
So I have a couple sitcom tapings
I just gotta pop into really quick.

767
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:49,246
- Are you sure you can't hang out?
- No, I have dinner with an advertiser.

768
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:51,886
So you drove 16 blocks just to say hi?

769
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,900
I'm flattered.

770
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:57,014
You know that night you got
the phone call?

771
00:38:57,243 --> 00:38:59,172
- You left your phone out on purpose.
- Really?

772
00:39:00,202 --> 00:39:04,252
You said something about "higher up
the pay grade," so I'd be tempted.

773
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:06,849
Your boss knew about Paul Trisko,

774
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,829
and you knew he knew,
And you got me to do the story.

775
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:11,685
Do you really think I'm that smart?

776
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:14,479
You have your boss's job.

777
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:17,130
A man faces a difficult situation.

778
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,817
Let's just say the man is me.

779
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:21,082
He knows about a problem,

780
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:23,738
but he can't say anything
because it's gone way too far.

781
00:39:24,026 --> 00:39:26,272
His boss won't do anything

782
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,575
because he's protecting his ass.

783
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,871
So what's this man supposed to do, hmm?

784
00:39:34,112 --> 00:39:36,718
He lets someone turn it
into a great story.

785
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:38,720
And he looks like a hero,

786
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,224
and the studio doesn't make
a hundred-million-dollar movie

787
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:43,801
that would've tanked if the child
molester story had come out.

788
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:47,429
And a bad guy lost his job, and
it just so happens a good guy got it.

789
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,018
Every so often, life is fair.

790
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:53,274
- You used me.
- Excuse me, my dear?

791
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,393
Who used who?

792
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:56,845
That's cute.

793
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:18,064
