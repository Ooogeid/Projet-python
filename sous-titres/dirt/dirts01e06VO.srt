00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:05,023
<i>Hi. I'm Don Konkey.
I'm a photographer.</i>

2
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:06,875
<i>Technically, I'm a freelancer,</i>

3
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:10,413
<i>but outside of the occasional
Cat Fancier magazine photo,</i>

4
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:12,473
<i>I'm exclusive to Dirt Now.</i>

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:15,245
<i>Last week, I was covering
a story for Lucy Spiller,</i>

6
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:16,808
<i>my best friend and boss.</i>

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,840
<i>- And things didn't go so well.
- Get him!</i>

8
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,458
<i>I ended up in jail.</i>

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,310
- Don, are you okay?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:28,529
<i>Not the best place for a schizophrenic.</i>

11
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:31,783
<i>That's Holt McLaren. He gets Lucy dirt.</i>

12
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,580
<i>With her help, he's gonna be the
next big thing in action movies.</i>

13
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:35,984
You're gonna have to bulk up.

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,781
<i>That's Holt's girlfriend, Julia Mallory.</i>

15
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,147
<i>With the help of her dealer, Garbo,</i>

16
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:45,637
<I>she's gonna be
the next big thing in rehab.

17
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:48,700
<i>Holt's relationship with Lucy and Julia</i>

18
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:50,454
<i>is starting to take
a toll on his stomach.</i>

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,060
<i>We all have something.</i>

20
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,022
Papa! No!

21
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,409
<i>Lucy's dad committed suicide
when she was 15.</i>

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,895
<i>Now, her relationships
with men aren't so good.</i>

23
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,329
Did you come the last time?

24
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:07,995
Maybe you could give me
some direction.

25
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:10,593
I could draw you a map.
It's not gonna happen.

26
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:12,463
I have better luck alone.

27
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:16,354
<i>Good thing she's got me.</i>

28
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:21,178
- So, we were thinking--
- If it works for you--

29
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:24,019
And this'll be exclusive.
If it works for you,

30
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,388
I get caught in
a lesbian affair with Chyna.

31
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:28,722
And we've already talked to her,
and she's totally in.

32
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:31,710
And once it hits, Chris will accept it.

33
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,538
Yeah. I accept it,

34
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,590
and then we move in together
as a "thrupple."

35
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:40,240
But when that dies down,
I get jealous of him and Chyna.

36
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,722
So Chyna and
I have Adrianne move out.

37
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:44,895
And I have to win him back.

38
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,496
Thank you.

39
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:52,020
That is good stuff. It really is.

40
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:54,313
You've obviously put
a lot of thought into it.

41
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:56,187
I have to deal with an editorial issue,

42
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:57,898
but you can come back, right?

43
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,769
Oh, sure. And just so you know,

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,447
we're completely flexible on the story.

45
00:02:01,448 --> 00:02:03,067
These are just a few ideas.

46
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:05,286
Okay, great. I'll have
Kenny show you out.

47
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:06,713
- Be in touch.
- Okay.

48
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:07,812
Thank you.

49
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:09,460
What do you think?

50
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,984
Dude, we are totally getting a cover.

51
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,604
400,000 for an exclusive on the wedding,

52
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:17,235
and some waiter with a
cell phone cam scoops us?

53
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:19,418
They're crap images.
People want to see the glam.

54
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,960
"People want to see the glam"?

55
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:22,615
What is that, a Shakira lyric?

56
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:24,559
I want to see an exclusive!

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,422
What do we know
about this dead cheerleader?

58
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:28,775
Amber Carmichael,
disappeared at a pep rally,

59
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,035
found the next day in the woods
behind her high school.

60
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:34,166
Not a lot on the wires.
No arrest yet. Small town story.

61
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,444
How small a town?

62
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:39,307
Walnut Valley, about an hour
and a half out of L. A.

63
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:41,865
Population, 11,000.

64
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,495
Now that's a solid cover.

65
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:47,769
It's a great cover, but I mean,
we have about two days to close,

66
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,478
and we don't even have a reason
to think she had a secret life.

67
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:52,485
Everyone has a secret life.

68
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:54,105
She was murdered!

69
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,838
Her secret life is our next cover.

70
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,559
You better all get to work.

<b>Dirt - Season 01 Episode 06 -
"The Secret Lives of Altar Girls"</b>

74
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:15,193
Hello.

75
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,764
Your office just seems
to get bigger and bigger.

76
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:21,095
Same office, Chuck.

77
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:23,605
And yet, bigger.

78
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:25,655
Maybe I should do a story.

79
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:29,768
"Mysterious Expanding
Office Takes on All in its Path."

80
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:31,529
I need you on something.

81
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,934
You already have me up
to my ears in nuts and sluts.

82
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,167
I got, "Family Keeps
Pet Hippo in Living Room,"

83
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:41,058
"Idaho Potato Looks Like Virgin Mary."

84
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,769
- My plate's kinda full.
- I need you on a cover.

85
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,395
It's a crime story.

86
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,730
I'm sending a small army
to Walnut Valley

87
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:49,286
to get into
this cheerleader murder.

88
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:50,867
These knuckleheads will treat it like

89
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,409
some premiere after-party.

90
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,244
I need hard journalism.
M. E. reports, D. A.'s office--

91
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:57,105
I have two Polk Awards and a Peabody.

92
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:59,366
I know how to cover
a damn crime story, Lucy.

93
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,591
That's why I called you.

94
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:03,950
You sending me for a cover, or a story?

95
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:04,964
Meaning?

96
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,880
Well, you've already picked out
your headline: "Her Secret Life."

97
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,342
If this girl had
no secrets, fine, come home.

98
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:11,504
I'll run something else.

99
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:15,071
Girl's dead. Maybe some things
should just stay secret?

100
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,987
Do you want the story or not?

101
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,364
- Yeah, I'll take the story.
- Okay.

102
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,645
I want Willa McPherson to go with you.

103
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:24,079
You think a chaperone
can keep me on the wagon?

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,368
One can only hope.

105
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:26,611
She seems hungry.

106
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,370
Maybe she'll learn
something from you.

107
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:29,564
Like you did?

108
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:31,346
If she's lucky.

109
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,730
Hey.

110
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:41,650
$400,000 for exclusives on
Cheryl Lane's wedding,

111
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,949
and you're bumpin' the cover?

112
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,840
"Exclusive" being the operative word.

113
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,805
Pictures all over
the Internet. The deal's off.

114
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,052
So what's the cover?

115
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,626
Or do you plan on surprising me again,

116
00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:50,852
'cause, as I recall,

117
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:52,478
that didn't go so well last time.

118
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,788
Meet Amber Carmichael.

119
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,029
Never heard of her.

120
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,907
White, attractive, murdered
in her cheerleading uniform.

121
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:01,106
- America's gonna love her.
- More than Cheryl Lane

122
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:02,282
and her fairy tale wedding?

123
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:04,962
Celebrity murder always trumps
celebrity wedding. You know that.

124
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,804
She's not a celebrity.

125
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,293
Yes, well, she will be.

126
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,710
Okay, guys, check with me
before you head out,

127
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,569
even if you have your assignments.

128
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:35,509
There you are.

129
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,141
Hi.

130
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:44,180
We're doing a story
for Dirt Now Magazine.

131
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:46,630
Did any of you know Amber Carmichael?

132
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:49,109
Poor bastards'll
never know what hit 'em.

133
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:50,789
Um, we're uh--

134
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,163
Lucy's told us to wait--

135
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:53,885
You don't have to tell me
what Lucy said.

136
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,895
Everything she knows about reporting,
she learned from me.

137
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,436
Lucy learned from you?

138
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:01,929
I was her mentor at The Trib.

139
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:03,979
Back when I was a respected journalist?

140
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,605
Hard to believe, I know.

141
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:08,729
Wow, you worked with Lucy at
The Trib? I thought you were like,

142
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,804
the Dirt spooks-and-kooks
guy since forever.

143
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,371
Hmm. Nice interview technique, subtle.

144
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:17,713
All right. Let's regroup.

145
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:19,128
What have we got so far?

146
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:22,857
Well, I called the D. A.'s office but
they don't have a press liaison, so--

147
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:24,474
Hmm, interesting.

148
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:29,080
Look, there's a memorial for this girl
at the local church in two hours.

149
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,417
Why don't we go there,
check it out, see what we see?

150
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,959
How did you know about it?

151
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,246
Big, complicated story like this?

152
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:37,299
Intricate local politics?

153
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,452
You really gotta know how to dig.

154
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:45,879
It's nice out. Let's walk.

155
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,941
Maybe we'll, uh, find another
scoop on the way.

156
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:53,448
So, what was Lucy like
when she was starting out?

157
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,219
I mean, what was her first big story?

158
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,401
How did she rise so far and so fast?

159
00:06:57,402 --> 00:06:59,489
You're a one-man press conference.

160
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,114
Look, you want to be a reporter?
Remember this.

161
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:04,328
Everyone wants to tell their story.

162
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,079
You gotta cultivate your source.

163
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,014
One question at a time.

164
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,193
Sometimes no questions.

165
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:13,046
Sorry.

166
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,196
So, what was Lucy like
when she started out?

167
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,269
Kind of a little bit like you.

168
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,891
Not necessarily a compliment.

169
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,980
So we'll do the flowers ourselves.

170
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:33,103
Fine, I'll call, then.
I will. I--I gotta go.

171
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,310
Sorry. People hear it's a wedding

172
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:38,103
- and the prices triple.
- Not interested.

173
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,079
Has Don called?

174
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:41,297
- No. You want me to try him again?
- Yes.

175
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:42,806
And can you just use our florist?

176
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:45,198
We spend a fortune there every month;
it should count for something.

177
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,730
- Thank you.
- Are you dialing Don?

178
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:47,621
Yes.

179
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,106
<i>Don?</i>

180
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:00,213
<i>Don?</i>

181
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,576
<i>Hey.</i>

182
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:05,544
<i>I love you, Don.</i>

183
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:25,260
Local cops. They got nothin'.

184
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:26,805
How can you tell?

185
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:28,794
No one's talking to them,

186
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:30,835
they're talking to no one.

187
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:33,028
Well, maybe they're just
being respectful.

188
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,688
Mm, their mistake.

189
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:37,738
Killer isn't ID'd in the first 24 hours,
probably won't be.

190
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,281
No one in this crowd's gonna give
up any dirt on the girl.

191
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:41,958
No dirt, no suspect.

192
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:43,046
Well,

193
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:45,187
if they're not gonna give it up
for their own cops,

194
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:47,336
what makes you think
that they're gonna talk to us?

195
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,503
We're in a church.

196
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,456
Maybe we can get
a blessing from the reverend.

197
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:53,465
Come on.

198
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,374
Reverend,

199
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,849
I'm Chuck Lafoon.
This is Willa McPherson.

200
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,902
We're from Dirt Now Magazine.

201
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:04,090
- I'm sorry for the intrusion--
- Please,

202
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,779
this is a house of mourning.

203
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:10,696
Impressive.

204
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:12,913
Excuse me,

205
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:15,529
did you say you're from Dirt Now?

206
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:16,737
Yes.

207
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:19,778
A- Amber and I were best friends.

208
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:22,676
We're both totally into Dirt Now.

209
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,987
I mean, we were.

210
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,321
She was.

211
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:29,353
I still can't believe she's gone.

212
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:30,831
I'm so sorry.

213
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:34,186
Anyway, I saw you
talking to my dad, so--

214
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:36,210
Your father's the minister.

215
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,626
Uh, Willa has family in the clergy.

216
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:42,019
Constant chore, right?

217
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,846
Yeah. Totally.

218
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:46,770
Well, uh,

219
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:49,127
you probably
want to focus on the service.

220
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,362
Maybe you guys could
get together afterwards,

221
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:52,910
and talk a little bit. Get some

222
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:56,673
- background for the magazine.
- Sure. Yeah! Okay.

223
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,239
- Should I--
- We'll find you after.

224
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,517
Cool.

225
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:07,198
Well, you got your first
crime story interview.

226
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,488
God help us.

227
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:12,620
Okay, Quinn. No, that's great.

228
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:15,946
Okay, listen. I just got home,
so I gotta go.

229
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:18,937
All right. I will.

230
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:21,195
Hey.

231
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,268
Quinn says "hi."

232
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,427
If he wants to talk to me,
he could answer one of

233
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:28,104
my goddamn phone calls.

234
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:31,160
He said he called.
He wants to have lunch with you.

235
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:33,295
When's the last time
you checked your voice-mail?

236
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:40,983
Hard Charger deal just closed.

237
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,263
Name above the title.

238
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:47,886
Sheet!

239
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,815
That's--

240
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:51,732
- That's--
- Huge!

241
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,296
Oh, yeah, after Dawson fell out,

242
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,981
Johnny Gage's people were all over him,
but they only wanted me.

243
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,959
Three movies in a row.

244
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:01,342
All summer tent-poles.

245
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,004
- Babe, that's awesome.
- Yeah.

246
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:06,780
Come here.

247
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:16,820
Just lay back.

248
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,921
What the hell is that?

249
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,542
I scratched myself in the taxi.

250
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,703
You scratched yourself?
Let me see.

251
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,027
- Let me see!
- Jeez. What?

252
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:41,606
Jesus Christ, Julia.
What the hell are you doin'?

253
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,536
It's not a big deal. God.

254
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:46,569
I knew you were
gonna be a bummer today.

255
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:54,566
Don?

256
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:57,370
Don!

257
00:11:58,779 --> 00:11:59,765
Don?

258
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:05,357
Hey.

259
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:08,769
Don?

260
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:10,774
You haven't been returning my calls.

261
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,057
I'm working.

262
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,133
You're writing on your photos.

263
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,486
I have to get it out.

264
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,360
Now, I worry about you
when you don't call me back.

265
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:25,887
Sorry, Lucy.

266
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,747
How's your finger?

267
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,875
It throbs a lot,
but the doctor said that's good.

268
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,579
Good.

269
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,221
I brought you some food.

270
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:39,898
It's your favorite soup
from Nate 'n Al's.

271
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,324
Okay.

272
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,778
Oh, no, no, no, no.

273
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:49,300
Hey...what happened?

274
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,216
You seemed to be doing
so much better.

275
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,841
Do you want to go to the hospital?

276
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:55,053
No!

277
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:59,293
It's just police, you know.

278
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,623
I didn't like their bathrooms.

279
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:03,990
You're still upset about the arrest.

280
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,765
Well, they still might come back for me.

281
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,738
No. I took care of it.

282
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,048
The police will not come back.

283
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:13,720
Okay.

284
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:18,212
I'm fine.

285
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,923
It's just, you know,
it's up and down like always.

286
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:26,642
I just need to work,
you know, for focus.

287
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:29,631
- It'll help.
- Okay.

288
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:33,031
Why don't you come in on Wednesday,
and I'll have something for you?

289
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,070
It's okay.

290
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,644
You actually know Britney?

291
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:49,932
Well, it was just a little interview.

292
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:51,777
But we did have a burping contest.

293
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:53,017
Bet she won.

294
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:54,384
Oh, hands down.

295
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:55,924
This is all Britney.

296
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,671
Amber and I made it together.

297
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,010
Did K-Fed really sleep in the basement?

298
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,841
That one she wouldn't answer.

299
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,931
So who else was Amber into?

300
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,763
She was a Lindsay girl
all the way.

301
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,862
I'm all about Paris. You?

302
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:10,947
Uh, Paris.

303
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:12,445
I know, right?

304
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,516
We always have this debate.

305
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,742
Well, had.

306
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,179
We had it.

307
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,753
How long were you friends?

308
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:23,895
Forever.

309
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:25,543
We shared everything.

310
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,065
Did she have a boyfriend?

311
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,978
We're not supposed to date.

312
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:33,739
We both took
the church chastity vows.

313
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,909
We're supposed to wait to be married.

314
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,938
But now, she'll never have that chance.

315
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:51,671
Um, Maddy?

316
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,446
Would you mind if I borrowed this?

317
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:57,339
I'd give it back.

318
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:58,635
For the magazine?

319
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,900
Yeah. Do you want to see my others?

320
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:07,509
Holt! Holt.

321
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,650
No sorbet, extra peach and bee pollen.

322
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:10,369
Thanks, man.

323
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:12,186
Bee pollen's good for stress.
When, uh--

324
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:15,380
when things get tough at home,
I always double up on the bee pollen.

325
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,319
If you want I could grab a bottle
so you could bring i home for Julia.

326
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,339
I, uh--

327
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:22,001
I heard she's been
having a rough time, so--

328
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,242
Oh, you heard, huh?

329
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:24,143
Well, I mean,

330
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:25,693
the magazines and stuff, but I'm

331
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,477
I'm sure it's all
bullshit anyway, right?

332
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:28,623
Yeah, it is. Believe me.

333
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:30,380
- She's fine.
- Good. Good.

334
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:33,604
Um, all right. They'll be ready
for you in five, so--

335
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,444
<i>Press one to leave a message.</i>

336
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,881
Hey, it's me.
I'm just checkin' in.

337
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:47,246
Hey, I really hope
you're checkin' your voice-mail.

338
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:50,522
All right, I'm workin' late,
so call my cell.

339
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:54,213
Jesus, man!

340
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:56,312
- Sorry. Sorry
- Was I not loud enough for you?

341
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:57,927
- What?
- Did you just miss something?

342
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:59,914
- No. I just--
- You fishin' for a story, Junior?

343
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,544
- No, I--
- Are you sellin' to the tabs?

344
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,054
What are they payin' you?
How much?

345
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:04,803
- What are you talking about?
- How much?

346
00:16:04,804 --> 00:16:06,988
- How much?
- Holt, I swear to God.

347
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,021
It's just they're ready
for you on set, man.

348
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,556
They're ready for you on set.

349
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:11,975
That's it.

350
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,368
No, no. Now listen, the chief and I
agreed, we are not talking to the press.

351
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:22,510
On the record. It is a matter in
our local justice system.

352
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,414
We are gonna let
the system do the work.

353
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,530
Thanks. That's great.

354
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,762
Seriously. No. I get it.

355
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:31,664
"Let the system do the work."
It's a strong quote.

356
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:35,693
Aloof, in charge, gives the sense
you're closing in.

357
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:38,178
Have you worked a lot of big,
high-profile murder cases?

358
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:38,798
High prof--

359
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:40,841
This is Walnut Valley.

360
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,147
When I covered
the Blue River Killer murders--

361
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:44,875
Of course, that was 14 years ago--

362
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,340
It was that D. A.'s
first big murder case.

363
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,312
Blue R--

364
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,571
You're Chuck Lafoon.

365
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,755
I knew I knew you.

366
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:53,628
I read your book.

367
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:54,619
Did you read his book?

368
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:55,403
Uh, yeah.

369
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:57,873
The prosecutor
you wrote about, Engler, he is like

370
00:16:58,155 --> 00:17:00,043
one of the reasons I became a D. A.

371
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:01,987
Engler's great. He made that case.

372
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:05,087
Th-- the fingerprint on the light bulb
in the hallway? That was genius!

373
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:06,311
He's an amazing guy.

374
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:09,735
The book-worthy cases always have great
characters like that.

375
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,496
A leading man making the case...

376
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,059
and a twist.

377
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:16,319
- You gotta have a twist.
- Oh, this story has a major twist--

378
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,856
No worries. We're off the record.

379
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:24,910
Come here.

380
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:30,261
Anything you give me
on deep background,

381
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,055
not for attribution, whatever--

382
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,408
It won't get back to you.

383
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:37,817
No one knew I was talking to Engler
till the verdict was in.

384
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:41,245
All right,

385
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:44,556
the M. E.'s report won't be out
for a couple of days, but the, uh,

386
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,514
the victim, the girl?

387
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:48,181
She was pregnant.

388
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,522
- Holy shit.
- What?

389
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:59,637
Lucy was right. Girl did have
a goddamn secret life.

390
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,181
<i>Residents of Walnut Valley
have been shocked and outraged</i>

391
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,516
<i>to find out the truth about their
favourite cheerleader. </i>

392
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,242
Tell me the networks are using our name.

393
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:10,450
We got them all different exclusives,
in exchange for crediting us

394
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:12,183
for breaking the story in the new issue.

395
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,503
The numbers should be great.

396
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:15,255
I'm glad we upped the West Coast draw.

397
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:17,800
Oh, and somebody please
get this guy a stylist!

398
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,590
Or at least some powder.
He's gonna drown in his own flop-sweat.

399
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,614
We're not gonna have it
all to ourselves next week.

400
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,374
Does anyone have a jump
on the next cover?

401
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,400
We're thinkin' emotional.
Victim's parents, something like this.

402
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,955
That's filler.

403
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,094
The girl was pregnant.
Who is the baby's father?

404
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:34,900
I haven't found a boyfriend yet.

405
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,721
Willa, stop telling me
what you don't have.

406
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:38,340
You've got an in with the best friend.

407
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,272
Get the story.

408
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:40,199
I'm working on it.

409
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,991
Just want to come by
and congratulate everybody.

410
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:44,330
Good job this week.

411
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:45,795
Thanks, Brent.

412
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,363
Is that next week's cover?

413
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:49,349
That's something
we're playing around with.

414
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,817
I'll let you know when it's locked.

415
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:54,680
We have the parents' cooperation?

416
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:55,441
We'll see.

417
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:56,554
Talk to Legal.

418
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:58,681
They're not public figures.

419
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:00,100
If they won't cooperate--

420
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:01,696
Last week, they weren't public figures.

421
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,025
- Today, the whole world knows them.
- Because of us.

422
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:05,810
You only worry about your image.

423
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:07,863
I'm worried about the magazine's image.

424
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,961
What we publish has consequences.

425
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:11,963
This case was going nowhere
until we stepped in.

426
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,658
If we keep at it,
we may just raise enough hell

427
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,447
to bring this girl's killer to justice.

428
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:18,068
How's that for consequences?

429
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,238
Wow. Seems like I hit a nerve.

430
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,004
What are the odds of that,
like one in a billion?

431
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,103
Oh, God.

432
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,712
The competition on this case
is about to get intense.

433
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:32,783
We need to continue breaking this story.

434
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,530
If we do, we won't get
just one more cover, we'll get five.

435
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,563
"Explosive Reveal
of Unborn Baby's Father."

436
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:39,831
The arrest,

437
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:40,804
perp walk,

438
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,184
trial, justice--

439
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,214
This girl is dead.

440
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:45,454
I wanna know who. I wanna know what.
I wanna know why.

441
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:51,981
Fun story, huh?

442
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:54,672
Yeah, everyone loves a murder.

443
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:57,307
Fifteen and bam!
It's over just like that.

444
00:19:58,124 --> 00:19:58,856
Yeah.

445
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:02,013
You're not objective.

446
00:20:04,394 --> 00:20:05,267
Excuse me?

447
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:06,916
This story.

448
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,508
I know why you're so obsessed by it.

449
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:10,415
Why? I'm a mad genius?

450
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,585
Or is it just my God-given
gift to find editorial gold?

451
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,430
It's the girl.

452
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:24,006
I remember way back
one night you got drunk at McClootey's.

453
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:26,518
Told me the whole story
of your father's suicide.

454
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:29,322
How you found his body when you were 15.

455
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,200
How you never understood why he did it.

456
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,018
You were 15,
just like this girl.

457
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,545
You said you died that day.

458
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:40,968
Your words: "I died that day."

459
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:43,976
You said that's why
you wanted to be a reporter.

460
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,096
So you could know the why of things.

461
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:47,361
I said that?

462
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:50,489
- You were drunk.
- Yeah.

463
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:53,222
Must have been.

464
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:55,115
You said your father's suicide

465
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:57,566
was the one mystery
you most wanted to solve.

466
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:01,544
You said it like
everything would just fall into place

467
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:03,855
if you knew the answer
to that one question, why?

468
00:21:04,742 --> 00:21:05,672
Why'd he do it?

469
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,785
Aren't you curious?

470
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:09,757
About her life, her death?

471
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,376
Don't you want to know what happened?

472
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:15,900
Or have your reporting instincts gone
the way of your liver?

473
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:23,787
You can stop negating my concern
by focusing on my alcoholism.

474
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:25,238
I concede. I'm a drunk.

475
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,821
But you are emotionally
involved in this story and--

476
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:30,075
I'm finding answers.

477
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,104
Not everything has an answer.

478
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:57,052
<i>Cheerleader muder
Her Secret life</i>

479
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:12,019
Don't tell me you can't
do an interview.

480
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,334
You're sitting here getting
a makeover for Larry King.

481
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,486
Everything has to go throh my publicist.

482
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,580
How'd you get a publicist, Andy?

483
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:20,950
Anything to do with all
the coverage I gave you?

484
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:22,269
I'm not saying no, Chuck. Okay?

485
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,788
It's just the deal
with CNN is exclusive.

486
00:22:25,305 --> 00:22:28,215
I think it's just TV, but I don't know.
We may be talking about print.

487
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,025
I can get a different leading man.
It's still my story.

488
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:34,731
Larry's ready when you are.
Just look right into the camera.

489
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:35,967
Wait, wait.

490
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,391
I'm not saying no, okay?

491
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:39,462
It's just that they're talkin'
about a book deal.

492
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,292
Call my publicist.

493
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,466
I may need a ghost writer.

494
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,768
And four, three, two, one--

495
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:49,949
Well?

496
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,562
And you want to release this?

497
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:54,157
Oh, no. Not release.

498
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:56,496
It'll be "stolen" from
her bedroom by a worker.

499
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:59,152
But not a Mexican,
'cause we don't want to be racist.

500
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,187
I have to be honest with you.

501
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:04,549
I don't think anybody really
cares to see this sex tape.

502
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,428
These are the numbers
from our VH1 wedding special.

503
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,994
Check out the 18-34 demo.

504
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:11,095
Boys love her.

505
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:13,050
And every girl wants a little Brady.

506
00:23:13,051 --> 00:23:17,415
Plus, this video totally takes the image
thing and just smashes it on this head.

507
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,307
Yeah

508
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:20,841
You know what? Fast-forward
to the part where you choke me.

509
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,742
I pass out for at least ten seconds.

510
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,538
It's way edgy.

511
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,418
I want to see the part where you drip
the hot candle wax on my balls.

512
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:30,335
<i>There it is.</i>

513
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:32,205
Okay, let me think about this.

514
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,348
All right? And kick it around
with my staff.

515
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,451
- Okay. - Okay.

516
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:36,812
I'll be in touch with Rema.

517
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:38,007
- Great.
- Thank you.

518
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:41,636
I'm sorry, Lucy.

519
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,326
No. I'm glad you're here.

520
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,547
We just finished.

521
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,272
- Who are they?
- A favor to a publicist.

522
00:23:58,463 --> 00:23:59,573
You look good.

523
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,943
- You have work?
- I do.

524
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:04,290
We're doing a crime story
in Walnut Valley.

525
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,700
I need candids of the victim's
friends and family,

526
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:08,069
school, whatever you can get.

527
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,849
You want me to do civilian candids.

528
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,712
- That's what we're doing this week.
- Okay.

529
00:24:14,464 --> 00:24:15,496
What?

530
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:19,772
Not really... challenging.

531
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,792
Well, I think staying on your meds
and off the streets

532
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,826
is challenge enough for this week.

533
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:26,234
<i>Cheerleader muder
Her Secret life</i>

534
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,589
She looks sweet. Sad.

535
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:32,020
- Why? She's smiling.
- Sad smile.

536
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,336
She reminds me of you
when you were younger.

537
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:40,871
Wildcats, Wildcats
Fight, fight, win

538
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,945
And then we'd do this,
like, flip-switch thing.

539
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:45,243
It was cool.

540
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,737
So, what did you think of the story?

541
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,271
I don't know.

542
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,386
What? You can tell me.

543
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,570
It was all about the crime
and her being pregnant.

544
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:03,730
I mean, that's not her whole life,
who she was.

545
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,398
It didn't mention anything
about her friends, or--

546
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:09,589
I know. I'm trying to get them
to let me do a piece on that.

547
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,499
You know, who she was,
and her social life--

548
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,550
baton-twirling partner, boys.

549
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,146
She wasn't about boys.

550
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:21,855
She was about cheerleading,
and her friends, and church.

551
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,842
Maddy, the police want to question
whoever got her pregnant.

552
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:28,172
It's not their business.

553
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,050
Well, it is.

554
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,459
It's too bad, but it is.

555
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,258
- He didn't kill her.
- Who?

556
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:40,615
I just wish people could
remember the good things.

557
00:25:40,616 --> 00:25:43,400
Us-- us smiling, like this.

558
00:25:47,218 --> 00:25:49,331
You know, I think

559
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:53,086
that this would be
a great cover story.

560
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:56,669
That'd be--

561
00:25:58,535 --> 00:26:01,914
And the more I talk to you, the more
I think that this was who she was

562
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:03,213
with you.

563
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,201
But my editor is insane
about cover stories.

564
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:08,610
There needs to be
some more information.

565
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:10,128
It just can't be background.

566
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,343
I don't agree with it,
but that's her deal.

567
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,479
So, if you know who
Amber was sleeping with--

568
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:24,580
Look, Maddy, the police
are going to find out anyway.

569
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:28,984
So if you tell me, at least I can paint
the right picture for people.

570
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,971
Amber did sort of have a boyfriend.

571
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,083
Tyler Kurta.

572
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:41,182
She wasn't allowed to date,
so no one really knew.

573
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:10,147
Hello?

574
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:16,124
Is anyone out there?

575
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:40,139
Are you lost?

576
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:43,878
I-- I think so.

577
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:46,968
Come with me.

578
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:01,119
- It's quiet.
- Yes.

579
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:06,634
Can I take your picture?

580
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:08,558
Of course.

581
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:10,013
But first...

582
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:11,546
let's pray.

583
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:40,459
You know, the book's jammed for
the next few issues, but call me;

584
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,820
we'll see what we can do.

585
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:42,821
Thank you.

586
00:28:46,654 --> 00:28:47,890
There you are.

587
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:51,066
Char, I'd like you to meet
our editor-in-chief, Lucy Spiller.

588
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,232
Lucy, this is Char. She's a, uh,

589
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:55,114
a very talented singer.

590
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:56,733
Oh, I'm sure she is.

591
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:58,594
So the new issue is killing.

592
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,629
Just got the newsstand
numbers, 1.34.

593
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,342
Oh, I hate to say "I told you so."

594
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:05,178
Yeah. That's her favorite expression.

595
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:07,494
So, still exploiting
the dead girl next week?

596
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,294
I don't know, Brent. Still exploiting
the live girl this week?

597
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,710
Looks, brains, and venom.

598
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,478
How do you stay single?

599
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,277
- Oh, you know. It's a battle.
- Yeah.

600
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:18,529
Clearly.

601
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:20,380
- Shall we?
- Nice to meet you.

602
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,793
but, you know,
her sister's in town, so--

603
00:29:28,356 --> 00:29:29,091
Yeah.

604
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:30,171
Holt McLaren.

605
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:33,159
Hi. I heard you closed the deal

606
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,333
to star in Teddy Jick's new
Hard Charger movies.

607
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:36,695
I did.

608
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:39,218
Great. You got a few exclusive
comments for the magazine?

609
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:40,689
Of course. Yeah.

610
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,081
Excuse me, fellas.

611
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,085
Excuse me.

612
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:47,228
Thank you.

613
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:49,610
I don't know how many times
I can tell the same stories

614
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:51,832
to a bunch of strangers
that think they know me.

615
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:53,381
You know?

616
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:55,274
Party vampires. Get used to it.

617
00:29:56,198 --> 00:29:57,715
Can I get another one, please?

618
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:01,798
I hate these damn things.

619
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,761
You got to find a way
to make it amusing.

620
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,062
I like to look and see if
I can find the people

621
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:08,769
who donated 500 bucks to get in,

622
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,662
but spent 10 grand on a dress.

623
00:30:10,882 --> 00:30:12,931
Yeah, that one does sort of scream,

624
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:14,589
"Screw the homeless," right?

625
00:30:16,521 --> 00:30:17,726
I'm done here.

626
00:30:17,727 --> 00:30:19,556
I got a car out back.
You want a ride home?

627
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,956
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

628
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,960
So, star of you own
big action franchise.

629
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:41,650
How does it feel?

630
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:46,942
The first one's not even made.
Who knows if it's gonna hit?

631
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:48,882
It'll hit.

632
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:50,853
Look at you.

633
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:55,156
That's what gonna make you huge,

634
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,668
you know that?
You're a really good actor,

635
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,141
but the thing that'll
make you pop is that

636
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,746
you have the look,
and you don't even know it.

637
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:07,687
If I pop, it's just
because of your magazine.

638
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:10,433
That too.

639
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:18,433
So, I guess I owe you.

640
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,366
Yeah, you do.

641
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:24,249
Yeah.

642
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:49,626
Oh, God.

643
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,964
Are you okay?

644
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:02,169
Yeah.

645
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:10,663
Home, sweet home.

646
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:14,230
Yeah, I can't come in.

647
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:16,725
- Julia's expecting me.
- Did I invite you in?

648
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:20,339
I'm-- I'm sorry.

649
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:23,312
- No, listen. I'm so sorry.
- No, don't apologize.

650
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,299
I'm glad we left at the same time.

651
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:28,792
The car'll take you home.

652
00:33:29,512 --> 00:33:30,450
Thank you.

653
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,609
Any time.

654
00:34:33,684 --> 00:34:35,374
Yo, I need you to pull over.

655
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:38,612
Yo, pull over, please!

656
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,058
No, no, no. Don't mind me.

657
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:20,171
I'm just gonna grab some shit
and see myself out.

658
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:22,126
Jesus, I didn't even
hear you come in.

659
00:35:22,127 --> 00:35:23,300
Yeah, obviously.

660
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:26,446
Please, babe. Come on.

661
00:35:26,837 --> 00:35:29,466
- Come on! We were just--
- Just let him go. Who cares?

662
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:30,812
Shut up. Holt.

663
00:35:32,251 --> 00:35:33,644
Don't come near me!

664
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,239
Don't come near me.

665
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:38,383
Baby, please, come on.

666
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,785
- Listen to yourself begging.
- Get out!

667
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:42,553
Now! Out!

668
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,329
Honey, what are you doing?

669
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:49,394
You really have her
on a leash, don't you?

670
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:52,570
- Please, baby. Nothing happened.
- I don't want to hear it.

671
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm done with your shit.
I am. I'm done.

672
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,732
No! No!

673
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:59,246
Nothing really happened.

674
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:02,377
All right? And it didn't mean
anything, I mean...

675
00:36:02,588 --> 00:36:03,745
these pills, and

676
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,129
and the accident.

677
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:08,853
You did Johnny Gage on your movie
long before the accident.

678
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,989
No, I didn't.

679
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,245
I saw the tape!

680
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:14,654
- I saw it.
- What?

681
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:18,393
Well, yeah, Johnny givin' it to you from
behind in some hotel or some shit?

682
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,823
Yeah.

683
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:24,140
I saw the tape months ago.

684
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,133
Jesus!

685
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,715
You knew someone had a sex tape
on me, and you didn't tell me.

686
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,766
What kind of a person are you?

687
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:37,967
Been askin' the same thing
about you for a long time.

688
00:36:52,227 --> 00:36:53,682
Look, I loved Amber.

689
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,731
And I'd never do anything to hurt her.

690
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:59,384
You think the police are
really gonna believe that?

691
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:02,560
Look, this is your chance to get out
your side of the story.

692
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:04,555
We never did anything wrong.

693
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,651
And we're good Christians, both of us.

694
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,334
She was pregnant, Tyler.

695
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,297
That's not possible.

696
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,457
We took the "True Love Waits"
chastity pledge.

697
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:16,366
- Everyone at church does.
- Tyler--

698
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:18,369
Look, we never had sex.

699
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:20,731
Okay, not "sex" sex.

700
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:22,296
We just--

701
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,973
Look, there's no way
I got Amber pregnant. Okay?

702
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:29,523
Her virginity was sacred to both of us.

703
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:33,411
That's why we agreed
I'd only put it in her butt.

704
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:44,534
There are no shots of the boyfriend.

705
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:45,918
He's her minister.

706
00:37:45,919 --> 00:37:48,061
Okay, but Don, I need
shots of the boyfriend.

707
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:50,721
I can do that.

708
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,130
You look different.

709
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,024
I do?

710
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:07,576
Your hands are relaxed
and your eyes are soft.

711
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:12,133
These shots are useless.

712
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:13,885
I need you to go back
and get more.

713
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:17,061
Less pious minister,
more ass-banging boyfriend.

714
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:19,361
Okay.

715
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,856
Grab something to eat.

716
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:34,447
Peanut butter and bana on the croissant.

717
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:40,115
I've seen your stuff
in a gallery somewhere, right?

718
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:42,008
No. No.

719
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:44,183
Nah, this is--
This is just for me.

720
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,366
It's too bad. They're beautiful.

721
00:39:16,502 --> 00:39:17,816
Where'd you go?

722
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,354
Just out drivin'.

723
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:26,645
Did you expect everything to be
different when you got back here?

724
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,248
What happened to us?

725
00:39:50,136 --> 00:39:51,294
I don't know.

726
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,460
Other things just took over.

727
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,215
How do we go back?

728
00:40:05,118 --> 00:40:08,799
I wish we could just
get out of here, you know?

729
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:13,775
Go someplace nobody knows us.

730
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,192
Where?

731
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:32,220
These stories always
need great characters.

732
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,706
A hero making the case.

733
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,349
Could be the medical examiner.

734
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,882
You can drop the sales pitch.

735
00:40:37,403 --> 00:40:39,437
<i>NationalEnquirer's already offered me</i>

736
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,799
10 grand for a first look at my report.

737
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:45,085
So... what's it really worth?

738
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:49,168
This small town's just not as quaint
as it used to be, is it?

739
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:51,820
Twenty grand, cash.

740
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:53,932
And that's exclusive.
No one else sees it.

741
00:40:54,714 --> 00:40:55,716
Okay.

742
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:00,883
Better be worth it.

743
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:02,625
Oh, it is.

744
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:06,567
We've I. D.'d the father
of the victim's unborn baby.

745
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:09,445
My God.

746
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,999
<i>Cheerleader murder, he did it.
Rev's shocking admission</i>

747
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,299
God bless Don Konkey.

748
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,201
He had the right shots all along.
What do you think?

749
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,360
I think it's not accurate.

750
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:19,971
Excuse me?

751
00:41:20,596 --> 00:41:22,176
It implies he killed the girl.

752
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:25,618
He's her minister, he got her pregnant,

753
00:41:25,954 --> 00:41:27,002
she's murdered--

754
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,661
readers will draw their own conclusions.

755
00:41:28,825 --> 00:41:30,766
Off a headline that reads,
"He did it"?

756
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,518
It refers to getting her pregnant.

757
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:34,214
Oh, please.

758
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,263
The cover's a lie, and you know it.

759
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:39,502
The cover is a sales tool,
the story is inside, and it's accurate.

760
00:41:40,535 --> 00:41:42,115
This is why I don't do this anymore.

761
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,622
I get sent in to get facts,

762
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:45,781
and they get twisted around
to make the cover work.

763
00:41:45,906 --> 00:41:49,238
The guy is a child-violating asshole.
That is fact.

764
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:51,741
You can keep goin' after
everyone in the world,

765
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,324
expose everyone else's secrets, but
it's not gonna get you what you want.

766
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,375
It's not gonna tell you
why your father killed himself.

767
00:41:58,523 --> 00:42:00,416
Get out! Drunk.

768
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:04,436
The wall is locked. Get it to press.

769
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,753
<i>Reverend Thomas Sweet was
arrested today</i>

770
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:10,544
<i>for the murder of
15-year-old Amber Carmichael</i>

771
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:12,280
<i>in Walnut Valley, California.</i>

772
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:15,941
<i>Dirt Now's new issue says that
according to the coroner's report,</i>

773
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,555
<i>Reverend Sweet was the father
of the victim's unborn child.</i>

774
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:20,790
Oh, my God, Willa.

775
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:21,964
Oh, my God.

776
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:23,888
I got here as fast as I could.
Are you okay?

777
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:26,204
Who told you my father killed Amber?

778
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:27,268
Who said that?

779
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:30,186
Look, Maddy, I know that
you must be really freaked out,

780
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:31,563
seeing your father get arrested--

781
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:34,723
It's in your magazine.
The cover. "He did it."

782
00:42:34,724 --> 00:42:35,873
He didn't do it.

783
00:42:36,843 --> 00:42:39,550
Maddy, your father got Amber pregnant.

784
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:42,037
I know, but he didn't kill her!

785
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:44,056
It's all wrong!

786
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,996
I loved him.

787
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,657
She seduced him.
She preyed on him.

788
00:42:49,658 --> 00:42:50,705
It was her.

789
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:53,177
What?

790
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:57,002
Look, it's okay. You can--

791
00:42:57,003 --> 00:42:58,050
It's not okay.

792
00:42:58,394 --> 00:43:01,993
He's my father.
He loved me, not her.

793
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:05,465
What we had was ours. Sacred!

794
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,812
Ours, and God's,

795
00:43:08,008 --> 00:43:10,550
and no one else's. That's what he said!

796
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:14,743
When she told me she was going
to have his baby, I just--

797
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:17,340
I had to kill her.

798
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:20,946
I did!

799
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,606
He wasn't supposed to be
with anyone but me!

800
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,772
That was our promise!

801
00:43:27,554 --> 00:43:29,119
So I killed her!

802
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,565
I did it...

803
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,692
not Daddy.

804
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,486
This should be me on the cover.

805
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:36,894
Me.
