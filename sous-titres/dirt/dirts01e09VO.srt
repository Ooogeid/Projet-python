<i>In last week's episode,</i>

7
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:12,670
<i>Julia got a visit in rehab from Holt.</i>

8
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:14,757
- These are cold.
<i>She got cold chicken wings...</i>

9
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:16,724
- Sorry.
<i>...and an apology.</i>

10
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,462

11

15
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,737
Wish we had that surveillance footage
from your work parking garage.

16
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:39,229
We could sprint right through
to the finish line.

17
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:42,062
Come on. You don't think vandals
knocked out that camera, do you ?

18
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:43,880
Whoever did, broke into
two other cars.

19
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,647
Could be a coincidence...
or not.

20
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,618
We tried to trace the IP address from
the IM you got,

21
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:51,448
but it came from
an unregistered server.

22
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:52,903
Any hack could have sent it.

23
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:56,973
He left this
in my paper this morning.

24
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:58,504
What makes you think
it's a he?

25
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,941
Because I don't know any woman who
has that kind of time on her hands.

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,413
Open your eyes wide.

27
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:08,123
It's the only way to see
what you can't look at.

28
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:12,815
This is a haiku. Five syllables
followed by seven, then five again.

29
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,281
So I'm being stalked
by a poet?

30
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:15,513
And not a very good one.

31
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:19,072
Haiku are usually about the seasons,
nature, that sort of thing.

32
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:21,194
Well, you're my security guy.
What do we do?

33
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:22,240
Nothing.

34
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,211
You're saying I don't need
to worry about this?

35
00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:25,256
Didn't say that.

36
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,145
People's biggest mistake
is engaging these assholes.

37
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,679
That'll be his foot in the door.

38
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:31,398
This is about control.

39
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,861
Absolute control
equals true love.

40
00:01:34,342 --> 00:01:36,817
If you engage him in any manner,
then it's game on for him.

41
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,069
See, your rejection
isn't complete if

42
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:40,686
he's still
screwing with your life.

43
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:43,155
No offense, but I've been to
parades with fewer people

44
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:44,715
than your list of possible suspects.

45
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,265
None taken.
If it were smaller,

46
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:48,350
I'd be unemployed.

47
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:50,989
Let me whittle this down to 10
or so, and we'll go from there.

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:52,197
Okay, good luck.

49
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,919
Do you know anyone with
any kind of mental illness?

50
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:56,430
Paranoia ?
Schizophrenia ?

51
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,521
Erotomania ?

52
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,301
A lot of these stalkers
have very rigid personalities.

53
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,234
- They're maladaptive.
- No. No one springs to mind.

54
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:04,975
Excuse me.

55
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,016
Have you heard the news?

56
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:13,514
Okay, let's save some time here
and assume that I haven't.

57
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,822
Your cover story on Dana Pritchard and
Joey Perez's upcoming wedding

58
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,054
It's been called off.

59
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:22,303
That's bullshit. I've approved $700,000
for their exclusive rights.

60
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,192
I've got three covers
tied up in this.

61
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,418
Dana's publicist called. They're sending
out a press release in an hour.

62
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:29,078
All right. I'm on my way in.

63
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,530
I want you to get Don Konkey

64
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:34,861
and everyone else. Tell them to be in
the conference room in 20 minutes.

65
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:39,310
Also call Dana and Joey's publicists.
Now, Kenny.

66
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,484
If these assholes
screw up my cover,

67
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,759
you'll have a few more names
to put on that list.

68
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,012
Hey, baby.

69
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,860
Hey. It's Daddy.

70
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,431
What are you doing?

71
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:01,443
You being a good girl?

72
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:05,760
That sounds like
a lot of fun.

73
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,849
I have to go now.

74
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:20,349
Daddy loves you
past the sun.

75
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,135
I love you the most.

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,689
Say bye-bye.

77
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:32,267
Bye-bye.

Dirt - Season 01
Episode 09

82
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:52,955
"This Is Not Your Father's
Hostage Situation"

83
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:19,938
Don't. I don't want those.

84
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:55,355
Jimmy, there were here two days ago,

85
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,923
and she still had a little of the
ride over on her chin.

86
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:01,502
But I know that he's on
a plane to Miami by himself.

87
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,690
Right. Okay, so there's
an illness in her family,

88
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,368
and he goes on vacation.

89
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:10,992
Okay, don't take this personally,
but you're an idiot.

90
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,311
Which is not my objection.
My objection is

91
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,774
that you would assume I would
believean idiot.

92
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:19,164
Listen, I want you to pull
all the photos from the last 24 hours.

93
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:21,398
- I wanna know everywhere they've been.
- Got it.

94
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,988
Okay, Jimmy,

95
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,324
You better
tell me the truth.

96
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:28,519
Because if I have to work to get it out
of you, you ain't gonna like it.

97
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,426
New story. How it all fell apart.

98
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,842
- McPherson ?
- Well, I spoke with Dana's agent.

99
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,414
She's tap dancing like crazy.

100
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:40,898
First, her sick relative was her aunt.
Then it was her grandmother.

101
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:43,479
Either they're dropping like
flies in the Pritchard household

102
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:45,582
or they're just flying
by the seat of their pants.

103
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:47,361
Sounds like someone
hit his fiancée again.

104
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,421
I don't think so.

105
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,075
Spoke to Joey's people,
and sounds like

106
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,298
they've cornered the market
on righteous indignation.

107
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:53,413
So it's her ?

108
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,091
His agent says that all further inquiry
should be handled through Dana's people.

109
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,320
Okay, let's do a little
good cop/bad cop.

110
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:01,892
Terry and Willa, I want you
to help Dana deal with her guilt,

111
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:05,156
while you 2 become drinking buddies with
the Perez camp, see what you can get.

112
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,247
What other job allows you
to expense a strip club ?

113
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:09,076
Why does it always
have to be a strip club ?

114
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:10,977
We've got 24 hours.

115
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:12,914
You all know the drill.

116
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,735
Sorry. It's this...

117
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:24,231
It's just this
damn medication.

118
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:28,302
It's just nice
to be next to you again.

119
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,456
God, I wish you didn't
have to go.

120
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:37,104
I'll just be an hour tops.

121
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:41,223
Clean out my trailer,
then I'll be back.

122
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,168
You smell so good.

123
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,802
You sure there's nothing
I can help you with?

124
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,106
You like that ?

125
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:01,111
I have something
you can do.

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,288
- Holt.
- Shh.

127
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,285
- Look--
- Did I say you could speak ?

128
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:45,546
No. Is it still in your ass ?

129
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,813
It better be.

130
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,094
Meet me in the supply
closet in 20 minutes.

131
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,921
Sammy Winter called again.He said
it was about a follow-up interview.

132
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,170
We've done enough stories
on Sammy Winter and his...

133
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,270
futile attempt at rehab,

134
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:06,938
his prostitutes, the trials and
tribulations of being a child star.

135
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:08,948
So unless he's banging
an Olsen twin

136
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,728
or he has bought some ad space,
I don't give a shit.

137
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,109
Johnny Gage is in your office.

138
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:18,314
Johnny Gage is in my office
and you open with Sammy Winter ?

139
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:20,062
Way to bury a lead.

140
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,019
What are you doing, Gage ?

141
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,435
Just checking out
the power seat.

142
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:29,984
And what do you want ?

143
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:32,711
I've got a scoop on something
I thought might interest you.

144
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:36,699
Joey Perez didn't
call off the wedding.

145
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,763
- Dana did.
- No shit.

146
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:40,194
We're all over that.

147
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:43,165
What if I told you that
Dana broke it off

148
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,394
because she's switching
to an all-carpet diet?

149
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:47,013
I'd tell you
to get to the point.

150
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:50,063
First a little quid pro quota.

151
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:52,528
- Where's the love?
- Come again?

152
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:57,127
Johnny Gage has disappeared
from the pages of <i>DirtNow</i>.

153
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:58,464
What's with that ?

154
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:02,178
I guess we ran out of different ways
to tell about you screwing strippers.

155
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:07,950
- I want a cover.
- And I want a private jet.

156
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:12,267
<i>DirtNow</i> is not gonna blow you over
some half-assed speculation.

157
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:15,669
Trust me. This is full-assed.

158
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,576
She was supposed to meet him
for lunch yesterday.

159
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:20,477
Totally blew him off.

160
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:23,445
Called him from
the chick's cell phone.

161
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:24,782
- Hope Duggan ?
- Yep.

162
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:27,597
Dude's major messed up over this.

163
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:29,407
She's not even that good-looking.

164
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,973
I, uh, did her once in
the parking lot of Whole Foods.

165
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:35,061
Shit. We had it right
the whole time.

166
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,938
Dana said she thought about it

167
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,560
and would rather
lose her career than Hope.

168
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:43,449
I was so ahead of the curve on this one.
I was at their house,

169
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:46,112
and their TiVo is all,
like, Ellenshows.

170
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:50,686
I gotta take this.

171
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:53,349
- Give your story to Terry.
- What about my cover ?

172
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:55,015
I'll work on it.
Shut the door.

173
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:56,186
Hold on one second.

174
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,602
Who's Terry ?

175
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:06,647
Hey.

176
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:08,910
The movie's wrapped.

177
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:12,159
Oh, great. Just in time for
Julia's homecoming.

178
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,472
How is she ?

179
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,915
She's okay, I guess.

180
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:18,657
What is it you want, Holt ?

181
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:20,241
I don't know.

182
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,757
Well, call me when you do.

183
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,095
No, no, wait. Lucy.

184
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,051
Look, I need to see you.

185
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:29,904
Why ?

186
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:32,285
Come on. Does it have
to be like this ?

187
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,701
I need to hear it.

188
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:38,093
All you need to do
is ask, Holt.

189
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,237
<i>Hey, look, I can't stop
thinking about you.</i>

190
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:44,205
<i>You know, it's like you're
in my head all the time.</i>

191
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:46,794
You know...

192
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,023
I need to be...

193
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:51,509
with you.

194
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,665
You mean inside of me ?

195
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:02,100
I can't. I have a lot of work to do.
Call me later.

196
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:10,514
Hi.

197
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:11,851
What's with the ugly luggage ?

198
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,130
It's little Tristan.

199
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,667
He's having trouble peeing

200
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,802
He's got a vet's appointment
in an hour.

201
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:19,357
- Are you feeding him wet or dry?
- Mainly dry.

202
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,753
What's the ash content ?

203
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,237
What are you talking about ?

204
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,791
I took a year of veterinary medicine

205
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,600
before I decided
to switch to journalism.

206
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,746
High contents of ash
can usually cause

207
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,306
Feline Urologic Syndrome.

208
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,908
It's basically a blockage
of the urinary tract.

209
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:33,597
It's very common
in male cats.

210
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,345
How's his stool ?

211
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:37,480
I got some in the car.
You wanna take a look?

212
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:39,784
- Yeah. It'd be a pleasure.
- That's great.

213
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,169
That's money well-spent.

214
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:42,752
Hey, Don.

215
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:45,040
I need you to cover
Hope Duggan's hangouts.

216
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:46,435
- Again?
- Again.

217
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,247
Come on, move ! Move !

218
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,891
Back off !
Get down on the floor !

219
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:01,745
Stay down !
Get back !

220
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:05,616
There's a man with a gun.

221
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:06,754
Down !

222
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,962
Hey, Lucy.

223
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:14,998
Get down, you stupid-looking bastard.

224
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:16,769
Back off !
Back off !

225
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,467
Get down !
Down !

226
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:20,980
Down !

227
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:23,999
Back off, buddy !

228
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:25,266
That's right !
Get down !

229
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:26,861
Look away !

230
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,556
Everybody back off !

231
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,057
Hi, Lucy.

232
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:39,679
In the future,

233
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,658
when Sammy Winter calls,
it's best you take it.

234
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:49,884
Listen up.

235
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:51,186
Everybody...

236
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:52,930
I want all your
cell phones,

237
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:55,064
Blackberries, whatever-you-got
communication

238
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:56,824
device in this basket,

239
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:58,419
Now ! Come on !

240
00:12:58,525 --> 00:12:59,956
Give it to me !
Put it in here !

241
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:01,934
Come on ! Hurry up !
Hurry up !

242
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:04,127
Come on! Thank you. Thank you.

243
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:05,957
Good boy. Come on !

244
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:07,623
Give it to me ! Come on !

245
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,688
Give it up ! Hurry up !

246
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:11,527
Give it to me.
Very good.

247
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:13,991
You. Both.

248
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:15,293
No one moves.

249
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,275
Good job.
Thank you.

250
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:19,398
Thank you. Very good.

251
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:23,964
All the exits have been padlocked,

252
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:25,782
so everybody just get comfy.

253
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,167
Get comfy.

254
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,746
Everybody does
exactly as they're told,

255
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:32,916
no one will get hurt.

256
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:34,218
Got that ?

257
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:35,672
No one gets hurt.

258
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:37,784
If anybody wants to get cute,

259
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:39,986
I've got

260
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,414
enough explosives here

261
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:45,370
to blow us all into pizza toppings.

262
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:46,965
Are we clear ?

263
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:48,936
Everybody's clear, right ?

264
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,098
All the exits are padlocked.

265
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:55,752
Only way out's through the bullpen,

266
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:56,972
that's where the gunman is.

267
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,083
- God. Did he shoot anybody ?
- I don't think so.

268
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,921
I think it was just
to get their attention.

269
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,012
What is your plan?

270
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,590
My plan is for us to be as quiet as

271
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,573
church mice until this
whole thing is over.

272
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:09,763
Hiding while others may die
is not a plan.

273
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:13,582
Neither is rushing a gunman from
40 feet away with your cleaning lady.

274
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,884
You okay ?

275
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,826
Maybe you can create a diversion.

276
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:18,492
Or maybe we can sit here

277
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,424
like I just said
and let this thing play out !

278
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,885
American men, you have no balls.

279
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,185
- I'm okay.
- Buddy...

280
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,898
I know you're pissed, buddy...

281
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,525
but I will blow your brains out.

282
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,659
I'm okay.

283
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,028
Don, I'm okay.
Don ! God damn it, look at me !

284
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:41,224
Go ahead, Don.

285
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,995
- I'm okay.
- Come on.

286
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,517
- Do you understand ?
- Go ahead, Don.

287
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,926
- Do you understand ?
- Gimme that ice.

288
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:49,498
Sweetheart,

289
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,292
- gimme your blouse.
- What ?

290
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,911
I need it to wrap the ice.

291
00:14:53,204 --> 00:14:54,870
- Come on !
- You can have my shirt.

292
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:56,308
Thanks, buddy...

293
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:59,557
But that much cologne that close to her
face will cause brain damage.

294
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:01,152
Give it to me, princess !

295
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:04,085
Give it to me ! Come on !

296
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:07,487
Here you go.

297
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:10,584
Put this on you...

298
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:14,766
I'm sorry, okay ?

299
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:19,265
I had to let everyone know
that I mean business, okay ?

300
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,920
Take out the ram, the sheep
fall into place, all right ?

301
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:26,545
Seriously, though, would it have
killed you to call me back ?

302
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,062
Who are you ?

303
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:33,566
Look at this guy. Look at this guy.
Who is this guy ?

304
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,481
He's gonna pretend that
he doesn't

305
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:37,618
know who I am.

306
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,242
'Cause God forbid you
should give me the satisfaction

307
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,873
of your measly acknowledgment, right ?

308
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:44,363
His name is Sammy Winter.

309
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:46,630
He's a former child star
from a show <i>Buster Rules.

310
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:48,635
That's right. '81 through '89.

311
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:51,416
<i>Buster Rules</i>. 2-time
People's Choice winner.

312
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,668
Ring a bell, buddy ?
Remember ?

313
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:56,563
Jesus Christ. This guy's a...

314
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,011
Okay, Sammy, you've got my attention.
What is it that you want ?

315
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:01,994
I want you, to keep your promise.

316
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,399
That's what I want.
I want you to keep your promise.

317
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:06,104
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

318
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,568
1989.

319
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:13,741
<i>Buster Rules</i> about to wrap a 9-year run

320
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,312
as perennial top 20 show.
That's right.

321
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:19,549
I pick a young go-getter named...

322
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:21,453
Lucy Spiller.

323
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,706
Yeah, at <i>TV Guide</i>.

324
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,579
I pick her over all the others
to do my exclusive.

325
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:28,961
- Ring a bell, Lucy ?
- Of course it does

326
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,151
That's right. I was gonna do a cover.

327
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:32,864
And you said you owed me.

328
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,717
Those were your words, Lucy.

329
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,064
Your words. You owe me.

330
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:39,996
Well, I'm here to collect.

331
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:44,021
Company.

332
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:46,026
Beautiful.

333
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:47,434
Company. Come on !

334
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,381
Don, please ! Please !

335
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:50,789
- Please, Don.
- It's okay.

336
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,675
Back up !

337
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,748
It's gonna be okay.

338
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:04,092
Thank you for the shirt.

339
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,101
Do you really think everything's
gonna be all right ?

340
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:11,959
Absolutely.

341
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:16,432
Let's go. Come on.

342
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:18,280
Keep 'em coming.

343
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,924
We don't have time!

344
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,993
Yeah? Well, then we're
gonna have to find a way

345
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,332
to make enough time, okay?
I mean,

346
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,600
what-- who's your cover
this month? Who is it?

347
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:37,220
Joey Perez and Dana Pritchard.
That's crap, man!

348
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:39,922
I've shat out things more
interesting than those two.

349
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:42,504
Do a story on me.
Dedicated to

350
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:44,273
Sammy Winter, okay?

351
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:45,575
What I'm really like.

352
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:49,038
How I'm the most misunderstood
person in Hollywood.

353
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,316
We can touch on my alcoholism,

354
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:53,228
the infidelities.
We'll do the whole

355
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:55,178
story behind the story.
The whole thing.

356
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,082
- A beautiful cover.
- Excuse me.

357
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:58,888
Johnny Gage!

358
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,589
Now way! Dude.

359
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,878
Dude... Ladies and gentlemen,

360
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:05,015
Johnny Gage in the house.
Dude.

361
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,364
Good to see you, dude.
You look great.

362
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:09,005
- Great.
- Thanks, man.

363
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:11,037
Got a movie going,
right? Big movie?

364
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:12,287
Listen,

365
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,453
this guy was on my show back in the day.
My radio show. You remember that?

366
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,019
- Sure. Great show.
- Great show.

367
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:18,951
How-- how's it going?

368
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:21,149
I got fired yesterday.

369
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:22,775
Do you believe that shit?

370
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,509
And they kept on that talent less

371
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:25,563
bitch.

372
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:28,905
Man, she was about
as entertaing as a pledge drive.

373
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,088
I'm so sorry, man. I'm--

374
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,137
Look, I'm working on
this new movie.

375
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:35,703
I have a meeting.

376
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:38,360
I was wondering if I could,
you know, go.

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,009
Dude.

378
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,086
You're Johnny Gage.

379
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:43,509
Thank you.

380
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,059
- Thanks, man.
- They'll reschedule.

381
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,663
Sit down.
Come on. Let's start--

382
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:47,987
Let him go.

383
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:49,418
Let half of these people go.

384
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,729
What are they gonna do?
Call the cops?

385
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,806
No. Everybody stays.

386
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:55,800
Look, no disrespect, man,

387
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,140
but she's right.

388
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:00,201
What have any of us ever done to you?

389
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:05,817
You stopped caring.

390
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,350
Why do you carry on with this one?

391
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:14,931
He has no character.

392
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:17,039
We're just co-workers.

393
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:18,560
So, what...

394
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:21,052
you were in a meeting
when I walked in?

395
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,622
Please. Besides,

396
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:24,640
who do you think cleans up
after you at night?

397
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,169
- The condom fairy?
- I'm sorry, dear.

398
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:28,418
What's your name?

399
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:29,863
Maria.

400
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:32,664
How original. Maria,

401
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,380
shut the hell up.

402
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,563
Is it hard to hear?
That you're a coward?

403
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:37,639
- Oh, my God.
- Sitting

404
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,646
there with your knees
in your chest, like a fetus.

405
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,969
Why do you give it away to this?

406
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:44,406
Could you just shut up?

407
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:47,342
I can tell a lot about
a man from his office.

408
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,283
Your friend has no photos.

409
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,872
No girlfriend, no wife,

410
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,213
no smiling children watching
him from inside

411
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:55,260
the frame while he does his work.

412
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:56,992
Just things.

413
00:19:57,383 --> 00:19:59,491
Nothing that tells us why he's here.

414
00:20:02,514 --> 00:20:04,321
Willa, what's the matter?

415
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,474
I can't breathe.

416
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:10,965
Willa.

417
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:14,086
She's claustrophobia.
Breathe.

418
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,924
What?

419
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,426
I really like that piece you did
on sneaker freaks.

420
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:35,504
Thanks.

421
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,911
I'm a total sneaker freak.

422
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:43,839
I waited in line 36 hours for
these limited edition SB Dunks.

423
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:46,873
I'm a Converse gal.

424
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:50,486
SBs are cool, though.

425
00:20:57,963 --> 00:20:59,950
"Who are your biggest influences?"

426
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:03,022
"What was your favorite
episode of Buster Rules?"

427
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,683
I mean, no one's gonna
wanna read this.

428
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:07,317
<i>The hostage situation here
at Dirt Now magazine...</i>

429
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,139
It just got picked up national.

430
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:11,066
<i>The gunman has now
been confirmed to be...</i>

431
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,155
- This is my white Bronco.
- <i>...Eddie Winter.</i>

432
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:14,793
- <i>In addition to having</i>

433
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:18,526
<i>Winter is believed to have
a bomb strapped to his body,</i>

434
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:22,125
<i>making the negotiators
strategy that much more difficult.</i>

435
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,491
<i>Thanks, Jane.</i>

436
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:26,085
We have more information on
what is now being referred to as

437
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:28,057
<i>the Sammy Winter saga.</i>

438
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,821
<i>The controversial editor of
the tabloid Dirt Now, Lucy Spiller,</i>

439
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:34,952

the hostages inside the building.</i>

440
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:38,678
<i>Sammy Winter, 38, started in
television at the age of 6--</i>

441
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,905
Six years old.

442
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,321
Quiet, quiet, quiet. We'll listen.

443
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,317
<i>He parlayed that into several
70s Movies of the Week.</i>

444
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:46,724
Guys,

445
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:49,712
how does it feel to be part
of television history, people?

446
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:52,219
- This is great!
- <i>...and theM. O. W. Confessions</i>

447
00:21:52,297 --> 00:21:53,456
<i>of Thalidomide Baby.</i>

448
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:55,082
I loved that movie.

449
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:56,369
That was great.

450
00:21:57,302 --> 00:21:59,651
- Very good.
- I've got a deal for you.

451
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:01,690
I'm all ears, baby.
What do you got for me?

452
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,190
Let's scrap the bullshit questions.

453
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:08,141
You let me tell the first-person
story from inside the cris,

454
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:11,371
and I will give you
the mother of all covers.

455
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:13,764
Okay. But what's the Sammy angle?

456
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:15,179
A one-on-one with me.

457
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:16,798
Everything you wanted to know about

458
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:19,387
Sammy Winter but were afraid to ask.

459
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:21,005
Good. Good stuff.

460
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:22,692
One-on-one with Sammy Winter.

461
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:23,881
8 pages.

462
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:25,973
Full spreads.

463
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,200
And a second sidebar reporting
from inside the siege.

464
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,377
Let me do my job
the way I know how,

465
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:34,455
and I will make you a star.

466
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:37,286
Sweetheart, I am a star.

467
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,071
You just need
to remind people, okay?

468
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:42,517
Come on! We got
a magazine to put out!

469
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:45,257
Come on! Do your magazine thing,
whatever you guys do.

470
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:46,401
Let's do it!

471
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:47,643
Good stuff.

472
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:49,028
Very good, Lucy.

473
00:23:06,654 --> 00:23:09,217
What do you like about me?

474
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,551
You're shitting me, right?

475
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:12,140
No, I wanna know.

476
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,163
What do you like?

477
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:14,709
Well, I don't know.

478
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,604
You're warm
and have no standards.

479
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:20,917
Your ass is so out the door
when this is over.

480
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:22,233
Am I wrong?

481
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:26,589
A little girl with
your eyes shut and legs open.

482
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:29,906
You are candy, nothing more.

483
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:31,889
Your assumption is arrogant,

484
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:34,975
and your face is
starting to piss me off.

485
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:45,851
Besides, I'm the one in control.

486
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,806
He's the one with the 3-inch
butt plug in his ass.

487
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:53,272
He dared me to take it to the
next level, and I did.

488
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:54,979
Right, honey?

489
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:57,727
Oh, my God.

490
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,623
Okay, everything but the cover story
has to be locked

491
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:02,210
and out of the building by 9:00.

492
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:03,934
I want a splashy cover.

493
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:05,906
I want you to go to Photoshop,

494
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:08,854
pull all the pictures of Sammy
from different points in his career.

495
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:11,716
- That's a good idea.
- All right. Where's McPherson?

496
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:14,596
I think she got out.

497
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:16,457
Lucky her.

498
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:19,854
All right, Naomi, let's hold off on the
"Anorexia in Hollywood" piece,

499
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:22,578
and ask makeup if there are any
filler ads that we can drop.

500
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:23,730
Okay.

501
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,395
- Don?
- Hurry up.

502
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:28,050
I want you staying with me.

503
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,981
I'm gonna need to develop the film.

504
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:32,550
What do you mean develop?

505
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:34,384
Can't you use digital or something?

506
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,746
No. Only film.

507
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:41,850
He's not right, is he?

508
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:43,635
He's the best there is.

509
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:48,007
He's gonna need access to the photo lab
which in on the second floor.

510
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:51,323
Okay.

511
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,950
You know, Don,

512
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,519
I trust you.

513
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:56,795
You only look stupid.

514
00:24:56,888 --> 00:25:01,336
I bet you there's a whole lotta shit
going on up there in the attic, huh?

515
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,560
Oh! I'm on TV!

516
00:25:06,183 --> 00:25:07,256
There I am!

517
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,343
I'm gonna need a tape recorder.
And someone get me some food.

518
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:11,550
Lucy.

519
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,378
Lucy, I need to leave.

520
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,936
Gage, I don't know if you've noticed,

521
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:18,557
but there's a guy over there with
a gun who's calling the shots.

522
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,298
Talk to him. I gotta go.
I got-- I feel sick.

523
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:25,081
Gage.
Gage.

524
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:26,805
What's up, dude?

525
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:29,581
I need to go.

526
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,719
You know what movie you were great in?

527
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:34,501
The Deal.
You remember that one?

528
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:37,725
You're the hostage negotiator,
and you played by your own rules.

529
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:38,967
That movie rocked, dude.

530
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:40,639
Critics panned it.

531
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:43,009
It grossed over $200 million worldwide.

532
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:44,388
The critics.
What do they know?

533
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,922
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down!

534
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:49,009
I wanna ask you something.
Sit down.

535
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,515
Listen.

536
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:55,579
I may need a little help with the end
of this one. You know what I mean?

537
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:58,239
Be great to have you on
as a consultant.

538
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:05,641
<i>Winter is said to have enough
dynamite strapped to his body</i>

539
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:07,727
<i>to level the entire building.</i>

540
00:26:07,728 --> 00:26:10,175
<i>That is a direct quote
from Winter himself.</i>

541
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:13,203
<i>And though there is no truth
validating that claim...</i>

542
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:15,565
God, this is awful.

543
00:26:16,513 --> 00:26:17,910
Yeah.

544
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:22,607
They've shut Wilshire down
all the way to San Vincente.

545
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,279
Is that for tonight?

546
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:28,348
Yeah.

547
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:30,675
I'm a little nervous.

548
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,520
Screw it.
Let's just stay here.

549
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:36,761
Come on. It's your wrap party.
We have to go.

550
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,071
I just...

551
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:40,906
Never mind.

552
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:42,786
What?

553
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:46,872
Just say it.

554
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:50,569
The tape.

555
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:52,379
The tape of me and...

556
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:54,976
It's out there and...

557
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,165
I don't know who's seen it
or who has it and...

558
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,786
No one's seen it,
I prom--

559
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:01,338
Listen, I promise you.

560
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:02,604
How do you know that?

561
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:05,793
I don't-- I don't even
understand how you saw it.

562
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:08,179
And you won't talk
to me about who--

563
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:10,748
Just-- just trust me.

564
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:11,921
But how...

565
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,421
How come I have to trust you?

566
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:16,100
Why can't you just tell me?

567
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,841
Who are you trying to protect, Holt?

568
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,497
Because it sure doesn't feel like me.

569
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:29,693
Listen to me.

570
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,658
I'll always take care of you.

571
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:37,806
Come on, you know that, babe.

572
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,616
Why don't you slip into
that little dress,

573
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,715
and you and me can go out
and have a good time.

574
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:11,303
<i>Spiller, known throughout
Hollywood as one of the most</i>

575
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,251
<i>powerful people in the art of...</i>

576
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:15,940
I had a head cold
when we filmed that.

577
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:19,689
So I spent the whole day looping,

578
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,654
trying to get my dialogue
intelligible, you know?

579
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:26,310
And...

580
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,247
I went home...

581
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:31,437
and my mom was like...

582
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,678
"Dad's gone."

583
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,917
He cleaned us out.

584
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:41,831
Just took off.
Like...

585
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:45,072
like he checked out of a hotel.

586
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:49,873
Did you ever see him again?

587
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,063
Nope.

588
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,132
Uncle got a letter from him a
couple of years ago, but...

589
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:02,633
Do you have any idea...

590
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:05,771
what it's like to lose
the compass in your life?

591
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:07,623
To have them just split like that?

592
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:13,054
Nothing left to exonerate you.
Just... split.

593
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:14,819
You know?

594
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,595
Leaving you to fill in the blanks.

595
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:22,923
You know, I can forgive the guy
for taking off,

596
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:25,545
taking every last penny.

597
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,062
It's just the cruelty

598
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:33,396
that I'm have trouble
coming to terms with.

599
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:36,500
He must have really...

600
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:38,827
just hated us.

601
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:41,431
It's not his hate.

602
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:43,765
It's his indifference.

603
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:45,886
Indifference is worse.

604
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:51,635
<i>And now with live-breaking news,
we go back to the scene.</i>

605
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:54,273
<i>There's been little contact
with Sammy Winter.</i>

606
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:56,359
<i>since the early moments of the siege.</i>

607
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,044
<i>Negotiators say this one may drag
on for a least a day or two.</i>

608
00:30:01,253 --> 00:30:03,597
<i>Since the cancellation...</i>

609
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:08,080
That perm was a big, big mistake.

610
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,880
- Nice perm.
- Tell me about it. God.

611
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:16,709
I don't know. I mean...

612
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,813
I love her, but I'm not
inlove with her, you know?

613
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:20,313
Yeah, totally.

614
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:24,090
You can't live your life for
someone else, you know?

615
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:27,992
I mean, I'm always gonna be
there for the kid and stuff and...

616
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:31,832
God, I feel like
such a loser saying that.

617
00:30:31,923 --> 00:30:34,509
You are not a loser.

618
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:35,910
Look at me.

619
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,686
I am looking.

620
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:43,169
And I see a sexy, sweet, nice guy
that anybody'd be lucky to have.

621
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,811
I don't have a shot yet.

622
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:57,751
- This one's pretty good.
- It's not it.

623
00:30:58,077 --> 00:30:59,370
I'll get it, though.

624
00:31:00,422 --> 00:31:01,749
I know you will.

625
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,594
You feel bad for him, don't you?

626
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:10,429
I'm just concerned about
getting us out of here safely.

627
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:15,878
When I was growing up, we used to
have this poodle called Frenchie.

628
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:17,418
Frenchie?

629
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:18,935
Whenever my dad would come home,

630
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:21,573
he'd walk right past me and my mom
and go play with the dog,

631
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:23,512
like we weren't even there.

632
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,546
He tried his best.

633
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,753
He was the one that got
me into wearing hats.

634
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:35,674
He wore hats all the time.

635
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,588
When he'd come home drunk

636
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:41,782
he'd say, "The best way to
sober up is put on your hat."

637
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,854
It reminded him of when
he used to be somebody.

638
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:49,416
I bought him this hat,
but he never wore it.

639
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,521
I love hats.

640
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:57,580
You thinking about your dad?

641
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:05,483
I was at a friend's house...

642
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:08,432
before I came home and found him.

643
00:32:10,052 --> 00:32:11,811
And I had had a cigarette.

644
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:15,152
My first and only one.

645
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:20,479
And I remember being so scared
that my dad was gonna smell it on me

646
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:25,258
that I walked home, and I was just
trying to get the smoke out of my hair.

647
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:31,158
And when I saw him...

648
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:37,780
hanging there, I actually
thought for one second

649
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:41,487
that God was punishing me
for smoking.

650
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,821
I think...

651
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,587
sometimes...

652
00:32:52,294 --> 00:32:54,587
life is too small for dads.

653
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,221
<i>...I'm Ray Herrera. Back to you.</i>

654
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:10,405
Pretty messed up, huh?

655
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:15,159
It really sucks.

656
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:18,193
They were gonna do a story
about my work rescuing dogs.

657
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:20,193
Do you think they'll still do it?

658
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:23,045
- What?
- My rescue work with dogs?

659
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:25,073
Do you still think
they'll do the story?

660
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,648
You know, provided they
don't all get shot.

661
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:31,890
It's just something that I'm really
passionate about, you know?

662
00:33:33,872 --> 00:33:35,147
No idea.

663
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:43,637
You know...

664
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,057
you got hard during
one of our loves scenes.

665
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:48,574
What are you talking about?
No, I didn't.

666
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,333
The one where I was riding you?

667
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:53,591
I could feel it.

668
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:57,024
Pushed a little harder so it felt
good for you. Well...

669
00:33:57,782 --> 00:33:58,817
and me.

670
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:08,308
Damn.

671
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,113
Dude.

672
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:11,579
Dude!

673
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,924
A cat?

674
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:16,165
You take pictures of a cat
and you got me right here?

675
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:19,161
I'm waiting for the right moment.

676
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:23,231
I got dogs, four of them.

677
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:25,961
I'm a dog man myself.

678
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,428
- What's its name?
- Tristan.

679
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:33,714
Dude, you gotta get a dog.

680
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:37,473
Cats are for, uh, you know,
those kind of guys.

681
00:34:37,931 --> 00:34:39,746
I like cats.

682
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:45,842
Cats are quiet and loving, and they
know when to give you your space.

683
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:47,956
I say it's dogs all the way.

684
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:50,546
That's 'cause you're a narcissist.

685
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:54,273
You can't live without excessive
admiration, adulation, attention,

686
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:56,105
and affirmation.
Dogs will give you that.

687
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:58,149
Their love is like a mirror

688
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:00,845
of how you'd like to perceive
yourself as seen by others.

689
00:35:01,004 --> 00:35:02,032
Oh, really?

690
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:05,027
Most likely a result of your bitter
disappointment and radical

691
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:07,600
disillusionment with significant
others during childhood.

692
00:35:09,503 --> 00:35:11,018
Anything else, Freud?

693
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:12,611
Four dogs is a lot.

694
00:35:15,873 --> 00:35:16,913
Bang.

695
00:35:20,629 --> 00:35:21,668
Thank you.

696
00:35:21,896 --> 00:35:25,561
So there's definite interest from
USA Network to do a pilot.

697
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:28,986
I mean, they're flattered that you would
even consider it, since you just worked

698
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:30,830
- with Johnny... shit-for-brains.
- Yeah.

699
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:33,251
- Do you love your husband?
- Pardon?

700
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,282
Your husband Ted, do you still love him?

701
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,220
Yeah. Of course.

702
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:40,103
Are you okay?

703
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,919
My father has diabetes.

704
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,654
Years ago he told my mother
he couldn't screw her anymore.

705
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:48,192
Some complications
with the disease.

706
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:51,586
And for years, she just took what she
could get from him in that department.

707
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,091
Last year,

708
00:35:54,884 --> 00:35:57,791
he dumped her for
his mistress of 15 years.

709
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:05,596
Julia, honey, is there
something I should know?

710
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:09,279
My mother said that it just
came out of left field

711
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:12,903
when he told her, but...I knew.

712
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:15,475
You know how?

713
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,097
No.

714
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,035
His cards.

715
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:21,877
They were always humorous.

716
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,700
His birthday,
anniversary, holiday...

717
00:36:27,903 --> 00:36:30,581
He could pull it off
in the moment, but...

718
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:33,921
something tangible,
something that my mother

719
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:35,947
could hold in her hands as proof.

720
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:43,329
- I'm gonna take a cab.
- Wait. Julia--

721
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:44,774
I'm fine, all right?

722
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,576
Just tell Holt I don't feel well.
I'll see him at home.

723
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,373
Okay.

724
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,195
Shit.

725
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:56,449
- Hey, Terry.
- Lucy needs me. I have to go.

726
00:37:00,404 --> 00:37:02,448
Hey, can I get something to drink?

727
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:05,655
<i>...hostage standoff with
very little news to report.</i>

728
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:08,915
<i>Television and radio
personality Sammy Winter...</i>

729
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,604
- Hey, Kenny.
- Yeah?

730
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:11,943
Can you go get me a drink?

731
00:37:11,944 --> 00:37:13,582
Can you just
give me one second?

732
00:37:14,016 --> 00:37:16,745
- What'd you say?
- We're just finishing up.

733
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:19,035
The drinks are in the fridge.
It's right over there.

734
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:23,054
Oh. Okay. No problem.
I'll go get the drink. Um...

735
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:26,719
That's a really good one.
Use that one.

736
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,616
Oh. Uh, Kenny?

737
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:43,757
Wake up, Kenny! Oh, my God!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

738
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,347
Oh, my God.
He killed Kenny.

739
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:54,593
Okay.

740
00:37:56,144 --> 00:37:57,536
You like that?

741
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,006
What happened?

742
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,297
What happened?"
You're the negotiator!

743
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,827
What do you think happened?

744
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,947
When a gun goes off in a hostage
situation, somebody dies!

745
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:22,767
Okay! We are losing the focus here!

746
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,040
The focus is me! Me!

747
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:28,756
Okay! I want respect!
And I want it now!

748
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:34,005
I got enough explosives strapped to my
waist to flatten the whole city block!

749
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:36,613
So back off! You back off!

750
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:39,677
Sammy.

751
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:42,056
What is it that you want?

752
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:45,157
What I want is for these
people to listen to me!

753
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:48,450
Don't act like I don't exist!
You go on with your lives!

754
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:50,900
I'm here!
God damn it!

755
00:38:51,393 --> 00:38:53,085
I'm still here!

756
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:01,656
What are you doing?

757
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,894
I'm mixing chemicals
to throw them in his face.

758
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:06,594
That is insane.

759
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,391
- Maybe she's right.
- No.

760
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:10,717
You're both hopped up
on Spic And Span.

761
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:13,272
Look, trust me on this one.
There's nothing we can do.

762
00:39:13,273 --> 00:39:15,070
You have been a coward too long.

763
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:17,729
You have outlived your relevance.

764
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:18,872
Look, sit!

765
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:21,813
You want to get your head blown off,
that's fine by me.

766
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,459
But some of us might like to live
to see their next birthday.

767
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,604
Why? What will happen then?

768
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,683
I said sit, old woman.

769
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:30,156
You're not the captain of this ship.
You've proved that.

770
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:46,335
Willa! Wait!

771
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,696
That's enough!

772
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:00,586
God damn it!

773
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:07,016
No one pistol whips
Johnny Gage.

774
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,500
Really, Johnny?
'Cause I just did, bitch.

775
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:11,180
Shoot him!

776
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:13,136
You better freeze, man.

777
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,475
Come on, shoot me.

778
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,449
Shoot him,
God damn it!

779
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:21,310
Shoot me. Come on. Come on. Shoot me.
Shoot me, pussy. You pussy!

780
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:22,456
I will, I swear.

781
00:40:22,457 --> 00:40:28,449
Shoot! I swear to Christ, I will!
Shoot. Do it. Do it, you pussy!

782
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:34,956
You screwed me, Lucy.

783
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:37,441
You screwed me. You were never
gonna run the story, were you?

784
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:39,819
Never! Never! Never!

785
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:42,151
- I don't know why I trusted you!
- Wait!

786
00:40:42,927 --> 00:40:45,164
You kill her,
and your story dies.

787
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:54,149
Trust me, I got no other motivation
to stop you from shooting

788
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,683
- her other than that.
- Yeah?

789
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:58,712
No one will give your story
justice like Lucy Spiller.

790
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:03,466
Come on.
You've come this far.

791
00:41:03,747 --> 00:41:05,351
Sammy? Hey.

792
00:41:05,668 --> 00:41:08,611
Come on, Sammy.
Let me do it.

793
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:10,849
Let me do it. Come on, Sammy.
Let me do it.

794
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:12,933
Let her put you on the cover.

795
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:14,889
You can trust me.

796
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:20,197
Come on, Sammy.
Let me take care of you.

797
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:25,442
Come on. Okay.
Okay. Come on.

798
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:28,278
You do it.Come on, come on.
Back to work!

799
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:31,450
Back to work! We're gonna do
the magazine! Come on!

800
00:41:32,084 --> 00:41:34,551
Let's do it.
Let's get back to work.

801
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:37,881
Back to work!

802
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:42,480
<i>We heard shots fired from inside
the building. Was anyone injured?</i>

803
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:45,370
<i>We have confirmedone causality, yes.
Do you know the identity?</i>

804
00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:48,893
<i>Yes, a male employee has been
fatally shot, and we're waiting</i>

805
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:52,012
<i>notification of his relatives
before we release his name.</i>

806
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,820
<i>Normally, in a situation like this,
we would advance on the building,</i>

807
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,706
<i>but because he has explosive--</i>

808
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,490
<i>It's moving into day
three of the standoff,</i>

809
00:42:00,491 --> 00:42:03,697
<i>and we're still waiting to see if
Sammy Winter will turn himself in--</i>

810
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:05,722
It's beautiful.

811
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:08,277
Beautiful.

812
00:42:09,722 --> 00:42:11,819
It's better than I dreamed.

813
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:16,986
We did it.

814
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,607
No.

815
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:20,880
You did it.

816
00:42:21,074 --> 00:42:22,149
No.

817
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,052
This is us.

818
00:42:24,598 --> 00:42:25,814
Us.

819
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,944
We shouldn't have
to work that hard for love.

820
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,180
Boom.

821
00:43:41,312 --> 00:43:42,810
Move back.

822
00:43:45,216 --> 00:43:46,397
We love you, Sammy!

823
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,124
I love you!

824
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:20,447
Could you please
leave us alone?

825
00:44:20,727 --> 00:44:22,225
This is not the time!

826
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,017
Holt, come to bed.

827
00:44:30,682 --> 00:44:32,213
Be right there.

828
