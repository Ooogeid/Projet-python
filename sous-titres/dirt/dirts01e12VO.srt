00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,405
<i>Hi, I'm Don Konkey. I'm a freelance
schizophrenic photographer.</i>

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,441
<i>Things were going
all right for me, but...</i>

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,809
<i>last week, I hit
a bit of a rough patch.</i>

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,047
Look what somebody threw away.
A perfectly good camera.

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,850
<i>A friend of mine was
practically beaten to death.</i>

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,820
<i>And he was just a friggin' kid.</i>

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:29,194
<i>Lucy finally showed Holt the stalker
photos of her and him having sex.</i>

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,697
Do you think Julia could have
paid someone to follow you?

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,596
You know what this shit
could do to me, right?

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,340
<i>They make such a nice couple,
don't they?</i>

11
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:36,736
And you don't know
who took this?

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,174
<i>Holt promised Julia he'd get back
the sex tape of her and Johnny Gage.</i>

13
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,175
<i>So Holt went and asked Lucy.</i>

14
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,810
I want the sex tape back.

15
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,813
<i>Lucy, of course, bent over
backward to help him.</i>

16
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,215
<i>And forward...and
backward...</i>

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,618
<i>and forwards.</i>

18
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,653
Paid in full.

19
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,656
<i>Yeah, he might've wanted
to keep that thought inside his head.</i>

20
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,892
<i>Poor Lucy.
First her brother left her,</i>

21
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,628
<i>and now her lover.</i>

22
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:06,432
<i>At least now the evidence is destroyed,
Holt and Julia are free.</i>

23
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,669
<i>Right? And she can get
her career back on track.</i>

24
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:16,142
<i>I've tried that, too, Holt.
It doesn't make the other you go away.</i>

25
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,746
Numbers don't lie.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,715
<i>DirtNow</i> had a huge launch,
but it's slipping.

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,349
The sex issue was a disaster.

28
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,785
Okay, well if you factor
out the Wal-Mart boycott,

29
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,221
the sex issue pumped
our newsstand by 20 percent.

30
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,424
Yes, factor it in and our net
took a 10 percent hit.

31
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,793
We launched a new book
and became one of the top celebrity

32
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,395
weeklies in the nation.

33
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,263
Gibson Horne is not
interested in last month.

34
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,366
He expects to be top dog.

35
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,435
The hostage memorial issue
didn't move, sex, TuLu...

36
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,904
Hard to justify that beefed up
personal security budget

37
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,008
for an editor whose circulation
numbers are trending down.

38
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,343
Okay, so we need a big cover.

39
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,847
Hmm, what a great idea, Brent.

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,049
Thank God you're here.

41
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,419
Tell Gibson to relax.
I'll deliver a monster cover.

42
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,820
I always do.

43
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,968
Julia!

44
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,238
- You said you got it.
- Got what?

45
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,641
- It's all over the internet.
- Juli--

46
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,711
You said you got it back!

47
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,546
It's everywhere.

48
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,948
It's on the internet!

49
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,721
How'd this happen?

<i>"Caught On Tape"</i>

55
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,843
Micro-cams transmit
to us in real time.

56
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,001
Panic buttons in every room,
which you won't need

57
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:01,480
because I'm going to keep a guy
inside whenever you're home.

58
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,416
Oh, God. For how long?

59
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,118
Until we catch him.

60
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:07,133
Why don't I just stay
at the Hotel Bel Air,

61
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:08,898
and you can put
a man outside of my suite?

62
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:11,757
We don't want the stalker to feel
like you're reacting to him, like

63
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,498
he's having
an impact on your life.

64
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,527
Right, like he hasn't
had an impact on my life.

65
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,631
I always hang out with
former Israeli commandos.

66
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,968
Don't worry. We play
it right, hang back,

67
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,903
the guy will expose himself.

68
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,073
You gotta tell me
where you got it.

69
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,841
Who else had it?

70
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,313
All I can say is...

71
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,814
is since there started
to be real heat around me,

72
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,184
people in the press
want to be my friend.

73
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,219
And I'm not gonna say
who, all right?

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,087
- Jesus, Holt.
- Babe, look. It--

75
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,622
It doesn't matter.

76
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,858
Listen. They had it locked
up and hidden in a vault.

77
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,727
I demanded it back,
and I got it.

78
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,495
They gave me their only copy.

79
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,098
You sure about that?

80
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,066
Johnny Gage, man.

81
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,135
Johnny Gage is scum.

82
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,370
I mean, he made it.

83
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,440
He's been gunning for me ever since
I got Hard Chargerover him.

84
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,843
If anyone leaked it, it's him.

85
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,578
Everybody's gonna see this.

86
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,214
I mean, my parents
are gonna see this.

87
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,384
Your parents
aren't gonna see it.

88
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,754
Like, seriously, they don't even
know how to use the internet.

89
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,093
And this is worse
than everything.

90
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,863
The drugs, losing the show.

91
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,634
What am I gonna do?

92
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,370
We'll just go on.

93
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,240
People want to talk, screw 'em.

94
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,010
- Really?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,979
You're all I
care about, you know?

96
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,416
<i>Hey, Nancy, check this out. The movie
may have been a flop at the box office,</i>

97
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,953
<i>but a sex tape made during
the film's production</i>

98
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,921
<i>is now the hottest download
on the internet.</i>

99
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,924
<i>Now, the video was allegedly
made when Gage and Mallory</i>

100
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,726
<i>were starring together
in Terminal Velocity.</i>

101
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,296
<i>Now, wasn't she supposed to be
with Holt McLaren at the time?</i>

102
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,977
Okay, I want to see every picture of
Gage and Mallory together.

103
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,337
And we have to find out who
else could have had that tape.

104
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,306
Yeah, where did Gage keep it?

105
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,810
Who has access to his house,
to his trailer, whatever.

106
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,144
Okay.

107
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,114
Yeah, and I want to move
the meeting up to 7:45.

108
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,150
Hold on one second.

109
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,986
Okay, I have to take this. Bye.

110
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,623
If I find out

111
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,591
that you had
anything to do with this...

112
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,327
Well, good morning
to you too, Holt.

113
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,496
No, I'm serious. You told me
you gave me your only copies.

114
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,131
I did give you my only copies.

115
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,400
Well, listen, if I
find out they weren't,

116
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,536
then I'm gonna find
a way to take you down.

117
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,272
You understand?

118
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,473
Why would I have
released the tape?

119
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,842
Well why do you do
any of the shit you do?

120
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,544
It's to get a story.

121
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,446
It's all over the web,
it's everywhere.

122
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,216
It's not exactly like
I'm scooping anyone here.

123
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,952
As far as I know, you're
the last one who had the tape.

124
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,288
- Maybe you released it.
- Yeah, you're funny.

125
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,624
You don't have the guts
to break up with Julia.

126
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,827
- This makes it easy.
- Yeah, you're sick. You know that?

127
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,663
Maybe. But I'm rarely wrong.

128
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,198
What did you do with the tape?

129
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,699
We destroyed it.

130
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,370
Look, are you absolutely sure
no one got into your vault?

131
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,672
Hold on. Someone's approaching
the property.

132
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,873
I gotta go.

133
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,345
Two people with duffel bags.

134
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,510
Get to the back bedroom.
Let us clear them first.

135
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,511
Okay, this is silly.

136
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,115
Are you expecting
two people with duffel bags?

137
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,251
Back bedroom's secure.

138
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,094
Whoa! Wow! Holy shit!

139
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,064
Hey, sis.
You changed your locks.

140
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,637
What's with the secret
service detail?

141
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,639
Did you piss off a mobster
with some expose'?

142
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,041
I wish I knew.

143
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,676
So you're here.

144
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,944
Just walking back in.

145
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,582
I'm sorry I couldn't talk to you.
I need to cool down.

146
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,520
- You think I'm still the devil?
- I know you're not the devil.

147
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,023
I missed you.

148
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,058
I really missed you.

149
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,399
- Where the hell were you?
- A commune in Bolinas.

150
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,804
Hey, sweets.

151
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,206
This is my girlfriend,

152
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,176
-  Lumina.
- Your girlfriend.

153
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,277
It's nice to meet you.

154
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,512
Hi.

155
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,449
She's living in silence
right now.

156
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,917
Don't judge.

157
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,488
So can we crash in your
guest room for a while?

158
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,357
Sure. Join the party.

159
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,231
Thanks.

160
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,701
I like your work.

161
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,276
There she is!
Julia! Julia!

162
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,445
Julia! How long were
you cheating on Holt?

163
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,680
Do you know about the tape?

164
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,151
Julia, did you like it as much
as you said on the video?

165
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,420
Did I like it?

166
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,855
I was drugged that night.

167
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,256
He drugged me.

168
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,757
And when a woman is drugged,

169
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,428
too drugged to say yes,
isn't that a "no?"

170
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,297
This video you're all
watching online is not a sex tape,

171
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,767
it's a rape tape.

172
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,168
Are you gonna bring criminal
charges against Johnny Gage?

173
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,036
- Will there be a lawsuit?
- Julia!

174
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,606
Do you have a message
for other rape victims?

175
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,942
McPherson, my office.

176
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,713
I need to know who the hell
leaked that videotape.

177
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,449
Um, well, as far as
I can tell,

178
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,751
it hit on a bunch
of internet sites at once.

179
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,087
They all claim that it was
delivered anonymously.

180
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,256
- No other details?
- No, not yet.

181
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,790
Okay. Get them, quietly.

182
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,093
I don't want anyone to think
that we're digging there.

183
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,830
Let everyone else think the story
is just the videotape and the aftermath.

184
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,533
I'm on it.

185
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,867
What?

186
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,336
Um...

187
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,972
is this an actual assignment
or am I still in the doghouse?

188
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,508
Get the story, and it's
an actual assignment.

189
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,244
Screw it up, and it doesn't really
matter where you are, does it?

190
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,613
Yeah.

191
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,156
- Oh, hey, Lucy.
- Hey.

192
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,525
Okay, everyone's gonna
be going after Johnny Gage

193
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,793
and Holt and Julia.

194
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,229
I want you to get a shot
that no one else has.

195
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,700
- 'Kay.
- <i>Consoling, fighting...</i>

196
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,569
arguments, it doesn't matter.
Just get their private life.

197
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,604
Who's the more important
of the three?

198
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,139
Today it's the girl.

199
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,575
I figured.

200
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,109
I-I'll call you
when I have something.

201
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,378
Thanks, Don.

202
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,251
Don?

203
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,653
Coming.

204
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,722
Don?

205
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,427
Hey, Don.

206
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,965
Marqui.

207
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,234
Are you out of your coma?

208
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,002
Did you just leave the hospital?

209
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,338
No,

210
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,806
I'm still in the hospital.

211
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,574
I'm still in my coma.

212
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,676
I had to come see you.

213
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,478
I have an assignment for you.

214
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,647
I'm-- I'm already on a job.

215
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,517
I know, this is more
important than Lucy's.

216
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,354
- It's much more important.
- What is it?

217
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,823
You'll find out.

218
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,828
I need to know if someone
could've gotten in here.

219
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,236
It's unlikely.

220
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,731
We've been watching the place
pretty closely since the siege.

221
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,934
And what about
before the siege?

222
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,037
I keep some very sensitive
things in there.

223
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,072
The room used to be
a bank vault.

224
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,706
Unless you left it unlocked,

225
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,376
only the most skilled criminal
would be able to get in.

226
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,944
And you would know if he did.

227
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,381
What about an employee?

228
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:49,648
You think there's someone
who wants to hurt you here?

229
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,783
I'm the boss. Everyone
wants to hurt me here.

230
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,251
- Hey, Lucy.
- Yeah?

231
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:57,155
Sorry, but Johnny Gage just got accosted
by a bunch of news crews.

232
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,458
- It's feeding live.
- I'll talk to you later.

233
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:06,765
Were you high?

234
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:09,223
Hey. Yeah, were a little high.

235
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:10,998
But she totally wanted it,
believe me.

236
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:13,076
- How did you know?
- I would know. I was there.

237
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:16,088
<i>On the video, doesn't she say,
"We shouldn't be doing this?"</i>

238
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,031
<i>Yeah, and then she says
she likes it and asks for more.</i>

239
00:11:19,248 --> 00:11:21,672
<i>Watch the whole tape, dude.
Everyone else is.</i>

240
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,621
<i>Why did you leak it?
Did you want some press?</i>

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,234
I didn't leak it.

242
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:26,567
Are you make money on this?

243
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,351
Look, the only reason
I made it for is

244
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,710
you know, when you're
with a really cool girl, you just

245
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:31,971
want to be able to relive it.

246
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:34,294
Yeah, but if it wasn't you, who?
Who else had the tape?

247
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:37,368
<i>The only other person who has
ever even seen this tape</i>

248
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:39,771
<i>is Lucy Spiller at DirtNow.</i>

249
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,536
<i>She's the only one
who knew about it.</i>

250
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:43,939
<i>So maybe you should be
asking her who leaked it.</i>

251
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,381
<i>You showed your sex tape
to Lucy Spiller of DirtNow Magazine?</i>

252
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,683
<i>Yeah, I gave her a copy.</i>

253
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:50,077
<i>Does she have something on you?</i>

254
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:51,896
<i>Why would you give a
copy to Lucy Spiller?</i>

255
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,866
<i>Come on, you guys
know how this works.</i>

256
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,026
You get good press.
You wash Lucy Spiller's hands,

257
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:59,895
<i>she gives you good coverage
in her magazines.</i>

258
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:17,862
- Hello?
- Hi.

259
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,027
My name is Natalie Benson.

260
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm a volunteer at the Rape
Cris Center in Hollywood.

261
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:24,541
I'm trying to reach Julia Mallory.

262
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,966
Um...can I tell her
what it's regarding?

263
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:28,774
<i>We're starting a new campaign</i>

264
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,003
to educate high school
students about drug rape,

265
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,887
and we'd like her
to be our spokesperson.

266
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:34,445
I'd love to talk to her about this.

267
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,607
She's not in right now,
but I'll give her the message.

268
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,263
<i>It wouldn't take
a lot of her time.</i>

269
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:42,659
Anything, anything she could do for
these kids would make a huge difference.

270
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:44,751
<i>She's setting
a courageous example</i>

271
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,847
<i>and has a huge fan base,
both male and female.</i>

272
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:51,722
Well, I have your number
on caller ID. And,

273
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,151
I'll talk to her about it.

274
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:54,449
<i>I promise.</i>

275
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:56,333
Thanks. It means a lot.

276
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:08,313
My bread and butter
is anonymous tips.

277
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:11,149
Why would I tell you anything
about how I got the video?

278
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:13,776
* compare
like <i>DirtNow</i>, Perez.

279
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:16,396
And, you know, I could slip you stories

280
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,356
that were about to hit
the magazine early.

281
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:20,098
Things to make your site hotter.

282
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,122
All I need are details on
how the tape was uploaded.

283
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:24,810
It wasn't uploaded.

284
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,664
I got a call on my cell phone telling me
to look in a dumpster around the corner.

285
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:30,883
DVD was there waiting.

286
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,416
I checked with the other web
sites who got it. Same thing.

287
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:34,823
Your cell phone?

288
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:37,659
Yes, don't get excited.
I checked.

289
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,219
Call came from a pay phone.
Dead end.

290
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:47,007
Lucy! Lucy!

291
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,258
One picture!
One picture, please!

292
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:52,592
Over here!

293
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:55,396
Did you trade feature
stories on Johnny Gage

294
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,236
for the Julia Mallory sex tape?

295
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,250
- Is that how <i>DirtNow</i> works?
- Okay, guys.

296
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:02,183
I will answer
every question and more

297
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,413
in the pages
of <i>DirtNow</i> Magazine.

298
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,050
I promise everything there is to
know will be in the next issue.

299
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,179
And if I get more information,
it will be in the issue after that.

300
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,340
I will give you the unvarnished
and uncompromising truth,

301
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:17,479
because that is what <i>DirtNow</i>
is and always will be.

302
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:20,824
Anything else that you read
or hear is gossip and innuendo.

303
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:22,901
So you're saying
you won't answer our question.

304
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,762
Did you or did you not
release the tape?

305
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,985
Oh, come on. Is good press
for sale in <i>DirtNow</i>?

306
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:29,164
Okay, listen to me.

307
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:31,557
We don't know
everything right now.

308
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:34,443
But I promise you,
the truth will come out,

309
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:35,833
because it always does.

310
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:37,417
Now, that's all. Thank you.

311
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,605
Julia, you told me
before the show

312
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,946
that until you saw the tape, you weren't
sure what happened that night.

313
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:19,185
No. I knew I'd had

314
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:20,751
one or two drinks,

315
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:22,749
but I was bruised.

316
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,475
I asked somebody
if maybe I fell.

317
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,141
But there was a little
voice inside my head that

318
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,314
I didn't want to listen to.

319
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:33,503
They say that rohypnol

320
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:35,527
is the mind eraser.

321
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,924
I just told myself that
I'd had too much to drink.

322
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,812
But all I remember is
one glass of champagne.

323
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:44,818
What was your first reaction
when you saw the tape?

324
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,299
Ca-Can you talk about that?

325
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,254
You can do this.

326
00:15:53,922 --> 00:15:54,925
I couldn't breathe.

327
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:56,818
I...

328
00:15:58,136 --> 00:16:00,392
I remember telling
myself to breathe.

329
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:03,707
It was real, and it
was happening, and...

330
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,153
I was terrified.

331
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:10,230
People think that if you're
raped by somebody you know,

332
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:12,359
that it-- it's
not really a crime.

333
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:14,770
But... I was drugged

334
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:16,790
and I was assaulted.

335
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,394
It's like your mind can forget,

336
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,576
but your body remembers.

337
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:24,462
I really applaud you
for speaking out.

338
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:34,458
Now, Johnny Gage is claiming
the sex was consensual.

339
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,839
To tell the truth would put
him in jail for 20 years.

340
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:38,181
You're not pressing charges?

341
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:40,476
Holt and I, we spoke
with a lawyer,

342
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:45,012
and it's a little late to be gathering
hard evidence for a conviction.

343
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:46,635
Holt...

344
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:49,743
This can't be easy
on either of you.

345
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,194
No.

346
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,575
You said in an interview once
that he was your rock.

347
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,480
Yeah. I mean,

348
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,277
he's an amazing guy.

349
00:16:57,865 --> 00:16:59,228
I feel so grateful.

350
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,367
He hasn't left my side,
not once.

351
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:16,186
Now, you are <i>filing a lawsuit
against the major tabloids.</i>

352
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:18,016
<i>Tabloids, the distributors,</i>

353
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,437
<i>anyone who's looking
to profit from the video.</i>

354
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,133
Lucy Spiller bartered
with a rapist

355
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,276
<i>and she's profiting
from his crime.</i>

356
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,268
<i>You're referring to Lucy Spiller,</i>

357
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,930
<i>editor of DirtNow Magazine.</i>

358
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:35,337
<i>That a woman would do this
makes me sick.</i>

359
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,876
<i>It's an insult,
not just to rape survivors,</i>

360
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:40,868
<i>but to all of us.</i>

361
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,289
<i>I want you all to know that
the money from the lawsuit</i>

362
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,645
<i>is going to the Hollywood
Rape Crisis Center.</i>

363
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:59,272
That's really great.

364
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:03,137
This is bullshit.

365
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:05,930
He's going to fire me
over an allegation?

366
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:09,517
Or, you know, merely suspend.
I mean, nothing's definitive.

367
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:12,656
There is nothing that
ties me to the story. Nothing.

368
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,701
- Tell her to take me to court.
- You've already been tried, sweetie.

369
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:18,267
By the highest court in the land.
The court of public opinion.

370
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:19,533
I'll countersue.

371
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,481
Defamation of character
and slander.

372
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,901
It's not about
the goddamned lawsuit, Spiller.

373
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:27,423
It's about the perception that
<i>DirtNow</i> Magazine

374
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,053
trades stories with celebrities.

375
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,982
Now, I'm not asking if it's true or
false. I don't want to know. But

376
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,540
blackmail?

377
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:36,755
That is a serious allegation.

378
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:38,574
My sin isn't blackmail.

379
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,089
It's omission.

380
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,478
Sometimes it's what I don't write that
gets people to tell me their secrets.

381
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:45,080
What about the truth?

382
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,466
Isn't that your mantra?

383
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,306
Aren't you willed by the, uh,

384
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,525
journalism gods to tell all?

385
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:54,768
Truth has no expiration date, Brent.
It's always there.

386
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,800
When I choose to disclose
something, that's my business.

387
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,220
If I decide to hold it back in
order to reveal a greater truth,

388
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,931
then so be it.

389
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:06,467
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:08,437
That line has a lot
of wiggle room in it.

391
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:11,490
Really? This coming from
a publisher who two weeks ago

392
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:14,391
wanted me to put his teenage
dalliance on the cover

393
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,719
so his ass wouldn't get
burned at the stake.

394
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,442
Tell me what you want me to do.

395
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:22,434
Okay.

396
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,628
I want you to keep me alive
until this issue comes out.

397
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:27,765
It will answer everything.

398
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:28,949
I promise.

399
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:32,462
They're good.

400
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,069
Think she'll like them?

401
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,721
I don't like
this assignment.

402
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,514
You don't like a lot of
your assignments, Don.

403
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:41,744
Yeah, but I don't-- I mean,

404
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,543
I really don't know

405
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:45,577
what this is about.
What's the story?

406
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:47,564
What is it you want me to do?

407
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,817
You know what the assignment is.

408
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:52,609
I think I should go
back on my meds.

409
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:54,909
I thought you don't
like your meds, Don.

410
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:57,029
I don't, but I don't like this either,

411
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,539
you know.
I mean, Lucy's my friend.

412
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,971
She's calling for me.
She needs me for a story.

413
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,522
Lucy's part of a story now.
A big story.

414
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:05,882
You're part of it, too.

415
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:08,683
The meds make you dull.
You have to be sharp for the story.

416
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:09,887
What is it?

417
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:14,033
You have things to do, Don.

418
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,619
Important things to do.

419
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:23,402
Shut the door.

420
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,128
How's the temperature out there?

421
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,443
It's pretty good.

422
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:34,635
Okay, if you're gonna act like
this is your first day on the planet,

423
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,107
you're about as useful
to me as a third tit.

424
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,570
Want to try again?

425
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:40,357
People are nervous.

426
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,751
They're loyal to you,
but to a point.

427
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:45,247
Their major concern
right now is, if you get fired,

428
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:47,375
- how it's gonna impact them?
- What about you?

429
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:49,251
I'm not worried. I'll work.

430
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:53,240
Anything on who
leaked the tape?

431
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:55,258
Not yet. I've got
some good leads, though.

432
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:56,494
Okay, good.

433
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,046
Are you sure you want
me to find out?

434
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,025
What's that supposed to mean?

435
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,481
I'm not sure that you're done
punishing me yet.

436
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:08,177
And it crossed my mind that
you put me on this because

437
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:10,555
you know very well
that it's a wild goose chase,

438
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:13,269
because you're the one
who leaked the tape yourself.

439
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,273
If I had leaked
the goddamn tape,

440
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:20,497
I would have done it on a Tuesday
to make sure we had the first cover.

441
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:22,875
Well, I hope so.

442
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:25,041
Because, no matter
what the truth is,

443
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,620
I promise
I'm gonna find it.

444
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:29,030
Great.
The sooner the better!

445
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:31,785
Have we heard from Don yet?

446
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,335
- Should I leave another message?
- Jesus, Don.

447
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:48,733
Please, could you tell
me why we're here?

448
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:52,420
Look. Look through
the lens. You'll see.

449
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:48,401
Julia! Julia! Julia!

450
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:50,801
Serendipity. I was just gonna call you.

451
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:53,053
- Me?
- Did you see the Calendar this morning?

452
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:54,601
About the rape cris center?

453
00:22:54,693 --> 00:22:57,084
Your appearance on daytime
generated more donations

454
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,390
than they've gotten
since they opened in '74.

455
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:00,476
You're kidding.

456
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,754
Yeah, exaggerating,
but not by much.

457
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:06,573
They want you to be their woman
of the year. When they call, say yes.

458
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:09,104
Hey, uh, what are
you doing right now?

459
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:12,583
- Uh, I'm meeting on a pilot.
- Oh, no, no. No TV. Trust me.

460
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:14,401
- Really?
- Yeah, look, I know

461
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:18,266
I'm Holt's manager, not yours.
But I love him. I love you.

462
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:21,339
And I heard you fired your agent.
What the hell took you so long?

463
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:22,554
Quinn's a nose picker.

464
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,564
I wanna put you
with Sylvia Ellis.

465
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,018
She'd rep me?

466
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:28,632
If I ask her.
She's a friend.

467
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:30,969
Julia, listen.

468
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:32,938
People are talking
about you.

469
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,076
They are.

470
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:36,754
I'm like one of those Indian scouts.
I put my ear to the ground,

471
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:38,374
I know how many horses are coming.

472
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,837
Sydney Pollack called.

473
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:43,076
He thought I represented you and Holt.
I didn't correct him.

474
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,298
He, uh, wants to meet you.

475
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:48,298
And, Jule, he's just the first horse.

476
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,470
What do you say?
You and me?

477
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,029
Sylvia Ellis?
Heavy hitters.

478
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,600
I'd say you're on.

479
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:57,275
Smart girl.

480
00:23:57,662 --> 00:23:59,410
And you know,
I gotta tell you,

481
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:01,784
I think you've got balls.

482
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:04,189
The way you're dealing
with all of this bullshit?

483
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:06,692
Respect. You have got mine.

484
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:09,392
I, uh--
I was actually date raped.

485
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,791
Sophomore year.

486
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,987
When I was a senior,
I finally told a counselor,

487
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,545
and I couldn't even use
the word rape.

488
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:18,039
Cheryl, I am--
I am so sorry.

489
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:21,864
Yeah, I'll still take 15 percent,
but five of it will go to the center.

490
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:24,330
See? Something good
comes from something bad.

491
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,327
It's a decent job, but they
don't pay us shit, you know?

492
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:31,909
I hear you.

493
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,191
So, what was the location
of the pay phone?

494
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:35,415
Torrance.

495
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,862
My wife says our kid has
to have a private education.

496
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:41,175
Get the best opportunity in life.
Whatever, fine. But preschool?

497
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:44,617
You know they charge over $700
a month for friggin' preschool?

498
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:45,857
Listen,

499
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:48,747
you don't normally do this sort of
thing, but these are hard times.

500
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:51,524
I get it.
Now...

501
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:55,003
the calls to the web sites,
coins or credit card?

502
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:57,948
I'm sorry. Prepaid calling card.
Untraceable.

503
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:01,110
Can you track down where
the card was purchased?

504
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,852
$700 a month.

505
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:07,036
That's more than my parents paid
for my freshman year at Pepperdine.

506
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:12,230
Yep. Tough times.

507
00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:24,734
What's the matter?

508
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:27,273
Place kinda gives me the creeps.

509
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:28,801
Bad memories, you know?

510
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:31,432
Yeah, it was a pretty rough
two and a half days.

511
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:33,604
Yeah. I don't remember a lot of it.

512
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:35,168
Really?

513
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:37,690
Wow, I rember everything.

514
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,782
I remember you
getting bitch-slapped.

515
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,389
I remember you
cowering in the corner.

516
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:47,782
I remember you
pissing your pants.

517
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,953
Not your finest hour.

518
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:53,861
And yet, not one word of it
made it in the pages of my magazine.

519
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:56,180
I know.
Thank you, Lucy.

520
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,615
while you're thanking me,
here in private--

521
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:04,061
Well, I'm not a very private
person these days, Johnny.

522
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,675
- Thanks to you.
- Lucy...

523
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:12,160
But let's forget about the embarrassing
performance during the hostage siege.

524
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,787
I could have always gone
with the big story:

525
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:18,155
"Johnny Gage was a male hustler
before he became a star."

526
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,809
Jesus Christ, Lucy.
You can't--

527
00:26:19,901 --> 00:26:22,183
I have done nothing
but protect you.

528
00:26:23,251 --> 00:26:25,653
"Cheap call boy gets
his first movie role

529
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:28,598
by blowing a director
named Harvey Ross."

530
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:32,324
I could destroy you
with one issue.

531
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:35,103
But I keep your
secret safe in my vault.

532
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,017
I panicked, okay?

533
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,474
The cameras were in my face, and I--

534
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:42,553
I didn't know what to say.

535
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,467
So I told the truth.

536
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:47,909
You told a version of the truth.

537
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,324
You never told me
you drugged her.

538
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:53,084
Had I known that, I would have
thrown the tape back in your face.

539
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:56,360
- I didn't drug her.
- I don't care.

540
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,829
Just tell me how to make this right.
Please, Lucy.

541
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,890
Just--
Please tell me what to do.

542
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:09,862
Well, you have to start
by trusting me, as always.

543
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:16,598
Stick to my script.
I'll get your life back on track.

544
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:26,534
60 acres.

545
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,816
Yeah, but Texas is a red state.

546
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,128
Yeah, but it's just outside of Austin.
Austin is a blue city.

547
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,638
In a red state.

548
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:40,906
The house is brand new.
We wouldn't have to do anything.

549
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,679
Cut and run, though. I don't--
I don't know if I like how that feels.

550
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:46,225
What are you talking about?

551
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:48,931
I mean, everything that's going
on right now. The lawsuits?

552
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:52,263
We're taking a stand. I feel like
we should be here to back it up.

553
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:53,846
The lawsuits?

554
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:57,049
It'll take years.
Are you kidding?

555
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,865
And the cris center?
I-- I made a commitment.

556
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:03,172
I thought we weren't
gonna get sucked in here.

557
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:06,752
I mean, come on, you want our kids
growing up with kids named

558
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,445
Sushi and Apple?

559
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:11,090
Areyoupregnant?
'Cause I'm not.

560
00:28:11,914 --> 00:28:14,454
It doesn't have to be Austin.

561
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:17,251
I mean, we could look at Montana.

562
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:19,386
I don't know.

563
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:22,193
Buy whatever you want, though.
You don't need my permission.

564
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,242
It's your money.

565
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:24,963
All right?

566
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:27,365
Don't look at me like
I grew two heads, all right?

567
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,131
I haven't changed my
mind about anything.

568
00:28:29,132 --> 00:28:30,567
It's just not the right time.

569
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:37,629
That's right.

570
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,163
Too bad she can't hold her liquor
like she can her tongue.

571
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,105
Lumina's a kindred spirit.

572
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,222
You know, she's an amazing poet.

573
00:28:46,774 --> 00:28:49,792
We've been together six weeks,
and she hasn't said a word.

574
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,148
Seriously?

575
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,586
Nothing.

576
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:58,150
Not even, "Oh, God,"
when you're having sex?

577
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:01,629
Our relationship
isn't really about sex.

578
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,741
I don't think there's
a name for what we have.

579
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:05,785
No, I think the term is fag hag.

580
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,147
- No--
- Wow.

581
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:09,042
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just jealous.

582
00:29:09,502 --> 00:29:14,247
Because the only person who is
interested in me seems to wants me dead.

583
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:16,142
Why do you say that?

584
00:29:16,474 --> 00:29:19,805
I don't know.
Ask my $2,000-a-day security team.

585
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,858
It's weird, though.
It's-- It's-- It's surreal.

586
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:26,520
It's almost like I'm being
stalked by a ghost.

587
00:29:28,526 --> 00:29:30,036
Maybe you are.

588
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:32,740
I can't wait to hear this one.

589
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,690
No, I--

590
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,506
Seriously, it's part of what
we worked on at the commune.

591
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:41,445
You know, I mean, we manifest
the world we live in.

592
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:43,447
This isn't just happening to you.

593
00:29:43,521 --> 00:29:45,049
It's coming from you.

594
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,515
From this tabloid
that swallowed you whole.

595
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:50,165
So you think I brought
this on myself?

596
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:54,266
I brought on someone
taking pictures of me...

597
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:57,229
while I'm on the toilet and

598
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:01,403
broadcasting them all over my
place of work? I don't understand.

599
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:02,460
No.

600
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:07,035
What I'm saying is that, maybe instead
of looking at this as a personal attack,

601
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,765
you could look at it as a...
a wake-up call.

602
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,268
That's one hell of a commune.

603
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,790
I love you, Lucy.

604
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:18,919
I love you more
than anybody in the world.

605
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:24,365
And I don't like that some guy is
doing this to you. It upsets me a lot.

606
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:26,887
And it's hard to see this happening

607
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,316
to my big sister, but maybe--

608
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:32,003
I know it sounds crazy.

609
00:30:32,794 --> 00:30:34,911
Maybe it can be a blessing.

610
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:21,334
"I'm here to apologize...

611
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:24,025
"to Julia Mallory,
to Lucy Spiller,

612
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:25,364
to my fans.

613
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,328
"I lied about Lucy Spiller.

614
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,223
"I never gave her the sex tape.

615
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:32,874
"I gave it to one of my drug dealers.

616
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:35,631
"He was threatening me,

629
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:18,131
Thank you.

630
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:25,585
Hey, Luce.

631
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,864
<i>Was it coke or meth?
Was it coke?</i>

632
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:32,391
I have something else to say.

633
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:37,364
Before I was an actor,

634
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:39,922
when I first came
to Hollywood, um...

635
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:43,032
I was a private stripper...

636
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:44,799
for men.

637
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:47,883
I had no money.

638
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:49,760
I was alone.

639
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:53,662
<i>And it was the only way
I could, uh, survive.</i>

640
00:32:56,333 --> 00:33:01,671
I know what it feels like to be...
trapped and abused.

641
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,057
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- Yeah.

642
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:18,512
<i>The ever articulate Johnny Gage,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

643
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:21,913
Johnny Gage.
Oh, my God.

644
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:27,642
I have the date the card
was shipped to the store,

645
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,200
if you could just check your records
and see when it was sold.

646
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:32,971
- If it was sold here, I can find it.
- Great...

647
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:35,131
Um, maybe I could
talk to some of the cashiers

648
00:33:35,186 --> 00:33:37,929
who were on duty at the time and
see if they remember anything.

649
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,121
These morons?
Good luck.

650
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:45,589
Everything in the store has a
scanner code, including phone cards.

651
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:47,632
If I run the code,
I can find the exact time,

652
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:50,264
date, and register for the transaction.

653
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:52,322
Well, that's a start.

654
00:33:52,524 --> 00:33:57,709
Um, there's actually
one more thing I...want.

655
00:33:58,022 --> 00:33:59,531
Don't worry about it.

656
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,280
Just do me a favor.

657
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:05,126
Come see my play.

658
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:07,763
I'm doingFiddler.
Not the lead or anything.

659
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:09,916
Just the fourth daughter, Shprintze.

660
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:12,999
But I have a big solo
in "Sunrise Sunset."

661
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:20,967
Babe, you don't know
what you're doing.

662
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:22,660
She wants to mend fences.

663
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:24,611
Yeah, bullshit.

664
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:28,609
I didn't call her.
She called me.

665
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:31,168
I'm dropping the lawsuit.

666
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:33,818
Her magazine wants to make nice.
I figured,

667
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,806
why have an enemy
when you can have a friend?

668
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:38,103
Lucy Spiller's nobody's friend.

669
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:41,912
Does it look like I
just got off the boat?

670
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,737
Okay, but you
believe Johnny Gage?

671
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:49,491
Babe, come on. First he says he gave
her the tape, then he said he didn't.

672
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:52,344
I mean, he told the truth
and she got to him.

673
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,678
Stay away from her.

674
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,280
Lucy's the one.

675
00:35:03,624 --> 00:35:05,703
She gave you the tape.

676
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:08,574
Yeah.

677
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:14,600
She's your contact with
the vault full of secret shit?

678
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:15,823
Yeah.

679
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,342
Why didn't you
tell me it was her?

680
00:35:20,614 --> 00:35:23,448
- Why all this mystery?
- I don't know.

681
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:25,878
Did she get to you
like she got to Johnny?

682
00:35:27,663 --> 00:35:28,841
What do you mean?

683
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,629
Are you lying to me now?

684
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:33,500
Babe, she's the liar.

685
00:35:33,905 --> 00:35:36,629
She swore to me
there were no copies.

686
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,410
Stay away from her.

687
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:42,987
What's she gonna do?
Suck my blood?

688
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:44,128
Maybe.

689
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,173
Lucy Spiller is a wannabe.

690
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:49,835
She peddles gossip so she can
get close to real talent.

691
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:52,559
She has no power,
unless we give it to her.

692
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:55,007
Babe, you don't understand.

693
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,397
Well then, tell me. Explain it to me.
What don't I understand?

694
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:02,526
She wants something from you.

695
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:06,165
Don't give it to her, no matter what.

696
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:11,134
Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

697
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:15,510
Who's afraid of Lucy Spiller?

698
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:23,264
- I'm really glad you're here.
- Thank you.

699
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:26,853
So, how are you holding up?

700
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:29,117
I'm hanging in there.
Thanks.

701
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:30,406
Good.

702
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:33,604
Publicity, that's-- it's tough.

703
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:35,205
I know firsthand now.

704
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:37,791
You never thought you'd have to
see it on the other side, huh?

705
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,530
Not really. No.

706
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,750
Now, listen. I'm sorry that--
that things got so ugly.

707
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:45,941
Thank you.

708
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:49,953
I guess in the end it--
it's just part of being a celebrity.

709
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:55,908
Being in the public eye is sort of
the definition of celebrity, isn't it?

710
00:36:56,846 --> 00:36:58,687
Is that a violation to you?

711
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:01,153
Is this an interview?

712
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,255
Isn't that the point?

713
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,464
I mean, isn't it always?

714
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,470
Yeah, I guess.

715
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,912
No, um, yeah, it's--
it's been really hard.

716
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:14,210
People think that they know you, but...

717
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,284
At least I've gotten
a chance to speak out

718
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,731
for women who might not
otherwise have a voice.

719
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:21,609
And what does that mean to you?

720
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,798
Uh, it means, I guess,

721
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:29,124
I can make a difference.
In a small way.

722
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:32,805
That you're still relevant.

723
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,985
I don't--
I don't understand.

724
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,077
Really?
Come with me.

725
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:53,951
This isn't Edgar Allan Poe.
I won't lock you in.

726
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:57,081
I have a tape
I want to show you.

727
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,713
The infamous vault.

728
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:02,087
I've heard rumors.

729
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,338
It's--
It's not another sex tape, is it?

730
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:07,778
Not exactly.

731
00:38:08,275 --> 00:38:12,379
No, this is a store surveillance tape
of someone buying a phone card.

732
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:16,415
It's not really that interesting,
except for it was the phone card used

733
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:18,200
to call in tips
to web sites,

734
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,449
telling them where to pick up
their Julia Mallory sex tape.

735
00:38:25,877 --> 00:38:28,196
A phone card that was
purchased with cash,

736
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:31,288
so that someone could
make calls and...

737
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:33,313
never be traced.

738
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:50,970
You keep lots of things
in this vault, don't you?

739
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:52,387
Secrets?

740
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:55,130
Sometimes.

741
00:38:57,182 --> 00:38:59,888
This could be our secret.
If you kept it.

742
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:03,164
Johnny Gage has already taken
the blame for this. It's over.

743
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:05,078
I can give you anything.

744
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:06,238
Exclusives.

745
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:08,459
<i>DirtNow</i> can be my magazine.

746
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:10,447
We can be a great team, Lucy.

747
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:13,594
I'll-- I'll give you stories.
And you'll give me covers.

748
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:16,447
That's how it works, right?

749
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,078
I'm not for sale, Julia.

750
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:26,508
I know. I didn't mean that. I--

751
00:39:26,582 --> 00:39:28,256
You're not, I am.

752
00:39:28,694 --> 00:39:30,589
I'm the one for sale.

753
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,099
I'll be your star.

754
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,951
I'll feed you anything you need.

755
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:37,546
I told you.
I-- I knew about this vault.

756
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:39,902
Just keep the story on the inside.

757
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,672
And...you can own me.

758
00:39:45,138 --> 00:39:46,629
I don't mind being owned.

759
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,111
You know, there's still
time to walk it back.

760
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:02,350
What?

761
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:05,783
If you want to put the story
back in the vault, there's still time.

762
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:08,313
Going soft on me?

763
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:10,430
Are you worried about
hurting her feelings?

764
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:13,334
Actually, I was wondering
if you were the one going soft.

765
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:16,040
Isn't the smart play to put
the story in the vault?

766
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:19,500
This is a great cover.

767
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,447
Yep.

768
00:40:21,926 --> 00:40:25,736
"America's fallen sweetheart
sold her sex tape for

769
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:28,386
press, sympathy,
and to rekindle her career."

770
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:30,551
It almost worked.

771
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:32,631
If we just let it work.

772
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:36,072
Leverage over a star like Julia
Mallory has to be worth a lot more

773
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:38,465
in the long run
than just one cover.

774
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:40,942
Is that what you think
this whole thing is about?

775
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:42,267
Leverage and power.

776
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,856
No, I'm just trying to think several
steps ahead like you usually do.

777
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:49,261
We go with the story.

778
00:40:49,689 --> 00:40:51,455
Print the truth.

779
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:12,044
<i>Perez has some
crazy shit about you</i>

780
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,917
<i>He's a dick</i>

781
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,920
<i>Did you leak your own tape?</i>

782
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:28,304
<i>- Michael?
- Well, Julia Mallory may have fooled</i>

783
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:30,789
<i>but she's not going
to fool us again.</i>

784
00:41:30,818 --> 00:41:32,842
<i>We're hearing reports today
that the actress will</i>

785
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,778
<i>have to drop her lawsuit,
according to DirtNow.</i>

786
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:37,977
<i>The magazine's upcoming
issue promises to expose</i>

787
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:41,315
<i>Julia Mallory's involvement
in leaking her own sex tape.</i>

788
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,413
<i>A startling revelation
that could have</i>

789
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:45,925
<i>devastating consequences
for the already troubled actress--</i>

790
00:41:46,432 --> 00:41:48,217
- Shit.
<i>- ...if it turns out to be true.</i>

791
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,794
Hang up. Don't answer that.
Don't answer that.

792
00:41:50,956 --> 00:41:53,735
<i>Well, Jim, how about
that Julia Mallory?</i>

793
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:58,355
<i>DirtNow Magazine will run a story
tomorrow saying they have proof</i>

794
00:41:58,422 --> 00:42:01,790
<i>that Julia Mallory leaked her own
sex tape. So the question is,</I>

795
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,575
<i>was it a drug rape after all?</i>

796
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,594
<i>And if it weren't, what does
this mean for Julia's lawsuit?</i>

797
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:08,707
<i>It looks now like there will
be a counter lawsuit,</i>

798
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:10,584
<i>according toDirtNow
editor Lucy Spiller,</i>

799
00:42:10,713 --> 00:42:12,462
<i>who stated that Julia Mallory lied</i>

800
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:15,296
<i>in order to generate publicity
for her flagging career.</i>

801
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,081
<i>DirtNow promises, Nancy,</i>

802
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:18,780
<i>to have the details
in tomorrow's issue.</i>

803
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,841
<i>Just when you thought
she couldn't get any lower.</i>

804
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:23,032
<i>So what does this mean?
What's next for Julia, Tony?</i>

805
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:26,068
<i>Doesn't look like we'll be seeing her
on the silver screen anytime soon.</i>

806
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:27,362
Don't answer that.

807
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:29,589
- Hang it up.
- What's wrong?

808
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:32,148
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

809
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:34,813
Oh, shut up!

810
00:42:34,905 --> 00:42:36,156
Shut up.

811
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:38,843
Shut up!
Oh, my God!

812
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:45,146
- No, no, no, no--No!
- Don...

813
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:48,054
you can't just run away.

814
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:49,434
Yes, I can.

815
00:42:50,462 --> 00:42:53,425
I have my cameras.
I got clean underwear.

816
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:55,155
I got Little Tristin.

817
00:42:55,229 --> 00:42:57,400
Don, the job will just follow you.

818
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,572
No. No.

819
00:42:59,756 --> 00:43:01,118
- Don.
- No.

820
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:03,934
Don.

821
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:08,443
You know what you have to do.
Don.

822
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:12,876
You know you have to kill Lucy.

823
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:16,594
You have to kill her to save her.
