00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:05,504
<i>Hi. It's me, Don Konkey. I'm a
photographer for Dirt Now magazine.</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,842
<i>I'm also a highly functional
schizophrenic, blah, blah, blah.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,277
<i>Dad, I think it's time. </i>

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,712
<i>No offense, but if you
don't know that by now,</i>

5
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>then you have worse
attention skills than me.</i>

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,151
<i>That's Lucy Spiller.</i>

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,221
<i>Again, no offense, but you should
be up on this shit by now.</i>

8
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,555
<i>Lucy has sort of
a problem with men.</i>

9
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,092
You're not gonna use a stun--

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,793
Good night, Holt.

11
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,763
<i>But that's not the case
with Holt McLaren.</i>

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,800
<i>Lucy got what she wanted.</i>

13
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,770
<i>Holt got worms.</i>

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,972
<i>Remember those pictures I took
of happily married action hero</i>

15
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,642
<i>and international superstar
Jack Dawson and Lucy's brother Leo</i>

16
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,711
<i>a while back?</i>

17
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,879
<i>They're starting to cause
a lot of trouble.</i>

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,314
<i>Holt didn't see the worms
when he threw up,</i>

19
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,950
<i>but he did see the track marks
on the arms of his girlfriend</i>

20
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,920
- <i>Julia Mallory.</i>
- What the hell is that?

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,688
Jesus Christ, Julia!
What are you doing?

22
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,391
- It's not a big deal.
- <i>The magazine is doing this big story</i>

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,061
<i>about this cheerleader murder.</i>

24
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,829
<i>Turns out the murdered girl
was involved with the town preacher.</i>

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,332
I've I. D.'d the father of
the victim's unborn baby.

26
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,102
- <i>Oh. And she was pregnant.</i>
- My God.

27
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,404
<i>He was also sleeping
with his daughter.</i>

28
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,373
<i>I don't think there'll be
any World's Greatest Dad mugs</i>

29
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,809
<i>coming his way soon.</i>

30
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,843
<i>Lucy ran that on the cover.</i>

31
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,581
God bless Don Konkey.
He had the right shots all along.

32
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,348
<i>Not everyone was happy.</i>

33
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,920
Who told you my father killed
Amber? Who said that?

34
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,256
I did it! Not Daddy!

35
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,692
<i>On the bright side,
I'm dating again,</i>

36
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,127
<i>and I'm 99% sure</i>

37
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,329
<i>this one is real.</i>

38
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,195
Wait. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

39
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,764
Don't move.
Don't move.

40
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,169
Okay.

41
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,972
Oh, God!

42
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,029
You want to go again?

43
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,169
Don't you want to save
one for the home team?

44
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,821
I heard she moved from

45
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,456
prescription drugs
to self-medication.

46
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,126
What is she on?

47
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,363
I'm asking as a friend.

48
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,608
You want a beer?

49
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,047
Yeah. You?

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,521
This is wrong.

51
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,926
Don't take me
on your guilt trip.

52
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,863
No. You're poison, Lucy.

53
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,366
Excuse me?

54
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,002
We have to stop.

55
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,108
Then what are you doing
standing here?

Dirt - Season 01 Episode 07 -
"Come Together"

60
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,737
Herring worm's rare.

61
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,242
Human cases like yours are more
common in Japan, Netherlands.

62
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,576
Bet you like sushi.

63
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,478
I used to.

64
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,314
Okay.

65
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,482
Thiabendazole.

66
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,885
You're gonna be fine.

67
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,235
Joanna,

68
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,254
can you schedule another
ultrasound for next week

69
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,622
so we can get a head count?

70
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,758
And, uh, would you mind?

71
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:28,359
What happened to the one
we already took?

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,430
My glasses
reflected the flash.

73
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,335
All right.

74
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,470
1, 2-- Oh, wait.

75
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,672
There we go.
And 3.

76
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:50,850
Willa, right?

77
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,121
- I'm Brent Barrow.
- Oh. Of course you are.

78
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,123
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean of course
I know who you are.

79
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,292
That's all right.

80
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,894
That story-- the reverend who
molested his kid and

81
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,164
knocked up her
cheerleader friend was...

82
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,399
juicy.

83
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,701
You're a very talented
young woman.

84
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,138
- Uh, Thank you, Mr. Barrow.
- What are you working on now?

85
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,407
Uh, it's the same story.

86
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,477
The reverend's daughter
told me that she's the one who

87
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,778
killed her best friend.

88
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,446
She confessed that to you?

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,882
Yeah. The cops
don't even know yet.

90
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,417
Lucy thinks the confession cover
might hit the stands

91
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,953
before she's even arrested.

92
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:29,755
Chuck and I are going back today
to get her full interview.

93
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,823
No. No. Come on.

94
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,694
You don't need to share your byline
with that old boozer.

95
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,663
Tell Lucy to show you more respect.

96
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,066
You're editorial material, Willa.

97
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,469
- Thank you.
- Listen, please.

98
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,672
Reporters like you make my job
an honor and a pleasure.

99
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,319
Uh, Chuck?

100
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,188
Time to go?

101
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,825
Uh, I'm worried
about this interview.

102
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,227
Nothing to worry about.

103
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,697
Well, Maddy called me specifically.
It's because she trusts me.

104
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,134
You want to go eat on the way?
I vote for Quiznos.

105
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,437
Look, Chuck, she's
a sexual abuse victim.

106
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,373
I don't want her to clam up
because there's a man in the room.

107
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,577
Little Willa wants to fly solo

108
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,646
and not share a byline.

109
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,549
It's nothing personal.
It's just...

110
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,151
Lucy's wrong. I don't
need help with this.

111
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,453
I agree.

112
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,087
Really?

113
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,256
You got my blessing.

114
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,591
Will you clear it
with Lucy?

115
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,893
We'll tell her after.

116
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,529
Thank you.

117
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,337
Isn't it great?

118
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,105
I discovered
the artist myself.

119
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,608
Do you get it?

120
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,511
Average person spends
two weeks of their life on hold.

121
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,613
How sick is that?

122
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,080
I like hold.

123
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,416
It's free time.

124
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,919
My God, you're right.
I never thought of it like that.

125
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,488
What's your IQ?

126
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,856
I don't know.

127
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,259
You should get tested.
You're probably over 140.

128
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,329
My best friend in New York--
he's a published poet-- he's 140.

129
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,831
What's your process?

130
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,467
When you write on your photographs,
how long does it take?

131
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,069
I wake up...

132
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,437
it's there.

133
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,739
Oh. You black out.

134
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,842
What are you, epileptic?
Narcoleptic?

135
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,210
Schizophrenic.

136
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,982
Genius does not go unpunished.
Meet the bulimic.

137
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,851
Relax.
I use the other hand.

138
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,625
Have you and your father
always been close?

139
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,227
Madonna's mom died, too.

140
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,062
So did Rosie O'Donnell's.

141
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,131
Is that when it started?

142
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,933
When it was just
the two of you?

143
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,239
Have you ever interviewed
Nicole or Lindsay?

144
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,075
Um...

145
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,144
No, I haven't.

146
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,648
Maddy, come here.
Come here.

147
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,389
This is hard.

148
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,824
I love my dad.

149
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,795
I'm just here to write
what you tell me.

150
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,830
It's up to you,

151
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,799
okay? This is your story.

152
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,871
She's just here
to take some photos.

153
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,205
Of me?

154
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,241
Is that okay?

155
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,485
Maddy, when did you find out
that Amber was pregnant?

156
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,056
She told me
after the pep rally.

157
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:54,594
We both painted the tips
of my batons cherry red,

158
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,195
like snow cones.

159
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,264
What did she say?

160
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,200
They loved each other.

161
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,703
Amber and your father.

162
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,009
And that God had blessed their love
by giving them a child.

163
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,146
She said she was Sarah,
Abraham's wife,

164
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,382
and now she would
be my mother.

165
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,685
I told her no way she was Sarah.

166
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,688
She was Hagar,
Sarah's servant.

167
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,957
Hagar's baby
is not blessed.

168
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,392
It says in the Bible--
God says,

169
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:31,597
"Hagar's son will live in hostility
toward all of his brothers."

170
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,665
I told her, "Read your Scripture".

171
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,635
"You can't have this baby".

172
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,005
"I'm Sarah".

173
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,376
"Daddy calls me Sarah
when he puts his love in me."

174
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,913
I hit her
with my baton.

175
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,283
Shouldn't I
have make-up?

176
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,688
No, honey.
Your skin is beautiful.

177
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,657
Are you sure?

178
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,994
Well, maybe
just a little lip gloss.

179
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,433
- Here.
- Kiehl's.

180
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,803
It's yours.

181
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,638
Thank you.

182
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,346
Okay.

183
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,961
Hey.

184
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,064
The car's here.

185
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,899
I'm gonna go to work.
I'll see you in a little bit, all right?

186
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,736
- No. No.
- Hey. The car's here.

187
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,071
I want to go with you.

188
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,040
No. Go back to sleep.
I'll see you in a little while.

189
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,909
Please, I want to come
to the set.

190
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,612
They're kind of freaky
about guests.

191
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,814
You know, today's
a little tricky, so--

192
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,485
I won't talk to anyone. I'll-I'll just--
I'll stay in your trailer.

193
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,554
I'm ready.

194
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,290
Come on, you haven't
even taken a shower yet.

195
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,359
Come on, Holt. I can't
stay here by myself.

196
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,662
All right?
You don't know. You don't.

197
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,430
I feel like I'm gonna die.

198
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,365
Yeah,
it's the damn Vicodan.

199
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,835
Why don't you stop
taking so many of 'em?

200
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,070
- All right?
- Okay. I-- I won't take any.

201
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,740
I won't take any
if I can come with you.

202
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,042
I'm gonna be fine if I'm--
if I just am on set.

203
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,444
I just need to be
around people, that's all.

204
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,279
Please, Holt.

205
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,983
Then why don't you go hang out
with Hannah and Peter today?

206
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,086
I can't. They're working.

207
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,322
Everybody's working.

208
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,691
Nobody's got time.

209
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,393
Damn it, I miss Kira.

210
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:47,933
Oh, I'll go shower, and I'll--
I'll get dressed in 10 minutes, okay?

211
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,549
Jack Dawson
says he's not gay.

212
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,751
He's got The Bulldog
on speed dial.

213
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,685
I got the peter-eater
on speed dial.

214
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,288
Really?
Prepared to testify?

215
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,923
That's not the way it works.

216
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,691
You want a dogfight?
'Cause I really don't.

217
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,094
Oh, don't clench, Brett.

218
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,428
You'll get hemorrhoids.

219
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:24,804
Hi.

220
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:26,839
Hi, Lucy.

221
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,307
We talked
this morning, right?

222
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,709
- I told you to stay on Julia Mallory.
- Yeah.

223
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,379
Oh, you have something
already?

224
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:37,983
I need you.

225
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:39,952
What?

226
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,055
I'm here. What's wrong?

227
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,661
I need to make sure
she's real.

228
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:52,965
Okay.

229
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,774
<i>Okay, very quiet,
people, please. We're rolling.</i>

230
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,743
We've got a chair for you
right over here.

231
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,178
<i>And slate.</i>

232
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,852
<i>Crane.</i>

233
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,420
<i>Action.</i>

234
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,388
This is all I have
for you.

235
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,524
Too bad.
That's enough.

236
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,670
<i>And cut.</i>

237
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,744
<i>How was that for you?</i>

238
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,113
<i>Pretty tight.</i>

239
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,750
<i>Remember, I told you about paragliding
off the Dolomites of Italy.</i>

240
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,620
<i>This...
is so much better.</i>

241
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,256
<i>I need to change my panties.</i>

242
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,639
Yeah.
That's what my girl likes, hmm?

243
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,280
You're a pig.

244
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,449
No, he's sweet.

245
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,718
He let me
crash your party.

246
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,754
Come on. Let 'em
kick him to the curb.

247
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,956
You'd do that to me, Garbo?

248
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,225
For her?
What do you think?

249
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,828
She is Julia Mallory,

250
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,131
and my love for her
cannot be quantified.

251
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,134
Subliminal Velocity,

252
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,669
Hell House--

253
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,138
Camp Crusades: brilliant.

254
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,374
But you-- you changed
my life with:

255
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,513
* All for one, and God
will have some fun *

256
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,316
* Come on, boys,
come on, girls *

257
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,418
* Come on,
let's put our mark *

258
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,954
* On this wild,
wild world *

259
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,157
* This wild, wild world *

260
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,526
* This wild, wild world *

261
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,261
What?

262
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,430
I want to play, too.

263
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,334
- Keep your dick out of my face.
- No problem.

264
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,635
No problem.

265
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,705
So you girls
can screw me, suck me,

266
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,574
spank me raw for all I care.
Whatever you want.

267
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,608
Julia?

268
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,250
Okay.
She comes with me.

269
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,555
* This wild, wild world *

270
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,691
* This wild, wild world *

271
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,372
Here you go.

272
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,041
Thank you.

273
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,278
Be right back.

274
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,081
Very real.

275
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,816
I can still smell
the patchouli.

276
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,551
I like
the way she smells.

277
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,687
Well, if you like it,
then I like it.

278
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,423
- How long do we have to sit here?
- Just a few minutes.

279
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,560
She thinks I'm a genius.

280
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,131
Don't I always
tell you that?

281
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,102
- So you're Don's boss.
- Friend.

282
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,538
You went to college together.
He told me.

283
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,740
I'm sorry. I don't
read your magazine.

284
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,276
Oh, it's not a judgment thing.
I just don't have the time.

285
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,979
Uh, speaking of time...

286
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,213
Julia?

287
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,550
I have to go to work.

288
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,219
Wait. To the magazine?
I thought we agreed.

289
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:35,721
Agreed?

290
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,424
That Don shouldn't
waste his energy on star stuff.

291
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,993
Have you seen his artwork,
his picture poems?

292
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,061
Yes, I have.

293
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,261
Oh, so then you know.

294
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,997
Well, maybe just this once.

295
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,299
To pay the bills.

296
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,702
Okay.

297
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,205
- We'll talk more tonight?
- Bye.

298
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,974
Thanks, Lucy.

299
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,715
He sent me here
to see if you were real.

300
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,651
He's schizophrenic.
He told me.

301
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,688
Did he tell you he writes those picture
poems when he forgets to take his meds?

302
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,226
Uh, I know you mean well,
but you're not really helping him.

303
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,594
You're using him.

304
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,498
I'm gonna chalk that up
to young and dumb.

305
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,901
Look, play patron of the arts
if that's what gets you off.

306
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,404
But don't play
with people's lives.

307
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,938
That's what you do
for a living.

308
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,472
Thought you didn't
read the magazine.

309
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:29,508
Only in the toilet.

310
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,946
Okay. Let's not
personalize this.

311
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,282
I'm glad that Don has a friend
who appreciates him.

312
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,485
And you're right.
He's very talented.

313
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,854
He's also
caring and loyal,

314
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,956
and he has
a very real disease.

315
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,390
He has a label
given to him by a society

316
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,660
that won't tolerate anything
but the status quo.

317
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,396
Don's an artist.
Art is born of pain.

318
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,365
He's entitled to feel
what he feels.

319
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,636
Get someone else
to cut an ear off for you.

320
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,738
Like you got him
to cut off his finger?

321
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,225
Leo.

322
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,329
Don't recognize me
in the burkha?

323
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,032
Justine Dawson.

324
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,502
I have to dress like my maid
to avoid the paparazzi.

325
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,804
Aren't you gonna say hello?

326
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,340
- Look, I'm sorry--
- I liked your color sense.

327
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,742
I'm just sorry you couldn't
keep your hands off my husband.

328
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,545
- Jack came on to me.
- I don't give a shit.

329
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,347
- I'm not the first.
- Just the first to sell him out--

330
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,484
and not even for the money,
just revenge.

331
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,986
What a big baby you are.

332
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,189
Here, I want you
to have these.

333
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,827
This is a letter from my 11-year-old
asking her father to come home.

334
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,130
Oh, didn't you know?

335
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,133
Jack moved out of the house.
And here!

336
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,669
Ben found this in his desk.

337
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,271
"Your dad
is a pipe smoker."

338
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,341
It's a clever drawing.
He's lighting his own penis.

339
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,210
- This wasn't--
- Emma's 11,

340
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,945
and Ben's only 8.

341
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,614
So maybe that isn't
much of a score.

342
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,850
But they will carry this with them
for the rest of their lives.

343
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,286
So congratulations.

344
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,121
Revenge is sweet.

345
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,424
- Watch--
- Go!

346
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,525
Get off me!

347
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,440
I see you took my advice.

348
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,477
Well, it was really good advice.

349
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,413
What are you gonna do to celebrate?

350
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:34,052
Some of the gang told me
they'd take me out for a drink.

351
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,688
And what about after?

352
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,600
Excuse me, Miss.
I was just looking for the toilet.

353
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,936
Hello, Bulldog.

354
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,539
I'd get up, but that might be
mistaken for a sign of respect.

355
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,376
I got a call from Jack Dawson.

356
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,879
Don't take the case.
I know how you hate to lose.

357
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,115
I will be subpoenaing your brother.

358
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,950
I know he's the source.

359
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,787
Every story in this magazine
is verified by more than one source.

360
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,390
Fag makes grab at movie star's pistol

361
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,759
and gets fired on the spot.

362
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,497
Big sister cooks up a story to save
his pride and up her sales.

363
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,599
I don't need to cook it up in this town.

364
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,135
I step in it the minutes
I walk out the door.

365
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,570
And you sure stepped
in it this time, sugar.

366
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,673
I'd think about printing a retraction,

367
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,041
and an apology.

368
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,577
And I'd think about that hat.

369
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,655
Um, you guys go ahead,
and I'll meet up with you later.

370
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,290
<i>Maddy? Hello?</i>

371
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,526
You have to help me.

372
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,828
Grandma says I'm going to jail.

373
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:54,266
I can't go! I won't!
You said it would be all right.

374
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,268
What-- Hey--
Just slow down. I--

375
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,336
I lied to you, Willa!

376
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,038
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,773
It wasn't me.

378
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,544
I didn't-- I didn't kill Amber. He did.

379
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,244
My daddy.

380
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,114
What? Maddy--

381
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,952
He-- He made me lie.
He told me to lie. He made me.

382
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,887
All right, look, I'm coming
to see you. Just stay there.

383
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,223
<i>Don't talk to anybody.</i>

384
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,624
Okay.

385
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,662
Hey. Chefs don't clean up.

386
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,170
- Leo, let it go.
- Can't.

387
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,272
- You can.
- You didn't see her.

388
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,843
She married his box office.
Her whole life is a lie.

389
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,478
Those kids are going through hell.

390
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:40,812
No worse than we did.

391
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,347
Yeah. Look at us.

392
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,084
You have to stop worrying about her
and start thinking about yourself.

393
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,620
Jack Dawson's lawyer is threatening
to put you on the stand

394
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,089
if you don't make a retraction.

395
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,492
Okay? You know I can't do that.

396
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,861
You'd rather drag everyone
through a public hearing?

397
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,499
Okay, I asked you more than once,
"Are you sure you want to do this, Leo?"

398
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:04,369
You said to me "You bet your ass."
That is a direct quote. Yes, it is.

399
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,371
- I warned you.
- You warned me.

400
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,439
Warning me was bullshit.

401
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,608
You should have said
"He has a family and two kids."

402
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,310
Oh, like you didn't know that?

403
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:13,979
God.

404
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,948
Are people even real to you?

405
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,951
Yes. You're real.

406
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,293
This is so unfair, Leo!

407
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,036
You have to tell me the truth.

408
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,973
Look, I can't help you
unless I know what happened.

409
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,743
Maddy.

410
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,315
Amber told Daddy he had to marry her,

411
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,585
and if he didn't, she'd tell the police
he raped her.

412
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,887
You were there?

413
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,157
What happened?

414
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,393
They argued.

415
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,763
He hit her with my baton,

416
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,798
then he stabbed her.

417
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,401
That's the truth.

418
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,335
You have to fix it.

419
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,538
You said nothing bad would happen.

420
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,473
You promised. You promised me!

421
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,445
Okay.

422
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,687
- What do you want for these?
- They're yours.

423
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,891
The negatives in the vault?

424
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,394
Why waste the space?

425
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,797
I can get more anytime.
So can anyone else

426
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,501
Here.

427
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,939
Conquistador House.

428
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,807
It's east of Santa Barbara.

429
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,810
I made a call. They'll have a bed
ready for her tomorrow.

430
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,278
I never even heard of it.

431
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,182
Total privacy, and total
commitment to recovery.

432
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,253
Why are you doing all this?

433
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,657
Two more badges, and I make Eagle Scout.

434
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,531
Do you even know why you stick around?

435
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,936
Is it love, or is it guilt?

436
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,841
Are you afraid to find out?

437
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,512
I'm not.

438
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,318
You didn't know her before everything.

439
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,754
She was always happy.

440
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,726
She was just--

441
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,029
She was full of light.

442
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,832
Laughed all the time.

443
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,535
Jesus, Holt, she's not dead.

444
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,371
Yet.

445
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,809
Lucy.

446
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,047
Maddy didn't kill Amber.
Reverend Sweet did it.

447
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,250
He forced her to confess, but
the story's already been shipped.

448
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,383
What are we gonna do?

449
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,221
Relax. We have the transcripts.
The story is solid.

450
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,891
But Maddy could go to jail
for a murder she didn't commit.

451
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,793
Okay. Get a follow-up
statement from Sweet

452
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,893
Is he still in prison?

453
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,097
Her father manipulated her
into taking the blame.

454
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,466
We have to do something:
insert a denial or something.

455
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,137
How about a press release
saying "Don't buy <i>Dirt Now</i>"?

456
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,371
How's that?

457
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,241
She's just a little girl. I promised her
that I would protect her.

458
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,544
She is a story. She's not your friend.

459
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,880
You protect your source.
You protect the truth.

460
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,348
You don't protect the little girl.

461
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,785
She's a liar, Willa. You know that.
She told you herself.

462
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,255
You both got what you wanted.
You got your cover story.

463
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,226
Leo. Hi, it's me.

464
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,796
Would you please pick up?
I want to talk to you.

465
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,632
Come on. I know you're there.

466
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,036
You know, you really
are a dick sometimes.

467
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,980
She's not really your friend, Don.

468
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,982
I hope you don't mind me saying this.

469
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,552
Who?

470
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,153
Lucy.

471
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,226
Lucy's my friend.

472
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,895
If she were, she wouldn't
ask you to sell your soul.

473
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,370
Is that her?

474
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,639
No.

475
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:52,916
Your salacious lies have put
Jack Dawson's career

476
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,485
as a leading man in the crapper.

477
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,554
Good news, though.

478
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,491
He's always wanted to be
a media tycoon, so we'll settle

479
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,995
for everything
in Gibson Horne's portfolio.

480
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,797
Oh, my--

481
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,666
Two scenarios:

482
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,902
lawsuit.

483
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,172
Process of discovery.

484
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,243
Our lawyers call every gigolo,
masseuse, trainer, pool boy,

485
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,612
and ass toy
Jack's ever employed.

486
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,515
All rumors, innuendoes, and impressions

487
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,752
become facts of the case,
and that means

488
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,287
we can publish them.

489
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,322
I mean, that should be worth--

490
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,224
what do you think, five covers at least?

491
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:37,061
Jack Dawson will be
America's proud gay icon.

492
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,230
Scenario 2:

493
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,165
drop the lawsuit.

494
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,074
Look, the damage has been done, people.

495
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,011
There's not enough money

496
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,114
to indemnify you against
the lawsuit we will bring.

497
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,951
One year from today...

498
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,755
you will all be
working for Jack Dawson.

499
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,723
Well,

500
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,159
until he fires you. Good day.

501
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,453
Mom? Dad?

502
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,333
Seen this?

503
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:27,005
She didn't do it, Chuck.
She was covering for her father.

504
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,906
Cops found the baton.

505
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,175
Plenty of prints:
Maddy, not Daddy.

506
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,011
That's because it was her baton.

507
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,413
The medical examiner
matched the angle and depth

508
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,383
of Amber's stab wounds
to Maddy's height and weight.

509
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,119
Innocent until proven guilty, of course.

510
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,922
Arise, my little "protege'",

511
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,791
and join the ranks.

512
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,260
I shouldn't have cut you out.

513
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:50,962
I wasn't ready.

514
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,463
You did great.

515
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,632
No, I didn't handle it right.

516
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,367
I let her get to me.

517
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,537
When it stops getting to you,
that's when you're in trouble.

518
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,172
You missed a spot.

519
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,042
You'll get it.

520
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,888
I don't need this.

521
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,822
You can help me.

522
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,358
I don't need to be here.

523
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,593
Sweetie, listen to me.

524
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,231
There's something I've never told you.

525
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,434
Please, babe, can we just go home?

526
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,070
You remember that day that we met?

527
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,709
Well, I wasn't really there to audition.

528
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,782
I followed you from the coffee shop.

529
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,555
And you got your drink, and the guy made
a mistake with your change, and...

530
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,891
he gave you a 20 instead of a 1.

531
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,330
And you gave it back.

532
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,703
Then I couldn't think of anyone
that wouldn't have kept the 20.

533
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,907
And you were so beautiful.

534
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,212
You were the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

535
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,853
I want that girl back.

536
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,073
No, it's okay. I got this.

537
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,574
I got it.

538
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,044
No. No!

539
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,579
Julia, come here.

540
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,047
Please, Holt, please!

541
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,115
No, please.

542
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,250
Sorry, come on.

543
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,853
No! No! No!

544
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,622
- Please stop.
- No!

545
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,057
Calm down. Come on.

546
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,659
Come on.

547
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:04,595
Julia, stop.

548
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,063
Julia. Julia, stop

549
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,099
No!

550
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,369
Come on. Listen.

551
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,738
Listen.

552
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,040
Everything's gonna be all right.

553
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,542
You can trust me.

554
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:18,943
Come here.

555
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,444
Come here.

556
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,885
Everything's gonna be all right.

557
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,915
You're not the first.

558
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,956
Stop beating yourself up.

559
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,724
Thank you.

560
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,128
Lucy thinks I'm an amateur.

561
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,032
I'm so pissed to myself.

562
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,138
Close your eyes...

563
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,742
and tell me what color you see.

564
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,913
It's an old trick I learned from

565
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,983
a-a bushman in Zimbabwe.
What do you got to lose?

566
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,451
Okay.

567
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,323
Red.

568
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:46,864
All right.

569
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,969
Put that red...

570
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,373
right there.

571
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,442
Now...

572
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,878
see it move down.

573
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,283
Down your shoulder,

574
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,751
down your arm...

575
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:10,721
into your wrist...

576
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,558
your hand...

577
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,296
fingers--
- What are you doing?

578
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,632
Don't talk. Don't-- ...look.

579
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,834
Just...

580
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,548
No feeling is bad if
you know what to do with it.

581
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,090
What are you feeling right now?

582
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,952
<i>Well, thank you,
and I want to get right to</i>

583
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,121
<i>the photos that appeared
in the magazine.</i>

584
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,457
<i>How did that happen?</i>

585
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,525
<i>Tabloids will print anything</i>

586
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,761
<i>to sell paper, Tony, even
if they have to make it up.</i>

587
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,196
<i>We just don't pay attention.</i>

588
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,997
<i>My lawyers told me that I should sue,</i>

589
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,367
<i>but I will not dignify these lies</i>

590
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,835
<i>with a legal response.</i>

591
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,636
Justine and I, we know who we are.

592
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,207
<i>We don't have to spend time or
money proving anything</i>

593
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,708
<i>to anyone.</i>
- Good God.

594
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:38,975
<i>I want you to know, Tony,</i>

595
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,811
<i>this is the last time I'm gonna give
an interview on the topic.</i>

596
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,180
<i>- Never again?
- Never again.</i>

597
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,416
<i>No, no. Justine and I--</i>

598
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,185
Hey, turn on the TV. Channel 4.

599
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,521
God's in His heaven, and
all is right with the world.

600
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,290
<i>- You're pregnant?
- Absolutely.</i>

601
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,326
Come on. I know you're there.
I miss you.

602
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,961
<i>Show him the ring.</i>

603
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,830
<i>Jack Dawson's backing off.
He's not gonna sue.</i>

604
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,031
<i>That is a stun--</i>

605
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,234
I was gonna call you to say good-bye.

606
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,303
You going somewhere?

607
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,207
Oh, my God, of course you are.

608
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,544
One of your little walkabouts.
You always run away.

609
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,246
Nothing keeping me here.

610
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,351
You can hide, Leo, but the old shit's
gonna be here when you come back

611
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,052
Look, I don't want to fight.

612
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,622
Where are you going?
How can I reach you?

613
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,824
I don't know, but if I did,

614
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,626
I wouldn't tell you.

615
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,327
Is that a joke?

616
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,130
Look, hon, you can't leave me.

617
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,299
I need to get away from you for a while.

618
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,304
I think it's catching. The last couple
of days, I've felt, uh...

619
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,040
numb.

620
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,075
Is that how it starts?

621
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,712
You can't be mad at me forever.

622
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,282
I know.

623
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,139
Justine, thank you very much.

624
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,574
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

625
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:25,943
Jack, always good to see you.

626
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,338
They are back in the news
and yes, at it again.

627
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,340
But this time, Lindsay
and Paris are fighting--

628
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,010
no, not over a boy toy, Shaun-- no,

629
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,343
over an actual movie role.

630
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,411
Yeah, that's right, Tony.

631
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,648
The two scrappy vixens are battling
over which one will play the role

632
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,118
of Maddy Sweet in the hottest
new film property in town.

633
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,888
Now, Sweetis based on
the infamous cheerleader murder

634
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,489
in Walnut Valley, California.

635
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,492
You know, maybe Lindsay
and Paris could make up

636
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,660
and do the film together.
One could play Maddy, and

637
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,395
<i>the other could play
Amber Carmichael.</i>

638
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,463
<i>You know, Amber's the victim,
and everybody says</i>

639
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,366
<i>the bad girl role
is always the better role.</i>

640
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,769
<i>- You're probably right about that.
- Maybe.</i>

641
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,504
<i>Either way, Adaptation
helmer Spike Jones</i>

642
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,740
<i>is rumored to be looking
to direct, and production</i>

643
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,810
<i>on Sweet is slated to start
as early as this summer</i>

644
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,413
<i>for a holiday release. What, a
better family film I cannot find.</i>

645
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:47,017
<i>Yeah. Sounds like someone
might be looking for a nomination.</i>
