1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,760
we have so many ways to send a message to somebody,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,360
to make a connection.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,140
In the old days,you had to put a bottle in the ocean 

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,540
or train a pigeon or set something on fire.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,990
God,it used to be so easy.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,050
Todd?

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,210
Todd?

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,610
Okay,now where'd you go?

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,590
Sorry.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,980
I had to get my tea.

11
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,360
You've been in london for two weeks.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,430
You drink tea?

13
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,770
They go well with my biscuits.

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,510
Oh,check it out!Check it out!

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,510
The magazine got me business cards today.

16
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,810
Can you see?Can you see that?

17
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,630
Todd deepler,photo editor.

18
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,270
This is weird.

19
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,620
I mean,I-I think I took for granted you be--being here,and,you know,

20
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,520
we didn't really define who we are or whatever before you went.

21
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,750
But I miss you.

22
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,620
Can I say that?

23
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,970
Is that okay?

24
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,020
Todd?

25
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,860
And look at this hat!

26
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,970
Look at that!

27
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,220
Right,guv'nor?

28
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,660
oh,that's great.

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,270
Hey,uh,uh,who is that?

30
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,280
That's mickey,my roommate.She's great.

31
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,380
She's been showing me around.

32
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,200
She can totally drink me underneath the table.

33
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,060
-shut up.
-You shut up!

34
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,640
You didn't--you never told me mickey was a girl.

35
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,620
So?

36
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,590
So you were my roommate,and you were a girl.

37
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,910
And we srted dating.

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,570
-sam's a girl?
-Yes,I aM.

39
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,050
Sam,could we say good night?

40
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,100
I'm six hours ahead,and I'm pretty knackered.

41
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,190
Knackered?

42
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,740
Two weeks.

43
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,410
That's two.

44
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,990
Good night,sam.

45
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,680
I mean,every time I talk to todd,I feel likepasado.

46
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,650
Which I sort of am.

47
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,800
I mean,he's six hours ahead.

48
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,740
-Samantha.
-What?

49
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,660
Foet todd.

50
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,990
Todd is gone.

51
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,010
You should be enjoying your life.

52
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,320
I mean,look at me.

53
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,050
I'm enjoying your life.

54
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,990
Ooh,more wine,please.

55
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,000
You know,you should be enjoying your own life,mother,with dad.

56
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,350
I cannot believe that you let him go on that R.V.Trip by himself.

57
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,910
I am going to join up with him tomorrow.

58
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,590
I have lots of work to do.

59
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,840
But tonight I can be your wingman.

60
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,020
billionaire at 9:00.

61
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,420
And he will be one at 10:00,and I am still not interested.

62
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,180
Samantha,you listen to me.

63
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,790
When you lose your dog,the best thing you can do is get a new dog,

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
and that one has pedigreE.

65
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,140
So get over there and sniff his butt.

66
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,600
less wine,please.

67
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,000
Ladies.

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,180
regina.

69
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,130
Winston.

70
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,840
Oh,I love coming into the city with its customs.

71
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,900
May I steal your daughter for a moment,please?

72
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,910
Oh,it's not stealing if i give her away.

73
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,860
It is if you put little quiches in your purse.

74
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,490
Not as slick as you think.

75
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,320
Get!

76
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,510
Here you go.

77
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,840
Thank you.

78
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,220
and of course,you'reood at this,too.

79
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,790
Well,my parents wouldn't let me play football.

80
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,360
Besides,you're the one making me look good.

81
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,340
This whole night is because of your work.

82
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,590
When I grow up,I wanna be you.

83
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,060
What do you say,sam?

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,130
Have dinner with me.

85
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,870
You used to love me once before.

86
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,110
That was not love.That was an affair.

87
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,100
We were sneaking around behind your wife's back.

88
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,280
My ex-wife's back.

89
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,500
Whatever.Your ex-wife's back.

90
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,080
No,my ex-wife is back.

91
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,240
You left her for me?Are you crazy?

92
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,250
What is she doing here?

93
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,870
Don't worry.She never knew anything about us.

94
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,510
As far as she's concerned,you're the head of my foundation.

95
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,110
Gigi.

96
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,330
Winston,hello.

97
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,290
It's good to see you.

98
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,830
You look like a million bucks.

99
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,630
$400 million,actually my lawyer was better than yours.

100
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,180
You know,uh,samantha newly?

101
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,830
-Samantha newly?
-Yes,mr. Funk?

102
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,420
Head of our foundation.

103
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,740
Oh,it's nice to meet you.

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,500
Winston,run and grab us a glass of champagne 

105
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,730
so we can make a toast to everything that this woman has done.

106
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,580
Of course.

107
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,080
I'll be right back.

108
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,260
Going...now.

109
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,600
Your dress is so pretty.

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,020
Yours,too...

111
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,880
you home-wrecking whore.

112
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,050
Thanks.I got it on sale.

Season 2 Episode 19</font>

116
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,330
Okay,before you attack me or anything like that,

117
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,960
I want you to know that there are a lot of plainclothes officers in this room,

118
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,840
and I may or may not be one of 'em.

119
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,820
You do realize you ruined my life?

120
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,120
Really?

121
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,370
Gosh,I think that having $400 million would make everything-- 

122
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,580
okay,I'm--I'm sorry.

123
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,810
Look,you--you need to understand something.

124
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,240
That person who broke up your marriage is not me.

125
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,760
I read the e-mails.

126
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,090
I saw the romantic things that he wrote to his "emerald-eyed beauty with the sunshine hair.

127
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,760
" Okay,well,there are certain resemblances,yes.

128
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,260
But what I'm saying is that that "me" was hit by a car and got amnesia.

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,290
Seriously,I don't remember anything from before that day,

130
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,660
and I am nothing like that person at all.

131
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,160
And what,you're not with him anymore?

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,560
No.Not even a little bit.

133
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,640
If I could take it back,I would.

134
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,460
Damn it.

135
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,560
What?

136
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,490
Well,you're nice.That's what.

137
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,720
I spent an entire year working up to this.

138
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,930
I even learned to like martinis so I could throw one in your face.

139
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,290
You still can.

140
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,440
Here,go,go,go.

141
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,150
Hey,I'm stealing your husband.

142
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,440
You better stop me.

143
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,860
All the fun's out of it.

144
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,860
Samantha,after I read those e-mails,I was so angry.

145
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:52,200
I spent an entire year at an ashram breathing in forgiveness and sleeping on a cot made of hemp,

146
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,490
which got pretty tiny because I had to smoke a little of it every night to get to sleep.

147
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,660
I was-- I-I was such a mess.

148
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,700
No.Oh,come on,no,no,no.Don't cry.Please.

149
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,510
Look--look,look,listen-- listen to me.

150
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,140
If there is anything-- anything at all that I can do to make it up to you,I-I--anything...

151
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,520
help me get back together with him.

152
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,340
Uh,I was thinking,like,a ride to the airport.

153
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,870
Something like that.But,yeah,sure.

154
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,950
Okay.

155
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,300
Okay,calendar up.

156
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,730
I am blacked out on the 10th,the 14th and the 20th.

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,820
Oh,but two saturdays from now I got us tickets the murder mystery train.

158
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,680
Oh,I can'T.It's andrea's wedding.

159
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,990
I don't have that.

160
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,510
All right,fine.Just tell her that she has to pay me back for the tickets.

161
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,230
Oh,no,sorry.

162
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,170
I don't-- I don't get a plus one.

163
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,370
I'm not a plus one.

164
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,800
We're in a committed relationship.

165
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,820
Yes,we are,unless I meet someone off my free pass list,of course.

166
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,850
Considering most of them are characters from "the lord of the rings,

167
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,730
" I think you're pretty safe.

168
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,760
Tell andrea we're coming.

169
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,770
I can'T.I mean,andrea thinks that couples shouldn't be invited unless they're married.

170
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,140
All right,fine.You know,if it's just about bemarried,dena,then...

171
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,390
why don't we just...

172
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,960
get married?

173
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,920
Was that supposed to be a proposal?

174
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,320
I don't know.It can be.

175
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,290
You want it to be?

176
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,720
Bottom line it for me.What do you want?

177
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,660
We do it by october,we can file jointly.

178
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,820
How much do you make?

179
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,850
Nice.

180
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,790
-Very romantic.
-What?

181
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,620
You know,chase chapman,you could learn a thing or two from aragorn,

182
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,660
the rightful king of gondor,about how to treat a lady.

183
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,170
You keep this up,and you'll be my minus one.

184
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,440
Your...

185
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,090
andrea?

186
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,060
Are you okay?

187
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,050
I'm good.I'm not hungry.

188
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,930
What?

189
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,220
Wait.

190
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,080
This isn't my fice.

191
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,850
Okay,are you still not eating?

192
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,680
I have to be crazy thin for this wedding.

193
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,680
Women I have hated my entire life are coming from around the world to be jealous of me.

194
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,100
They're not leaving until they're in tears.

195
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,390
Yes,but you can't not eat for two weeks.

196
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,720
I'm fine.

197
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,880
I licked two stamps before I came in.

198
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,080
Okay,that is not what I meant--and she's down.

199
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,990
tyler,can you please come in here and wheel ms. Belladonna into her office?

200
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,490
Oh,and you know what?

201
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,390
Will you call mr. Funk and tell him that I will have dinner with him tonight?

202
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,660
I'm sorry?

203
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,030
It's not a date.

204
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,150
I am setting him up with his ex-wife.

205
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,460
Awesome.

206
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,060
Still in the game.

207
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,880
Uh,you know what?

208
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,830
I'm just gonna e-mail him myself,okay?

209
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,350
"samantha,no words,no music,no sigh can give voice "to this feeling.

210
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,070
I am silenced by your beauty.

211
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,590
" "there's nowhere I'd rather be "than beside you,

212
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,350
waiting for the moment your eyes open and give light to my day.

213
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,440
" "The world says I'm a wealthy man,but I'm always poor when you say good-bye.

214
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:11,440
" "Ts slope I'm on is too slippery,"and I can't climb back up,so I just let go and fall into you.

215
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,590
hey,sam!

216
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,050
I saw that you were online.

217
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,520
You good?What's going on?

218
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,010
Nothing.I,um...

219
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,520
I-I,um...

220
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,440
wait,sam?

221
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,440
Sam?

222
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,990
The picture froze again.

223
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,160
Sam?

224
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,100
so...

225
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,800
when I rented it out for the two of us,I thought it would be romantic.

226
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,290
And it'S...

227
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,200
not.

228
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,280
No,it's--it...

229
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,790
it just sorta seems like the place is going out of business,that's all.

230
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,970
Thank you.

231
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,840
Thanks.

232
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,030
So,um...

233
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,750
-I wanna talk to you about gigi.
-Okay.

234
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,190
Um,champagne?

235
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,340
Um,no,thank you.

236
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,550
I-I won't even be here that long.

237
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,970
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

238
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,510
Grilled cheese?

239
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,980
That's the first meal we ever ate together.

240
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,830
I'm sorry.You--you were saying?

241
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,710
Yeah.Gigi.Okay.

242
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,670
I think that...

243
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,990
you need to get back together with her.

244
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,550
saM...

245
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,390
I don't want gigi.

246
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,450
I want you.

247
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,870
Well,I tried.

248
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,270
Samantha?

249
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,750
Turn off the light.

250
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,230
What are you doing in my bed?

251
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,830
I was clubbing,and I experienced a temporary forgetting of my address.

252
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,880
Mom?

253
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,760
Are you actually going to meet dad in the R.V.,Or is he,like,

254
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,940
resting in the basemenor something?

255
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,780
I am meeting up with him tomorrow.

256
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,320
And what are you doing coming home so late?

257
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,170
Well,you'll be happy to know I went out with funk,and I kissed him,

258
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,720
which is the exact opposite of what I wanted to do.

259
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,510
Now I don't--I don't know how I feel about it,because...

260
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,200
well,I mean,partly because of todd.

261
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,730
But you know,todd's not here.

262
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,520
But because of gigi,and--and she wants to be with him,so she's not gonna like this at all.

263
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,160
Or maybe she'll be okay with it.I don't know.

264
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,520
She's all kinda like forgiving now.

265
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,270
oh,get that.

266
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,750
I can't get up.

267
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,640
It's--it's like I'm looking through the eyes of a bee.

268
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,680
Hello,samantha.

269
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,140
Gigi.

270
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,910
You know where I live.

271
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,100
That's cool.

272
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,290
Your assistant told me that you had dinner with winston,

273
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,810
and I was wondering if you might've talked to him about me.

274
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,740
Yeah.

275
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,450
Funny thing-- we did.

276
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,060
Gigi,look,you know how you were talking about your ashram with the forgiveness?

277
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,570
What did he say?

278
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,780
I mean,I had to know.

279
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,800
I don't even have a car here.

280
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,850
And I'm so excited I had someone run me over.

281
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,930
He said he likes you.

282
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,140
So go get him,killer!

283
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,370
 why?

284
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,200
Why did I kiss funk?

285
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,870
I should not get involved.

286
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,460
You know,now I'm just the other woman...

287
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,370
again.

288
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,070
Don't worry.

289
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,360
I've got your back. 

290
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,860
more flowers from mr. Funk.

291
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,370
Get those outta here,man!

292
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,760
What are you trying to do,geme killed?

293
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,910
She found out that funk's ex-wife is the one that ran her over.

294
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,440
Mr. Engle in 4 will be disappointed.

295
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,760
In the tenant pool,he had "disgruntled classmate.

296
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,540
" Most of the others had me.

297
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,110
Is there any chance that I've mastered,like,

298
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,640
a deadly martial art that'll just come back to me right when I need it most?

299
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh,god!

300
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,900
No.

301
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,100
maybe she's not dangerous anymore.

302
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,760
You know,she's been at an ashram.

303
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,050
You know what?You're right.

304
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,580
She spent the last year trying to get peaceful.

305
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
That's one explanation.

306
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,490
Okay,what?

307
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,460
Often,the original purpose of a pilgrimage to ashram was not for tranquility,

308
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,960
but for cleansing and instruction in the art of war,

309
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,170
particularly in the use of enchanted weapons.

310
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,260
Well,let's see if they're any match for these magic scissors.

311
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,270
No.No.

312
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,680
This does not constitute a tip.

313
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,850
I wasn't,um,expecting to run into,uh,to see you today.

314
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,050
He's not returning my calls.

315
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:55,770
Who isn't?

316
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,800
Winston.

317
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,280
You said that he wanted to get together,but he's not calling me back.

318
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,230
Yodon't mind if I just cut some stuff while we're talking?

319
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,300
They just happen to be the best and sharpest scissors I've ever owned.

320
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,230
Fine.

321
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,150
Do you think he's seeing someone else?

322
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,480
Yeah,that's not what I wanted to cut.

323
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,230
Because if he is,samantha-- hands where I can see 'em!

324
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,360
Just,I mean,just 'cause I love those nails.

325
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,490
flowers!

326
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,860
From that funk guy.

327
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,410
For you!

328
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,070
No,they're-- 

329
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,760
okay,you can go now,tyler.Just don't speak.Go.Go.

330
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,800
Just go.

331
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,560
Here's the card.

332
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,430
No,no,no,no.

333
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,490
"I can't wait to kiss you again.

334
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,430
I'm waiting for you at chez monique.

335
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,620
omg,sam.Thank you!

336
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,890
Don't go.

337
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,640
-No?
-No,god,no.

338
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,350
You wanna play the game,right?

339
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,310
I mean,I-I would say wait,you know,at least aear.

340
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,700
You know,maybe go meet someone.

341
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,600
Maybe have some kids.Move to canada.

342
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,060
That'll drive him crazy.

343
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,830
I'll call you!

344
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,930
Oh,I can't wait.

345
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,220
Drive slowly.

346
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,570
Don't hit anyone.

347
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,360
Tyler,I need you--oh.Of course!

348
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,740
Oh,come on,funk.

349
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,410
Pick up,pick up,pick up.

350
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,280
No,do not go to voice mail.Do not go to voice mail.Do not go to voice mail.

351
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,660
Hey,hey,it's me.

352
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,850
Listen,when you get this message,get out of the restaurant immediately,all right?

353
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,140

00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,400
Do not call me back.

355
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,570
do not e-mail me.

356
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,680
We need to cool it until gigi is out of the picture.

357
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,860
All right?!

358
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,550
which might be sooner than I thought.

359
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,260
there,sleepyhead.

360
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,650
It's your cousin cindy.

361
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,800
Sam,I don't have amnesia.

362
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,610
Well,it was worth a shot.

363
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,220
Look,gigi,I'm sorry.

364
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,440
It was--it was an accident.

365
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,790
I understand.

366
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,500
You still want him.

367
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,390
And now that I'm with winston,it's eating you alive.

368
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,030
What?!

369
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,400
And now your darker side has taken over.

370
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,020
My darker side?

371
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,570
Are you kidding me,lady?

372
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,820
Thank you,lauren.That was fun.

373
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,400
And how is the patient?

374
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,880
The patient is fine.

375
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,680
The visitor can't seem to handle that you're in love with me.

376
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,830
In love with...

377
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,570
you?

378
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,350
Yeah,you know,the flowers?

379
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,880
And the note?

380
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,520
The lunch?

381
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,900
I can see you winking.

382
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,670
You know,I think I'm blocking an ambulance.

383
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,670
She tried to kill me!

384
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,770
She tried to kill me first!

385
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,980
She put me in a coma!

386
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,050
So you don't have amnesia!

387
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,900
Yes,I do.

388
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,730
But I remember things sometimes when I'm really,really stressed out.

389
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,870
Just like now.

390
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,680
I just remembered I can juggle.

391
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,680
And I remember that you ran me over with your car first.

392
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,810
All right,I know I only have an honorary law degree,but none of that sounds okay.

393
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,330
Hey,you know what?I'm not gonna live in fear,

394
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,540
loing over my shoulder.

395
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,550
Because you know what,lady?

396
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,350
You and I--we're even.

397
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,940
Because that girl that you were trying to kill-- you killed her.

398
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,120
She's dead.

399
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,480
In rhode island?

400
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,830
Um,no.

401
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,190
Me.

402
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,890
And another thing,I'm not the other woman anymore,

403
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,690
because he wants to be with me,which makes me...

404
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,660
the woman and you the other woman,which technically gives me every right to run you over.

405
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,770
All right,you know,that's not exactly-- but she has a point,gigi.Okay?

406
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,750
You gotta start living your life and stop waiting for things that are just not gonna happen.

407
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,690
not gonna happen.

408
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,570
You're right.

409
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,690
You are.

410
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,560
Sam,letting it go.

411
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,720
White light in.

412
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,890
Black smoke out.

413
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,370
God,I want a cigarette.

414
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,940
Thanks.

415
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,040
Sam?

416
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,730
Oh,and,sam?

417
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,450
Yes?

418
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,620
That's the last time you should ever turn your back on me.

419
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,040
Do you wanna go to dinner tonight?

420
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,960
Can'T.

421
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,830
Brushing the dogs' teeth.

422
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,470
You know what?You have really

423
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,820
 painted me into a corner here.

424
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,220
So I'm just gonna...

425
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,150
what are you doing?

426
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,100
Calendar up.

427
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,330
October 10th.

428
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,210
Church,preacher.

429
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,460
Let's pull the trigger on this one.

430
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,650
what are you doing?Get up!

431
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,210
No,no,no.I know it's not romantic enough.

432
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,350
I was gonna do it at night.

433
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,360
You don't get it.You're not proposing wrong.

434
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,590
I don't wanna get married.

435
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,030
I...

436
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,050
get it.

437
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,390
No problem.

438
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,350
No,no,that's not what I mean.I...

439
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,040
it's not that I don't wanna get married.

440
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,860
I-I do.

441
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:09,400
I'm just afraid that marriage can't live up to the way I've always pictured it.

442
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,440
It's the same reason that every christmas I leave one package unopened.

443
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,280
You know,when it's still wrapped and under the tree,it can be--be anything.

444
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,890
The fantasy of what it could be is always better than...

445
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,280
opening up to find socks.

446
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:35,470
For the record,dvd player,a,uh,bicycle-- those are really great gifts.

447
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,990
But...

448
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,230
just remember...

449
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,950
if you ever get cold...

450
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,730
you're gonna want that pair of socks.

451
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,500
Thanks for being patient.

452
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,150
Yeah,sure.

453
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,960
I just need to marry someone in october,'cause I don't know how to delete this.

454
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,410
they say opposites attract.

455
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,400
I wish it were that simple.

456
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,970
Dena gave me these scottie dog magnets.

457
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,910
Aligned correctly,they come together.

458
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,930
Pointed the wrong way,no matter how hard they try...

459
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,130
I know,howard.

460
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,790
I'm sorry.

461
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,560
I know.Just--just one more day.

462
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,440
I am--I am absolutely swamped with work.

463
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,520
Okay,I love you,too.

464
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,270
They push farther and farther apart.

465
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,900
That's what everyone's trying to do,isn't it?

466
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,910
Find that scottie dog and come together?

467
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,270
clicK.

468
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,870
are you ready?

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,080
Yeah.

470
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,330
I think I am.

471
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,990
Let me just get my coat.

472
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,190
sam?Heo?

473
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,650
Sorry I'm late.I-I got hung up.

474
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,890
Did I catch you in your knickers?

475
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,630
Hello?

476
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,590
Are we being cheeky then?

477
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,760
Come 'round the corner,luv.

478
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,840
Sam,are you there?

479
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,490
am I too late?

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
