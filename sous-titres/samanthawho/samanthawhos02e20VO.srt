1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,250
I guess a lot of girls have this princess fantasy, 

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,880
living in luxury, totally pampered.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,630
I'm trying to understand it.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,210
In fact, I'm trying really hard.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,450
there--there's no plastc wrap on the glasses 

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,100
and--and no paper on the toilet seats.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,090
Rich people don't care what they catch.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,120
I know.I better get used to this.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,540
After I'm married tomorrow, I'll have to learn to become self-indulgent and demanding.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,640
I'm tired of this song now.Change the cd!

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,200
andrea, stop.I can change the cd myself...

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,840
if someone can carry me over there.Could you-- 

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,860
you're gonna have to learn not to do things for yourself 

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,550
once you and winston funkare a power couple.

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,830
A power couple?

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,360
We just started seeing each other.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,590
You know, and I was actually thinking of not bringing him to the wedding.

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,830
No, you have to bring him.I need famous people there.

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,280
Matthew mcconaughey-- he just dropped out because I told him he had to wear a shirt. 

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,590
But that's the thing.The--the wedding's gonna be on the news and tv, 

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,470
and if I bring funk, people will see--people far away.

22
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,730
People in london.

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,080
Like todd.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,020
No, I was actually thinkinG...prince harry might be upset.

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,270
yes, todd.

26
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,180
Todd is not gonna be happy abouthis at all.

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,010
Oh, you had no choice.Todd is in london, funk is here.

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,250
Here versus there.Here's always better.

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,130
Not if you're talking about a bear.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,870
I thought you'd want mr.Snowball.

31
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,210
Chase, i was gonna try to go one night without--thank you.

32
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,660
But you have to go, 'cause we're about to start the bachelorette games.

33
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,320
Really?Like pillow fights, a little bath play?

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,190
Yeah, you just missed the tickle party.

35
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,990
Really?no, you're joking, rht?Are you?

36
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,160
Yes.

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,240
I want to play "how well do you know the bride?

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,690
" You know, I figure between sam's amnesia and anea's blackouts, I'm a lock.

39
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,180
Wait, what?Amnesia?

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,130
What do you mean, "amnesia"?

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,890
I told you that, right?

42
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,190
When sam said she was in rehab, she'd really been in a car accident and lost her memory...

43
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,040
no?Didn't I tell you that?

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,550
She worked for me for an entire year.

45
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,410
She was our best performer, and she had no idea what she was doing?

46
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,590
Amnesia?

47
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,440
Oh, no, tickle party!

48
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,970
I-- 

49
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,120
my lord.Howard!

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,160
You were only on the road for nine days.

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,310
how did you make such a mess?

52
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,430
I was exploring america.

53
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,160
You think lewis and clark tidied up?

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,040
What are these?

55
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,310
Almonds.

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,880
Those are my almonds.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,780
"Lightly salted"?

58
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,710
Since when do you lightly salt anything?

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,140
Okay.

60
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,060
I picked up a hitchhiker.

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,200
Oh, my god, a hitchhiker?Howard!

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,390
I knew you were gonna react like this.

63
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,690
R-relax.It was just a young woman.

64
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,760
You--you picked up a woman?

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,100
I was never in any danger.

66
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,980
I mean, she was just a little thing.She was half your size.

67
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,850
Okay, time for party games.

68
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,890
I know.Let's play "hide the bridesmaid." Go!

69
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,470
No!

70
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,510
this one's hysterical.

71
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,630
Whatever she says when she opens it is what she's gonna say on her wedding night.

72
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,870
here.

73
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,800
I don't think that works if the groom is gay.

74
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,680
All right, I'm pulling it.Nothing's happening.

75
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,690
Although I could be wrong.

76
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,120
just think.This could be our lives if you were dating funk.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,480
We wouldn't have to think or feel.Just absorb...like amoebas.

78
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,050
I don't know if it's me.

79
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,920
Do you know that he doesn't have any keys?

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,620
I mean, he has a driver and a valet and a butler.

81
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,240
The man does not own a key.

82
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,830
He owns a florida key.

83
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,270
All right, we got the chocolate mousse for two...

84
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,560
lemon water for one and a little something special for the bride-to-be, care of me.

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,400
it's funk!

86
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,040
"Enjoyour honeymoon on exclusive, private san madre island in the grenadines.

87
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,680
" we tried that.It was booked.

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,880
I know.That's why I bought it and declared myself king.

89
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,100
Feel free to bring a guest of choice, who is free to bring a guest of...choice.

90
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,640
What, I'm supposed to be impressed that you have an island?

91
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,860
'Cause you know what?There's probably, like, at least ten people who have islands, so...

92
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,790
after the wedding, you'll be whisked to the airport on my private helicopter 

93
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,010
where you will board my private jet to san madre island.

94
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,100
Please phone ahead if you want the kosher meals.

95
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,250
- you want kosher.
- So then...

96
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,960
good night.

97
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,440
- Do it.
- What?I don't-- 

98
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,800
excuse me, sir.

99
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,560
Yeah.

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,060
If your boss will let you off work tomorrow, you maybe want to go to a wedding?

101
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,230
Why, yes, prime minister, it was a lovely ceremony.

102
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,320
It was so good of you to come.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,750
Drummer from u2-- yes, I agree that it's a shame that bono didn't show-- hello?

104
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,430
Todd!

105
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,410
Hi.

106
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,420
nothing.

107
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,930
Listen, I was gonna call you.

108
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,060
Um, there's something that I need to say.

109
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,900
hey, me, too.

110
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,450
I'm back to take you to the wedding.

111
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,050
What wedding?

115
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,440
Shoot!Darn it!See, this is why you don't sneak up on people!

116
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,420
Oh, and, hey, it's really good to see you, by the way.

117
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,450
Are you sure?

118
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,360
Yes!

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,300
Just having a crazy couple of days here, and you know when would be good?

120
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,440
Two weeks from now.

121
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
What's going on, sam?

122
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,440
Nothing.I just wish you would've told me you were coming 

123
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,210
so I could've saved you a spot.

124
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,590
Is that goat cheese?

125
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,520
It's the--the same color.

126
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
It's gonna be like spackle.

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
And--and--and what do you mean, "my spot"?

128
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,170
Are you going with someone else?

129
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,660
Someone else?No.I mean, no, there's--

130
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,650
there are tons of people coming.

131
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,600
Just like andrea-- well, obviously-- and, um, tony and his boyfriend, 

132
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,250
uh, dena, maybe andrea's mom, and some guy from work.

133
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,050
Funk?

134
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,940
I think that's his name.

135
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,810
I knew it.

136
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,250
Look, I was gonna call you when I got off the phone with the drummer from u2.

137
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,570
Fine.Whatever.

138
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,300
You know, I-I'm glad I came back.

139
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,870
I needed to get all my stuff, anyway.

140
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,890
And off to london you go.

141
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,600
And, of course, why not?

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,650
That's what you do.

143
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,040
You don't want me here.

144
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,280
Now you don't want me to leave?

145
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,390
Well, you wouldn't have to leave if you had never left.

146
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,770
I got a job.You said I should go.

147
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,880
And then you went.

148
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,220
Look, you know what?Forget it.We're just out of sync.

149
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,870
You know?We are relentlessly out of sync.

150
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,210
It's like, when you are in my bed, you should be on the couch, 

151
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,880
and when you're on the couch,you should be in my bed, 

152
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,930
and when you should be in africa, you're in chicago, 

153
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,120
and when you should be in chicago, you're in london!

154
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,660
Yeah, yeah, well, I can beat that.

155
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,750
First, you were mean as a snake, then you were in a coma, 

156
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,240
then you didn't remember me, then you thought you wanted me, 

157
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,560
then you thought you didn't want me.

158
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,430
The best time we ever had together was when you were in a coma!

159
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,960
You know what?Maybe you should go.

160
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,270
Here, let me help you take some stuff down.

161
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,010
Never anything I can use.

162
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,580
You need any more help?No?Okay, bye!

163
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,750
Yeah, well, it's been a nice trip.

164
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,340
14 hours in coach, but totally worth it for this paperback!

165
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,560
bells are ringing for one happy couple today 

166
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,000
as basketball superstar tony dane marries andrea belladonna in a celebrity-filled ceremony in the windy city.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,650
With the president in town and traffic gridlocked, 

168
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,640
will they get to the church on time?

169
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,370
"Superstar weddings" is there.

170
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,170
I found these in the R.V.What are they?

171
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,950
I don't know.

172
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,510
They're pictures of you at civil war battlefields...

173
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,200
on four different days...

174
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,280
taken by your little hitchhiker, I assume, 

175
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,040
because no way do you know how to use the self-timer on your camera.

176
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,740
Well, jenny was interested.I mean, she majored in history.

177
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,550
Oh, you know her name?

178
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,620
What, are you writing her centerfold bio?

179
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,180
She has a name, she goes to college, she likes almonds, 

180
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,420
and her turn-ons are old men in R.V.S.

181
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,100
I swear, reginA.

182
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,600
Nothing happened.

183
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,790
Something did happen, howard.

184
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,710
You--you shared your life with someone.

185
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,180
Well, you didn't want to go!

186
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,060
I don't care!That's not your life to share!That belongs to me.

187
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,730
O-okay.I get it.

188
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,650
This is still your life-- our life.

189
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,820
Come here.

190
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,390
is that a tattoo?

191
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,700
I don't know.

192
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,100
chase.

193
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,060
Chase, I-- 

194
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,570
uh, I have to be at the church.Why aren't you ready for the wedding?

195
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,780
I was up all night.

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,350
I saw the sun rise.

197
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,000
has has it always had all those colors?I...

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,860
and what else have I missed righunderneath my nose?

199
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,820
I know you're upset about sam's amnesia.

200
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,520
I mean, she did the job with no information at all.

201
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,920
What does that say about the job?

202
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,680
Or about my job?does anything really matter?

203
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,820
Do we exist?

204
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,870
Are we--I mean, is anything really real?

205
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,900
Come on, dena.It is time for us to get away together, okay?

206
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,680
It is time for us to go away.

207
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,170
You need to come with me so we can find out what is really real.

208
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,150
- No.
- Yes.

209
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,280
I can't just go, you know?I can't just leave.

210
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,170
I-I still have a season of "lost" recorded.

211
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,380
I-I don't know how to stop my newspaper.

212
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,390
I-I have dogs.

213
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,050
Oh, do you have dogs?

214
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,570
Or do they have you?

215
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,010
Okay, this...

216
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,500
is why sleep is so important.

217
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,490
Chase, my life is very real.

218
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,560
Now get dressed, 'cause i have to help my friend that hates me marry a gay man.

219
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,660
What?He's gay?

220
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,130
As we count down to the belladonna-dane ceremony, we'll have exclusive footage...

221
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,390
mom!What?Mom, what are you talking about?

222
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,670
you have to be here!

223
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,750
I know that traffic is jammed up, but we'll wait.

224
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,840
No, we cannot hold the start.We have time booked on the satellite.

225
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,580
- Who are you?
- I'm with the network.

226
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,510
We've prepared for this.We have alternate parents on hold.

227
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,680
You choose.We like this guy.He was on "veronica mars.

228
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,210
" We hare a lot of that same audience, so they'll dig it.

229
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,390
Okay, let's break down here instead of at the church!

230
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,670
This is the guy who set us up right here.

231
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,500
I don't know why I did that.I really wanted her for myself.

232
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,480
this guy here is crazy.

233
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,110
I'm serious.Don't marry her.I really wanted her.

234
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,990
hey, honey, I'm sorry I'm late!

235
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,570
Todd showed up.Surprise.

236
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,400
Okay, besides your toast to me, let that be the most you say today.

237
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,050
Okay, look, take this engagement ring and don't give it back to me 

238
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,140
until my wedding ring is on my finger, okay?

239
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,260
How's my dress?

240
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,470
Um, it's fine.It's fine.

241
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,530
Little baby goats might follow you, but that'll be cute.

242
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,090
- Go get dressed.Go, go, go.
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

243
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,400
our cameras also caught the bride in conversation with her friend, 

244
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,020
the unattached billionaire winston funk.

245
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,680
you're a friend of samantha's, aren't you?

246
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,360
Did she mention something about maybe seeing her ex-boyfriend again or-- I don't know.

247
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,140
I guess that's a good thing, right?

248
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,860
- Funk, who has himself been recently linked with andrea's maid of honor...
- what was that?

249
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,930
Excuse me.Excuse mE.Where's--is-- where's the rest of the tape?

250
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,400
I need to see it.Is it in here?Is it in here?Come on, move, move, move!

251
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,480
what, is he, like, a struggling artist or something like that?

252
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,240
He's a photographer.Local stuff.Nothing special, you know.

253
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,510
Not like magazines or anything.

254
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,480
Well, maybe he'll get s big break one day.

255
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,110
He sent him away.

256
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,420
He sent todd away so he could be with me.

257
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,370
Well?

258
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,050
It's all fake.

259
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,670
It's a setup.

260
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,730
God, how could I be so stupid to think that it was real?

261
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,240
Okay, if that's supposed to be your toast to me, then you should keep working on it.

262
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,380
Sam, our car is here.We should go.

263
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,680
No, why don't you go?

264
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,520
I just founda really good episode of "top cook" here.

265
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,530
You want a french fry?

266
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,590
here.You want some more?

267
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,320
Something has transpired.

268
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,400
You sent todd away!

269
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,190
Yes, I did.

270
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,750
Yes!You did!

271
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,820
And you're busted.

272
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,290
Why don't you seem busted?

273
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,910
For what--loving you?

274
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,670
Loving?Love?Are you-- what?No!

275
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,130
All right, what did I do?

276
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,430
What did I do, really?

277
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,200
I offered todd a job, okay?That's it.

278
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,390
What am I--the devil?

279
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,170
I-I can't compel people to do things they don't want to do.

280
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,890
Look, I didn't get to where I am without being able to spot a winner, 

281
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,720
sam, and you are like that tire factory I bought in india.

282
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,140
When the--I, ooh, I--that is not a romantic statement, and I see that right now.

283
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,690
Look.Come on now.Todd wanted a job.

284
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,460
I want you, and I want to spend every day of my life just...

285
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,860
giving you everything you ever wanted.

286
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,170
If you like that sort of thing.

287
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,370
You know what I want?

288
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,330
What?

289
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,570
I want to blow off this wedding and get the hell out of here.

290
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,900
And if I don't do it now, I'm never gonndo iT.

291
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,880
So let's go.Come on.Let's go.

292
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,360
All right, next time you come back to convince a girl that you want her, 

293
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,320
don't bring a round-trip ticket.

294
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,610
Not sexy.

295
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,240
Good advice.

296
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,910
This coming from the guy who set up the love of his life with her husband.

297
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,000
In retrospect, it was a flawed strategy.

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,390
The wedding will take place at the local church where tony was baptized as a child 

299
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,180
and where the aunt ethel who raised him is still the organist.

300
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,510
Man, we suck.

301
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,690
Yeah.

302
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,060
I thought it was gonna be like "an officer and a gentleman," you know?

303
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,640
Come on, you know, the end, when--when richard gere comes into the factory, 

304
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,500
scoops up debra winger and then just carries her right out.

305
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,050
Doesn't even let her punch out.

306
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,260
He's not even sure if she has personal time coming.

307
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,320
He doesn't care.

308
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,170
well, then what?

309
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,000
Well, then the movie's over.

310
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,480
seth...

311
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,860
the movie's not over.

312
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,980
Andrea belladonna in a celebrity-filled ceremony...

313
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,270
you may see me on the news.

314
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,070
A tattoo?

315
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,170
It's a butterfly, and I like it.

316
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,500
Oh, me, too.You know, I always wanted hepatitis, 

317
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,020
but now I can just get it from you.

318
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,240
Look, I-I-I was sitting next to this woman at a bar, 

319
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,600
and she had these beautiful, beautiful portraits of all of her dead boyfriends up and down both arms.

320
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,700
They're called "sleeves.

321
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,820
" You were at a bar?

322
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,350
One night, I was staying at samantha's-- 

323
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,240
you went into the city alone?

324
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,880
Yes, howard, yes!

325
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,250
While you and miss hitchhiker of the mth were traipsing through battlefields, 

326
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,910
I went into the city!

327
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,090
And you know what else?

328
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,260
I had sushi!

329
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,620
You did not!

330
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,810
As raw as can be!

331
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,400
Hepatitis and parasitic worms-- that's what you get in the city.

332
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,330
Howard, I don't want to live in an R.V.

333
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,240
I'm sorry.

334
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,630
Should've told you that from the start.

335
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,730
We're young.

336
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,090
I don't want battlefields and cemeteries and final resting places.

337
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,810
I'm not ready to rest.

338
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,770
I'm too excited about our future.

339
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,800
But that's what i want to do in the future.

340
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,080
I want to look at the past.

341
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,360
Not me.I'm just starting.

342
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,960
I'm a butterfly.

343
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,630
They have a life span of six days!

344
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,540
andrea, it's sam.

345
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,730
Where are you?Why aren't you here?

346
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,550
hey, andrea, I'm in a helicopter!

347
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,090
So, listen!

348
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,440
Honey, I can't come to your wedding.I'm really sorry.It'S...

349
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,980
I finally figured out what it is that I want, and I just can't miss this chance.

350
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,390
I hope you'll understand.

351
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,550
Listen, I can't hear you, so i'm just gonna pause for your response.

352
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,000
No!I cannot do this without you.

353
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,930
Now get back here before I kill you!

354
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,320
Thank you so much for understanding!Bye!

355
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,660
Andrea belladonna, I'd like you to meet your mom and dad.

356
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,770
The network wanted diversity.

357
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,820
okay, this is happening.Let's get the bride in the chute.

358
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,630
You, go!Come on, move it.

359
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,790
Wait!Wait, wait, those aren't my parents, 

360
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,560
and my maid of honor isn't even here.

361
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,620
What is this?

362
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,760
You'll be fine.

363
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,740
You know, when I worked on "veronica mars," 

364
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,480
I was scared to death, but I'm here for you, andrea.

365
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,240
It's ahn-drea..."dad.

366
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,180
***

367
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,730
You're gonna love my island.Guess who's on the $5 bill?

368
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,340
You wouldn't--honey!

369
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,000
We, uh, my plane is that way.

370
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,430
Oh, yeah, I know, but I just remembered that you suck.

371
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,420
But thank you for the ride to the airport, 

372
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,160
'cause I never would've been able to catch todd without it.

373
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,420
Uh, sam, wh-what are you doing?

374
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,960
What?Do you feel manipulated, used?

375
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,410
It's gotta be rough, huh?

376
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,410
Because I am not your puppet in your little puppet theater show, ay?

377
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,860
You don't get to control my fatetino.

378
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,200
Your fate.Okay, fate-- there's no such thing as fate, sweetheart, all right?

379
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,490
Fate is what happens to people who have no power.

380
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,310
Well, I do have the power.

381
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,030
I have the power to walk away.

382
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,610
Check it out.

383
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,050
See you at work on monday!

384
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,350
I need to get my bag.They said I have to ask you.

385
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,960
This bag has been checked to london.

386
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,510
I know, but I'm not going to london.

387
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,880
Then why did you check it to london?

388
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,490
Well, because my girlfriend-- ex-girlfriend-- um, it doesn't matter.Forget it.

389
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,400
You know, I'll-- I'll let the bag go alone.

390
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,570
I'll--I'll just get it later.

391
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,010
So you checked a bag which you have no intention of accompanying?

392
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,800
That's right.

393
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,380
- Security to baggage services.
- security copies.

394
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,010
Excuse me.

395
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,210
Hi, yeah, um, I guess I need to buy a ticket.

396
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,630
Okay, where to?

397
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,860
Uh, it doesn't matter.

398
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,710
Well, there's a flight to hong kong that departs in 20 minutes.

399
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,490
Perfect.Perfect.One, please.

400
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,060
I'm afraid that flight's sold out.

401
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,290
Me--I think you'd enjoy shanghai.

402
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,110
My college friends and i went there, and it was just-- 

403
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,050
I don't care, all right?I just need a one-way ticket.

404
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,250
I have no bags to check.

405
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,410
It doesn't matter to where, because I'm not gonna end up there, anyway.

406
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,260
one sec.

407
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,850
Security to ticketing, please.

408
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,330
No, no, no, whacome on!

409
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,230
It'll be a minute until a room opens up.

410
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,970
You might want to take this time to relax.

411
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,480
Please, please, please, let me stop him!

412
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,190
Look, I know how this is gonna go down.I do.

413
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,600
He's gonna get on that plane, and--and he's gonna meet some flight attendant 

414
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,280
who--whose husband just died or something, 

415
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,790
and then they're gonna talk, and she's gonna open up about her pain, 

416
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,680
and by the time sharing a ether.

417
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,290
Look, we cannot keep doing this!

418
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,380
I know, it's confusing.

419
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,200
But you know what?People are confusing.

420
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,250
That's what makes them real.

421
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,700
And I don't care if we're in sync...

422
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,660
as long as we're out of sync together.

423
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,770
shut up and tell him that.

424
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,910
Todd!

425
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,090
Hey, no contact!

426
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,690
Wait.I have something for you.

427
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,510
Me, too.

428
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,120
Sir, mnh-mnh.

429
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,090
But, dude, come on!

430
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,260
All right, fine, fine.

431
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,800
O-open it for me.

432
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,920
Go on.There, there.Can I have that?

433
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,990
- Aw, man...
- thanks.

434
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,050
Will you marry me?

435
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,170
there's another kind of fairy tale-- one built on star-crossed lovers 

436
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,520
who fight against the evil empire,

437
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,860
 who find each other against all odds.

438
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,190
No one can ever knowabout this.

439
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,990
Got it?

440
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,200
Got it.

441
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,610
Now shut up and spoon me.

442
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,570
so where to?

443
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,570
I've got 5 million frequent-flier miles and two years of french.

444
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,420
We're free.Nothing to tie us down.

445
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,280
Ooh, you hear that?We're free.You boys like your freedom yes, you do.

446
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,270
Time for somebody's pill, huh?

447
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,940
Hey, frank!Guess what?

448
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,410
We're getting married.

449
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,960
Well, I wish you luck.

450
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,610
Aw, thanks, frank.

451
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,150
what?What are you doing?

452
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,500
wait.Hold on.Hold on.I have to get my keys.

453
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,430
he has keys.

454
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,480
lots and lots and lots of luck.

455
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,300
That last one--now that's my kind of fairy tale, 

456
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,660
where true love trumps all, and they live happily ever after.

457
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,540
Mom!

458
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,100
I've left your father.

459
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,200
Now it's nothing you did.

460
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,130
We both love you just the same.

461
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,090
We're just gonna live in different places.

462
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,380
I'm gonna live here.

463
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,360
does everything have to be so brown?

464
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,820
Let's get some color in here!
