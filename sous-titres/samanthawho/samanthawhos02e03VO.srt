1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,650
Time traval, it's sounds so excited ???

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,400
but in a way,we travelha 
through time every day.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,240
a childhood memory can 
instantly pull you into the past.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,050
a wish can send you zooming into the future.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,930
what's actually hard is to stay
 planted in the present,

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,860
to be here,in the now.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,470
i want to go home now.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,450
calm down. you're fine.

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,970
mom,a brain doctor does not call

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,350
and say that he has to see you

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,280
unless there is something seriously wrong,okay?

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,640
you're not dying. you're not even warm.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,520
if i slip into a coma again,do 
not unplug anything,okay?

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,690
not a machine,not a radio. nothing.

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,250
oh. there's my favorite patient.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,660
- hi. 
- i bet your earyo n burning.

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,680
huh? um,yeah,they kinda-- 
they have,uh,maybe,sort of.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,080
- is that bad?
- oh,no,no,no.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,090
it just means people have 
been talking about you.

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,680
okay,now the reason i called you here...

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,120
uh,it's strange not having our
 weekly appointments,isn't it?

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,330
- they were like little dates for me. 
- doctor,please,do you mind?

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,830
- i can't stand this. is she dying or not? 
- oh,no,no,no,no,no,no.

24
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,090
no,no. we want her to be 
part of a clinical trial. hmm?

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,550
we are close to getting 
f.d.a. approval for a new drug

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,950
that will help people with 
various forms of memory loss.

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,950
oh! oh,wow. that--that's it?

28
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,410
wow. i mean,you know,you could 
have just le jhat on the machine.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,670
oh,he did. i forgot.

Samantha Who S2 ep03

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,270
see,this is the side of the brain

34
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,080
where the memory is.

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,960
it's a--it's--it's a very-- it's a 
very exclusive study,

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,880
because apparently,

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,800
i am one of very few
 high-functioning amnesiacs

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,240
in the entire country.

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,510
said the girl wearing black 
shoes and brown pants.

40
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,700
okay. you know what? sometimes 
einstein left the house naked.

41
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,450
how much are you getting paid for this anyway?

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,670
there's a guy in texas who got paid 25 grand

43
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,440
to have his foot cut off and reattached.

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,480
ooh,i'd do that for $13,500.

45
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,280
it's not about money,guys,
i just want to help people,

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,170
you know,and i want to
 know that i helped people,

47
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,530
and i kind of want people 
to know that i helped people.

48
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,280
oh,did i mention that they might
 call it the "newly report"?

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
so what's it feel like?

50
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,520
well,it feels like nothing right now

51
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,420
'cause i only took the pill about an hour ago.

52
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,030
maybe you're the placebo.

53
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,970
no. no,i don't want to be the placebo.

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,510
you're not supposed to 
remember anything that they--

55
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,450
aah! jeez.

56
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,780
what are you crying about?
 you scared the crap out of me.

57
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,220
nope. not the placebo.

58
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,320
you just had one. what 
was it? was it about me?

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,800
no. no. it--it was just,uh,

60
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,490
it was about kids and balloons 
and stuff. it was really nice.

61
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,330
oh,dr. andy wants me to write this stuff down.

62
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,680
- free notebook. score. 
- yeah.

63
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,070
- um,sam?
- yeah?

64
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,190
the guy we hate is parked over there.

65
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,040
oh,well. i'm sure this guy 
did something wrong.

66
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,350
oh. okeydoke.

67
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,280
these are coming on a little strong,

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,320
so i think i'm gonna 
just go lay down for a little.

69
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,810
- okay. well,feel better. 
- thanks. bye,you guys.

70
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,670
oh,that poor bird.

71
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,010
well,hello there.

72
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,770
hello,yourself.

73
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,960
and who do you belong to?

74
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,310
- they're mine. they belong to me. 
- they're mine.

75
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,710
they're mine,mine,mine,mine,mine. i love them.

76
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,320
lucky dogs. you have two 
mommies fighting over you.

77
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,430
ah!

78
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,350
he thinks we're a couple.

79
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,210
- that's so funny.
- that's not funny,

80
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,640
it's a little funny,yeah.

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,730
maybe you should be mom,
and i-i should be mommy.

82
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,860
i don't want to confuse them.

83
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,830
hey,frank.

84
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,750
miss newly.

85
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,400
morning,ma'am. i'm frank,the new doorman.

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,310
i just want to say what a
 pleasure it is to meet you.

87
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,340
shh. okay,here's what i need.

88
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,620
hold the door for me,hail my cabs,

89
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,470
and i don't like guys who send flowers,

90
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,910
so you can just throw those about.

91
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,120
you do all that,hank,and you might keep your job.

92
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,080
yes,miss newly.

93
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,380
i'm sorry,frank.

94
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,130
what's wrong?y.

95
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,430
nothing. oh,i lucked out.

96
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,830
i got to be part of this,um,this 
study for memory recovery.

97
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,710
- you have crazy eyes. is that part of the study? 
- i don't know. i'm not a scientist,so...

98
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,310
will you be okay alone?

99
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,620
because i was gonna head 
out and look at an apartment.

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,520
what? oh. what happened
 to the one from yesterday?

101
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,590
- it had a view. 
- well,it also had a smell.

102
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,100
it turns out there was a goat's 
head in the refrigerator.

103
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,990
- plus,somebody beat me to it,so... 
- well,i hope you get this one.

104
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,930
i mean,for you.

105
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,640
i mean,i know it's been really
 weird living here,you know,

106
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,970
for you and me.

107
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,010
for us.

108
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,990
mostly for you.

109
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,930
and me.

110
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,470
- i'll let you know. 
- okay.

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,180
good-bye.

112
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,240
good-bye.

113
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,860
almost there.

114
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,890
almost there.

115
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,140
okay. almost there.

116
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,320
almost there.

117
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,260
mommy,can i come home tonight?

118
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,020
well,what time is your dinner party over?

119
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,000
and for youself ,???

120
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,110
you got your notebook and your...

121
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,980
your pills.

122
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,330
- thank you. 
- and a wave machine.

123
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,410
i got this for your father on his last birthday,

124
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,310
but it made him have to tinkle all night.

125
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,790
i'm sorry i'm being such a baby about this.

126
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,830
it's just that these memories 
are so vivid,you know?

127
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,310
like stepping off the curb,

128
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,350
and i was crying for some reason,

129
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,340
and these brakes--oh!

130
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,880
and i was wearing this very bright green jacket.

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,930
i know. it's probably a blessing in disguise.

132
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,150
that jacket never looked good on you.

133
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,200
anyway,um,maybe i'm just--

134
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,370
i'm--i'm--i'm skimming the bad
 ones off the top,you know,

135
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,540
so i can get down to the good ones,

136
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,640
kind of like that skin that 
forms on the top of pudding,

137
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,500
you know,and underneath there's just--

138
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,270
there's just chocolaty goodness.

139
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,940
ah,there are memories i'd love to have back,

140
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,110
like that summer before i had you.

141
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,800
yeah,thanks.

142
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,060
mom!

143
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,600
i had a great body that summer.

144
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,260
fine. but you know what?

145
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,150
don't come crying to me when,yoknow,

146
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,910
- y-you come crying to me,okay? 
- all right,all right.all right,all right. fine.

147
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,200
good night. sleep tight.

148
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,940
the pill's working already.

149
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,510
i just remembered-- todd called,

150
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,310
and he said that he's got a new apartment.

151
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,670
really? he found an apartment? wow.

152
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,710
that's what you wanted,right?

153
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,160
yeah. yeah. no,it's just that he did it.

154
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,790
it's just... so not todd.

155
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,100
- oh,cute. 
- well,you look nice.

156
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,410
thanks. do you have anyplace special in mind?

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,570
um,yeah,actually.

158
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,900
there's this cute place off i-90 west.

159
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,880
i-90?

160
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
wait. so our first date is really

161
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,090
me giving you a ride to the airport?

162
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,560
we have three hours. you're 
lucky there's fog in new york.

163
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,140
what are you doing?

164
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,940
there must be men who actually 
put up with this stuff,

165
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,030
or you wouldn't even try. good night.

166
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,210
don't be a jerk.

167
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,650
you know what? your not 
giving a girl a ride to the airport

168
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,400
says something about your manners.

169
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,340
can you believe that todd guy hasn't called me?

170
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,820
i mean,who is he to not call me?

171
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,860
- i mean,i'm the one who doesn't call him.

172
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,160
- no,you're right. you're right. i'm done. 
- wanna go to the bar?

173
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,550

174
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,020
i was just rejected by a guy 
whose windows zipper.

175
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,340
well,that guy over there owns a jet,
two buildings and three senators.

176
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,880
i mean,i practically apologized 
to him,and he ignores me?

177
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,060
oh,nuh-unh. no. no,no,no,no.

178
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,030

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,600
hello,todd.

180
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,210
- you. 
- mm-hmm.

181
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,160
i thought i was hired to
 photograph a kids' party.

182
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,380
well,what was i supposed to do?

183
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,190
you wouldn't return my phone calls.

184
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,130
oh,man. i should have gotten it

185
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,290
when i saw it was this building.

186
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,470
you're... "mrs. butterworth"?

187
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,220
yeah,well,i don't know anybody named "missus."

188
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,550
and so what?

189
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,030
you can take pictures of me
 now,naked or whatever.

190
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,650
i'm very cooperative.

191
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,120
- wow. 
- what?

192
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,290
well,you went to a lot of 
trouble to get me here.

193
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,590
- you're really into me. 
- shut up.

194
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,450
you are. why don't you put on some clothes,

195
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,830
and we'll go get some food?

196
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,530
i mean,unless you've never
 done it in that order before.

197
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,120
jerk.

198
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,660
just let me put on some jeans.

199
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,550
ooh,bad night?

200
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,120
ugh. awful.

201
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,040
just all night long,just more
 bad things that i did.

202
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,050
bad,bad,bad,then i had to get up to pee,

203
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,760
and more bad and bad,pee,
turned off that wave machine

204
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,750
and just bad.

205
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,230
- montpelier.
- i'm sorry?

206
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,820
capital of vermont. i can never remember that one.

207
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,280
these pills are great.

208
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,290
oh,yeah. they're like a party in my head.

209
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,560
u know what it does to me 
when you wear that skirt.

210
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,870
she's kidding.

211
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,220
stop it. why are you doing this?

212
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,130
because you actually hate that 
people think you're gay.it's too fun.

213
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,710
i don't care if someone thinks i'm gay.

214
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,420
i re if they think i'm with you.

215
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,460
- no offense.
- in what world is that no offense?

216
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,230
i'm just saying,if i were gay,i 
would be with someone else.

217
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,540
like who? i haven't thought about it.

218
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,010
- like,for instance? 
- i don't know. carol in payroll.

219
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,770
oh! not in a million years

220
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,050
could you get hot lesbian carol from payroll.

221
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,670
hey,i can get anyone i want.

222
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,300
i am the hottest lesbian that's not 
a lesbian in the entire world.

223
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,420
i don't know how much longer i can do this,mom.

224
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,450
i want to help people and all,but i just--

225
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,960
- i feel like such a loser. 
- sweetie,listen to me.

226
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,170
listen. i saw this article...

227
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,600
oh,lord. that was five years ago.

228
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
i'm a genius!

229
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,340
- anyway... 
- mm-hmm.

230
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,470
about how the mind protects us

231
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,380
and only allows us to recall 
as much as we can handle.

232
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,150
so if you're remembering really 
bad things about yourself,

233
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,410
just imagine how truly awful

234
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,130
the things you're not remembering are.

235
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,050
yeah. i'm all better.

236
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,990
thanks. that's great.

237
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,270
hello?

238
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,580
samantha? oh,it's nic to hear your voice.

239
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,650
how did you,uh,do last night?

240
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,870
actually,doctor,i had a really rough time.

241
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,910
um,these--these pills are really somethin'.

242
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,880
aren't they?

243
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,420
why don't you go ahead and throw those away?

244
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,330
- just toss 'em. 
- uh,well,if you're sure...

245
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,350
the drug company is suspending the trial. it's...

246
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,850
it's no biggie,just--just a few people

247
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,470
reporting some tiny side effects.

248
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,220
oh,gosh. yoknow,i just feel terrible.

249
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,610
i mean,i guess i'm just gonna have

250
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,800
to do good for people some other time.

251
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,470
i feel terrible,too.

252
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,470
maybe we could,uh,make our own memory?

253
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,860
yeah. okay. bye.

254
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,680
bye.

255
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,940
what was that?

256
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,340
no,no,no. what was that? 
oh,no. that was a good one.

257
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,460
that was a good one. i 
need another pill. oh,no!

258
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,190
I just need one more pill. 
you gotta hook me up,doc.

259
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,510
- samantha,there are no more pills. 
- don't tell me that,man!

260
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,310
i need a slam. i need a bang. i need a pop.

261
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,180
uh-huh. i think you might be making up slang.

262
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,700
i just need one more,okay?

263
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,630
i-i-i started to get pieces of 
this really,really cool memory

264
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,900
about--of--of... oh,no. shoot.

265
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,860
- of us? was it us? 
- no. damn it! what's going on?

266
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,790
- am i losing my memories now?
- no. that's a funny story.

267
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,690
yes. you are,but only the new memories--

268
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,400
the ones that were brought on by the drug.

269
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,670
so all these new memories that i'm having

270
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,210
are just gonna be gone,like,forever?

271
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,450
as soon as the drug leaves your system,yes. oh.

272
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,320
but if there's any changes
 in the trial,i will call you.

273
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,080
in fact,i-i'd like to call you anyway.

274
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,610
yeah,but it was something 
really important,though,

275
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,740
and i-i need to know what.

276
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,270
come here. come here.

277
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,530

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,230

283
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,970
ugh. my god,you are such a girl. here.

287
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,350
i hate you.

288
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,540

289
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,970
todd? yay!

290
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,100

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,500

oh,my god. why don't you just 
stamp "property of todd"on my ass?

314
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,660
or better yet,why don't you go ahead
 and absorb me like an evil twin?

315
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,260
what?

316
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,000

326
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,450

 me away because you're scared.

327

okay. oh,god. oh,my god.

339
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,900
it was me! i was the scaredy-cat.

340
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,030
and now i'm pushing him away again?

341
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,410
oh,my god. i have to stop him.

342
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,560
what is this,tangerine? it's nice.

343
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,160

344
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,640
thanks. okay.

345
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,270
Hey,Todd,it's me ,pick up,pick up

346
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,490
listen,i'm on my way back to the apartment.

347
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,110
i remember the proposal,so please don't go.

348
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,240
we really have to talk. proposal. proposal.

349
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,120
okay. proposal. proposal. proposal. proposal.

350
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,970
do not talk to me,frank. proposal.

351
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,340
always my first choice.

352
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,300
i-i tried. i did everything i 
could,and it's not enough.

353
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,750
you do not get to choose when we break up.

354
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,090
i just did.

355
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,100
yeah,i just cut it all off.

356
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,400
todd loved my hair long.

357
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,570
that'll teach him.

358
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,490
- oh,hey. hey. listen--
- did your mom tell you i found a place?

359
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,150
- as soon as they process the application,i'm in.
- shh. shh. listen to me,okay?

360
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,540
it's not big. it's a little dark,

361
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,090
but there's zero goat heads,

362
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,670
- and i'm feeling pretty good about that. 
- listen. listen. we need to talk.

363
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,790
i-i justeed you to know
 that i am so sorry that i...

364
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,320
that i what?

365
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,000
oh. oh. it's here. it's here.

366
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,140
um,i'm--i'm,uh,for the pro--prof--

367
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,090
p... p...

368
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,040
um,pro-- it--it--it smeared.

369
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,040
pom--pomnip--uh,does 
that-- any of that ring a bell?

370
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,750
you know what? hold on. there's a message.

371
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,120
hey,todd. it's me. pick up. pick up.

372
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,600
listen,i'm on my way--

373
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,340
well,you're here now. what was it?

374
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,280
- i don't know. it's gone.
- well,i'm sure it'll come back.

375
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,990
no. it won't.

376
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,180
maybe it was nothing.

377
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,390
oh,hi.

378
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,890
just reading a little didion,like usual.

379
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,460
there's nothing like a "'poignant and 
trenchant look "at marriage in the 21st century,'

380
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,210
says the new york--" me.

381
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,880
why are you stalking me?

382
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,840
- what? i-i'm--i'm not.
- i know that you keep calling me and hanging up.

383
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,720
your extension shows up on my phone.

384
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,730
it does?

385
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,520
i call everyone in the office just to say hi.

386
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,860
okay,why don't you like me?

387
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,110
excuse me?

388
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,660
kiss me. kiss me. just do it.

389
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,840
okay,that's it.

390
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,700
you just bought yourself a 
sit-down with human resources.

391
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,660
no. ooh. ooh. wait. wait,carol,okay?

392
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,040
you know,just go easy on her,okay?

393
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,320
she's not right. i think we 
both--we both know that.

394
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,260
you know what i mean?

395
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,770
for you.

396
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,850
okay.

397
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,260
why is she not attracted to me?

398
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,060
i think she's stupid. i hate her.

399
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,240
well,maybe she's not into looks.

400
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,520
you know,maybe-- maybe she dislikes you...

401
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,010
for who you are.

402
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,070
you think?

403
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,230
andrea,life has a way of evening things out,

404
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,540
and pretty on the outside

405
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,040
usually doesn't get to be pretty on the inside,

406
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,220
and,andrea,you are very... very...

407
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,940
pretty on the outside.

408
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,180
thank you.

409
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,120
i just checked my voice mail.

410
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,640
i was turned down for the apartment.

411
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,170
it was a done deal.

412
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,610
it was my place--a crappy
 place--but it was mine.

413
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,040
you know,um...

414
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,740
you could always just stay here.

415
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,540
excuse me?

416
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,040
well,you know,until you--
 you find exactly what you want.

417
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,300
okay...

418
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,400
when did we ever worry about what i wanted?

419
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,490
i know. i know. i--it just--
 i-i can't explain it entirely,

420
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,480
i just know,that looking over these notes,

421
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,210
everything ends with a "bad to todd,"

422
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,410
or "apologize to todd" or "buy todd a new bird."

423
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,610
that was you.

424
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,690
i just think i would feel a lot better

425
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,110
if i could just make it up to you.

426
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,990
so i'd be doing you a favor?

427
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,010
if you wouldn't mind.

428
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,250
- no rent then? 
- a favor,not a charity.

429
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,650
but as just... friends,right?

430
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,100
yeah,of course. just as-- 
just as... friends,you know?

431
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,640
or not friends if you don't want to do that.

432
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,230
we could,you know,just be roommates.

433
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,290
no,no,no. friends would be nice.

434
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,600
you know,because i'll probably 
slide on the rent a few times,

435
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,950
and my roommate might not understand.

436
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,540
navigating through memories can be quite a trip.

437
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,780
and maybe it's true,

438
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,730
maybe the mind,like any smart traveler,

439
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,140
does know where it's safe 
to go and where it's not.

440
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,280
at least,until the time is right.

441
