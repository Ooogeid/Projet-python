00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,720
one of the nice things 
about having best friends

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,360
is that they are with you 
through the good times and bad.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,110
it means you can kind of check 
in with them to see how you're doing.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,580
tonight i can tell that it 
was one of the good times

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,490
and that i'm the only one who's sober.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,430
no! no! boo! oh,no! boo!

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,950
shh. listen,be quiet. there is 
a police car behind us,okay?

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,950
i hate that feeling i get in 
my stomach when i see cops.

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,620
i know. it's like,"why you 
gotta be rolling up on me,5-0?"

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,790
right? oh. everyone gets that feeling. 
you didn't even do anything,

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,840
and then you start to think,
"oh. i think i did something. "

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,230
yeah,but you guys know 
that you didn't do anything.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,400
i might have done something.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,610
i st don't remember if i did anything. ugh.

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,790
no,just relax. ten and two. 
ten and two. ten and two.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,210

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,930

Samantha Who S2 ep05

21
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,770
they're gonna send me 
to prison. you pulled over

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,440
after one block. how bad could it be?

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,590
i don't know. i don't know.

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,310
i mean,i-i-i might have a 
record or-or-or an alias.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,340
i might not even be the person 
that i don't remember that i am

26
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,110
that probably would have come 
up when they revoked your license.

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,340
i'm gonna get shanked.

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,620
okay,you know what you should do?

29
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,170
call your brain doctor and 
see if he'll write you a note.

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,400
i'll starve in prison.

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,210
i saw this mie once where steve 
mcqueen actually had to eat a spider.

32
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,330
it was a centipede.

33
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,890
well,in that case,yummy.

34
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,190
why don't you just find a lawyer,

35
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,360
see if he can reduce the charges?

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,970
andrea's doing it right now.

37
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,430
w- you-you really want 
andrea handling this?

38
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,020
she's on it,todd.

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,840
why are you getting tense with me?

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,510
no,i'm not getting tense 
with you,okay? i'm just tense.

41
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,550
so instead of sitting here,

42
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,570
telling me all the things 
i should be doing,

43
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,230
can we just take a few seconds to 
talk about how much this sucks?

44
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,530
okay. yes,this sucks

45
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,660
i know.

46
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,750
so you know what you should do?

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,880
- todd! 
- what?

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,400
i don't know why you bring up a 
problem if you don't want a solution.

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,260
ma you don't understand me at all.

50
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,990
you don't understand me at all.

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,550
i am not getting on that plane,todd.

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,820
but you're the one that wanted to 
wake up in the morning and see paris.

53
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,210
you seriously thought that i was gonna 
go to europe on a flight with a layover?

54
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,610
i wanted to see paris,todd.

55
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,740
i didn't want to see paris d houston.

56
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,270
disposal's broken. should i fix it

57
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,350
or just tell it how much that sucks?

58
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,740
i'm sorry about paris.

59
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,280
we didn't wake up to see paris.

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,450
oh,that's okay. it was more
 your wish than mine.

61
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,990
you know,it's a shame that,uh,

62
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,370
you're in the remembering
phase of our relationship,

63
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,050
because i'm more in the 
"trying to forget" phase.

64
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,180
oh. okay,well,then while you're at that,

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,890
maybe you can try and forget

66
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,570
that i put artichoke 
leaves down the disposal.

67
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,460
so... what is it? what's the verdict?

68
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,130
it's not good. oh,my god.
i'm eating centipedes.

69
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,560
i got your file.

70
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,150
okay,a few drunk and disorderlies.

71
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,480
you punched out an ex-boyfriend.

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,150
you stole a christmas tree from a house.

73
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,170
okay,well,come on. 
come on. what did i get?

74
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,030
i tried my best. i am so sorry.

75
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,540
so that's it? jail?

76
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,640

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,430
community service.

79
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,600

picking up trash by the 
ghway for a hundred hours-

82
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,050

83
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,030

00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,860

i didn't sign up for this part of it.

111
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,680
no offense. i-i think there's 
some sort of mix-up.

112
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,050
i just kind of thought 
it was gonna be,like,

113
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,130
nonstop making a difference,
but someone won't let me.

114
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,890

shoplifting,punched someone at a wedding,

119
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,660
and,uh,there was a little mix-up

120
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,720
over using someone else's identity.

121
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,420
apparently,if i don't get my act together,

122
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,090
next stop is jail.

123
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,940

131
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,750
i- i'm sorry,

132
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,560

so then i told my manager,"you 
know,i'm not cleaning that up,"

137
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,270
and he's all like,"fine. 
you're fired," and i was like,

138
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,210
"fine,and you're sleeping alone tonight. "

139
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,170

147
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,860

about saving the whole world?

148
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,490
no,no,no,no. i'm not.

149
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,650
i just figure if i save one person

150
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,330
oh,my god. why n't you 
just become a nun?

151
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,670
and then aleast i can 
laugh your funny outfits.

152
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,990
look,she deserves a chance,okay?

153
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,880
i got one,and all i want 
to do is just pay it forward.

154
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,200
you hated that movie. you 
threw your flask at the screen.

155
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,650
all right,she says she doesn't have a job,

156
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,320
so i'm figuring,why don't 
we just help her get a job

157
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,980
so she has a sense of accomplishment?

158
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,160

these drinks?i need to cash out.

160
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,710
how's that little project going there for you?

161
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,070
you know,it's easy to help 
someone who doesn't need help.

162
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,990
this just proves that i have chosen well.

163
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,390

164
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,960

for my friend natalie.

171
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,080
and,uh,if i wanted my 
job back,you'd give it to me.

172
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,800
- really?
- mm-hmm.

173
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,340
so what kind of job 
does this natalie want?

174
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,540
and f. y. i.,if you came back,
you have to take a pay cut.

175
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,240
entry level,and you'd 
give me a raise,if anything.

176
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,410
well,we can try in the mailroom.

177
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,870
i'd offer you 5% top that's it.

178
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,810
mailroom's great,and 
i'd get 10% or nothing.

179
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,200
all right,i'll meet her,and you're hired.

180
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,490
- thanks,and i quit. 
- good meeting.

181
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,970
i think it's rude that we 
just drop in on samantha.

182
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,100
we should have called first.

183
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,810
well,then it wouldn't be a surprise.

184
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,440
you want to ruin her fun?

185
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,070
oh. hi,guys.

186
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,350
hey,todd. sorry we didn't call. 
that's why this is so much fun.

187
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,030
sam's not here. uh,i was just fixing the sink.

188
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,310
oh! could i help?

189
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,560
i thought we came into the 
city to shop for ethnic spices.

190
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,030
- todd?
- well...

191
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,930
sorry,regina. the boy needs my help.

192
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,700

193
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,030
hey,natalie. hi. come here.

194
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,270

- you have a job interview.

195
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,440
dena. dena. i had a whole speech.

196
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,450
sorry. it's just really exciting.

197
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,800
yeah,well,now it's ruined.

198
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,800
well,wait. a job interview? for real?

199
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,490
yeah. yeahfor real. don't cry.

200
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,360
i'm not.

201
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,630
oh,okay.

202
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,580
but now you're making me feel really weird
about stealing from you guys last night.

203
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,660
oh! now you're gonna make me cry.

204
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,630
really sorry.

205
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,870
we're still light 5 bucks.

206
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,580
i had to take the bus,all right?

207
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,640
see,look at that. you're changing already.

208
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,230
i'm sorry. it's just,um,no one ever 
really does this stuff for me.

209
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,160
i mean,they say they will,but i don't know.

210
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,580
they usually bail by now.

211
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,360
maybe it's 'cause you steal from them.

212
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,120
i promise you,i am not 
gonna bail on you,okay?

213
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,770
now let's talk about your interview today.

214
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,590
what do you-what do you think you're gonna wear?

215
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,030
this got me the job at the taco stand.

216
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,980
we'll swing by a store.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,160
what'd you do to this thing?

218
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,510
well,i unhooked it,took it apart,
stared at it,then you showed up.

219
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,380
well,the are better ways to impress 
samantha than destroying her kitchen.

220
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,360
oh,impress sam? no. no,no,no,no,no.

221
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,560
we're not together anymore.

222
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,930
well,that's too bad. i was 
rooting for you two.

223
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,040
- really? 
- yeah.

224
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,530
thks,you know,but that ship 
sailed a long time ago.

225
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,740
well,the world is not flat. 
ships come right back around.

226
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,980
no,we're just friends.

227
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,450
if you were just friends,

228
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,470
you wouldn't be saying you were just friends.

229
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,740
you know,i got a friend named larry,

230
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,340
but i never say that larry and i are just friends.

231
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,980
i think it's great she wanted to
pick out her own interview clothes.

232
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,850
yeah. yeah,

233
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,040
she's-she's showing initiative.

234
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,580
she didn't even want us to go in with her.

235
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,780
she insisted we not go in.

236
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,270
that we wait at the curb.

237
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,910
so,uh,did she ever say

238
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,430
why she got community service anyway?

239
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,460
oh,just various things.

240
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,070
punched a bride...

241
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,680
robbed a store...

242
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,180
shoplifted.

243
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,730
she's stealing.

244
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,760
yep. we're the getaway car.

245
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,750
what a you doing.no.

246
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,450
getting o- getting out of here.

247
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,410
i don't want to be the getaway car.

248
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,150
okay,listen. just-can we 
just hang on for a second?

249
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,800
we don't have any proof,

250
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,470
so let's just,you know,just think about it.

251
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,260
okay,she used to rob stores.

252
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,300
she's in a store,robbing it.

253
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,110
if she was robbing it,
she'd be out already,okay?

254
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,920
you're in,you pistol 
whip the clerk,you're out.

255
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,600
- i don't want to throw my life away over your project. 
- well,you know what?

256
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,310
- i don't want to be like everybody else in helife..
- i have a perfect driving rerd.

257
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,200
- and bail on her because i promised her
- i don't want to-

258
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,080
all right,I's go.

259
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,260
"let's go," like we have to get 
out of here as quickly as possible,

260
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,840
like we might be chased?

261
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,730
no,"let's go," like we have 
an interview to get to

262
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,810
in half an hour,so let's go to it,all right?

263
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,170
so what'd you snag,um,buy,uh...

264
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,170
what did you purchase?

265
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,360
this. i don't know. does 
it make me look old?

266
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,390
oh,that's nice. yeah,where's the bag?

267
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,790
when buy things,they put them in bags.

268
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,150
haven't you ever bought shoes

269
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,740
and just worn them out of the store,huh?

270
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,230
but she wasn't wearing the jacket.

271
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,740
well,maybe she didn't want to wrinkle it.

272
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,480
no,so she stuffed it in her backpack.

273
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,710
she was just trying to be 
environmentally conscious,okay?

274
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,490
- trying to reduce her carbon 
- okay,why don't you have a bag?

275
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,380
can you pull over,please?

276
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,130
- huh? 
- now! do it.

277
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,670
wh? oh,god. god. okay,take the car.

278
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,700
you know,we-we 
haven't seen your face.

279
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,450
nalie,natalie,what are you doing?

280
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,370
you guys think i stole this stuff. i'm out.

281
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,720
no,i do not think that you stole it.

282
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,010
we just kind of thought you 
accidentally took it a little,

283
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,870
just without paying for it.

284
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,600
okay,well,then why do i have a receipt?

285
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,580
look at it. you know you want to.

286
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,250
okay,i knew this was gonna happen,okay?

287
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,720
this is why my life is so messed up,

288
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,380
because people make 
up their minds about me,

289
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,970
but no matter what i do,they always bail.

290
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,690
no,i'm not bailing. i'm not bailing.

291
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,700
i- i-i had a moment of doubt,
yes,but you know what?

292
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,580
it's like a bone that breaks.

293
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,250
when it heals,it heals a lot 
stronger than it was before.

294
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,370
not if you break it the right 
way. then it stays broken.

295
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,990
oh,okay.

296
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,470
good to know.

297
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,550
i'm sorry.

298
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,570
right now i really am.

299
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,290
come here.

300
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,900
come here.

301
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,550
let's get you to that interview,all right?

302
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,520
come on.

303
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,040
- dena.
- no.

304
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,630
dena,unlock the doors.

305
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,460
unh-unh.

306
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,110
sometimes sam just drives me crazy.

307
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,960
like the other day,she comes
 in,all upset about this thing,

308
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,920
and i'm trying to give her advice,
and she started yelling at me.

309
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,560
and i'm sorry. i can't keep 
talking to your feet.

310
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,940
okay,we're all done.

311
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,050
well,thanks for doing this.

312
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,340
sure. my advice? don't 
try to fix her again.

313
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,040
i know. next time i'll call a plumber.

314
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,480
no,i'm talking about samantha.

315
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,760
a woman is not a sink. you try to fix them,

316
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,600
and they hear th they need 
fixing? you're done,pal.

317
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,190
no,all you gotta do is listen,
nod occasionallynd say...

318
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,820
"i'm sorry you feel that way"...

319
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,780
and you're good to go.

320
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,040
so you're doing something 
without doing anything.

321
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,130
it sounds like a trick.

322
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,790
no,the trick is to show 
them that you're listening.

323
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,280
yeah,it's a- it's a gesture.

324
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,330
it like when regina and i were dating.

325
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,710
she said that she wanted a ferrari someday,

326
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,220
so i listened,i nodded,and i went out

327
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,120
and i bought her a toy 
car,a little matchbox deal.

328
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,950
i said it was just until i 
got her the real thing.

329
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,280
35 years,and i'm still waiting.

330
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,410
r hey. didn't hear you knock.

331
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,960
i had key made while i was out.

332
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,630
samantha keeps forgetting to give me one.

333
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,170
did you have fun?

334
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,600
no,it was awful. i went
to four different stores.

335
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
they were all out of saffron.

336
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,770
so buy some on the internet.

337
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,720
i don't want to buy it on the internet.

listen to me.

414
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,850
what you do now is up to you,

415
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,520
but what you cannot do ever again

416
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,320
is use the excuse that everyone
 is always bailing on you.

417
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,660
now go.

418
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,440

429
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,890

431
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,900

if i don't take both of them,

433
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,220
do you have to put one of them down?

434
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,420
did you come here to
bail us out or to gloat?

435
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,490
i think i just answered that question.

436
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,270
andrea,please let me out.
i really have to go.

437
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,380

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,680
ooh. okay. okay. i'll jusdo it.

441
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,160

442
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,640
no,no,no,no,no,no.

443
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,270
no,i'm not a loser?

444
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,480
no,i mean i'm not going to listen to this.

445
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,460
i posted bail. i've done my part.

446
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,950
i codn't even change one tiny person.

447
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,640
no,not that tiny person. she 
didn't want to be changed.

448
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,600
look at me. i've tried to 
change you for an entire year.

449
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,980
you're just not cooperating.

450
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,800
maybe i should have just run her or.

451
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,850
you know,it's not too late. 
do you have your car here?

452
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,940
enough with the car.

453
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,220
this magic car that 
suddenly changed your life-

454
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,150
did that car help you quit your job?

455
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,210
no.

456
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,780
did it move you out of 
your parents' house?

457
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,660
no.

458
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,640
did it run that 5k for heart disease?

459
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,350
you still owe me 50 bucks for that.

460
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,530
oh,my gosh.

461
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,780
every single day since you 
woke up from that coma,

462
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,010
i have to hear about how hard 
it is to make these choices.

463
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,260
and now you're gonna say it's 
all because of some car.

464
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,750
you should market that thing.

465
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,840
the good-mobile?

466
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,080
there you go.

467
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,580
you're right. i do work hard.

468
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,200
it's really,really hard being this good.

469
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,920
no kidding. it's exhausting 
just watching you.

470
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,090
come on.

471
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,250
another great thing about my friends

472
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,080
are that they are patient.

473
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,190
they understand that i'm 
just learning things now

474
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,240
that i should have known a long time ago,

475
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,890
like how the only person you 
can really change is yourself.

476
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,130
see,the thing is,

477
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,220
if you're so busy worrying 
about other people

478
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,660
that you're t paying 
attention to your own life,

479
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,800
you might miss out on something 
really,really important.

480
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,500
that's why from now on,

481
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,290
i've got to keep my eyes 
on the road ahead of me,

482
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,500
stay focused on my own path.

483
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,570
it's not always easy,but it's worth it.

484
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,260
listen up,people.

485
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,190
if you happen to come across a body part,

486
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,310
don't forget to use your emergency while.

487
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,630
but i don'have to worry about anything

488
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,240
because no matter 
where that road takes me,

489
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,810
i know i'm gonna have my 
best friends right beside me...

490
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,990
keep movin'. not here to make 
friends. just doing my time.

491
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,790
even if they have to be by law.
