00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,830
what happens when you achieve your dream running a multi-million dollar charity foundation,

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,870
but you have no idea what to do?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,070
You're like a dog who chases cars and finally catches one.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,970
now what?

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,040
I guess you chew on the tire for a while until you figure it out.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,520
Tyler banks,your temp,but I can see this becoming permanent.

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,030
Oh,well,it's nice to meet you,tyler.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,470
And I-I didn't know what you liked,so I got you all of them.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,730
Oh,okay,thank you.

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,550
My,um,office?

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,380
Is this okay?

12
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,280
I see a bookshelf right there.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,130
It's okay.

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,750
I do the same thing every time I take over a company.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,890
Sorry,sam,this guy just walked right by me.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,470
He does not have an appointment.

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,350
Winston...

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,320
funk.

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,540
Name on the building.

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,210
Tyler banks-- name on the yogurt in the fridge.

21
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,600
tyler.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,690
So...

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,310
welcome to your company.

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,790
Sten,we have a lot to talk about.

25
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,810
How about scheduling something for,ooh,next week?

26
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,160
Okay,um,how about lunch on monday?

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,420
No,I meant all next week.

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,560
Jackson hole has 3 feet of powder.

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,560
Oh,you know,as tempting as that sounds,

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,000
I do have $30 million of your money burning a hole in my pocket,

31
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,700
and it ain't gonna spend itself.

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,800
Well,as long as you're giving all ofy money away,

33
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,780
we might as well give some of it to the ritz-carlton.

34
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,690
Oh,you go.

35
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,580
I need to find needy people.

36
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,890
I have needs.

37
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,620
You can pay people to take care of those.

38
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,490
Thought I had.

39
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,410
Now it's $40 million.

40
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,420
Keep talking.

41
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,910
Okay,sam,I get it.

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,820
You won.

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,690
You got the job.

44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,930
Now I need to get down to business and find our first charity.

45
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,890
Fantastic.

46
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,980
I mean,you're so eager.

47
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,670
Why don't we call a press conference for next friday?

48
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,820
I n't even need that much time.

49
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,660
How about this friday?

50
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,360
How about thursday?

51
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,080
How about wednesday?

52
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,900
Because today is wednesday.

53
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,240
How about thursday?

54
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm sorry.They just showed up.

55
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,840
it might be the free money.

56
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,130
I believe we said next friday,right?

60
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,210
come on,andrea.

61
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,490
Let me be in your wedding.

62
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,560
I mean,all the celebrities are gonna be there,

63
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,450
and--and I've never got to be a bridesmaid before.

64
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,150
I mean,the closesthing that I ever got was I was my mother's pallbearer.

65
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,010
Well,I would give it some thought,

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,240
but I have so many errands to run,and I just don't have time to think about it.

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,760
I'll do it.

68
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,880
I get it.I get it.

69
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,860
I'll do it.I'll do it.

70
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,700
Hey,I'm sorry.

71
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,940
Oh,where have you been?

72
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,210
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.

73
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,220
I know,I kn

74
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,380
I had a 5:00 with a land mine victim that ran over.

75
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,530
I told him I had to run.

76
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,840
I felt bad about that.

77
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,290
Then I apologized for blowing him off.

78
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,710
Yeah,that went well.

79
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,130
You want to hear a really sad story?

80
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,390
They discontinued the bridesmaid dresses that I wanted.

81
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,850
Here's what we're left with.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I couldn't possibly look at this-- oh,god.These are bad.

83
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,760
I kn

84
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,880
Well,it's the whole point-- to make you look like a clown,so I can shine.

85
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,570
Just not the corduroy.

86
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,730
Well,you will make a lovely southern belle.

87
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,610
It's endless,I'm telling you.

88
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,960
If I say yes to one charity,I'm just saying no to thousands of other ones.

89
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,380
It--it's like I'm responsible for the entire world.

90
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,960
I do not want to decide who lives or who dies.

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,730
You know,I'm not santa claus.

92
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,900
Oh,uh,remember,we talked about that?

93
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,240
It's this new you.

94
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,230
You're too soft to say no.

95
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,070
Yeah.

96
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,270
What I need is the old me to come help the new me with this job.

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,330
Yeah,and the closest thing you have to the old you is me.

98
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Oh,my god,you're right.

99
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:00,860
I hate disappointing the less fortunate,and you seem to get a thrill out of it.

100
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,350
Are you offering me a job?

101
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,440
Yes.

102
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,620
Oh,come on,please do it.

103
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,570
I'm really afraid.

104
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,950
I can't do this alone.

105
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,940
What does it pay?

106
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,510
I don't kn.I looked at the budget really quickly.

107
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,290
I-I think there's a seven in it.

108
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,890
I won't do it for anything less than a nine.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,310
I can do an eight,but that's it.

110
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,550
-Yeah.
-Yes!

111
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,480
Oh,thank you.

112
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,870
Um,about this hummingbird choir,you--you do know that they don't really hum?

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,260
I want birds,and I want "we've only just begun.

114
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,960
" You want to be a bridesmaid,figure it out.

115
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,040
Okay!

116
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,150
Hey,andrea--

117
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,130
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,340
I didn't know you were in a meeting.

119
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,040
No,no,no.

120
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,990
Come in,come in,come in.

121
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,170
Sam,meet philippe.

122
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,640
We've been going over his ideas all morning,

123
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,280
and we really need your opinion on this.

124
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,930
Great.Fire away.

125
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,100
what do you think?

126
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,660
He did J.Lo's first and third wedding.

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,410
I'm sorry,philippe.I reay need to talk to anea,

128
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,750
so if you'll just step out for a minute,that would be great.

129
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,970
Au revoir.

130
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,990
Andrea,honey,we have a press conference on friday.

131
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,310
Oh,my god.

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,950
Yeah,I know,that's what I'm saying.

133
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,580
Tony dane and I have a press conference in an hour.

134
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,150
Thank you so much for reminding me.

135
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,130
What?

136
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,510
You cannot go.

137
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,200
It is so good to work for a friend.

138
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,760
Chapman was such a slave driver.

139
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,190
I'll be back at 4:30.

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,840
Ooh,that's really not enough time to start anything.

141
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,310
Oh,we'll hit it hard tomorrow morning.

142
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,950
andrea!

143
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,700
Wha--andrea!

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,260
Hi,cheryl.

145
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm samantha newly.

146
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,140
Oh,okay,this isn't a proposal.It's A...resume.

147
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,890
Yes.

148
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,730
I saw your press announcement for the foundation,

149
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,210
and I was betting that you could use an in-house attorney.

150
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,480
Cheryl,I'm so sorry,but we have already filled that

151
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,840
-- oh,wow,you've--you've worked for a lot of foundations,huh?

152
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,640
And it looks like you have a lot of grant applicants out there already.

153
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,830
Oh,god.Yes,I am so overwhelmed.

154
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,480
I just-- ms. Newly,you really need to narrow your focus.

155
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,930
What is your mission statement?

156
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,640
My mission statement.

157
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,390
Um,well...

158
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,530
it is to boldly go where,

159
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,850
no man has gone-- yeah,okay,so I don't really know what a mission statement is.

160
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,940
What your foundation does and doesn't stand for.

161
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,800
Oh,good.

162
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,270
Evil...

163
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,500
in that order.

164
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,620
You'll find a lot of these guys are just hustlers trying to take advantage of the new kid.

165
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,660
The charity business is about knowing the players,and believe me,I know all of them.

166
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,030
And I can help you sort these out in a couple of days.

167
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,470
Do you have any questions for me?

168
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,080
Um,yeah,just a couple.

169
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,440
Are you getting married?

170
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,690
Never again.

171
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,720
And when can you start?

172
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,740
Hey,wt's going on?

173
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,620
What's going on is we need a new fridge.

174
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,410
Well,you don't throw something out every time it breaks.

175
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,530
If we did that,how would we play our 8-tracks?

176
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,380
I can fix this puppy.

177
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,840
Not this time.I made sure of that.

178
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,080
Hey,dad,you're a boss.

179
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,860
Have you ever had to fire a friend?

180
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,780
Howard,tell her.

181
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,590
You're not my friend.You're my wife.

182
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,190
It was when we were first married.

183
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,350
He was tryinto save money-- surprise,surprise.

184
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,780
Well,you're still married,so it must've gone okay,right?

185
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,160
I had to have security escort her from the building.

186
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,640
I lost two good men that day.

187
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,800
I have tyler.

188
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,050
I guess this would give him a chance to die for me.

189
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,130
Ah,I found it.

190
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,090
Look.

191
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,980
It looks like that wire's been cut.

192
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,420
Beavers.

193
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,320
I'll just tell andrea it's the economy.

194
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,910
You know,I'm downsizing.

195
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,610
She'll understand that,right?

196
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,750
I mean,it's like,if we were friends and I fired you-- you did...

197
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,290
from our relationship.

198
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,310
I was downsizing.

199
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,820
You see how much better that sounds?

200
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,840
do you still have thatook of shakespeare sonnets that I gave you for your birthday,

201
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,650
the one that you pretended to like?

202
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,750
Oh,I loved it.

203
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,640
Yes,it occupies a place of honor on,

204
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,320
over there somewhere.

205
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,150
Great.Now I'm going to go fire andrea.

206
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,540
Oh,have fun.Yeah.

207
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,880
Keep her in front of you.

208
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,550
-Yeah.
-Okay.

209
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,540
Just pitching some spec vows to andrea,you kn

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,000
Still not a bridesmaid,but it's a foot in the door,right?

211
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,510
Oh,here it is.

212
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,440
sorrY.

213
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,190
Oh,the ring.

214
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,080
Oh,are you--are you gonna propose to sam?

215
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,280
Can you keep a secret?

216
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,170
No.

217
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,920
Before the accident,I proposed to her.

218
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,800
But you can't tell her.

219
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,390
you know,um,are you gonna propose to sam again?

220
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,760
no,that's over.

221
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:47,700
I've been wanting to get a place of my own,so if I hock this,I can afford it.

222
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,190
No.No,no,no,no.

223
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,390
No,you're giving up too soon.

224
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,130
Oh,god.

225
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,560
I mn,haven't you pictured your lives,you know,growing old together?

226
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,430
Yeah,I did once.

227
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,330
Well,do it again!

228
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,310
Hey,hey,you know,they have computer software that'll,

229
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,950
you know,age you,and you can see what you-- you guys would look like,

230
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,300
or,hey,just t a mirror.

231
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,200

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,020
I love you,todd.

233
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,350
I love you,todd deepler!

234
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,200
Andrea,you may have noticed a downturn in the economy and

235
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,640
-- now you listen to me,lard ass...

236
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
I'm on the phone with chapman.

237
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,700
what?No!

238
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,600
No,no,no,no,no.

239
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,320
Don't do that.

240
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,470
No-- you can take your job and stick it somewhere the sun--hello?

241
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,500
What-- I needed it for my phone cord collection.

242
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,960
Stupid hobby.

243
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,760
Oh,god.

244
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,470
Um,wait right here.

245
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,140
I'll be right back.Just...

246
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,830
this completes my set,so...

247
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,900
hey,girlfriend,it's 8:00.

248
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,990
Didn't you,uh,get my e-mail about coming at 10:00,huh?

249
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,570
Oh,I'm sorry,that's my worst fault.

250
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,910
I'm the last one to leave,and I'm two hours early.

251
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,990
Who's that in my office?

252
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,580
Well,aren't you just miss nosey parker?

253
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,620
Maybe I have a surprise for you.

254
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,830
Now you're ruining it!

255
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,970
Who are you talking to?

256
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,670
The ceiling guy.

257
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,840
Where is he?

258
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,880
In the...ceiling?

259
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,920
Were you not listening?

260
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
Do I have to fire you for that?

261
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,620
What's going on?

262
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,830
Well,maybe I was gonna surprise you,andrea,but now you're ruining it.

263
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,390
Who's that?

264
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,520
I'm cheryl hainstock,vice president of legal affairs.

265
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,470
surprise.

266
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,250
It works a lot better when she jumps out of the cake.

267
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,000
I am so sorry.

268
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,080
It's just that cheryl is just so much better than you are.

269
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,310
Uh,that sounded bad.

270
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,640
It's not personal,okay?

271
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,110
It's just business.

272
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,890
But you know what?

273
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,770
In the business of friendship,you're still hired.

274
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,830
You know what?I get it.

275
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,730
I get it.Stop it.

276
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,100
-Come here,come here...
-What?

277
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,110
Oh,my god,thank you.

278
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,270
Thank you for making this so easy.

279
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,730
Wow,so...

280
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,670
well,are you just gonna go back to your old job,missy?

281
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,770
oh,yeah,you're gonna say to chapman,"I'm sorry.

282
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,590
My bad," and he's gonna be like,"you're in the doghouse,belladonna." and,you kn ..

283
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,510
yeah.

284
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,880
I'm not going anywhere.

285
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm sorry?

286
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,520
Oh,you see,I signed a contract.

287
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,600
So you can keep her,but I'm staying.

288
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,390
and do what?

289
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,360
Just--just act like nothing's changed?

290
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,940
Oh,no,one thing has changed.

291
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,490
You're not my maid of honor anymore.

292
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,010
It's not personal.

293
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,650
It's just business,missy.

294
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,940
Right.

295
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,160
No,I get it.

296
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,850
So where's my maid of honor?

297
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,590
I love this dress!

298
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,270
I mean,I don't really love,you know,this dress.

299
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,160
Who could?

300
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,210
But I love that I've been asked to wear it.

301
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,600
well,hi,y'all.

302
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,180
Oh,sam,I don't want any trouble.

303
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,580
What are you doing here?

304
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,010
Well,fiddle-dee-dee.

305
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,570
I'm here for my maid of honor fittin',sugar.

306
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,460
dena is my maid of honor now,honey pie.

307
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,350
see,she's wearing the hat.

308
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,720
She's wearing the maid of honor hat.

309
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,380
I am wearing the hat,sam.

310
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,110
yes,well,you asked me to byour maid of honor,and guess what?

311
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,820
I'm not going anywhere.

312
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,920
Now let's talk bridal shower.

313
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,200
I was thinking maybe some sloppes,some ribs or maybe a dancing bear.

314
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,970
You don't have to rassle it.

315
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,920
That's okay.That's dena's job n

316
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,070
I have to wrestle a bear?

317
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,460
What is the theme of this wedding?

318
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh,also,my maid of honor speech.

319
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh,no,no,no,no.

320
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,460
No one said I had to make a speech.

321
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,280
I was thinking about starting off with a dirty limerick...

322
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,180
in a wee irish brogue.

323
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,610
I can't--I can't tal in public.

324
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,640
I-I freeze up,and I swallow air.

325
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,310
I cannot believe you're doing this to me.

326
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,290
you started it.

327
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,550
You lured me into a job,and then you fired me.

328
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,220
You took advantage of our friendship.

329
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,030
I blew off a fake job to go and plan my wedding.

330
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,060
Big whoop.

331
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,080
A fake job?

332
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,400
You got hired to do a job that you know nothing about 

333
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,170
because the boss wants to get into your pants.

334
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,270
It's a joke.

335
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:04,960
Oh,yeah?

336
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,610
You want to know what a joke is?

337
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,730
Marrying a gay guy and thinking it's an actual wedding.

338
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,390
You know what?

339
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,800
It's so funny,people are laughing behind your back.

340
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,730
Oh,like they're laughing at you at chapman & funk?

341
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,250
I wouldn't know,because the laughing that they're laughing at you is drowning it out!

342
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,100
But possibly!

343
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,030
A joke!

344
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,210
I can start with a joke and use my little hand puppet,little dena,and,you know,'

345
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,860
cause she has the courage to say things I don'T.

346
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,200
Hell everyone.

347
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,060
Has,uh,that one been in yet?

348
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,780
She got a 9-1-1 text from an ice sculptor and flew outta here.

349
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,750
Oh,good.

350
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,630
Then we can get some work done.

351
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,150
Almost done already.

352
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,620
I divided the proposs into yeses,maybes and nos.

353
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,840
There's only one pile.

354
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,190
Those are the nos.

355
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,160
Well,why even do the maybes,then?

356
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm an optimist.

357
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,300
You rejected the red cross?

358
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,710
Showboaters.

359
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,110
"we're the red cross.

360
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,620
We save victims of war and disasters.

361
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:17,230
" Um,cheryl,I,uh,know we haven't quite pinned down the mission statement yet,

362
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,420
but the gist of it is we give money away.

363
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,670
And that's what they want-- handouts.

364
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,520
I could u a million dollars.Maybe I'll apply.

365
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,760
I worked my tailbone off for every penny I ever got.

366
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,910
Nobody ever gave me a free ride.

367
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,300
That's nuts.

368
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,920
Cheryl,have you noticed a downturn in the economy?

369
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,970
I'm not going anywhere.

370
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,900
I signed a contract,too.

371
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,770
Dad?

372
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,300
What?

373
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,330
Oh,it's you.I'm sorry.

374
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,830
Whole neighborhood's out.

375
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,510
Yeah,I saw that.

376
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,590
So what were the "beavers" trying to get this time?

377
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,520
One of those fancy washer/dryers that talk to each other.

378
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,930
All I did was yank a couple of wires,

379
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,680
and now mr. Mcclatchey's respirator is running off his car battery.

380
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,740
The abernathy kid picked the wrong day to bring the incubator chicks home from school.

381
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,550
The high school hockey game...

382
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,590
let's just say we've had a day.

383
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,280
You want some chardonnay?

384
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,750
It's warm,but it does the job.

385
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,210
Dad?

386
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,620
Hey,sweetie.

387
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,940
How's the boss?

388
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,060
I suck.

389
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,860
I have two lawyers.

390
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,570
I have a thousand applicants.

391
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,440
And I have 2 days to start giving away $30 million.

392
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,530
There's nothing but problems. 

393
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,750
Could you--could you hold that for a second?

394
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,910
Now that,that's a problem,okay?

395
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,120
What you have is a job,a job that you always wanted.

396
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,230
You just shocked me.

397
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,570
Well,so you stumble a little bit out of the gate.Who cares?

398
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,010
do you think I knew what I was doing when I started out?

399
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,250
I mean,it's not that I'm bad at it.It's just...

400
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,720
the truth is,dad,I don't deserve it.

401
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,570
Andrea's right.

402
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,720
It's just a joke job...

403
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,720
and the only reason I have it is because some billionaire wantto get into my pant-- ...

404
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,430
tomine club.

405
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,220
It's a very exclusive club.

406
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,640
Here's a secret.

407
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,550
Everyone is a fraud.

408
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,560
Nobody knows what they're doing.

409
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,370
I mean,do you think I have any idea how to fix this electrical panel?

410
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,500
But I am not letting your mother win.

411
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,080
That is not an option.

412
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,350
Okay.

413
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,050
I get it.

414
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,750
I just gotta do it.

415
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,920
It gets easier,though,doesn't it,daddy?

416
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,930
Boy,wouldn't that be great?

417
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,720
You know,for every problem you solve,you create three more.

418
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,220
You know,and then you-- you hire a staff.

419
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,420
And then the staff has kids.

420
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,100
Now they all want to take the afternoons off so that they can take their kids trick-or-treating.

421
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,760
I mean,since when did halloween become a holiday,huh?

422
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,250
Daddy.

423
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,210
But,hey,it's gonna be great for you,okay?

424
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,220
Okay.

425
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,100
For me,you know,I think I've had a good run.

426
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,450
What?

427
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,970
You're quitting?

428
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,080
Yeah.

429
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,310
Thanks for the talk,kiddo.

430
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,140
Hey,regina...

431
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,090
we have to talk about the rest of our lives.

432
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,960
What have you done to your father?

433
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,600
Good morning,tyler.

434
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,960
Will you grab all the proposals and bring them into my office?

435
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,720
And hold all my calls.

436
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,330
I love your sense of purpose.

437
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,620
And your...bouncy ringlets.

438
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,830
prenatal care would cost so little,

439
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,600
and the effect on infant mortality would be enormous.

440
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,030
it shouldn't be that easy to end up in the street.

441
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,330
It should be hard.

442
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:17,500
god asks us to save his children,not to prove we're virtuous,but to fill our hearts with joy.

443
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,030
What's this?

444
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,910
It's my resignation.

445
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,370
I was wrong.

446
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,670
You're not a joke.

447
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,980
You ever wonder why we're friends?

448
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,110
No.

449
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,570
Because the truth is,I have no idea what I'm doing.

450
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,400
And you were the only person who would tell me that.

451
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,860
And I think it's because you and I will tell each other the things that other people won'T.

452
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,030
Or should.

453
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,600
I mean,like you and your wedding.

454
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,560
Who else is gonna say to you,"andrea,stop.

455
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,180
What's up with the gay dude?

456
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,570
" No one.

457
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,630
But seriously,the guy is,like,super gay.

458
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,840
I kn

459
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,820
I kn

460
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,610
Okay,fine,look.

461
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:34,660
When I was 6,I would play dream wedding like every little girl would do.

462
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,620
And my cat would be the ring bearer.

463
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,010
And I'd wear this big dress,and--and I'd have a big pink cake,and there'd be birds.

464
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,200
And then when I got older,then I'd play divorce attorney.

465
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,840
And now the guys that I date-- I don't wanna marry them.

466
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,280
And if I did,I'd run off to vegas or a courthouse or something,but...

467
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,750
the little 6-year-old still wants that day.

468
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,190
You wanna take that dream away from a little girl?

469
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,430
Nope.

470
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,390
You know that the cats would eat the birds,right?

471
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,370
So what do you wanna do?

472
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,270
I want you and i to learn this job together.

473
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,040
And I want you to get rid of the crazy lady.

474
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,990
Done.

475
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,440
I already have a plan.

476
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,660
Do I want to hear it?

477
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,630
I don't kn

478
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,820
Can you lie to a grand jury?

479
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,160
Go.

480
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,370
With my amnesia,I can't dream about things I don't remember,so I dream about the future.

481
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,170
Some people don't even want to wake from their old dreams. 

482
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,000
Some just need to make new ones.

483
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,890
me--for now,I have my hands full just living this one...

484
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,010
hey,you.

485
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,880
Until the next one comes along.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
