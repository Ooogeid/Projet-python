1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,423
<i>They say you can't choose your family.</i>

2
00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:06,919
<i>Well, that's probably best...</i>

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,766
<i>if you could, the return policy would have to be really strict.</i>

4
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:11,484
Okay, what you think?

5
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:15,020
What don't you just... get yourself a dog you could dress up?

6
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:18,335
Put back if you don't like it. I'll give it for you for Christmas.

7
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:20,047
Thank you.

8
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:24,727
Oh my God.
Stop, what are you doing?

9
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:28,041
I like it! It hides the flaws in your bone structure.

10
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:30,529
Mother I was looking for a foundation.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,445
Not trying to join the witness relocation program.

12
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,185
Can you just try not to control like every aspect of my being.

13
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:39,576
I'm sorry, excuse me for caring.

14
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:42,308
Let's go look for some of those cute plastic clock.

15
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:44,744
Regina?
Amy.

16
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:46,579
I wasn't sure if it was you.

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,744
There it is. You still in Portland?

18
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:52,363
Still there. You still in Long Land Valley?

19
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,248
Well, bye.
Bye.

20
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:58,770
Bye Samantha.
Bye.

21
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:01,735
Who is that?
That's my sister.

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,835
Oh that's cute.

23
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,511
I have an aunt?

24
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:09,035
What do you mean you forgot?
It happens!

25
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,735
You forgot way more than I have.

26
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:13,775
Okay, you know what? I let it go when you forgot

27
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:17,622
that I was allergic to walnuts, 'cause you know,
it was nice to see everybody at the hospital again.

28
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:19,936
But you did not forget to tell me you had a sister.

29
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:22,203
Because she's a horrible person, you better off not knowing her.

30
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:25,926
Mom, listen... for the past year and a
half, I've been trying to put together

31
00:01:25,927 --> 00:01:30,270
this possible of who I am. And... an aunt is a pretty big piece!

32
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:34,297
When you were two years old, you ate a piece of my puzzle.

33
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:38,589
Victoria Falls, but I knew what Victoria Falls
looked like because it was a picture on a box.

34
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,023
I'm your box.
But this is my family.

35
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:43,767
Why do you not want me to know my family?

36
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:45,538
The same reason I don't want you to have a gun.

37
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,315
You might hurt yourself.

38
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,902
Okay, but...
You are not seeing her again.

39
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:51,713
The subject is closed.

40
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:54,224
This was a fun day, we should have start earlier.

41
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,689
Kisses.
Yeah but mom...

42
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,066
I said "kisses".
Okay.

43
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:01,343
See ya. I'm gonna go back to the city.

44
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:07,239
Aunt Amy.

45
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:10,850
Hi.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000

47
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,824
I win it.

48
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,066
Wow, who ordered the sea monster?

49
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,763
This is a deep sea delicacy I first had in Tokyo.

50
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:36,319
It's never on the menu but I always ask for it.

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,723
It honors the chef skills at removing the poison sac.

52
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:46,479
I don't know if it is the best month, but I am going to find out if they have live starfish

53
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:52,213
To our new mom!
I know! Isn't she fantastic?

54
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,216
She lived in Tokyo. The one in Japan.

55
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:58,479
It's like she's the mom I'm supposed to have you know.

56
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,050
And there was just some crazy mix-up at
the hospital and I ended up with Regina.

57
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:04,727
Who is very nice by the way. And I hope we'll keep in touch.

58
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:07,030
So how are you going to tell your fist mom about this?

59
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:11,163
Well, I am an adult, and I'm gonna do what adults do and...

60
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:13,377
I am going to keep it a secret!

61
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:16,485
So, please join me on pushing down my fears.

62
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:19,990
No, I'm going to see an other one of Tony's
games so I don't want to be puffy.

63
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:23,120
He doesn't care what you look like, he is gay.

64
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,604
He is so gay!
Yes, but

65
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,614
I may be on Jimbotron.

66
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:29,920
Wooh, the Jimbotron.

67
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:33,275
What is that? Like a robot, an elephant or something?

68
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:38,608
No, it's the big screen. And my seat is like 3 feet away from the court.

69
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,667
I don't even have to bring my own wine, in fact they told me to stop.

70
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:45,446
Hey we should watch, I've never
seen somebody I know on national TV.

71
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,713
Except for my high school boyfriend on the news.

72
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:50,236
After the police dug up his yard.

73
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,310
Sorry Sam's late.
It's ok.

74
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:08,071
... sits down with his four fouls. That's
two games in a row he just can't get going.

75
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:12,201
Oh God, there's Andrea. Oh Sam's missing it.

76
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,430
And those buh jeerings are for Tony Dane's girlfriend Andrea Belladonna

77
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:21,192
Guess the crowd decided she is a jinx on Tony's game

78
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:23,043
Why doesn't she leave?

79
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:25,326
Oh, she's got her outfit planned for the whole season.

80
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:26,944
She's not going anywhere.

81
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:31,529
She even, if they keep loosing, she'll keep going to the game.
Just to get on TV. 

82
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,930
Yeah.

83
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:35,893
Who are you calling?
A bookie.

84
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,211
Love how you decorated it.

85
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:44,806
Did you do this all by yourself?

86
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:46,864
I don't know, actually.

87
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:50,722
All I know, I killed the previous owner and I just moved right in.

88
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,754
See? This is nice.

89
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,844
This is an early Curbestin

90
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:00,302
He was a Dutch potter who settled in
Pennsylvania. I collect these myself.

91
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,113
Really? Take it.

92
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:03,958
Please.
What? No!

93
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,838
Sam, that's not why I...
Amy, seriously, I...

94
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,335
have no connection to anything in this house, so...

95
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,034
Well, except for this little African mask-y thing I named Dave.

96
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:15,218
You can't have Dave.
Thank you.

97
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:18,379
I should have complimented you and your flat screen TV.

98
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:25,109
Hello?
Miss Newly.

99
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,867
You requested I alert you if your mother enters the building.

100
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:30,462
Huh, yeah Frank. I was there when I told you.

101
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,730
Oh, she's here?!

102
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:36,184
Can you just... can you stall her for just a second?
Okay, thank you.

103
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:38,219
My mom's here. Stairs!

104
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,898
Regina, to see "The Great Escape" at a dinner cruise

105
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:43,695
is a one in a lifetime opportunity.

106
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,277
If we're late...
Samantha has not answered her phone all day.

107
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:49,800
What if she has been taking the pop stitch.
What if Todd finally snapped

108
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:53,086
I'm sorry folks, the elevator has been acting up.

109
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,942
The only way to keep it for getting stuck is to stop at every floor.

110
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:08,606
Oh mom! And dad! What a delightful surprise.

111
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,462
You haven't return my calls all day.

112
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,842
Oh, right, yeah. I... I was at the park.

113
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:17,442
And this darn squirrel took off with my cell phone.

114
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:19,408
What kind of squirrel.

115
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,379
I smell perfume.

116
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:24,542
Oh, that... that's... that's Todd's cologne.

117
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:26,857
He bathe in that stuff. It's just awful.

118
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,565
It's Amy's.
Todd is seeing Amy?

119
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:33,190
That's not okay, because he knows how I feel about her.

120
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:36,991
She's been here. You've been seeing her behind my back, I knew it!

121
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,242
You did not.
So, do you...

122
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,095
you wear the cloths I buy you when you go out with her?

123
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:44,578
Mom, please don't be ridiculous okay?

124
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,453
Amy is fun, she's cool.

125
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,665
And you know I'm sorry that you're so threatened by her

126
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,012
but I'm not gonna stop seeing her, 'cause
you know what, she lets me be who I am.

127
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,919
Where is the bowl?
What bowl?

128
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:58,486
The bowl!
The bowl.

129
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,496
Oh, no, no, Regina, not the bowl again.

130
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:04,147
I'm gonna be in the car, the movie boat leaves in 15 minutes.

131
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:07,576
The bowl that my mother passed on to me, that I passed on to you.

132
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:12,718
Oh, Amy complimented it, and I just...
You gave it to her?!

133
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:15,199
Yeah.
She always wanted that bowl.

134
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,073
She only became friends with you so that she could get the bowl.

135
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:23,272
Yeah right, and Dena is only friends with
me because, oh, she wants this clock.

136
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,843
I warned you.

137
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,426
But you wouldn't listen, so now I've lost a family heirloom.

138
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,014
Technically, it's still in the family.

139
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:32,007
I thought I was your family.

140
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,605
I guess not.

141
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:37,634
I will get the bowl back, okay?

142
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:41,405
But you know you're wrong about this.
Amy didn't know about the bowl.

143
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:47,808
Samantha, could you... bring the rolls to the table please?

144
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,227
Yeah.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,408
there might still be stuffing I prepared from recipes, see here I added...

146
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,742
The bowl.

147
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:03,745
You told me it was broken.

148
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:06,918
I was tired of you coming over here rummaging through my house looking for it

149
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,473
I wouldn't have to rummage if your house wasn't such a wreck.

150
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh I wanted to spend my energy taking care of my family

151
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:16,362
There we go again. You got a family I don't have one

152
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,211
When are you going to start throwing in my face...

153
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:21,694
You're so immature!

154
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:26,190
Why would you do this?
I'm meeting someone after dinner.

155
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:31,129
And it looks like dinner's over.

156
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,935
Oh, gosh.

157
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,686
I don't wanna hear it Dave.

158
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,165
I had two moms, now I have none.

159
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,077
I'm an orphan. Which is not bad.

160
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,824
No then you and I can go out and find other orphans

161
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:54,660
And create a supportive ragtag family.

162
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:58,378
Just call your mother and make up. She'll make you suffer for a while.

163
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,641
Then it will be over. Like a slumber party.

164
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:05,019
Yeah you're right. I'm gonna call her and apologize.

165
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:07,864
yeah, tell her she's right.
No, that is not an option.

166
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:12,760
If she knows that she was right, then she
is gonna be even more up in my business.

167
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:15,893
Maybe if she got her bowl back, that would fix it but,

168
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:18,185
there's no way that Amy is gonna give it up.

169
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,199
That's tough, that's a tough one.

170
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,250
What to do? What to do?
Dena!

171
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:29,360
Oh, pop corn?
The bowl!

172
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:31,987
Ok, somebody's hungry!
No!

173
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,033
This is the bowl!
What?

174
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,909
Yeah! Where did you get it?

175
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,694
Potteryville 9 bucks.
I need it.

176
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:40,218
My mom gets a bowl, Amy gets a bowl.

177
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:43,784
Everyone goes back to hating Amy, the order is restored.

178
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:48,400
Plus, if I pull this off, my mother never has to know she was right.

179
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,035
I have change if you all you got is a ten

180
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:53,934
Really?
Yes!

181
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,515
Tony can't miss a shot tonight

182
00:09:57,516 --> 00:09:59,534
Why did I bet $300 on a jinx?

183
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:03,192
You? I bet a thousand.
What?

184
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,322
I have a history of gambling.

185
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:07,963
I'm known to the thrill of betting a few hundreds

186
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:11,621
You've destroyed me.
What's the score?

187
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,108
Andrea. Oh no, no, no. Why aren't you at the game?

188
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:18,001
Cause I want to show everyone that I'm not a jinx.
Tony is just having a little cold streek

189
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:20,264
Not anymore he's not. He scored 20 in the first quarter,

190
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:22,205
and just bounced one in off the referee's head.

191
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,396
And I'm not there?
Now they are going to be sure that I am a jinx

192
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,417
Watch me save your thousand bucks.
Actually, it's 2 thousand.

193
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,008
Lying is also part of the addiction.

194
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,859
Andrea, Tony can't miss tonight.

195
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,102
Go! Get there while is hot. And all the credit will go to you.

196
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,836
Yes. Shoot. I want to but I can't.
Why not?

197
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:46,803
I've already wore these shoes to a game

198
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:50,058
Go by the house, pick up another pair.

199
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:52,864
It's so crazy, it just might work.

200
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:58,365
You're gonna get your 2 thousand back.
It was actually 5 thousand.

201
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,865
But making you believe it was 2 thousand was exhilarating.

202
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:14,650
Mom, I brought you something.

203
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,877
I got it back from Amy.

204
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:30,402
She just... gave it back?
Yeah... I mean no, when she remembered

205
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:33,740
that this was the bowl that you guys used to fight over,

206
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,311
she was horrified.

207
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:40,145
That it came between me and my mother.

208
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,098
Guess I owe you an apology.
No!

209
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:50,431
No, let's not dwell on how wrong you were.

210
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,034
You have the bowl and...

211
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,845
the less we speak of it to anyone the better.
Thanks.

212
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,544
Howard, I got the bowl back.

213
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:09,670
The bowl. Oh, Sammy, no you didn't
bring this bowl back into our house.

214
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:13,104
Daddy, it's ok, it's over, we don't have to talk about it anymore.
No.

215
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:16,876
What are you doing?
I'm going to my happy place.

216
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,200
It's a place where I go whenever your mother's family comes up.

217
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,854
Your happy place?
It's a lumber mill

218
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:23,823
in Oregon.

219
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:26,720
And I run it. I got 20 employees

220
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:30,003
'casionally we do a run of four by four and two by six

221
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:32,960
but really two by four is our bread and butter

222
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:36,676
That sounds nice. Can I work for you sometimes?

223
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:40,009
Wow, sure.
You know, I thought about it.

224
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,010
Amy really has been the bigger person in all this.

225
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:47,756
If she thinks she can show me up by returning this bowl

226
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:50,977
just watch me returning it right back in her face.

227
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:55,404
Ok. See you later mom.

228
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,432
What?! No! No, no, no, wait, no! Oh my...

229
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:07,823
What are you doing here?
I... completely forgot to tell you,

230
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:12,298
Amy left for Canada. Hum, I was gonna call you about it, but

231
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,226
that squirrel still has my phone. So let's...

232
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,103
Well, we meet again.
Hey, I just wanted to welcome you back from Canada.

233
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:23,773
So, see you. Let's go.
Can I have a minute?

234
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:32,060
Well, I just thought I'd drop by to tell you how
kind it was of you to give back on this bowl.

235
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:35,700
But I belive I am even kinder person because I am giving it back to you

236
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:38,502
Well, it was very kind but I already have mother's bowl.

237
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,715
The one your daughter's sneaking out with.

238
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,731
Mom, I'm pregnant. You were right.

239
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:49,962
Boys are only after one thing.
Samantha...

240
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,479
Sweetie, you gave me a fake!
So?

241
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:58,636
Look, they're completely identical. Look at this. Look, you know what?

242
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,572
I switch 'em up, everybody gets a bowl.

243
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:02,847
I dare you to tell them apart.

244
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,718
That one.
No, that's mine.

245
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,638
I changed my mind.
Enough. Stop it! Stop, give me that.

246
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:12,611
You are fighting to the death for a $9 bowl.

247
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:15,413
God, how did the women in this family get so screwed up?

248
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:19,722
What's all this noise? It sounds like you're trying to wake the dead.

249
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:22,356
Mother go back upstairs. I can handle it.

250
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,531
I have a grandmother?

251
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,203
Ah yes! Tony totally tanked.

252
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,001
That's $300 for me and $5000 for you.

253
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:36,057
Hey you know what? Let's go to Vegas.

254
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:37,974
Right now!
Nope.

255
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,685
I gotta buy my daughter a tree house,

256
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:41,898
and locate a good rehab facility.

257
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:43,868
But you have fun

258
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,599
What?

259
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,794
Tony, there was no such thing as a jinx.

260
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,579
You wanna know what I think? I confuse you.

261
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,187
You see me up in the stand, and you say

262
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:56,808
"oh, she's hot, I think I want her,

263
00:14:56,895 --> 00:15:00,777
maybe I'm not as gay as I thought I was."

264
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,212
Well, here's what I think. You're the only one who knows I'm gay.

265
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:08,808
So I when I'm looking at the stands and I see you, 
I see someone who can take everything away from me with a phone call

266
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:11,248
and that's why I can't play when you're around.

267
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:15,414
Well, that's very different from what I thought.

268
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,424
Wait, wait , wait. Tony, Tony, wait.

269
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,257
This is me. 6th grade.

270
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:29,551
That is a lot of facial hair.

271
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,935
Girls in gym threw chew toys at me.

272
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:36,302
It took years of painful electrolysis to become 
the stunning fox you see in front of you

273
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:40,094
Why do you keep this?
Because whenever I see someone less fortunate

274
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:45,436
I pull it out and I look at it and I realize
that I used to be less fortunate.

275
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:48,156
And then I don't have to feel sorry for them.

276
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:53,701
Look, no one knows about this. So you can keep it. I trust you.

277
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:58,082
Just like you can trust me.
I'm just asking,

278
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:02,386
can you grow this back? Two to three days

279
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:06,292
I have a grandmother. How long have you known about her?

280
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,450
Oh, I haven't seen you since you got yourself run over.

281
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:11,586
I guess your mother is ashamed of me.

282
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:16,060
I invited you to come and see her when she was in the coma.
Yes, it sounded like a lot of laughs

283
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:20,422
Hi nana. I'm sorry, I don't know what I'm supposed to call you.

284
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:23,036
Granny, or nounou... but, hi.

285
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,832
Hey back off jumbo. I got brittle bones.

286
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,546
Mom, Regina's trying to take my bowl. Tell her she can't do it.
Oh for Pete's sake,

287
00:16:31,547 --> 00:16:36,544
I just gave it to you. I brought it back. Will you please tell her to give it to me.

288
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:40,459
I don't even know what you're talking about.
I just came down here to get my cigarettes.

289
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,796
Oh Regina, another flavorless meal.
Thank God I brought my own food.

290
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:51,197
Here, mom, I'll wash your bowl so you can take it home.

291
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:54,708
Uh, no, you can have it. Someone from church left it at my house.

292
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,096
I don't need any more crap around. It's your problem now.

293
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:02,847
Look what mom gave me

294
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:07,568
What? Mother!

295
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:11,747
Wait a minute. I remembered.

296
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:16,058
This... this is not about the bowl. This bowl
doesn't mean anything. It's never meant anything.

297
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:21,397
The only reason that Amy wants it
is because she gave it to you.
That's because she got everything

298
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:25,169
What are you talking about? You always got
everything you want. You were the special little baby.

299
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,559
Are you kidding Regina the Queen-a.

300
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:31,183
Stop.
Stop it.

301
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:37,550
I loved you both the same. I may have
only enough love for one daughter

302
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:40,668
but you each got half, so what's the big deal.

303
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,869
Well, it kind of is a big deal.

304
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:47,121
Maybe if they'd gotten more love from you,
they wouldn't be fighting over this stupid bowl.

305
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:52,068
Oh look, they might have only half a
mother but at least they had two daddies.

306
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:53,863
What?

307
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,717
Our daddy was my daddy. I know that.

308
00:17:56,752 --> 00:18:00,526
Maybe I am just saying by then there was another rooster in the hen house

309
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:05,279
Oh Lord, mother, ok...
Maybe we should just stop this.

310
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,726
Do a DNA test if you want. You can dig up your daddy, but

311
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:12,141
I scattered your uncle ashes at the fair grounds

312
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:17,082
What? Uncle Jack?
Now uncle Jack was a half wit, Luther.

313
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,375
Uncle Jack never got passed third base.

314
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,583
Luther was in a wheelchair!

315
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,278
Please stop with the yelling again.

316
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:29,339
OK I just had enough!!

317
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:38,536
I'm not cleaning up that mess.
My bowl.

318
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:43,359
You had no right to do that.
Yes I did. It was passed on to me.

319
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:47,440
Oh God, with all this poison, all this hatred, I don't even want it.

320
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:50,941
You know, I don't need a bowl to know that my mother loves me.

321
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,663
I know my mother loves me. All she ever tried
to do is protect me from the two of you.
Oh Samantha.

322
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,580
What's all that noise down there?
You stay out of this mother

323
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:05,237
I'll come up there and unplugged you again.

324
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:08,907
Let's go. You really don't want to meet this one.

325
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,191
Geez.

326
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:17,161
Okay, I don't like that family. Is there
another family that we can have?

327
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:20,007
Oh this is good, now you can start from scratch.

328
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,000
Hey, you gonna be okay to drive?
Yeah I'm fine.

329
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,207
I left my purse in there.
Oh no.

330
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:34,379
I'm trying to decide if it's worth going back in.

331
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,304
God, those people! I should have listen to you.

332
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,153
I was like that pretty girl on a horror
movie you keep yelling at the screen

333
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:46,646
"don't go back in the house". And she
always goes back in the house.

334
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:51,027
All she needs is to find out for herself

335
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:55,545
And you would be pretty if you keep your hair off your face.

336
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:01,521
Thank you for my fresh start mom.

337
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:03,963
You're welcome.

338
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,015
Oh, here.

339
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:11,691
Where did you get this?

340
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:14,219
You'd really think I was gonna
get my sister the real one, did you?

341
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:19,701
I swung by a store. They're 9 bucks.
Yeah, but it's not the real bowl.

342
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:21,531
what is then?

343
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:24,946
So from mother to daughter,

344
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:32,242
you pass it down. And you're gonna tell the story of the bowl.

345
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,936
And that her grandmother was right.
Yes, of course.

346
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:40,268
I love you mommy.

347
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,742
<i>Ok, so no family is perfect.</i>

348
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,392
<i>I thought I found a documentary on one,</i>

349
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,841
<i>but it turned out to be a sitcom from the 70s.</i>

350
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:50,370
<i>The point is you can't choose your family</i>

351
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:52,791
<i>You're stuck with them. Good and bad.</i>

352
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,603
<i>But that's okay. Maybe the bad relatives are there</i>

353
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,608
<i>to help you appreciate the good ones.</i>

354
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:00,011
<i>The ones who have been looking out for you all along.</i>

355
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:04,938
I've got a bowl just like that one.
No Frank, not like this one.
