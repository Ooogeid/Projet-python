00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,070
nostalgia--

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,880
Seems everyone is stuck reliving their pasts.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,960
I don't get it.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,470
Of course,that might be because I don't have a past,

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,710
but it seems silly making a big deal out of something that's not a big deal anymore.

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,130
me? I live in the now.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,690

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,650

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,280

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,600
Yeah,much better. Do you mind?

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,790
Oh,um,I'm actually waiting for some friends,

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,250

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,210

Oh,god,no.

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,160
hey,meter maid, stop writing. Come on.

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,140
I was trying to get a salesgirl fired,and it took forever.

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,520
Damn it. No change.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,120
Thanks,guy.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,790
There should be one of you on every corner.

28
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,150
Um,I'm so sorry about that.

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,070
You know what? Let me pay you back. 

30
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,840
You don't owe me any money.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,330
Oh,well,that's good,'cause once again, no change.

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,590
So you're not putting on?

33
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,630
The name,the face-- nothing?

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,650
No,you see, I- I had is accident,ani have amnesia,

35
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,370
so everything just poofed. Gone.

36
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,610
Yeah,I get that.Don't remember much of the '80s myself.

37
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,460
I'm a musician.

38
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,260
Well,that's okay.I'm inetween jobs,too.

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,110
Oh,so sorry for blowing you off last night,

My boyfriend, ny dane...Was playing.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,480
There's this cheerleader for the team,And she's way too flexible for my liking.

43
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,960
Yeah,she might actually be a threat,because she's met him.

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,780
You know, just because we have not met does not mean we do not have something special.

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,530
You know,I have shared some of my deepest,darkest tts with that man. 

46
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,350
Well,I'm rry about last night,too.But my boyfriend... Chase chapman...

Oh,ght,right. Make fun of the crazy lady because she's having a party for her dog,right?

54
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,270
She'snuts because she's invited all of his little furry friends over.

55
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,810
She's wacko,right? Just because I found litt adorable little hats... 

56
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,350

57
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,970

58
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,870
But don't worry. I forgive you,

59
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,620
'cause I actually kind of met a cute guy.

60
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,120
No. Ooh. Tell.

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,380
Who is he? What does he do? 

62
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,620
Uh,he's a musician.

63
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,200
Ooh! Honey,honey,st right there.

64
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800

66
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,800
He's playing a show this weekend.

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,340
He kind of has an ego,though.

68
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,090
He was so shocked I hadn't heard of him. 

69
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,450
What's his name?

70
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,030
Uh,tommy wyer.

71
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,090
Shut up! You did not meet tommy wylder.

72
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,540
Yeah. So?

73
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,180
Sam,you're totally making me your maid of honor

74
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,320
and letting me move in with you guys. Oh!

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,950
Oh,dena,dena,dena,no.

76
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,830

82
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,380
Oh,god,look at him in that jacket.

83
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,310
Oh,my god. He's gonna be so embarrassed when he remembers he looked like that.

84
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,470
Oh,god. We all looked like that. 

85
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,240
- Oh,I know.
- Oh,my god. 

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,010
See,when we were 13, we were so in love with tommy wylder.

87
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,010
We bought the,uh, "king of hearts" album,and we cracked up,

88
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,410
because you said it sounded like the "king of farts." 

89
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,800
And then you said I was the queen of farts,

90
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,360
and we-- we laughed so hard that my mom tried to pull over the car.

91
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,850
I want to meet him. I think he'll find that story charming. 

92
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,170
Hey,samantha,why don't you ask him if he's looking for a new crib?

93
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,250
And we could put it on our business cards--

94
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,000
"real estate agents to the stars." 

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,440
it already says that on our business cards,mom.

96
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,750
So now it'll be true. 

97
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,900
Still,I don't get it.I don't get how we could worship somebody that we've never met

98
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,570
and who shows absolutely no interest in us at all. 

99
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,530
What is all this talk again?

100
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,510
If you don't want to go to church with us,don't go.

101
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,040
No. No. Sam is gonna marry tommy wylder.

102
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,520
And we're gonna sell him a new house.

103
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,500
Oh,guys,I'm only going on my first date with him tonight. 

104
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,560
Don't do it,sam.A musician is married to one woman,

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,690
and her name is lady rock 'n' roll.

106
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,440
And then he has lots of other women he has sex with.

107
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,980
Howard, shis her mother's daughter.She has a lu for the rockers.

108
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,700
Probably gonna marry one like I did.

109
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,850
You were married to somebody before dad?

110
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,620
Why does nobody tell me this stuff?

111
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,360
No,I mean your father.

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,460
He was the lead singer in a band.

113
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,100
Yeah,the shadowmakers.

114
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,950
The what-y hooters?

115
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,450
He was good.

116
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,440
You should have seen him on stage.

117
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,020
His sweat would sort of glisten in his chest hair,

118
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,520
and he'd lick his lips really slow-- 

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,540
okay,okay,too far. Too far.

120
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,550
Oh,but then a certain little someone came along,

121
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,200
and he dided to lose the leopard skin pants and get a real job. 

122
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,250
Because of me?

123
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,600
Oh,great. I killed my father's dream.

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,420
You know,leave it to you to make it all about yourself.

125
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,390
What aboutmydream? I thought i'd married a rock star.

126
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,900
I could have died young.

127
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,260
Come on. Come on. Come on. "king of farts."

128
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,010
Just say it real fast. Tell me you do not hear that.

129
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,800
Well,I do now, and I always will.

130
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,380
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,610
We're sorry to bother you, but we love you so much. 

132
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,650
Would you mind?

133
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,750
- Sure. 
- Please.

134
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,480
I lost my virginity to you.

135
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,730
She means the music. Right?

136
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,710
I lost mine to prince, but one of your songs totally got me through my eating disorder.

137
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,900
Oh,thank you so much. Oh,my god.

138
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,450
That must be so weird.

139
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,940
Yeah,but free pens. 

140
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,720
No,just women o don't know you just freaking out about you all the time?

141
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,220
That's why I'm here with you, a nice,pretty gl

142
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,680
who isn't afraid to tell me my biggest album is a fart joke.

143
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,860
It's great to not have all the hero worship stuff with you.

144
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,790
Could you excuse me for just one second?

145
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,720
Female problems. Two of them.

146
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,530
Get in there. Get in there. 

147
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,670
Are you kidding me?

148
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,410
What are you guys doing here and what are you wearing?

149
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,640
I just want to shake tommy's hand and then put that hand inside a plastic bag.

150
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,930
Do you have a rubber band? 

151
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,540
Okay, please do not dork out on me.

152
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,780
Well... Um,tell her. I mean,I know how to act around a celebrity.

153
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,410

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,430
Okay,seriously, listen to me,okay?

It really turns him off, so no cameras,no autographs and no crazy.

157
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,590
- No crazy. 
- Crazy. No crazy,okay?

158
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,580
Got it. I just want to say hello to him

159
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,540
and then ask him to sing at my dog's birthday party.

160
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,700
Okay,let's go over the rules again. Shall we? 

161
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,800
- Shall we? 
- I don't know.

162
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,140
Yeah,I just ran into a couple of my fries who wanted to say hi really,really quickly,

163
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,500

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,930

172
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,620

I mean,this thing was-- was magic.

193
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,810
One chord from this,and the girls would forget their names.

194
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,070
Oh,is thaso? Easy,tiger. That was a long time ago.

203
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,620
Tommy wylder sent you flows.

204
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,750
Actually, he brought them over.

205
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,610
He was here? He was in the house?

206
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,630
Oh! And he sat in that chair, and his feet were on that floor,

207
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,210
and you can still see the spot on the ceiling where he ascended to heaven.

208
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,190
 Jealous much?

209
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,270
Oh,yeah,I'm so jealous.

210
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,240
By the way,sam,I sti can't find my sunglasses.

211
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,260
Oh,fothe last time,he did not steal your sunglasses.

212
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,100
Look,I just know they were here before he showed up and said,

213
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,040
"cool sunglasses,dude." you kn,maybe Mr. Platinum record has a little problem. That's all I'm saying.

214
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,950
Hey. No crumbs. I sleep on that couch. 

215
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,810
Dude,you sleep on a couch,and your ex is dating tommy wylder.

216
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,060
I think you got bigger problems than crumbs.

217
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,930
Okay,about the conct-- So we're getting v.i.p. Seats?

218
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:53,250
Yeah,I wanted to,uh, talk to you guys about the concert and you.

219
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,070
Yeah? Yeah?

220
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,720
I just think that maybe, you know,it's too early for the bringing-the-friends- Along thing.

221
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,380
I get it. I totally get it.

222
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,470
Dena embarrasses you. Me,too. Me,too.

223
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,840
That's why I have not introduced her to tony dane yet.

224
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,860
Yeah,you know,it's not... Just dena.

225
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,990
Excuse me. What now?

226
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,930
Come on,andrea. The other night with the crazy fan stuff? 

227
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,840
Iembarrass you? Me?

228
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,340
Please don't make this a thing. 

229
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,580
It's too late. A thing has been made.Yeah. 

230
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,650
Okay,sam,I have to go to that concert with you.

231
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,190
I mean,tommy was ours.

232
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,150
You know,don't you remember, every day after school--

233
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,630
No,I don't remember,okay? I don't remember.

234
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,810
Th-this isn't about the good old days for me,all right?

235
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,170
You keep trying to bring me back to being 13 years old,

236
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,590
but this is about a guy that I'm datingnow,all right,

237
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,940
who just so happens to be a musician. That's it.

238
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,780
I guess you're right.I don't know what I was thinking.

239
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,530
- Look,I'm sorry,dena. I don't mean to sound like I don't care.
- Nope. Nope. Andrea,let's go.

240
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
- I hope you're happy--
- I said let's go. 

241
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,470
Come on.

242
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,450
Okay. Someone's been trying on my shoes.

243
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,060
Oh,just stop it!

244
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,970
I mean,I'm sure I have.I just don't really remember. 

245
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,300
Not because I was on drugs or anything,just because I have sort of a condition.

246
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,280
Oh,these are sort of close. It's gonna be really loud.

247
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,440
Is there anything better back... There? I guess not.

248
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,550
Uh,I think I'm over here. Excuse me.Sorry. Thanks.

249
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,770
* I was bleeding *

250
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,100

253
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,370
* I was needing *

254
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,710

255
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,940

256
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,940
* Do you want to marry me?*

257
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,260
Oh,my god,sam! He totally just looked at me!

258
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,930
- He's my boyfriend! 
- He is not! He's my boyfriend!

259
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,300
Tommy,I love you! Aah!

260
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,660

263
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,610
tommy,I'm right here!

264
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,280
would you mind?

265
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,770
I think we get it after 20 times.

266
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,810
He used to be with that girl. Now she's with this guy. Got it.

267
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,600
Look. It's a snow globe.

268
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,190
It's a picture of him from their concert in paris in 1986.

269
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,900
Damn,I wish I could have been there.

270
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,350
I can't believe I was not there. Oh! Oh!

271
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,600
I have to sh-show you all the pictures...From-- from the concert from last night.

272
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,840
I was so close to the stage! 

273
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,680
No,I don't want to. I don't like tommy wylder.

274
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,950
I never liked tommy wylder. I think he's lame. 

275
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,160
That's 'cause you're stupid.

276
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
What has happened to you? 

277
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,150
Nothing's happened to me,okay?

278
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,290
I just finally know what dena was talking about.

279
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,280
I mean,I loved himsomuch. 

280
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,800
Just turn it down.

281
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,340
You know,you don't get it. I just wish that you could feel what it feels like to have feelings.

282
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,400
Oh,god. Please don't play that one again. Please?

283
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,510
Thanks.

284
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,310
Guys? What are you doing here? Wh--

285
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,500
I- I left you,like, five messages last night.

286
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,870
I have to tell you about the concert.

287
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,170
Okay,look, I- I stole tommy's towel,

288
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,750
and it still has his sweat on it.

289
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,500
Oh,my--

290
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,660
Hey-- hey,what's going on?

291
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,150
We're ignoring you.

292
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,010
You don't say it. You just do it.

293
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,240
Come on. We have a dog's birthday to plan.

294
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,460
Oh,come on,you guy--

295
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,130
You're not still mad about the concert,are you?

296
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,610
Look,you couldn't go. you were acting totally lame.

297
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,250
We need a theme-- A murder mystery!

298
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,680
Like you're really into this party. 

299
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,130
At least I'm going to the party.

300
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,510
So am i. I'm bringing the fire hydrant cake.

301

304
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,500
Dena,please don't make me feel bad about this,all right?

305
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,960
I am living out a dream here. 

306
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,220
Ourdream.

307
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,340
Now you have tommy wylder all to yourself,you're better than us?

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,310
Howard?

312
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,180
What are you doing? I found this on the stairs.

313
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,140
I'm going over the books. We're getting audited next month.

314
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,870
I turn my back for one second, you stop practicing the guitar?

315
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,120
Practicing for what? 

316
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,790
For a gig! I've been putting feelers out.

317
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,280
You know phil remy over at the ramada?

318
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,460
He said that if that gal that plays the piano--You know,with the lazy eye and the fog machine?

319
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,750
If she gets sick, he's gonna call.

320
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,150
Now here. Wait a second. I got you something.

321
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,790
I'm not playing the ramada. I'm going through the books.

322
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,200
Look. Look,look,look.It's just like the one you used to wear!

323
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,690
Come on,just for a second. oh.

324
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,510
Ay,take me right now. oh!Take me right now.

325
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,660
And we're going to jail. Now,now.

326
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,210
Tommy wylder.

327
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,540
We're together.

328
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,920
I'm with him. I'm actually with him,with him.

329
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,620
So lunch was fun,huh? Do you wanna do something else?

330
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,600
I kinda have to be in the studio.

331
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,020
Oh. You're writing a song,huh? Is it about me?

332
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,620
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

333
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,400
I'm sure it's really hard to rhyme things with "samantha."

334
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,650
Maybe "pantha"? I don't know. 

335
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,720
 I - I just wanted to say I'm a big fan,

336
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,770
and,uh,I play some guitar myself.

337
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,810
Back off,frank! Okay,he is not public property,so chill.

338
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,070
Fans,huh? I mean,whatisthat?

339
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,810
Speaking of which,did you call me,like, ten times today and hang up?

340
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,090
No,I don't-- No,I don't think so.

341
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,090
You know what?Maybe my phone dialed from inside my purse,

342
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,400
because that happens to people, for reals.

343
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,090
- U wanna come up for a sec? 
- no.

344
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,440
We could watch your music videos-- what? 

345
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,360
Sam,I think it's time for me to step off.

346
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,330
"step off"?

347
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,460
It's been fun,but you--You're starting to get a little freaky on me. 

348
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,860
It's michelle,isn't it?

349
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,680
who?

350
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,040
From your song, "paris lover."

351
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,720
You sing about that girl michelle.

352
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,770
It just seemed like it must've been really intense.

353
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,130
I mean,the lyrics are really sweet and everything,but she kind of seems like a wacko.

354
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,070
Right. So I'm gonna take a really confusing way home.

355
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,950
Don't try and follow me,okay? Good-bye.

356
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,430
T- tomm y,I-- No,come on! Don't do that!

357
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,490
I'm not usually like this! I'm not-- I love you!

358
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,370
I love you! Don't... Go.

359
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,950
Come on. Let's move you inside quietly...

360
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,280
Like a "pantha."

361
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,620
I love him.

362
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,610
Here you go,sweetie.

363
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,300
I brought you peanut butter and pickle on an english muffin.

364
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,140
It's-- it's one of your favorites.

365
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,250
Is it really?

366
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,540
Because you usually say that when you're just trying to clean out the fridge.

367
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,670
This one's real. Eat it.

368
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,830
God,what happened to me?

369
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,890
I was fine,un-until I-I saw tommy up on that stage,

370
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,570
and then all of a sudden, I was just like...

371
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,680
Oh,my god! Uhh!

372
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,560
- Samantha... 
- So...

373
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,810
It's designed that way. You're there in the dark,

374
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,100
everything falls away, and it's just the two of you.

375
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,690
And the passion...

376
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,930
No one has ever understood you the way he does. 

377
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,510
Oh,god,no,I know!

378
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,700
And your heart starts to beat a little faster,

379
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,340
and you get flushed... 

380
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,620
And you imagine that the two of you belong together. 

381
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,210
And then your father starts doing this little thing with his hips,and you--

382
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,810
 no! No! Too far. Too far.

383
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,880
Oh,boy. I've seen that look before.

384
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,430
Another victim of rock 'n' roll,huh?

385
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,410
Musicians stink.

386
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,290
You should be thanking me for saving you from that life.

387
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,340
Well,thank you. Why?

388
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,540
Because I... Killed your dream?

389
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,370
It's okay.Mom told me that you gave up everything because she got pregnant with me.

390
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,700
 What? You told her that?

391
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,040
Well,I'm not gonna lie to her,howard.

392
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,640
You know how I feel about that.

393
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,390
Sammy,you had nothing to do with how my life turned out.

394
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,890
Okay?imade my choice. In fact,you were my excuse.

395
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,770
Howard,just tell her you quit because you wanted to be a responsible father.

396
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,120
No,I quit because I didn't want to be a musician anymore.

397
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,450
That's not true! Stop that. You loved playing in that band.

398
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,140
No,youloved that I was playing in that band.

399
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,280
Admit it-- If-- if I was the waiter when you walked into the club that night

400
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,100
instead of the guy up on the stage,would you have given me a second look? 

401
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,260
Yes... No.

402
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,600
But-- but look,l-look, look,look. Look,howard...

403
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,450
You haven't picked up a guitar in over 30 years.

404
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,980
You'll leave your fingernail clippings in the sink.

405
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,970
I'm still here.

406
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:18,060
Wait a minute.So now you're saying I just went into debt over a guilt guitar for absolutely nothing?

407
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,070
You wanna take it back? 

408
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,900
Yeah,i wanna take it back.

409
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,200
No,not for nothing.

410
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,620
Oh. For a few days,I got to...

411
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,980
Look at your father with that guitar,and it was 35 years ago all over again.

412
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,600
Regina, every time I look at you,it's 35 years ago again.

413
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,950
Okay,if music can stir passions ofallkinds,

414
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,340
then chances are, it can also soothe them.

415
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,830
dad?

416
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,160
Do you think you've got one more gig left in you?

417
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,340
All right,let's here it for the shadowmakers!

418
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,190
Shadowmakers?

419
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,910
Dena,I am so sorry.

420
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,000
Look,I know I don't rember that tommy was our thing,

421
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,870
but just because I don't remember stuff doesn't mean that it didn't happen

422
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,430
and that it didn't matter to somebody else.

423
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,710
So I really need you to keep reminding me when it did,okay?

424
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,670
Okay.

425
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,740
Remember that time we called all the hotels to see where he-- 

426
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,290
I don't remember.

427
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,520
Remember that time there was only one album-- 

428
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,490
no,I still have amnesia,though.Is there cake? 

429
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,070
Yes,yes,yes,yes.

430
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,850
They're gonna blow the roof off the ramada.

431
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,240
what are you doing with her?! You are terrible at this.

432
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,650
No,it's okay. She broke up with tommy,

433
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,010
and-- and she apologized for being an ass.

434
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,850
- I mean,reallyan ass. You weresuchan ass. 
- I know.

435
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,550
All right,fine,great.Now let's go. I'm at a dog party.

436
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,860
So I get it now-- nostalgia.

437
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,930
With nostalgia,idohave a past-- the same one as theirs.

438
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,780
And as long as I have that, I can never be alone.

439
