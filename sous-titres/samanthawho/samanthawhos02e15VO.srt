1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,950
There are people in the world  who have no one in their life--  

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,780
No one to come home to...

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,320
No one  to share their day with.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,470
Those people are so lucky.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,450
Learning chinese.

6
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,990
It is their century,you know,and eventually,they will overflow their bders.

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,930
Crowded there,is it?

8
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,820
Hello mom?

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,200
Dad?

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,760
Yes.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,330
Samantha?

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,030
We saw your car.

13
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,350
Hey,sammy.What are you doing here?

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,900
No,what are u doing here?

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,980
I-I thought today was the day you guys go look for junk at garage sales.

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,750
Well,it is.We came home early.I got some horrible news.

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,690
She made me pass up a great box of doorknobs.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,230
I could have had a spare for everdoor in the house.

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,650
What was your horrible news?

20
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,940
You know that condo we have listed over on college avenue?

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,430
Well,there was a bidding war.

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,400
And we solit.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,500
You do know that it wasn't an actual war,right?

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,890
That was our only listing.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,090
And it sold.

26
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,730
Hey,why don't you and dad go celebrate?

27
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,510
Samantha,you don't understand.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,500
To get listings,you have to have a listing.

29
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,080
It's like it's easier to get a job when you're working or to meet a man when you're dating somebody else.

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,420
Oh,listen to me.I'talking to someone who doesn't have a job or a man.

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,190
Why don't we just put another ad in the paper,like that--That picture of us with the cell phones?

32
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,930
Oh,it looked like an escort service.

33
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,480
We got calls.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,720
I know.

35
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,120
Why don't we sell th house?

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,150
Nobody's selling this house.

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,100
I just washed all the window screens.

38
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,830
I don't mean really sell it.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,570
It's just-- I want to ha an open house so i can meet people that are looking,

40
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,210

41
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,750
I do not like strangers in my house.

42
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,160
I don't evenike people i like in my house.

43

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,650

49
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,380
Oh,poo.No,i can't.

50
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,560

But who senda fax anymore?

59
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,810
What happened to the movie?

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,470
Well,i-I decided i didn't want to go alone.

61
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,490
It's just not as fun doing things by myself,u know?

62
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,550

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,580

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,050
You know,i was supposed to get that assignment,but for some reason,i never got the call.

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,870
I'm definitely not gonna tell him about this.

109
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,900

Hey,i am insulted.

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,580
So you can slash his tires.

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,920
No!No more bad.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,740

I mean,who does that?

123
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,260
Uh,my neighbor just called,

124
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,780
and she said that there is a "for sale" sign in my front yard and an open hou going on.

125
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,640
My mother does that.That's who.

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,400
Thanks for signing in.Here's my card.

127
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,640
Mrs.Newly,what's going on?

How did you get in my house?

129
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,740
Isn't that the great thing about living in a all town?

130
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,870
No one locks their doors.

131
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,160
I do,yeah.

132
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,350
You can't sell mhouse.

133
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,090
Is that something needed to say specifically at some point?

134
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,840
No,no,i'm not-- I'm not--I'm not selling your house.

135
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,620
I'm just making contacts.

136
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,310
I've already met four potential clients and a strange man who sniffed your banister,and then he left.

137
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,550
You let in mr.Darcy?This is not okay.

138
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,980

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,290
Um,apparently the--The house might not actually be available after all.

145
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,480
Okay,we don't want a big negotiation.

146
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,050
We'll give you $30,000 over the asking price.

147
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,980
I think you'll be very happy here.

148
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,090
That's him.

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,280
That's wes greene.

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,670

I need some sort of plan.

153
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,900
I shou have sex with him.

154
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,130

Look,todd was supposed to have that coal mine assignment,but i didn't give him the message,

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,710

So basically,you owe me.

174

175
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,750

176
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,070
Although i don't recall you being in that mine shaft choking on dust and death for two days a mile underground 

177
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,850
or placing the camera or getting enough lights down there to shoot,

178
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,130
but not too much light,so that people could feel the darkness those men live in down there.

179
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,080
Yeah,okay,we get it.You got a camera.

180
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,130
So does everybody else.I have one on my phone.

181
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,990
Right,so if you don't mind,i'll just keep the prize and my interview appointment,which is in 20 mines.

182
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,270
So i gotta get ready.Say hi to todd,okay?

183
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,930
Oh use this.

184
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,310
You carry that in your car?

185
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,570
You don't?

186
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,340
No,i can't do this.I can't do this.

187
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,160
You've done it plenty.

188
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,800
You just go through the side,where the steel belting's not in the way.

189
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,800
No.No.

190
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,220
I was mad a minute ago,but it is just--It's not right.

191
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,910
So let's--Let's just go.

192
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,790
No,you should go home,where because of you,

193
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,670
todd is probably sitting there jobless,just teaching himself the banjo.

194
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,460
See?It's just like riding a bike.Right?

195
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,330
I can't believe it.

196
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,870
I got the job the greawes greene was up for.

197
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,960
This is amazing!

198
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,950
You're welcome.

199
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,370

Don't worry.

210

214
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,650

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,340
Dude,how the heck did you know where iived?

217
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,250
I drove todd home once when we worked together.

218
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,210
But today i had to take the bus because someone slashed my te to get her boyfriend a job!

219
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,900
She's all yours.

220
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,080
Frank,come on.Tires?

221
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,540
Tires are really hd to slash,which i woulnot know...

222
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,210
About.

223
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,750
Okay,okay,okay.

224
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,220
I am so sorry,but,you know,you're kinda getting a little fliout-Y.

225
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,130
A little...

226
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,580
Flippy out-Y.

227
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,910
A little--Little flippy.

228
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,670
You're mad,and i understand that,but you can ge any job you want,

229
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,830
and todd really,reall needed that job.

230
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,820
Did he?

231
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,040
Did he need it because his wife divorced him 

232
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,600
and he has to show a judge that he's locally employed or he'll lose custody of his kids?

233
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,020
I don't know.

234
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,120
Fine.Fine.I have ruined yourife,too.

235
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,750
I will fix this.I promise.

236
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,140
I will talk to todd,and then i will explain to your ex-Wife exactly what...

237
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,480
No, you go anywhere near my family,and i will run you down in t street!

238
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,200
Need a pretty cooperative bus driver for that.

239
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,370
Not funny.

240
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,280
Great.Now to help wes,i just have to ruin todd's career again.

241
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,600
By the wayi'm happy,and i never want your help.

242
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,500
Dena,dena,this is a very good offer.

243
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,740
I know.

244
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,500
It--'S $30,000 over the asking price.

245
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,930
I know.That's a l of money.

246
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,590
In this market?

247
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,810
With people all over ts country unable to sell their homes,it's like spitting in their faces.

248
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,340
You know,this w my mom's house.

249
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,050
I've never lived anywhere else.

250
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,010
Dena...

251
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,090
Do you kw where your mother is right now?

252
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,920
 - In a wall.
 - She's in here.

253
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,330
 - In a mausoleum over-- 
 - I didn't mean literally.

254
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,170
Okay,no,the point is...

255
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,470
She's not here in this house.

256
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,990
She's in heaven.

257
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,130
And your boyiend's in the city,and samantha's in the city,and.

258
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,910
That's where our future is,dena.

259
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,550
Dena,i'm giving you the future.

260
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,900
Thank you.

261
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,490

Sam,this job is everything i've always wanted.

264
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,880
Really?

265
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,920
Even better than working...At a camera store?

266
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,660
A camera store?No,no,this job is great.

267
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,360
My assigent editor walked me through the storie i'm gonna be shooting--

00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,480
Maybe london 2012?

270
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,000
I mean,what,if you-- If you play your cards right?

271
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,650
Ause i'm sure if you-- You want to walk on eggslls for the next four years.

272
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,100
No wonder you're so stressed out.

273
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm not stressed out.

274
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,950
Calm down,man!

275
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,770
Breathe.Chill.

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,360
Look,you--You beat out wes greene for this job.

277
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,750
You can do so much bette i-I believe in you.

278
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,070
Wait.What's going on you were so happy i got this job.

279
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,100

280
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,360
Look,i-I've seen your work,and,uh,it's not that good.

281
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,500
Incredible.

282
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,530
What?

283
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,330
You just have to keep me down,don't you?

284
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,130
No.No,no that's not it.

285
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,440
well,then what?W-Why do you wt me to quit?

286
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,570
Because...

287
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,340
Because i.

288
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,510
I just,uh,really started to miss u,you know?

289
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,970
I just--It's really quiet around here.

290
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,620
Yeah,exactly.

291
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,900
When i was laying around the apartment claro,cuando estaba en like a lump,you could handle that.

292
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,100
You know,i bet this is why i never got ywhere when we we together.

293
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,490
Well,i'm going somewhere now.

294
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,780
I'm going out to dinner wi my editor and publisher.

295
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,330
Deal with it.

296
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,500
Sam?

297
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,320
You know,that martha stewart is a wackadoo,

298
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,210
because this does not sharpen knives.

299
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,240
Nope.It doesn't.

300
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
You slashed wes greene's tire?

301
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,210
Well,i tried reasoning with him first,

302
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,210
and i-I wouldn't even have been able to slash the tire if andrea didn't carry a knife.

303
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,280
You know what?Hearing it now,i bear very little responsibility here.

304
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,210
So now i have to quit the job.

305
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,660
Oh,god.Thank you so much for understanding.

306
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,220
I mean, his life is in shambles.

307
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,270
You know,he's getting divorced,his tire was slashed.

308
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,390
I mean because i don't deserve it.

309
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,270
Yes,you do deserve it,and you will get the next one.

310
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,500
No,he can have it.I'm done.

311
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,790
Done?With photography?

312
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,210
No.Why?

313
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,850
Because on the off chance you're not always ere to slash someone's tire for me,

314
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,580
it's obvious i'll never have wes' career.

315
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,010
Yeah,well,you know what?You would have if it wasn't for me.

316
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
What?

317
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,810
Thanks for doing my inspection, mr.Newly.

318
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,170
Oh,not a problem.

319
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,420
You know,those licensed gs are a racket.

320
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,050
Carnies with a clipboard.

321
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,550
No,everything is fine under there,but you got a little bluish stain in the sink there.

322
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,600
You know what?That's just where my mom made a blueberry pie every sine sunday.

323
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,500
Well,the new owners can just bleach it out,right?

324
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,390
What?No!

325
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,700
Every time i go to rinse out a glass,it makes me think of her.

326
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,490
You know what?I'm just gonna take that--That sink with me.

327
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,140
Well,they might notice that eventually.

328
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,940
Oh,and here,this doorjamb-- 

329
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,630
It has all the marks from where my mom measured my height every single birthday,

330
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,380
and,oh,this asterisk by my 13th is 'cause i wouldn't take off my darth vader helmet.

331
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,110
No,i'm--I'm--I'm ripping that out,too.

332
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,760
And the front door?

333
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,750
Taking it.

334
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,900
Yeah,that's where chase and i had our first kiss,and,oh,i'm gonna need the floor in front of the fireplace 

335
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,090
because that's the first place,you,we...

336
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,570
Never mind.But i'm--I'm gonna need that.

337
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,960
Dena,are you sure you want to sell?

338
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,150
Oh,yeah,sure.

339
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,730
I mean--I mean,i signed a contract,right?

340
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,640
Everybody's counting on me.

341
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,070
So i guess...

342
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,160
I just got off the phone with the new buyers.

343
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,750
They wanted to make sure that you were leaving...

344
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,950
That you were leaving the snoopy mailbox.

345
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,750
Like--Like you were gonna take that with you.

346
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,660
I want that.

347
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,270
Regina,bad news.

348
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,570
The sale ain't gonna happen.

349
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,680
 - What?
 - What?

350
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,360
Yeah,i was just down in the basement.

351
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,700
I-It's riddled with mold.

352
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,940
Mold?So?You n hang up an air freshener.

353
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,230
Well,nobody's gonna buy a house with mold,regina,

354
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,190
and now that you know,you have to disclose it.

355
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,290
Well,thanks so much for your help,mr.Science.

356
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,000
You're not a professional,and you cannot say anything against your wife in court.

357
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,790
That's the law.

358
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,210
Dena,dena,i'm gonna get a bottle of wine and some painkillers,

359
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,280
and by tomorrow,you're gonna forget that this conversation ever happened.

360
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,160
W-W-Wait.Wait.

361
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,040
Don't blame mr.Newly.It's me.

362
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,090
I'm happy here.I have a good life,you know?

363
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,750
I have a boyfriend and a--And a best friend and--And a free house with a yard for my dogs.

364
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,730
People work their whole lives to have what i already have.

365
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,790
I mean,i don't want to leave!

366
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,580
Okay.We got mold.

367
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,320
I don't even have a basement.

368
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,100
Well,i'm not a professional.

369
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,000
Thanks,mr.Newly.

370
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,200
Don't mention it.

371
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,120
Oh,and,uh,your bedroom wiring is shot.

372
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,310
Gotcha.

373
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,700
No,i mean it.

374
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,190
Fix it,or one night you'll wake up on fire.

375
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,780
A vacation?

376
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,210
You screwed me out of a job for a vacation?

377
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
Okay,okay,okay.That's o scenario.

378
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,960
Now just flip it around.

379
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,250
I did you a favor.

380
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,380
Oh,really?How's that?

381
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,290
Say i did give you that message,and you had gotten that job.

382
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,350
I mean,maybe you would have gotten a pulitzer prize and ended up just like wes--  

383
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,900
Failed marriage,not allowed to see our kids.

384
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,900
Maybe i wouldn't have neglected our kids.

385
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,960
Yes,you would've.

386
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,250
You'd be gone all the time.

387
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,640
What,and you're such a great mom?

388
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,580
Yeah,well,at least i went to their soccer games!

389
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,340
 - Wait,sam.
 - And the homework-- It's so hard!

390
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,640
What are we talking about?

391
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,240
I don't know!

392
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,320
I'm just so ashamed.I'm...

393
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,120
I am so,so sorry that i ruined your life.

394
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,870
Well,i don't know if you ruined my life.

395
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,430
Yeah,it was kind of ruined...

396
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,170
By me.

397
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,230
It's not ruined.

398
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,180
Kinda is.

399
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,270
Well,it's not even that bad.

400
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,720
You didn't see wes' car.

401
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,170
If it wasn't for me,you'd be driving that car.

402
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,100
Okay,stop.

403
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,270
Can you drive a stick,though?

404
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,530
Sam,come on.

405
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,260
You know,i-I know that you think you pull all the strings,but you're not god.

406
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,170
You don't control the universe.

407
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,380
That's very sweet,todd,but just not true.

408
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,040
Believe me.I would love to blame you for everything bad that's ever happened,

409
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,800
and--And not giving me that message--Yeah,that was bad.

410
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,340
Yeah,but since then,i might've...

411
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,080
Made a few wrong moves on my own.

412
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,450
No,you said i always kept you down.

413
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,830
Well...

414
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,970
I was mad.

415
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
The truth is,i've never been a big self-Start.

416
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,370
When we were together,you kind of kicked my ass into gear.

417
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,240
Really?

418
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,570
Which is maybe why since we've been apart,i've...

419
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,500
Kind of sputtereoh.

420
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,500
Quit.

421
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,030
Recommend wes.

422
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,210
We'll find you something better.

423
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,550
Camera store?

424
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,930
Even better.

425
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,780
Okay,so like i was saying,

426
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,730
except the opposite,it is a nice thing to have people in your life.

427
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,720
You just have to remember that they're in charge  of their own destiny..

428
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,900
Give me that.

429
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,800
And that  you can't control them,no matter how much you want to.

430
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,750
Yeah,here we go.

431
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,370
No matter how much they really  need you to take the wheel,don't do it.

432
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,850
All you can do is give them  a nudge in the right direction and hope for the best.

433
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,400
The good news is,you'll have more time to focus on your own life,

434
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,730
to solve your own problems,big and small...

435
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,730
Like how to do a crossword  puzzle when you have amnesia.

436
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,460
I blank ly.

437
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,200
Who the hell is lucy?
