1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,900
Sometimes taking things you like and mixing them
together can make another thing you like even more.

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,160
Todd. Todd! Todd!

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,590
What are-- what are you--
wh are you doing home?

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,780
Well,what about you? I thought
you were at granola boy's house.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,290
Unless it's mixing your current
boyfrie and your ex-boyfriend.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,860
Because granola boy called,and
they've got some fresh granola in.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,500
This is awesome. I mean,it's,uh,awkward.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,610
I don't know why i said "awesome,"
'cause it's not. It's awkward.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,630
Mostly because he's wearing my shirt.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,010
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,630
- I'lluh,go change.
- Good plan.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,900
- All right,well,that went really well,huh?
- No.

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,980
But i'm glad,because
now you owe me a favor.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,750
My mom's coming in from
canada for the week.

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,060
Wait a minute. She's in canada?

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,320
- You're canadian?
- Yeah. Why?

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,480
It's just not something that you eaboot.

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,240
Anyway,look,she knows we broke up.

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,010
What she doesn't know is that i live on your
couch and that your boyfriend wears my shirts.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,500
Got it. You want me to moveoot.

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,660
Yes.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,710
Okay. Well,what should i--
should i come by and say hi to r?

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,810
Or let me guess. She hates me.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,390
Oh,she might,if she ever met you.

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,290
You said you never mixed
boyfriends and parents.

26
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,650
That's not true. I mean,i obviously
introduced you to my parents.

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,270
Well... Sort of.

28
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,020
Oh,i can't do this. I can't do this.

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,270
Oh,what is wrong?

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,000
It's just-- being in
your parents' house...

31
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,290
They're in myrtle beach.

32
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,490
You know,it's your childhood room.

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,520
I
- i don't know if i can do it in front of this many unicorns.

34
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,400
Well,unless you want to do it in front
of the guys reflooring my apartment,

35
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,900
- then this is gonna have to do.
- Okay.

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,650
Hey,sammy,i saw your car
in the driveway. Oh,my god!

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,580
Hey,daddy. You guys bring me anything?

38
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,440
It's okay. You can have
the apartment. I'll...

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,770
Go stay at my... Parents'hoose.

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,890
Why would you invite your
boyfriend to meet your parents?

41
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,530
Seriously,you need a handler.

42
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,650
You cannot be left alone.

43
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,220
I don't want things in
my life to be separate.

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,780
You know,i like everything individually,so
why wouldn't i like them all mixed together?

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,860
- You like your red wine,right?
- Yeah,i love it.

46
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,960
- You like martinis?
- Sure.

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,580
- Enjoy.
- Thank you. I will.

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,640
I'd just be happy to mix with my own
boyfriend,but chase is always busy.

49
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,260
I've been trying to get him to go
see that movie "australia" with me.

50
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,300
I mean,i even told him,it's a
big romance starring hugh jackman.

51
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,560
What more could a guy want?

52
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,340
He used to want to spend
every second with me.

53
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,690
Now i never see him.

54
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,860
I see him every day. Believe
me. You're not missing anything.

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,680
Yes. That's an idea.

56
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,500
If i want to see him,go to his work.

57
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,810
Uh,which is also my work,so no.

58
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,280
I'm telling you,dnot
mix parts of your life.

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,360
I think you are wrong.

60
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,100
And owen is amazing,and i cannot wait
for my parents to get to know him.

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,080
Okay,well,have you considered this?

62
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,200
When your pa get to know owen,owen
will get to know your parents.

63
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,120
No,i have not.

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,470
Okay,so i'm gonna put these
fluorescent bulbs in all of the lamps.

68
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,470
Dad,you put out the
recycled toilet paper.

69
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,310
Oh,and no jokes about how
you can see stuff in it.

70
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,760
Oh,and,mother,i made up these cards
that i thought might come in handy.

71
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,930
Is it a party game? I love
party games.What's it c

72
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,330
it's called "things to avoid
duringin? Ner with owen."

73
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,570
Oh,how lucky were you to find that one?

74
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,750
"has he ever been married?"

75
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,050
"is he mried now?

76
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,310
Does he have children?
"canhe have children?

77
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,700
"your sex life. Oursex life."

78
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,850
Howard,can you believe this? Our
daughter is embarrassed by us.

79
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,130
Us? She didn't givemeany cards.

80
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,060
Oh,i can't tell the
constipated parrot joke?

81
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,650
No. Please.

82
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,810
Because smitty and reno down at the chicken
farm loved it,and they're a tough laugh.

83
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,620
Daddy,for me?

84
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,860
Okay. But you do realize
that he hasn't gone for days.

85
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,130
- No,i know it. - All ri-- all
right,all right,all right. You know what?

86
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,690
I was once told i was a
"bewitching" conversationalist.

87
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,310
Why am i being singled out?

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,520
I mean,i've already met owen.

89
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,710
Yes,and pretended to be my sister.

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,680
So you can understand my concern.

91
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,100
Fine. Fine. I won't speak.

92
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,570
I'll just cook and bus tables.

93
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,880
What,i'm the hired help now?

94
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,170
Yes,but we think of you as
almost a member of the family.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,190
Well done,sir.

96
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,290
I'm sorry?

97
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,560
Your mother,"who is coming to
stay," so miss newly would clear out?

98
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,690
Excellent story. Well played.

99
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,620
Uh,no,no,no. My mom really
was coming,but she canceled.

100
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,720
I was gonna call sam and
tell her to come home.

101
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,060
If i may...

102
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,840
Rarely does the universe offer
you a weekento yourself...

103
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,160
Andthe madden football game you ordered.

104
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,970
Speaking as one whose in-laws are
in the second week of their visit,

105
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,580
Ignoring such a convergence
seems like a slap to god's face.

106
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,200
Let's go.

107
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,650
Okay,so we're not
leaving until we're done.

108
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,050
First up is permits. Andrea.

109
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,570
Really? Is she gonna
be in the meetings now?

110
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,000
Just ignore me.

111
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,310
- I'm not even here.
- She's not even here.

112
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,530
So what are we gonna
dabout those permits?

113
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Yes,sir.We're still
waiting for the city--

114
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,450
i'm sorry,jerri. Waiting?

115
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,730
So now waiting is doing? Is that it?

116
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,450
Oh,wait. I see the
similarities. I see them.

117
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,830
They're both participles,right?

118
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,640
They're both action words,like
"groveling,packing,firing."

119
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,660
I'm sorry. I thought you were kidding.
I thought you were like... I'm a bear.

120
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,600
A cute little baby
bear,that's what you are.

121
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,630
Okay. Okay. Dena? Dena?

122
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,410
Kicked out of the bear cave.

123
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,540
Call me.

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,660
You know,owen,i was an
environmentalist beforeit became a fad.

125
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,530
And if i'd ever gotten these two to
turn off a light when they left a room,

126
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,510
I'd be a rich man myse

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,060
i never said that you were rich.

128
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,920
Oh,it's okay. I am.

129
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,180
Samantha,uh,would you
pass the potatoes to owen?

130
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,530
And,uh,howard,would you like to ask our
guest if he wants to have children someday?

131
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,610
Okay,owen,um,you'reonna
love regina's chicken salad.

132
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,410
Oh,thank you. It looks
fantastic,but,uh,i don't eat chicken.

133
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,490
Pardon me?

134
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,270
Oh,but it's okay. I
mean,nothing to worry about.

135
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,410
I have plenty of potatoes here.

136
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,840
- You have a problem with chicken?
- Daddy.

137
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,950
No.

138
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

139
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,900
Just the industry that farms it.

140
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,280
Which... I now understand means you.

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,640
All right. What do
we got? Chicken stock.

142
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,030
Yams.

143
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,410
We have yams!

144
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,190
Uh,really,i'm fine.

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,240
Well,i guess you gave your little
topic cards to the wrong parent.

146
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,290
Mother,i told you he was a vegetarian.

147
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,630
Which is why i made a salad.

148
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,980
Withchicken.

149
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,700
But chickensalad.

150
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,810
Chicken.

151
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,840
Salad.

152
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,850
***I
- i can pick around it.

153
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,300
So is this a humane thing?

154
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,100
Because we have
free-range chickens only.

155
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,030
Uh,it's more of an
environmental concern.

156
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,860
Factory farming uses a
disproportionate amount of resources.

157
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,360
Oh,here we go,the part where i'm
personally responsible for "global warming."

158
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,710
Daddy,it's-- it's not "global
warming." Okay? It's very real.

159
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,120
Um,owen and i actually went to a lecture
about it last week,an incredibly informative--

160
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,570
And maybe about an hour and
a half too long-- lecture.

161
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,700
And now i get one in the
privacy of my own home.

162
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,110
Daddy,this is what owen essa
fmaornt aha l wivhoin? G.

163
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,980
He's-- he's
saving the planet.

164
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,560
And i'm killing it,right?

165
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,570
And my little hobby provides
food,jobs,a roof over your head.

166
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,680
And let me remind
you,chickens built this house.

167
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,270
Really? I'd love to
see pictures of that.

168
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,900
Oh,look! Beets. Nature's candy.

169
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,430
I'm-- i'm sorry. I didn't
mean to cause problems.

170
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,260
I should probably go. Yeah.

171
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,270
- No.
- Maybe we can do this some other time.

172
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,190
Yeah,but you're gonna miss dessert. I
- i hope you like panda.

173
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,350
Daddy,stop it!

174
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,720
Sam,i'll call you.

175
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,320
No,no. I'm coming with you.

176
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,360
No,you're not.

177
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,610
You walk out that door,missy,don't
bother coming back.

178
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,670
Then fine,i won't. Come on,owen.

179
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,460
Uh,thank you for a lovely evening.

180
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,810
Creamed corn?

181
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,730
Panda?

182
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,280
He rode his bike.

183
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,670
Last night was a complete
and utter disaster.

184
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,770
I feel bad for you sam. I do.

185
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,720
But the lesson we can all
take from this is ias right.

186
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,340
Yes,you were right. Never mix.

187
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,430
I mean,my father still wouldn't
talk to me this morning.

188
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,610
You guys were talking about
chicken and ended up with a beef.

189
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,630
A beef. Right?

190
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,140
I mean,i-i was just
defending my boyfriend.

191
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,650
It's not like i was attacking
my father and what he does.

192
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,860
Well,a guy like your dad iswhat he does.

193
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,910
You know what i have to do?

194
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,130
I have to go down there,i have to apologize
and i have to see what it is that he does.

195
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,870
No,don't. Because i spent one day at chase's
office,and it ruined him. It was horrible.

196
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,570
Meaning?

197
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,390
- You were right.
- Yes,i was right.

198
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,760
I'm having a great day.

199
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,090
Look,chapman will be fine.

200
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,080
He just needs to humiliate somebody
in public,and he'll be back to normal.

201
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,130
Yes. Andrea,please do it.

202
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,410
Just pretend to let chase take you down.

203
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,700
And why would i do that?

204
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,230
And why would she do that?

205
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,930
- So that dena will stop coming to your office.
- Deal.

206
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,070
You know who i blame for
all of this? Todd's mother.

207
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,020
I hope she's enjoying herself.

208
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,940
Intercepted!

209
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,600
No,no,no. That's interference.

210
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,250
No,that's 98,nothing.

211
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,640
- Yeah,switch controllers hawi wthho m?
- Back off,woman.

212
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,010
Would the world's greatest
dad like a mug for his coffee?

213
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,610
Well,if you're talking about
me,i like styrofoam cups,

214
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,120
So when they get dumped into the ocean,i
get to clog up a dolphin's blowhole.

215
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,970
Actually,the thing about styrofoam is tt the
danger of it is that it has these chemicals

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
That are released
when it-- i'm sorry.

217
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,290
It was a very informative lecture.

218
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,590
Thanks.

219
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,510
Daddy,i shouldn't have taken owen's
side without even knowing what you do

220
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,720
or even taking the time to find out.

221
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,560
Yeah,well,you've been busy.

223
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,060
You know,you had that whole coma
thing going on,you know,this and that.

224
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,670
So... This is where it happens,huh?

225
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,050
Yeah,this is it.

226
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,700
You loved coming here
when you were a kid.

227
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,650
You used to sit at this desk and play with
the stapler,be the boss like your old man.

228
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
Will you show me?

229
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,420
Oh,you just take it and
just kind of go like this...

230
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,170
"hey. I'm the boss."

231
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,170
No. Will you show me what you do?

232
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,070
No. You're just being
polite. It's-- hey,it's okay.

233
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,520
Please can i have a tour?

234
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,690
Okay. Sure. Why not?

235
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,800
Uh,we might have to get some booties...

236
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,050
So you don't get blood on those
nice shoes and maybe a shower cap.

237
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,690
So we're projecting revenues escalating
in that market,so i'm gonna need--

238
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,620
people.

239
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,160
Andrea.

240
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,520
Yes,mr,chapman?

241
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,730
Andrea,it has come to my attention
that you have made some sort of mistake.

242
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,200
Apologize.

243
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,230
- Yes.I've made
a-- - stand up.

244
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,510
I did make a mistake.

245
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,090
I messed up bad.

246
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,610
And i feel i need some sort of slap
on the wrist to show me who's the boss.

247
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,550
Oh,i didn't say to sit down.

248
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,310
Um,what
i--

249
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,200
what,do you call that
some sort of apology?

250
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,640
- I said everything that
we agreed-- - get up.

251
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,260
I'm sorry,mr. Chapman.

252
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,150
And i promise this is the very last
apology that you will ever need.

253
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,150
- You got it?
- No. Get on your knees,woman.

254
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,840
I'm never doing that.
This is not my fault.

255
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,460
I didn't mess things
up with your girlfriend.

256
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,080
- Okay,apologies accepted.
- I'm not apologizing. You apologize.

257
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,150
If you had gone to one stupid movie
with her instead of ignoring her,

258
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,650
Then she wouldn't have
dragged your life into my life.

259
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,280
Just go and fix it.

260
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,200
Okay,double bonuses if no one
ever mentions baby bear again.

261
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,470
Okay? Good meeting.

262
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,740
We're home.

263
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,190
You're back. I'm so
glad you two made up.

264
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
- So where'd you go?
- Chickens.

265
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,220
We went to the-- the
farm with the chickens.

266
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,120
Oh,my god. The chickens.

267
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,050
Howard,you did not.

268
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,590
Well,she wanted to see
what her old man does.

269
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,450
And now i know.

270
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,070
And i'll never forget.

271
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,940
She loved it,didn't you,sammy? Tell her.

272
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,440
Oh,i loved it. I loved it.

273
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,530
I'd love to stop thinkin
about it,but i just can't.

274
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,600
I got a tape i wanted to show ya.

275
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,870
Samantha,are you okay?

276
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,260
Uh,they have hoses... And then
the beaks. oh,my god! The beaks.

277
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,160
Found it!

278
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,890
Amd that's where they get the cutlets.

279
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,710
- Isn't that fascinating?
- I had forgotten that.

280
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,370
- Yeah.
- Sammy?

281
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,980
When you were little,i had a dream,and i was
gonna wait until i was dead to tell you about it,

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,050
But seeing how much you
loved it there today,i...

283
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,840
Come on,samantha. Do it
again. Do it for mommy.

284
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,050
Oh,howard!Look,she's
taking her first--

285
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,130
uh,testing,testing.

286
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,600
Okay,um,i just saw
"terms of endearment."

287
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,790
And,uh,so i think that it's important for me to
say what would happen to everything after i die.

288
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,150
Um,regina,i love you.

289
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,280
Everything's you

290
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,730
howard,are you coming or not?

291
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,050
Just one minute!

292
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,560
Don't yell at me. You're the who wanted
to watch "hardcastle and mccormick."

293
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,750
okay,anyway,um,everything that
isExcept for the chicken farm,

294
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,950
and that goes to my best little
girl sammy,like she always wanted.

295
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,680
Howard,you left nothing to your mother.

296
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,640
Oh,please send her a copy of this.

297
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,130
I'm not gonna wait till you're
dead to see her reaction.

298
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,930
So,sammy,whato you think?

299
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,120
I think... I think i'm
a chicken farmer. Yeah.

300
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,590
Help me.

301
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,240
What is it?

302
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,880
What is it? I'm-- i'm--
i'm a chicken farmer.

303
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,870
Oh,that. Honey,relax.

304
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,580
I have promised your father
lots of things after he's dead.

305
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,730
Just say "thank you," and then when he's
gone,you on my trip with me to hong kong.

306
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,170
You already have plans?

307
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,290
Well,your father won't go to china.

308
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,690
Ironically,by the time i get
there,he'll be 6 feet closer than me.

309
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,860
Hey,sammy. Come here. Look.

310
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,520
Ntha who i've been waiting
a long time to give you this.

311
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,370
The guys down at the farm gave it to
me for my 20th year in the business.

312
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,270
Look at that-- "the
cluck stops here."

313
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,200
Smitty came up with that.

314
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,530
And y-you'll get a chance to meet him
when you hang that over your desk tomorrow.

315
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,010
Tomorrow? No. N
- not until you die.

316
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,230
You gotta die first,silly.

317
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,880
Well,you need to learn the business.

318
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,370
You know,right after my death,you're
not gonna be in a very good headspace.

319
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,950
You know,viking funerals are
very powerful,unsettling things.

320
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,640
Dena. Dena.

321
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,610
Dena.

322
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,350
Excuse me. Stop. Move. Move. Ank you.

323
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,840
So you think i'm ignoring you?

324
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,200
What are you doing here?
Don't you have to work?

325
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,920
No,i forwarded all my calls.

326
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,130
Well,yeah,i don't feel
like i'm a priority anymore.

327
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,080
I miss the honeymoon
phase of our relationship.

328
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,730
Really?

329
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,690
I hated the honeymoon phase.

330
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,990
I couldn't wait for the
honeymoon phase to be over.

331
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,370
Why,so you could neglect me?

332
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,900
No. I--
You shh!

333
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,950
Look,this part we're in now,dena,it's...

334
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,320
This part is real.

335
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,160
I'm not a goopy guy.

336
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,740
I'm a bottom line guy. I'm a...

337
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,430
Like th what is he,like a tycoon?

338
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,430
- He's a stockman.
- He's a stockman.

339
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,650
- I mean,i have no idea what that
is. - It's-- well,he's not a--

340
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,180
- you know what?It doesn't matter.
- Okay.

341
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,560
It doesn't matter. The point
is,i wasn't neglecting you.

342
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,570
I was taking you for granted.

343
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,060
And i ven't been...

344
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,610
Comfortable enough to do
that with anyone in years.

345
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,640
Really?

346
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,170
It's okay. Sorry. I'm leaving.

347
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,820
No,come in. Wait,wait. What
are you doing? No,come back!

348
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,640
That's so romantic,you coming
through my bedroom window.

349
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,940
Uh,this is not romantic.

350
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,200
This is me being scared of your dad.

351
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,720
There's a lot of things that i
can be afraid of in this house.

352
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,710
Right. I-- yeah,i
was just,um...

353
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,870
Just doing my nails. It's fine.

354
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,830
- Careful.
- Oh,yeah.

355
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,480
Sorry about last night.

356
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,860
I should have just shut
up and not made a big deal.

357
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,630
But i got all competitive and everything,tried
to act strong in front of my woman.

358
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,160
I know you're strong.

359
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,550
I see you riding that bicycle
on your balcony every morning.

360
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,140
Well,i kind of have to.
Powers my electric toothbrush.

361
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,100
Hey,sammy,i was
think-- oh,my god.

362
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,020
Mr. Newly.

363
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,980
Don't you use my first name.
It's "mr. Newly" to you.

364
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,220
Daddy,please.

365
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,970
So what were you thinking,huh?

366
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,740
You're gonna steal our little girl away?

367
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,090
Well,think again.

368
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,170
Sam,did you tell him the news?

369
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,490
Daddy,can we please talk
about this downstairs?

370
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,580
- She's taking over my chicken farm.
- You what?

371
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,820

372
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,230

373
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,890
- Yeah*******
- ********

374
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,460
*********

375
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,540
No*********

376
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,040
I'm sorry. I
- i just can't.

377
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,440
So you're,uh... You're choosing him?

378
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,990
- No. - I-
i got it.

379
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,290
Daddy,i'm...

380
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,180
- Owen,i have to go talk to my father,okay?
- Okay,i'll go.

381
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,560
Okay. He has the hatchet.

382
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,990
Right. Right. Um,i'll call you.

383
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,820
Daddy...

384
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,160
I was not choosing owen over you. Okay?

385
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,580
Well,you don't want to run the family
business,fine. That's no-- no problem.

386
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,910
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,230
Iove you,but i just
could not do what you do.

388
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,950
Yeah,because you don't approve.

389
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,100
No. No. Becauseicouldn't do it,which
is why it's good that you do.

390
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,820
Look,lots of us-- we eat chicken and hamburgers,and
we don't have to think about how we get it,

391
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,280
Because people like you protect
us from having to,like a dad.

392
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,500
You know,i knew the farm
wasn't right for you.

393
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:02,530
But when you dropped by the office,it was like
you were my little girl again,and i was your hero.

394
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,340
Dad,you still are.

395
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,310
Nah. You got a great guy
now,and he is. He's great.

396
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,150
I just don't think i... Handled it well.

397
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,850
Well,the reason i can pick a great guy is
because i have a fantastic one for a dad.

398
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,980
Now hamburger
production-- boy,oh,boy.

399
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,510
Y- you want to talk about
nightmares,i mean these--

400
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,650
Ernest hemingway once said
that life is a "moveable feast."

401
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,660
I think what he meant is that there's an instinctive
human desire to mix the ingredients of our lives...

402
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,460
Preparing a far richer meal than if
those ingredients had never come together.

403
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,750
So this parrot walks
into a taco stand--

404
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,950
Daddy no.....
