1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,380
a chae to rebuild your life from the ground up

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,920
is a pretty big job,

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,660
especially when there are 
cracks in your foundation,

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,110
but an important tool is self-respect,

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,360
being able to look yourself in the mirror

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,110
and like what you see.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,140
paper or plastic?

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,280
hey... there.

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,430
i was just,um,bringing you guys some food.

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,480
i mean,you're always feeding me,so...

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,820
now we are...

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,600
- even. 
- you know,if you got a job,

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,670
you wouldn't have to 
steal food from your parents.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,600
i'm looking,but i just don't
want to have a job.

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,690
i want to have the job,you know.

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,830
- i mean,i quit my last job because 
- because you made a lot of money doing bad things.

17
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,740
can i finish? because...

18
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,090
i made a lot of money doing bad things,

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,520
but now i just want to do
something that is meaningful.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,430
i mean,you're the one who said 
that i was cut out for better things,right?

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,100
that was when the leaves were green,

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,360
look at all the pretty fall colors.

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,210
i'm very close.

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,320
i sent out my rÉSum?to every 
single charitable organization

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,050
and nonprofit in chicago,
and i posted it online.

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,330
online?

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,150
you know,if you watched the 
local news like a normal person,

28
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,590
you'd realize that's how the perverts get you.

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,200
well,i will take that risk...

30
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,850
and the creamed corn.

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,790
sam,you have six e-mails
here from a "mr. footsiepants."

32
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,170
ugh! just delete those. god,he is relentless.

33
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,580
plus,it doesn't matter,
because in about 30 minutes,

34
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,610
i have an interview with 
a certain b.m.e. foundation.

35
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,190
they help the poor or the 
sad or feeble or something.

36
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,980
i was just too excited to rd the whole thing.

37
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,480
hey,sammy. you look great.

38
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,180
you're definitely gonna get that job.

39
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,510
todd?

40
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,230
sammy,it's me. look me in the eye.

41
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,710
you have to remember your own brother.

42
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,120
seth,i told you she wouldn't think it was funny.

43
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,090
sam,this is seth. he's an old friend of ours.

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,300
okay,mine.

45
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,340
great. it's nice to meet you.

46
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,780
yeah,he's just,uh,moved back from florida

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,270
and needs a place to crash.

48
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,620
oh. okay. can i talk to you for a sec?

49
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,330
yeah.

50
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,690
what are you doing?

51
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,490
- he can't crash here. 
- why not?

52
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,880
- because you're already crashing here. 
- no,i'm not crashing here.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,230
i pay rent. i'm your roommate.

54
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,040
well,then,you know,it's 
just-it's too many men.

55
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,460
all right,just with you,

56
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,220
the soap in the shower looks like a hamster.

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,490
this is my home. i can have
friends stay over if i want.

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,510
oh,really?

59
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,950
well,how would you like it if 
i just,like,all of a sudden

60
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,310
brought home one of my sketchy 
girlfriends to spend the night?

61
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,860
why,is heidi back in town?

62
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,570
okay,i don't even want to know.

63
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,020
hey,those are my tweezers...

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,450
by which i mean they are your tweezers.

65
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,340
hi. here are the shoes you
 wanted for the interview.

66
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,090
thank you. how do i look?

67
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,780
nothing works. huh?

68
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,630
except those earrings. 
can i borrow those,actually?

69
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,730
i have a meeting today.

70
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,900
oh,yes. now i'm gonna be late.

71
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,870
hello,ann-drea.

72
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,210
seth.

73
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,250
oh,god. it's back.

74
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,200
that's right,

75
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,520
and i'm carrying your baby.

76
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,050
i hoped you were dead. i 
mean,i heard you were dead,

77
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,380
and then i hoped it was true.

78
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,160
well,i don't know if you follow pro basketball,

79
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,970
but i just signed on with chicago.

80
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,560
still a towel boy?

81
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,710
still a lawyer?

82
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,310
that was a good one.

83
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,930
okay,is this better?

84
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,130
oh,no,no,no,no,no. wide belts are out.

85
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,290
look,i'm not just a clich? i keep up.

86
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,530
why am i listening to a thong inspector?

87
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,710
hello?

88
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,650
hello?

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,960
is any-hello. is anybody here?

90
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,760
i'm here for the interview.

91
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,540
please don't be perverts. 
my mother will never shut up.

92
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,010
five minutes early. impressive.

93
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,200
though on time would seem less desperate.

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,020
oh,my god. what are you 
doing here? i'm your interview.

95
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,530
you? you're b.m.e.? best mom ever.

96
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,500
oh! i changed belts three times for this?

97
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,460
- and that's the one you picked? 
- i'm out of here.

98
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,030
- oh,no. samantha,you're not going anywhere.
- why not?

99
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,090
- 'cause i have your keys. that's why. 
- no,give me those.

100
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,050
no,no,no,no,no. give me them back.

101
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,510
i'll give them back to you once you hear me out.

102
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,180
i have four words to say-
 "you," "me," "real," "estate."

103
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,510
i have four more words-

104
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,850
"i'll," "take," "the," "bus."

105
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,630
samantha!

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,830
samantha.

107
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,880
samantha!

108
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,950
now you said you wanted to do good.

109
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,520
what's better than putting families in homes?

110
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,860
you like families,don't you?

111
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,780
in theory,yes. they sound 
a lot better on paper.

112
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,230
look,all we need is your license.

113
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,080
i'll do all the work. i got us
 that building back there.

114
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,040
if we sell it,

115
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,010
you'll be able to pay your
bills for three months

116
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,110
with the 30% commission
that you're going to make.

117
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,650
you mean 50%.

118
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,360
wow. i heard you were good. deal.

119
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,460
no. no.i did not leave real estate 
to go back into real estate.

120
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,090
what kind of mother would i be
if i allowed you to starve to death?

121
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,460
what are you trying to prove? 
you finally lost those 5 pounds.

122
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,090
well,what about you? i thought 
dad didn't want you to work.

123
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,670
well,he also doesn't want his daughter

124
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,160
foraging for food in dumpsters like a bear.

125
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
i am not a charity case,okay?

126
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,410
i am an intelligent and capable woman.

127
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,270
in fact,i happen to have 
several promising offers from...

128
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,840
mr. footsiepants.

129
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,300
okay. okay. i will do it. but just for now.

130
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,230
i know. i understand. i know that 
you don't want to do this foreve

131
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,490
but,you know,until you do,listen.

132
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,170
we have a showing tomorrow morning,

133
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,490
and i've made up some fake listings so that 
people will think we've done this before.

134
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,800
no. no. no fake anything,all right?

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,020
i have done that before,

136
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,410
and this time,i'm not gonna lie about it,

137
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,090
and i'm not going to compromise
myself. understand?

138
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,520
absolutely. no lying of any kind.

139
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,270
okay. thank you.

140
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,560
starting now.

143
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,870
Samantha Who S2 ep04

144
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,790
???

145
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,540
- so much light.
- isn't there?

146
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,940
you know-oh,and i shouldn't be saying this-

147
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,190
but this is our favorite 
listing. isn't it,samantha?

148
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,760
mm,it's certainly up there.

149
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,580
oh,that sounds terrible,like 
having a favorite child.

150
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
do you have children?

151
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,130
no,no,but one day.

152
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,680
mm. god forbid.

153
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,330
really? 'cause the architecture is fantastic.

154
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,160
it has all the detail of an early hans laqul.

155
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,400
you have a very good eye.

156
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,310
yeah,but it's not. it's not.

157
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,330
um,actually,the buildings on eher side are,

158
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,950
but this one was built about 
30 years later by an imitator.

159
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,470
which makes it even more rare.

160
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,420
wow. your honesty is so refreshing.

161
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,240
isn't it? isn't she just...

162
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,550
we'll knock off $30,000 if you buy it right now.

163
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,810
apparently,we're in a very unstable market.

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,030
funny. i like that.

165
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,690
another realtor. awkward. 
i'll take it outside.

166
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,630
oh,take your time,

167
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,380
give us a chance to call our other buyers.

168
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,780
he seems nice.

169
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,470
yeah. what are you doing?

170
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,510
just improving your curb appeal.
it's obvious he likes you.

171
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,680
let's close this deal.

172
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,190
oh,that is just too bad.

173
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,540
i was really looking forward
to working with you.

174
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,500
i'm so sorry we couldn't close the deal.

175
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,080
oh,jeez. could you get that for me,please?

176
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,190
no. this is what i'm talking about.

177
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,190
i'm not gonna compromise
myself for this job,okay?

178
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,910
samantha,it's called sales.

179
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,190
real estate is not about selling a building.

180
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,530
it's about selling yourself.

181
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,490
no,selling yourself is actually
called...prostitution.

182
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,260
well,real estate is the second-oldt profession.

183
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,110
- no,it's not. i know i have amnesia,
but at least i know that. it is not. 
- is,too.it's so. it's-

184
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,180
man,those people didn't make me laugh once.

185
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,990
oh. you know,owen,you must
have an awful lot of questions.

186
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,330
why don't the three of us
 discuss this over drinks?

187
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,750
i could do that.

188
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,270
oh,shoot. you know,it's just
 gonna be the two of you.

189
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,200
i just remembered i have another showin have fun.

190
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,310
- regina! 
- not now. can't talk. phone's ringing.

191
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,540
senator!

192
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,380
um,so if you do plan on bing this building here,

193
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,250
i just want you to know that

194
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,370
i'm gonna be completely honest 
with you about all of its faults.

195
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,730
i know. that's so weird.

196
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,410
are you new at this?

197
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,100
no,no,actually,i've been d
oing it for quite a while.

198
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,350
i just haven't been working 
that long with my mom... ster.

199
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,690
i- i call my sister "momster."

200
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,110
oh. yeah,no.

201
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,270
just 'cause she's kind of like 
a mother and a-and a monster.

202
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,650
you look hot.

203
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,650
thank you.

204
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,220
let's please just try to keep 
this about business,okay?

205
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,850
no,hot,like...

206
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,430
yeah.

207
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,540
don't be nervous. it wastes energy.

208
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,040
plus,when i was in africa,
they told me it attracts bees.

209
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,810
you went to africa? oh,that's so funny.

210
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,300
i went to africa. oh,i mean,
um,uh,miami beach,but yeah.

211
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,080
what,uh,why did you go to africa?

212
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,770
i was making water with the sun.

213
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,510
wow. that's really beautiful.

214
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,390
i'm sorry. what does that mean? i don't know.

215
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,670
it means one of my companies,uh,builds solar still

216
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,510
which makes potable water for 
areas suffering drought.

217
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,110
mm. so...

218
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,350
you do good for people.

219
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,230
that's what you do.

220
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,870
well,i try.

221
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,450
mm. so if someone ever 
asks you,"what do you do?"

222
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,580
you-you just say,"good."

223
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,400
yeah,that's why i want to get the building,

224
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,850
'cause i want to convert it into 
solar-powered green spaces,

225
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,170
so that low-income families 
don't have to pay for energy.

226
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,460
can i get some potable 
water over here? please.

227
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,200
sorry.

228
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,680
i kind of get a little geeky
 when i talk about this stuff.

229
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,640
no. no,it's not- it's not geeky at all.

230
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,490
i- i love it.

231
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,680
we should,uh,talk about the building,right?

232
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,730
yes.

233
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,230
yes,we should talk about the building.

234
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,920
please don't tell my momster.

235
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,610
oh,we had such a magical night.

236
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,070
we had drinks,and then we had dinner,

237
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,350
and then we had coffee,and -

238
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,660
then you slept with him to sell him a building.

239
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,290
no. we spent the entire evening
 just getting to know each other.

240
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,860
like,his-let's see. his,um,
his middle name is david.

241
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,580
he's allergic to raisins,

242
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,650
and he lives this completely green lifestyle.

243
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,310
i mean,his whole house is green.

244
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,890
cept for the ceilings. they're white.

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,510
i tried to have a one-night
standon a plane once,

246
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,380
but we crossed the international date line,

247
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,230
so it ended up being a 2-night stand,but...

248
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,590
it was not a one-night stand,okay?

249
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,610
owen and i had a connection.

250
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,650
ooh. us,too. yeah,we 
switched planes in hong kong.

251
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,650
anywho,oh,he is just such an amazing person.

252
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,170
did i tell you guys that he makes
water for thirsty people?

253
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,660
i mean,how sexy is that?

254
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,990
guys,i really- i think i like him.

255
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,940
i like someone,too-seth.

256
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,430
oh,that's so funny,'cause you also hate seth.

257
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,910
but i like basketball players,and 
seth can get me to tony dane,

258
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,760
my favorite player on the team.

259
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,870
andrea,no.

260
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,740
you're not gonna pretend to like 
seth to go mee(@a guy,are you?

261
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,840
well,i am not trying to sell him a building.

262
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,410
we had a connection.

263
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,430
i slept with him because 
we care about each other,

264
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,180
and we both want to save the world.

265
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,730
those are the only reasons i have sex,too,

266
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,930
exceptor the guy on the plane.

267
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,420
i have such a soft spot for copilots.

268
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,080
hey,frank.

269
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,300
- miss newly? 
- mm-hmm?

270
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,950
a nice young man driving an electric car

271
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,770
puttered by and left you this.

272
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,560
don't say another word. don't 
cheapen this for me,frank.

273
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,340
i had a magical and unforgettable evening.

274
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,660
and at what point where you elected fire chief?

275
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,640
samantha newly,what did you do?

276
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,430
nothing.

277
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,380
what happened with owen yesterday?

278
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,670
yesterday? yesterday? nothing.

279
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,920
nothing. we had drinks,we talked,

280
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,440
we-just it was a little bit of drinking.

281
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,590
it was a lot of talking. why?

282
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,290
because he's not buying 
the building. that's why.

283
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,160
he's not? no. he found 
another building he likes better.

284
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,230
what other building? nuh-unh!

285
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,460
- i thought i told you to charm him. 
- i did charm him.

286
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,930
i... was very charming.

287
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,110
i bet she charmed the pants off him.

288
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,590
i don't understand. you've 
had so much experience.

289
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,270
there must be something 
wrg with your technique.

290
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,330
oh,my.

291
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,640
my technique is fine,mother.

292
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,370
obviously not. maybe could 
show you a thing or two.

293
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,250
no,i'll tell you- i'll tell you who knows
how to handle a businessman - your father.

294
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,660
oh,i give up. frank,see what you can do with her.

295
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,320
having a good day,frank?

296
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,090
best of my career.

297
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,970
we should be watching wrestling.

298
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,220
come in!

299
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,730
hello,andrea.

300
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,050
you should have been here five minutes ago.

301
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,570
- i was naked from the waist down. 
- because he sat on a pizza.

302
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,580
the point is,naked,waist down.

303
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,850
what's going on,andrea?

304
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,790
okay. this may sound stupid,

305
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,470
but i was thinking last night-

306
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,670
what were you wearing?

307
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,000
and i realized that maybe the 
reason you drive me crazy is that...

308
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,360
you drive me crazy.

309
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,680
okay. what?

310
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,000
okay. what? i'm-don't make me say it.

311
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,170
i want to take you to dinner tomorrow night.

312
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,020
oh,come on,seth. you're not
 falling for this,are you?

313
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,460
your eyes are so brown.

314
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,910
she's up to something.

315
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,270
yeah,and we're gonna get up to something,too,

316
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,040
- if you would just... shut up. 
- you have great hair.

317
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,840
thank you.

318
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,310
no,i'm serious,man. think about it.

319
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,130
i mean,she's her,and you're... you.

320
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,170
meaning what?

321
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,450
meaning she's hot,and you're
a guy who sits in pizza.

322
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,800
i mean,what are people gonna say when 
they see you two walking down the street?

323
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,830
either "a," i'm super talented
,or "b," i'm super loaded.

324
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,220
or that you're dying,and she's your last wish.

325
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,580
yeah,so dinner tomorrow night?okay.

326
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,880
wear something...

327
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,130
else.

328
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,430
and how could he not buy 
the building after i slept with him?

329
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,950
well,you didn't sleep with him 
to make him buy the building.

330
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,710
well,no,of course not. i slept 
with him because i like him.

331
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,790
i just kinda thought we were in 
a different place,you know?

332
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,260
like we're in the place where 
we buy each other's buildings.

333
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,980
thank you.

334
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,280
well,maybe he just likes your
 building more like a friend.

335
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,960
oh,god. i can't-i can't believe how stupid i am.

336
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,110
of course. i mean,why would he-

337
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,330
why would he buy the building

338
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,190
when he can get the realtor for free?

339
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,310
hey,i think you're lucky he didn't buy it.

340
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,690
how am i lucky?

341
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,650
because if he did,you'd always be wondering
if he did it because he owes you.

342
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,800
oh. oh,i get that. yeah.

343
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,360
- you know,like a whore. 
- i said i get it.

344
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,040
by his not buying your building,

345
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,820
it shows you how much he respects you.

346
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,780
you know,you're right.

347
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,040
you're absolutely right.

348
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,660
wow. i like him very much now.

349
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,960
hey. i got your message. what's up?

350
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,190
- good news. 
- what?

351
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,080
hey. samantha.

352
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,380
hey,you. uh,what are you- what are you doing here?

353
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,000
i'm buying your building.

354
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,450
- what? 
- aren't you excited?

355
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,540
thrilled.

356
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,260
why don't you just leave the 
money on the nightstand?

357
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,410
what is matter with you? you 
come back and behave yourself!

358
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,590
sorry. i - are you mad at me?

359
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,350
well,no,at first i wasn't,and then i-i was,

360
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,060
and then i wasn't again,but yojust couldn't
leave that alone,now could you?

361
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,950
you'll have to excuse my sister. 
she had a major head trauma.

362
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,160
we don't let her use scissors.

363
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,190
i - i didn't want to cause a thing here.

364
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,480
i just wanted to buy the building.

365
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,620
yeah,well,you should have thought
of that before you jumped in the sack.

366
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,090
yes,i slept with him. i hope you're happy,mom.

367
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,360
we hope you're happy,mom. god rest her 
soul. she died when we were really little.

368
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,320
i don't know what you think,

369
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,600
but this has nothing to do with 
what happened between us.

370
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,840
yeah,well,then why did you change your mind?

371
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,920
the other altor was lousy in bed.

372
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,640
too soon? sorry.

373
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,430
i just-i just got a bad vibe from the other guy.

374
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,580
i thought he was hiding things.

375
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,870
oh,well,lord knows we don't hide much.

376
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,050
don't start with me. this was your idea.

377
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,850
i did not tell you to go all the way.

378
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,490
it's not like we're trying to sell a mall.

379
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,290
samantha,i don't know what i did wrong,

380
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,800
but i know i did something,and i'm sorry.

381
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,480
and i'd like to make it up to you 
by not buying the building.

382
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,930
you would do that for me?

383
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,250
well,for you,samantha,

384
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,820
i would not buy every building in the world.

385
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,540
i'll take off $40,000. that's it.

386
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,400
thank you.

387
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,940
chili's.

388
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,110
i've passed this place a hundred times.

389
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,560
never thought to come in,though.

390
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,410
no,you're missing out. i 
mean,look at this right here.

391
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,160
crispy honey-chipotle chicken crispers.

392
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,200
i mean,you could stop at any one 
of those words and be very happy.

393
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,060
you know makes me really 
happy? how handsome you a.

394
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,980
are you doing something different?

395
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,480
i do a lot of things different.

396
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,670
some of 'em go over well,some of 'em don't.

397
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,920
and you smell...

398
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,250
amazing.

399
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,150
you wearing cologne?

400
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,990
no,i'm eating a ton of corn.

401
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,330
it makes me smell sweet,
like you,you little minx.

402
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,780
oh,my god. you touched my nose.

403
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,750
how hot.

404
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,660
we should do that dog thing

405
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,280
where we eat something until we kiss.

406
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,250
you know what i'm talking 
about? like this... come here.

407
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:55,660
woof. woof. woof. woof. woof.woof. woof.

408
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,480
no! no. i cannot do this. i'm an attorney.

409
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,910
and you're disgusting.

410
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,290
i'm going.

411
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,400
now? before you get a basketball
player's phone number?

412
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,310
what?

413
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,880
excuse me? basketball?

414
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,380
i don't know what you're talking about.

415
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,480
all right. i had you going,though,

416
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,520
with the whole woof,woof,woof,woof,woof.

417
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,640
all right. whose number do you want?

418
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,060
i got michael dently's,

419
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,600
tony dane's,dante roy's...

420
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,890
tony dane-that one.

421
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,780
oh,yeah. no,he's a good guy. he has a boat.

422
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,120
i love boats.

423
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,870
why are you doing this?

424
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,780
- well,i know how this thing ends.
-  what thing?

425
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,990
look,you're gonna go out with tony,

426
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,930
and you're gonna have fun and sex,

427
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,550
and he's gonna buy you a lot of
 blah,blah,blah,blah,blah.

428
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,220
but after a while,

429
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,360
you're gonna want something
different,something real,

430
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,440
someone who cares less about what's out there

431
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,490
- and more about what's inside. 
- uh,don't touch me.

432
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,570
and i'm gonna be there,'cause
i know it's right,and so do you.

433
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,710
you're crazy.

434
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,780
no,i'm right.

435
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,370
no,you're gross.

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,330
but this is really good,and i'm taking it.

437
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,580
hey,that's mine.

438
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,970
jeez,if i'd known you were
gonna carry me for ten blocks,

439
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,480
i wouldn't have had dessert.

440
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,550
no,it's my fault.

441
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,070
i walk everywhere,

442
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,670
and i forget that pretty girls
like to wear pretty shoes.

443
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,770
i'll call you tomorrow.

444
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,490
one way to build self-respect

445
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,060
is to surround yourself with people you admire...

446
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,500
who also admire you.

447
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,530
- i'm not carrying you to the elevator.
- shh

448
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,950
but at the end of the day,

449
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,450
no matter how much someone
else cares about you,

450
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,800
you have to respect yourself,

451
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,880
to be able to look yourself in the mirror.

452
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,150
sam,you're home late. long day?

453
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,650
uh. yeah.

454
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,660
yeah,i was-i was like,"mom,i want to go home,"

455
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,020
and she was like,"no."

456
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,610
yeah,i'm exhausted.

457
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,190
night.

458
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,240
i think your roommate has 
a roommate on the side.

459
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,100
<font color="#ffff00">welcome to www.1000fr.com</font>

460
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:16,930
darn it.
