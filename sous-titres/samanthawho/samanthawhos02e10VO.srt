1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,110
Being single is
completely underrated.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,710
You can use up all the
hot water for long baths,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,210
not share the popcorn

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,110
and hog the remote to
flip through 500 channels.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,010
This is helpful if you have amnesia.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,510
You can fill in decades of info

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,110
in the time it takes
your nail polish to dry.

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,110
Did you know that Hitler
had a mistress? What a jerk.

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,010
- History channel again?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,810
I only caught the second half, But
i think i pretty much got the gist.

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,110
Oh, look at this. You can
send coffee to the troops.

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,410
No. Put it down.

13
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,027
- Why? It's a very nice thing to do.
- I thought it was a nice thing, too,

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,510
So i sent a pound of
sumatra dark and a note

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,510
and got a note back from captain
Randy Holt saying thank you,

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,810
and so i, just to be polite,
e-Mailed back,"you're welcome,"

17
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,110
and then he e-Mailed me back,
"what's up?"

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,610
So now i feel like i'm cheating
on Chase and i led him on,

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,110
And i'm a coffee tease.

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,310
"Coffee, teas."

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,810
- See? The whole store knows!
- Oh, come on. Calm down.

22
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,010
You are not cheating on Chase.

23
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,610
All right? He's just a lonely
soldier who wants news from home.

24
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,710
You know, just keep it to,
like, small talk, you know?

25
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,810
Boring stuff, like, you know what?

26
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,110
Why don't you tell him that
story you told me three times

27
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,610
About your broken fridge...

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,327
hey.

29
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,510
Which i found thrilling,
but i think in his day,

30
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,410
It would be a nice break
from all the excitement.

31
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,027
Hey, Andrea...

32
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,410
I'm on a date.

33
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,110
You and Tony Dane are still texting?

34
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,577
- Come on. When are you gonna meet him?
- Bup. Bup.

35
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,010
Look, i know he's a big
basketball star and everything,

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,036
But he should take the time...

37
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,827
Why are you "bupping" me?

38
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,210
Look, it's okay.

39
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,210
You know, just 'cause
i'm not dating anyone

40
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,780
doesn't mean that you can't talk
to me about your relationship.

41
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:33,314
That is exactly what it means.

42
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:35,710
Every time you're not
dating someone and i am,

43
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,829
You do everything you can
to try and break us up.

44
00:01:38,216 --> 00:01:39,610
Come on. I will never do...

45
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,510
Oh, and of course, i'm wrong.

46
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,310
I'm gonna go to the little
girls'room. I'll be right back.

47
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,210
You guys make a great couple.

48
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,110
Andrea must be really happy If she's
gonna try and go off her meds again.

49
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,810
Whoa.

50
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,710
You work out, huh?

51
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,410
Huh.

52
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,610
That'll be helpful when Andrea's
husband gets out of prison.

53
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,810
Seriously?

54
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,310
You don't recognize her
from her "film" career?

55
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,610
No?

56
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,639
All right, look, i know that
used to happen,

57
00:02:15,722 --> 00:02:17,427
- but i am...
- different now.

58
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,010
- We know.
- Fine. Whatever. I will back off.

59
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,510
I just thought it would be a
nice story to tell your kids,

60
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,210
That mommy and daddy
actually met once.

61
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,772
Look, we're trying to meet.

62
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:31,310
We're just very high-Powered
people with very busy schedules.

63
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:35,327
Yeah, but it kinda seems like he's
the one who's always canceling on you...

64
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,100
Bup. Bah. Bah. Bah. I know.

Season 2 Episode 10
<i>My Best Friend's Boyfriend</i>

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,427
All right, turn on the tube.
The game starts in five minutes.

69
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,910
What channel is it on?

70
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,010
Todd? It's Cameron.
I didn't hear from you.

71
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,510
I just called to see if you
wanted to meet up some time.

72
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:58,627
Cameron?

73
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,010
The dancer with the legs
and the daddy issues.

74
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,410
What the hell, man?

75
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,410
It's not my call. I don't know.

76
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,910
Man, i'd be all over that.
And that girl at the Deli?

77
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,710
"Take a number. Here's mine."

78
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,910
They're dropping from trees out there.
What are you hanging around here for?

79
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,310
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

80
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,610
Hey.

81
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,010
Shut up.

82
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,410
Todd, come on.
What are you doing, man?

83
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,110
Well, you know, we've been hanging
out a lot lately... movies, dinners.

84
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,527
Maybe it'll grow from friends
into something else.

85
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,910
Todd, listen to me. You are
quickly becoming gay roommate.

86
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:37,027
If you want it to turn into something,
you gotta make her miss you.

87
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,110
- We live in the same apartment.
- Then get out. Be less available.

88
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,010
All right? Sam is smart.

89
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,610
Why buy the bull when you
can castrate it for free?

90
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,827
- Wow. That's...
That's beautiful, man.

91
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,710
Hey. Hey, Seth...

92
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,410
- You work for Tony Dane, right?
- Towel boy.

93
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,914
Mock if you will, my friend, but if
it weren't for me, he'd always be wet.

94
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:58,910
Yeah but, I don't like the way
that he is treating Andrea.

95
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,010
I mean, what... Why is
he stringing her along?

96
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,596
Does he not like her or something?

97
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:05,710
What is he afraid of commitment?
Like, what's the deal?

98
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,210
Well, i don't know. I'll... I'll The
next time we get our nails done.

99
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,210
Look, i need to talk to him, OK?

100
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,310
- Why?
- Because i owe her.

101
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,410
Look, i just need a way
to get to him... sethy.

102
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,622
- So what, i just go in?
- This is what you wanted.

103
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:23,097
Now here is your press pass.

104
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,610
If you get caught or
captured, i don't know you,

105
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,710
Because believe it or not, it is
possible for me to be demoted.

106
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,010
Really? Wow. Okay.

107
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,610
Good game. Good game.
Way to play. Way to play.

108
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,964
I'm sorry about that. That's a whole
lot of naked. That's a whole...

109
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,427
How did you guys give up 20 points
in the fourth quarter?

110
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,034
We gotta come to play every night.

111
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,369
Anyone in this league can
beat you any night of the week, so

112
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,510
you gotta rely on your teammates.
Any more questions?

113
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,610
Why do you keep canceling?

114
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,010
What paper are you with?

115
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,210
I happen to be with, uh...

116
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,610
"Heinie" Magazine.

117
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,862
Anyway, why do you
keep canceling on her?

118
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:04,510
What... What is it, are you a
commitment phobe or a big fat liar?

119
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,810
Which is it?

120
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,210
I'm not canceling on her.
She's canceling on me.

121
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,210
Really? That's weird.

122
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,510
Hey, Andrea.

123
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,010
- What did you do?
- Me? Nothin'. This and that.

124
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,910
- You?
- Oh, me? Me?

125
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,110
I got a text message from Tony Dane.

126
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,910
He said,"some crazy blonde
came into my locker room

127
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,510
and accused me of
always canceling on you."

128
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,291
That Paris Hilton.
God, she's everywhere.

129
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:36,292
You just had to get
involved, didn't you?

130
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,710
- I told you to leave it alone.
- Yeah, well, you know what?

131
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,010
You also told me that
he was canceling on you.

132
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,924
So you know what? You lied to
me, And i... That's one of the sins.

133
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:46,327
- Don't even!
- Why don't you want to see him?

134
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,810
Because! Because it is perfect.

135
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,810
We text each other all the time.
We share things. We never fight.

136
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:56,910
It is the best relationship i've
ever had, And you just destroyed it.

137
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,027
- I guess you managed to hear all that.
- Some.

138
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,753
Mostly, i was writing a poem.

139
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,710
Ooh. Blah.

140
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,510
Excuse me. Excuse me.

141
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,127
Hey.

142
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,930
I am completely afraid

143
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,803
that a bug is gonna crawl down
my throat when i'm asleep.

144
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,010
I saw that on the discovery
channel last night.

145
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,310
When did you start thinking
that your life needed a narrator?

146
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,010
Everyone is afraid of
something, all right?

147
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,810
Go out with Tony.

148
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,710
You need more than
a text relationship, Andrea.

149
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,010
You deserve that.

150
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,510
- And Tony likes you.
- No. No.

151
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,710
He likes the stuff
my phone says i say.

152
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,710
Okay? I mean, i could
be this perfect person,

153
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,710
And i plan every word, and
i could spell-check myself.

154
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,810
I mean, what if i meet him, and every
word that just comes out of my mouth

155
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,710
is just misspelled?

156
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,410
Well, if that's what you're
worried about, i'll go with you.

157
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,397
I'll bring Todd. We can be like

158
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,227
the Ricardos and the Mertzes...
The Flintstones and the Rubbles.

159
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,535
- I've been watching way too much tv.
- Yes.

160
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,010
Mr. Newly, hi. I have a situation.

161
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,610
I've been writing to a soldier in iraq,
and i may have mentioned in a letter

162
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,110
that my refrigerator's broken.
Today this one showed up.

163
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:17,127
And if my boyfriend...
My real boyfriend, Chase,

164
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,210
sees it at my place,
he'll know i'm cheating.

165
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,010
Regina, it's for you!

166
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,310
Hey, Todd,
will you bring me my purse?

167
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,353
Is the man of the house at home?

168
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,710
- I was getting this for Samantha.
- Yeah, that's better.

169
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:43,693
Before i forget, We are going out
with Andrea tomorrow night, okay?

170
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:48,410
No.

171
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,910
- No?
- No. Not available.

172
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,807
Not even gonna say why.

173
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,110
Okay, well, i just thought You might
wanna hang out with Tony Dane,

174
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,110
But i guess i was wrong.

175
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,210
Yeah! 8:00.

176
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,610
This is you playing hard to
get, huh? So far i've only seen "get."

177
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,115
I'm hanging out with Tony Dane.

178
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,710
I can still ignore sam. In fact, this
way, She can see me ignore her.

179
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,914
- It'll drive her nuts, huh? Up high!
- Gay.

180
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:24,215
- Shut up.
- Roommate.

181
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,010
This is in farsi.

182
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,210
I should have stopped
writing captain Randy.

183
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,427
Sam said it was okay,

184
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,610
but now look the poor guy is
sending me major appliances.

185
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,510
I mean, i-I have to get out of
this. It's tearing me apart.

186
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,410
I can't keep living two lives.

187
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,260
Honey, i don't think
you're living one.

188
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,527
You gotta break up with this guy.

189
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,810
I can't break up with a soldier. I have
a <i>support the troops</i> sticker on my car.

190
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,610
Oh, then let me do it. Please?

191
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,555
I haven't broken up
with anyone for so long.

192
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,527
- It'll make me feel like a teenager.
- No, it's my responsibility.

193
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,610
I'm... I'm just gonna
go and... And do it now.

194
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,610
Fine. Leave, but don't come back.

195
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,610
- Excuse me?
- No.

196
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,910
Please don't...

197
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,510
Don't make this any
harder than it needs to be.

198
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,810
We had our chance, but
our chance came and went.

199
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,710
People change.

200
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,510
So just...

201
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,710
Just walk away...

202
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,410
And always remember
the times that we had.

203
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,110
You are so hired.

204
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,510
Hello? Thirsty.

205
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,127
- Mm.
- My drink?

206
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,910
You know, I forgot you were there

207
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,499
You know what? I should go.

208
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,210
Yeah, i have a big tort
complaint to prepare for,

209
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,810
And you don't even know what that
is, So you can't say i'm lying.

210
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,810
- Yeah.
- Here he comes.

211
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,760
You see? He hates me.

212
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,810
He doesn't. Just breathe, okay?

213
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,435
Andrea? Oh, it was
definitely worth the wait.

214
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,410
High-Lo.

215
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,410
I mean to say "hi," and...
then i thought,"hello,"

216
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,310
And it came out like,"high-Lo."

217
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,910
Let me start again.

218
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,010
High-Lo.

219
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,610
Now Philly... That's
a tough town to play in.

220
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,710
Huh.

221
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,710
So are you two together or what?

222
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,910
- We used to be, we just live together.
- Nope. I'm alone. Lone wolf.

223
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,946
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Yeah.

224
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,810
Oh, excuse me.

225
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,110
- Gay?
- Trust me.

226
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,510
Yeah, well, he wasn't
before he went.

227
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,810
He... He took the urinal right next
to me, And then there was a look.

228
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,357
How does that make him gay?

229
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,326
- And then there was a nod.
- Okay, a look and a nod. That's it?

230
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,424
And a smile. There was a look,
a nod and a smile.

231
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,127
The only thing missing
was ice skates.

232
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,610
- Ice skates?
- Well, figure skaters are gay, right?

233
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,810
Look, I don't know.
This is not my scene.

234
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,763
Sam. Sam, come here.

235
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,410
Do not say anything, all right?
This is going really well,

236
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,910
And i'm not gonna let
anything screw it up. Okay?

237
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:30,226
Yeah?

238
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,727
Tony just said the most amazing
thing. Go ahead. Say it again.

239
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,510
- I just said i liked her shoes.
- No, no, no.

240
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,410
He said he liked my
vintage Lacroix shoes.

241
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,116
I mean, really, what kind of man
notices something like that?

242
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,010
Sam, thoughts?

243
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,110
Look at her. She likes him.

244
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,210
Maybe she can change him.
It's possible, you know.

245
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,510
They have camps for that.
I saw it on the bible channel.

246
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,410
- Look, just tell her.
- Tell her what?

247
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,810
That she's in love with a gay
man? I can't tell her that.

248
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,710
She's just gonna think that i'm
sabotaging her relationship again.

249
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,725
- So don't tell her.
- She's in love with a gay.

250
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,427
How can i not tell her?
She's gonna get hurt.

251
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,710
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're right. You're right.

252
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,510
I don't tell her. I show her.

253
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,710
So if she sees it for herself,
then she can't be mad at me, right?

254
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,810
Thank you so much. You
are such a good friend. Oh!

255
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,310
Wait. Friend?
No, no, no, I'm not your...

256
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,074
Damn it.

257
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,210
Hmm? Like it?

258
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,910
"Hey, look at me.
I'm a breakup artist."

259
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,310
Nice stove.

260
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,810
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:36,506
He wrote and told me how hard it was for
him over there, and i wanted to relate,

262
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,810
I told him the pilot light
on my stove kept going out.

263
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,010
You were supposed to be
helping me out of this.

264
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,727
I couldn't do it.

265
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,527
I might be the only thing
keeping him alive at night.

266
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,118
Who are you keeping alive at night?

267
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,810
- My soldier.
- Oh, i'll break up with him.

268
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,710
I fire people all the time.
No problem.

269
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,110
But nobody buys my wife a stove.

270
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,310
Including you.

271
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,510
Damn right.

272
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,210
Look at it.

273
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,110
You begged for it. Look at it.

274
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,310
Tony, you know, um, Todd and i
were... were talking this morning

275
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,910
about what our favorite characters
on "Sex and the City" were,

276
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,210
and i was just curious
what yours was.

277
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,510
You know, i've... I've never... I've
never seen "Sex and the City."

278
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,527
Mm-Hmm.

279
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,610
That's okay.

280
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,210
You know, let's put on
some music, all right?

281
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,910
Hey, Tony, you can pick, 'cause
you're... you're the guest.

282
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,710
We have Foo Fighters,

283
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,010
Metallica,

284
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,710
"Mamma Mia."

285
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,977
Hey, what's your
favorite musical, Tony?

286
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,510
I'm really not into musicals.

287
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,710
Oh, really? So we're gonna
play it that way, huh?

288
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,510
Uh, andrea, i need to get some more
wine. Will you help me open up a bottle?

289
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,810
- Okay
- good.

290
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,610
You guys have fun.

291
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,210
I like him.

292
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,510
Oh, me, too. You know, i think we...

293
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,240
I think you should
have sex with him.

294
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:55,510
- What?
- Yeah, right now. Just try.

295
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,810
And then observe
what happens, you know?

296
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,806
If he says he's not in the mood, then...
then you tell him to get in the mood

297
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,010
or explain why not. Okay?

298
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,910
- That sounds kinda hot.
- Yeah, it is, kinda.

299
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,410
But i like him. I really do.

300
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,110
I think i kinda want to
take it slow with him.

301
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,310
Oh, my god.

302
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,110
Maybe some of the new
u is rubbing off on me.

303
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,510
Ah.

304
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,901
Now?

305
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,110
Oh, god.

306
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,262
What are you doing leaving
me out there with him?

307
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:29,910
- I'm a pleaser. You know that.
- Look, Andrea is just not getting it.

308
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,596
I need you to sleep with Tony Dane.

309
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,612
- Sorry?
- We already know that he likes you,

310
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:37,210
so we just need him to, like,
hit on you in front of her.

311
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,417
I know what we could do.
We could go in there.

312
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,810
We could all start dancing,
and then I'll switch,

313
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,027
And then you can start dancing
with Tony and i'll start dancing with...

314
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,758
Then you start dancing with him.

315
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:49,527
- Let's just open this up a little bit.
- Will you just cut it out?

316
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,915
Put some oil on there because
i think it needs to shimmer.

317
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:54,669
Stop it! What you doing?
I'm not your toy,

318
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:58,010
i'm not your pal, not your girlfriend,
and i'm not your gay roommate.

319
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,010
I'm here, okay? Right here.

320
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,310
And i guess that's the problem.

321
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,010
Drama queen, huh?

322
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,410
Snap.

323
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,227
- Where's Andrea?
- Bathroom.

324
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,410
Oh, good.
Then it's just the two of us.

325
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,306
All right, Tony, come on.
You can be straight with me.

326
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,882
- I'm sorry. That's a very poor choice
of words. - What you talking about?

327
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,110
- Tony, i think you know.
- Do i?

328
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,110
Tony, i know what happened in
the men's room with todd, okay?

329
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,010
And Andrea is my best friend,

330
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,210
and i'm not gonna stand
by and let her get hurt.

331
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,010
Look, she's gonna understand,

332
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:40,835
you know? I have admitted
so many horrible things to her,

333
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:43,671
and she's always forgiven me.
Not that being gay is horrible

334
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:46,553
or needs to be forgiven or anything
like that. I actually think it's good.

335
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,527
Go, gays!

336
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,610
So...

337
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,310
- Hey.
- Hey.

338
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,910
Uh, what's going on?

339
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,310
Andrea, um...

340
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,410
This i't easy to say.

341
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,810
It's okay. It's okay, Tony.
It's all right.

342
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,410
Andrea, Tony has something
that he needs to tell you.

343
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,010
- Sam tried to hit on me.
- What?!

344
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,027
Sam!

345
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,327
No! No. What?

346
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,017
I don't want to come between you two,
but i think we should just go.

347
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,710
I was not hitting on him. I
was not hitting on you.

348
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,410
I was... Why would i hit on him?

349
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,810
He's gay!

350
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,607
Yeah, you're gay.

351
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,210
He's gay.

352
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,210
There. Oh, god, i said it.
I said it.

353
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,610
Whew. Big weight lifted now.

354
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,610
Oh, honey, he is gay.

355
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,610
Oh, my god.

356
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,310
Honestly, Sam,
A new low, even for you.

357
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,810
- What? No.
- Mm!

358
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,510
He's gay.

359
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,810
He was staring at Todd's...

360
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,160
Maybe Andrea is right, maybe i do have
some sort of pathological

361
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,627
need to destroy
all of her relationships.

362
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,110
You know, it's, like, i don't
know if Tony Dane is gay.

363
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:55,427
I could be totally wrong.

364
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,898
My boyfriend in college was gay.
We didn't know it at the time.

365
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,474
I mean, he knew it,
and all the members of the,

366
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:03,411
you know, man alive choir,
but i did not see it.

367
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,827
Yeah. Now andrea hasn't
called me back for two days.

368
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,510
Todd's avoiding me. He
leaves before i even get up.

369
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,127
Did you do something make him mad?

370
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,210
Like ask him to oil up
and seduce tony dane?

371
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,510
Hmm. No. Just that.

372
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,310
Hi.

373
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,810
Hey, guys.

374
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,110
Hey.

375
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,710
- Guess who's gay.
- No one. No one's gay,

376
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,420
And anyone who says that
they are just kidding themselves.

377
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,810
Tony Dane.

378
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,810
Maybe not. Maybe i'm
just being narrow-minded.

379
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,810
You know what? In Europe,
straight guys... they hold hands,

380
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,110
they walk right on...
They walk right on down the street.

381
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,410
No, he's gay. He told me himself.

382
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:42,327
He did?

383
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,510
You know that i was not
trying to break you guys up.

384
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,234
Yes, and today we're leaking
our relationship to the press.

385
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,127
I know that i'm the one
with amnesia,

386
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,527
but that still means when two
guys love each other and they...

387
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,110
No, look, this is all good.

388
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,310
Tony gets to have me on his arm, and i
get paparazzi, press and private planes,

389
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,310
And i get to see
whoever i want in secret,

390
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,310
So you know what, Sam?
You were right.

391
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,610
I need more out of
a relationship... Fame.

392
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,410
Okay.

393
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,079
Are you sure that this is
what you want?

394
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:15,827
Yes.

395
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,410
- Really?
- Hey. Bup.

396
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,810
It's just a little weird to
have a guy who's just a friend.

397
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,610
It doesn't have to be. I
mean, look at me and todd.

398
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,010
No, it only works
if one of you is gay.

399
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,827
Why?

400
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,027
Because there's always one of you that
wants something more than the other one.

401
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,510
Usually me.

402
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,310
Or Todd.

403
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,410
Oh, God. I am such an idiot.

404
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,910
Of course he was mad i was
trying to put oil on him.

405
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,129
- Who wants to be treated like that?
- Chase.

406
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,796
He loves when I take baby oil...

407
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,710
Ew. Bup-Bup.
Bup-Bup.

408
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,510
I saw this thing the discovery channel
or something about the theory of matter,

409
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,110
That matter exists
in different forms.

410
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,610
I think the same
thing applies to love.

411
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,810
Love is like liquid. It can flow
outward and bring life to a desert...

412
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,210
he's very charming.

413
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,410
You know, he's only on leave for
a week. Just show him a good time.

414
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,810
I can't show him a good time.
You show him a good time.

415
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,510
- Regina, it's for you!
- Hey.

416
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,110
Love can be a gas... Light as air and
assuming the shape of its container...

417
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,410
I mean, it's crazy. I have been
so busy with other people's lives

418
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,910
That i have paid no attention
to what's happening in mine.

419
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,127
Like Todd

420
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,810
I mean, if he has feelings for
me, We need to talk about that

421
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,910
and about my feelings
about his feelings for me

422
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,310
or if i have feelings for him
and my feelings about that.

423
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,510
You know?

424
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:40,912
So i'm just gonna open up some wine

425
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:42,844
and settle in for a nice chat.

426
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,710
White wine and feelings...
He's a very lucky man.

427
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,610
Good night, miss Newly.

428
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,010
Good night, Frank.

429
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,710
Hey, Todd?

430
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,310
Hey. Can we just talk about some...

431
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,032
Hi.

432
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,510
You there.

433
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:04,536
Hi.

434
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,787
Hi.

435
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,410
Sam, this is Cameron.

436
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,295
We were just going out.

437
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:12,810
Yeah. Okay, good. Hi.

438
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,810
Th's... You'll like that.
Yeah. And him.

439
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,310
You'll like him,
'cause he's not... gay.

440
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,610
You wanted to talk?

441
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,510
Me? No. I'm good.

442
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,710
Have fun. Yeah.

443
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,310
Plus, i only got enough
wine for one, so...

444
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,910
So yeah.

445
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,910
And like matter, love can't
be created or destroyed.

446
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,010
It's always there, even
if you can't see it,

447
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,310
Even if it's right
there in front of you.
