1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,650
a million decisions every
day-- some big and some small,

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,710
and it's not always obvious
which is which, like this one.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,180
We've all been there-- whether to tell your new
boyfriend that you live with your ex-boyfriend.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,120
Could be as big as a freight train
or as tiny as an electric car.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,890
I just love driving
in your little toy car.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,900
It's like riding in a snow globe.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,690
Neat.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,440
So... can I come up this time?

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,790
Up where? Stairs? Upstairs?

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,410
No. I, um, I'm--I'm
not ready yet.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,460
You remember that we already
slept together, right?

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,690
Yeah. No, no, I'm just not ready
for you to--to--to just see it...

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,800
all messy and stuff. It's
like a guy lives there.

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,070
I just-- I have
this desire...

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,160
just to know... everything... about you.

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,440
Let me just check with frank about,
um, a package I was expecting.

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,520
Frank. Um, question.

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,640
Has that package from the
todd company arrived yet?

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,580
You know, the one that would
make it too crowded for owen

20
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,630
to come upstairs.

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,850
Yoknow, the
tall, the one--

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,370
yes, I understand what package you mean.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,850
Right, right, right.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,760
It's cold out there.

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,140
We could use some global
warming right about now, huh?

26
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,060
so what do you say, should I plug
this thing in and we go upstairs?

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,740
Oh, you quit that sexy talk.

28
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,300
no. Next time, okay?

29
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,380
Andrea, you're always saying
you have excellent taste.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,830
What do you think? Huh?

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,670
I think you're very lonely.

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,220
I'm photographing the, uh, fund-raiser
calendar for the newfie rescue.

33
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,040
What makes a better april, huh?

34
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,640
Mr. Cellophane dressed
as the... easter bunny.

35
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,080
Oh, that's so weird. I was
just about to fake a phone call.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,420
hello, andrea. It's se.
Don't hang up, please.

37
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,510
Seth, I told you to stop calling me.

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,460
No. You already gave me
tony dane's phone number,

39
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,770
so unless you turn into an even more
famous basketball player and I go blind,

40
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,490
I don't need you anymore.Yeah.

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,160
- Get them away from me.
- okay.

42
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,910
Put 'em away.

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,740
So... listen. Last night...

44
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,180
Todd and owen almost ran into
each other again, and I was like,

45
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,890
I cannot keep up this
charade any longer.

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,330
So I decided I'm gonna come clean.

47
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,970
I'm gonna tell 'em both.

48
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,370
Thank you. thank you. I am so relieved.

49
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,150
Who are you gonna tell first?

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,470
You couldn't let me just have
that for one second, could you?

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,110
You look stunning tonight.

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,630
Bartender, I did not order this.

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,050
I told you to stop
bothering me. Now scoot.

54
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,260
I'm meeting tony over drinks.

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,270
No, you're meeting seth here for drinks.

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,300
I texted you with tony's phone.

57
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,320
You little sleaze.

58
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,780
Well, you wouldn't return my messages.

59
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,510
You kept hanging up on me.

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,610
How was I supposed to
get in touch with you?

61
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,440
But the good news is, we get to stare
into each other's eyes all night.

62
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,600
Ready? And go.

63
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,530
Oh, I'm going.

64
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

65
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,690
Let me tell you why I've
been trying to reach you.

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,960
Tony won't call you back
until he sees a picture.

67
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,290
A picture? That is so superficial.

68
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,050
Didn't you tell him
how incredibly hot I am?

69
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,670
Look, he's used to dating celebrities,
models-- people that he's seen,

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,780
people that we've all seen,
people that have been in rehab.

71
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,090
I can do rehab.

72
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,650
I've done all the work leading up to it.

73
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,660
Just send him a picture.

74
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,630
but don't make that face.

75
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,550
Don't make that one.

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,880
Shut up.

77
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,000
And then I realized that my
wallet was in the composting heap.

78
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,330
god, you are so funny, which reminds me, I
have something really terrible to tell you.

79
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,530
And look, I-I-I feel so bad
that it's taken me this long,

80
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,800
but I was just scared that you were gonnae
freaked t, which you have absolutely no reason to be.

81
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,480
What is it? You have a fur coat?
You own some alligator shoes?

82
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,210
I have a roommate.

83
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,560
That's it? That's why I
couldn't come upstairs?

84
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,350
The other thing is, he's a guy...

85
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,610
who's not gay, and I know that because
we've slept together, like, a million times.

86
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,300
Okay, look. My roommate
is my ex-boyfriend todd.

87
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,970
And--and--and--and look, you don't--you
don't have to worry about a thing.

88
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,170
There is absolutely
nothing going on between us.

89
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,670
I also have alligator shoes.

90
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,000
I just want to get that all out.

91
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,640
And a matching bag.

92
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,110
I don't know why I held that back.

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,840
Are you mad?

94
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,750
I'm relieved.

95
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,270
I didn't want to tell you either, but
my best friend is my ex-girlfriend.

96
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,680
You have a todd?

97
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, willow. Yeah. I didn't
know how to tell you either.

98
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean, we went out for a long
time, and then when we broke up,

99
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,430
we realized that we could
be, like, just friends.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,700
Just
friends--that's cool.

101
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:16,310
I guess, you know, for most people,
it's strange to be friends with your ex.

102
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,550
Look at us, sitting here,
all evolved and everything,

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
No, evolution is great.

104
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,420
Yeah, you don't want to
be like monkeys, you know?

105
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,910
It's le, "get out of that tree, monkey.

106
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,750
"Get out of that willow
tree. Get off that willow..."

110
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,880
Sohat if owen is best
friends with his ex, you know?

111
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,520
I-I trust him, and it just
shouldn't bother me, so...

112
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,370
but it does.

113
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,780
It does. It really, really does.

114
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,480
I wouldn't like it if chase was
still friends with his ex-wife.

115
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,730
Even if the courts allowed i I wouldn'T.

116
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,300
You know, I have a todd, and--and there's
absolutely nothing going on with my todd.

117
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,470
Women can have a todd.

118
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,510
Men get a todd, and they do what
they do with everything they get--

119
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,760
they just try to figure out
a way to have sex with it.

120
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,540
Hey, mom. Mom, look what I did.

121
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,660
It's okay. That's how I learn.

122
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,890
Forget cookies.

123
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,540
I just went to a couple open houses,
you know, check out our competition?

124
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,310
No one is putting out
cookies. I mean, no one.

125
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,630
It's all cupcakes now.

126
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,600
I-it--it's like a
nightmare come to life.

127
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,150
So make cupcakes.

128
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
I don't know how to make cupcakes.

129
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,980
I make chocolate chip cookies.

130
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,010
I'm sorry it's "out of fashion."

131
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,180
You should make s'mores. Remember,
you'd always make them when we were kids?

132
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,020
Dena, dena, dena. S'mores aren't baking.

133
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,630
Besides, I only made those so the two of
you could have fun together playing with fire

134
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,180
while I finished the crossword.

135
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,280
Oh, what is that look?

136
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,100
I was never more than two rooms away.

137
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,530
First of all, this look isn't about you.

138
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,770
But now I have a deeper understanding of
why I'm so frightened of lighting my stove.

139
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,860
Owen told her that he's still
friends with his ex-girlfriend willow.

140
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,500
I think you should tell
owen to dump willow.

141
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,230
Oh, lord, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

142
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,290
No, do not make him choose
between the two of you.

143
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,830
That will just drive them back together.

144
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,760
You need to make friends with this girl.

145
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,780
Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

146
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,410
Uh, you know what?I think I'm
just upset because it's just--

147
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,000
it's unknown, you know?

148
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,230
And it's the only way you'll
get close enough to destroy her.

149
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,750
And back to wrong.

150
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:29,160
so when do you think I'll be able to
meet this, uh, what's he name again?

151
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,390
What is it?
--Willow?

152
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,580
What? You want to? That would
be great. She'd love to meet you.

153
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,820
Yeah, I mean, if
she--if she wants to.

154
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,460
It's, you know, I've got--I've got a lot of
stuff going on, but, you know, whatever, yeah.

155
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,950
Why don't we have dinner tomorrow night?

156
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,620
We can do it after her yoga class.

157
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,080
Yoga, huh? I see. Trying to slim down?

158
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,600
No, no. I hope not. No,
she's too thin as it is.

159
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,920
No, she teaches.

160
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,100
So, like, what
night did you want--

161
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,490
tonight.Let's do it tonight.

162
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,570
That's great.

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
And we can invite todd.

164
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,920
I mean, you know, I'd love to meet him.

165
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,160
Todd. Yeah. Yeah. No.

166
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:14,520
He'll--he'll--he's gonna be so excited to finally
put a face to the name I'm constantly saying. So...

167
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,840
I just hope tonight's not his...

168
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,380
bench pressing class. So... yeah.

169
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,710
- You're cooking.
- Yeah.

170
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,950
I ju, uh, having a cple
of friends over for dinner,

171
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,000
this vegan girl and
her ex-boyfriend, owen.

172
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,300
Oh, yeah? When did you meet 'em?

173
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,330
When I started dating the
vegan girl's ex-boyfriend, owen.

174
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,060
Here. Try this.

175
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Wait, wait, wait.

176
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,480
I know. I'm sorry I
didn't tell you earlier.

177
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,760
I just--I didn't want to
hurt your feelings, you know?

178
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,660
But then it just started to get really uncomfortable
because owen wanted to come up here and have sex.

179
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,970
I mean, not by himself.
I-I mean, with me.

180
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,680
I might be doing this poorly.

181
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,360
Okay, well, enjoy your dinner. I'll
be at mccorkle'S. It's pot pie night.

182
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,260
No. No, no, no. You have to stay.

183
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,800
Why would I have dinner with
you and your new boyfriend?

184
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,010
Uh, because if you leave
because it's weird for you,

185
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,990
then it's gonna look like you
left because it's weird for you,

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,020
and I don't want owen to think that I
live with a guy who thinks it's weird.

187
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,870
Please.

188
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,880
So--so y want me to put myself in an awkward
situation to prove to everyone how awkward it's not?

189
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,510
Yeah, and if you could do a few push-ups
before they get here, that would be great, too.

190
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you sure you don't
want a theme, huh?

191
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,290
Wild west or a saloon girl?

192
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,440
- Why would tony dane want
a saloon girl? - Well--

193
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,940
do you know why I asked you to do this?

194
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,480
Because you have a camera.

195
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,270
Now just be quiet and shoot it.

196
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:46,030
Okay. I made a mix of sexy music,
just like the photograers of "redbook."

197
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,690
Okay. All right. You're beautiful.
You're making love to the camera.

198
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,480
you're making holiday crafts,

199
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,700
What?What? Let me see.

200
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,040
Oh, god!

201
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,590
I knew it. I knew it! Damn it!

202
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,280
I can't believe this is still happening.

203
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,870
What is? Because I'm scared.

204
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,610
I've never been able to
take a good picture, okay?

205
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,740
I'm amazing in motion, and
then when I stop, I get that.

206
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,830
It's like I'm an optical illusion.

207
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,990
No, but you posed for that portrait.

208
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,230
I mean, you look like the "mona
lisa," w-with addional life experience.

209
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,750
I hired a guy to paint
it for me from this photo.

210
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,310
Okay, that guy is an excellent artist.

211
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,500
oh, god. Okay, please
don' be prettier than me.

212
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,330
Please don't be prettier than me.

213
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,710
Oh, good. Oh, god. Her head is
gigantic. Oh, it's the fish-eye.

214
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,900
Hello! Welcome!

215
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,800
- Sam, this is willow.
- Sam

216
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,240
It's so amazing to finally meet you.

217
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,440
Owen talks about you so
much I feel like I know you.

218
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,730
good. Come on in. Come in.

219
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,720
Okay, so admit it.

220
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,660
You were a little freaked out
when you heard about me, right?

221
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,250
I know. Most women are,
and I completely understand.

222
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,160
No. Gosh, no, no, no, no,
no. No. No. A little bit.

223
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,610
just a smidge. I haven't slept in days.

224
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,270
Get it. I'm so sorry.

225
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,580
Come here.

226
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,820
she's great.

227
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,220
You must be owen.

228
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,970
Oh, hey. Nice to meet you,
uh, todd, and this is--

229
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,410
todd?

230
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,330
Willow from the art institute?

231
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,300
Photography 205, body and shadows.

232
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,540
God. You guys know each other?

233
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,540
Willow was our life studies model.

234
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,370
Didn't you wear that same grungy
soundgarden t-shirt, like, every day?

235
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,820
Yeah. More than what you were wearing.

236
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,240
stop it.

237
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,600
I know. Quit it.

238
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,870
At least he was polite enough
to hit on me after class.

239
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,180
Yeah, but you always had some boyfriend.

240
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,440
Yeah, this guy.

241
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,280
You're kidding.

242
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,570
oh, my god. You were naked,
and todd asked you out.

243
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,180
That is-- it's
extremely hilarious.

244
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,860
I cannot believe how many pearl jam concerts we
were at the exact same time without knowing it.

245
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,150
I know. It's so crazy. Do you
remember that 2-hour encore they did?

246
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,350
The best. The best.

247
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,890
Hey, you want to hear something crazy?

248
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,640
You know that song by that band who,
um, oh, god. What's the name of the band?

249
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,280
I don't know. They have a song that's on a
commercial right now, and it goes like, um...

250
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,800
oh,
di-di-di-di-da-da-da

251
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,060
why is that crazy?

252
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,290
Oh, well, owen and I get it.

253
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,370
I don't have a tv.

254
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,760
Well, that's crazy. Am I right?

255
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,280
Oh, I don't have one either.

256
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,380
oh, you don'T.

257
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,180
So do still have those pictures of me
from art class? 'Cause I never got copies.

258
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,130
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Um, in the other room.

259
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,290
Oh, I don't know if I should see
them. That's when I was in shape.

260
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,510
No. No, yeah, you gus go look
at those. Have fun. That's fun.

261
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,790
She's great.

262
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,890
So is todd. Okay, confession.

263
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,150
I didn't really love it when I
found out you guys lived together,

264
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,870
but, uh, now I know you're just friends.

265
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,250
I kind of feel silly.

266
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,510
yeah.

267
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,470
You know, since this is, uh,
owen's first time at the apartment,

268
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,660
willow and I were thinking that we'd go get
dessert and give you guys time to hang out alone.

269
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,180
- No, that's ridiculs.
- Oh, that's really co. Thanks.

270
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,560
No, I mean, that's--that's just so silly,
because I already went to the store.

271
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,840
I went to the nature mart
and I got us dessert, so...

272
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,360
who wants rhubarb crisp?

273
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,850
- That sounds good.
- Really?

274
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,320
Actuallywe're just gonna get going.

275
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,890
Yeah, sam, thank you so much.

276
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,960
She's the best.

277
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,280
Don't blow it, dumb-dumb.

278
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,900
Don't you blow it, knucklehead.

279
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,810
see you later, bastards.

280
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,940
I didn'T...

281
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,280
we'll just give your
pictures a little enhancement.

282
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,400
You'll see. It's-- if wdon't like
something, we'll just touch it up in-- oh!

283
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,510
Oh, my god.

284
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,920
Dena, is it bad?

285
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,650
Okay, show me.

286
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,150
Why do you have a picture of an iguana?

287
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,720
Oh, my god!

288
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,740
I don't understand how
this... becomes... that.

289
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,110
It just does. It doesn't matter.

290
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,340
I'm never going to meet tony dane.

291
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,480
So what?

292
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,830
I mean, he's just a guy. You
can have any guy you want.

293
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,170
Any regular guy.

294
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,760
This guy's famous.

295
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,590
What does that matter?

296
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,900
It just matters, okay?

297
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,790
It's just...

298
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,890
Ever since I was a littlgirl, you
know, I'd look at these famous guys,

299
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,610
and I'd want to be that girl,

300
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,390
you know, the one with them
walking down the red carpet

301
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,490
and the one fighting
with them at the airport?

302
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,650
That girl--that girl that everyone
hated, just because she was with him.

303
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,630
Oh, but plenty of people do hate you.

304
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,610
Just the ones that know me.

305
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,280
I want to be hated
everywhere, by everyone.

306
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,020
Then let's get you that dream, huh?

307
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes. Okay.

308
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,930
That's not gonna do it.

309
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,880
- One more.
- At least.

310
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,490
Sorry.

311
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,640
Is it the rhubarb crisp?

312
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,070
No, no. I...

313
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,980
I was just wondering why
todd and willow are still out.

314
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,110
It's only been an half an hour.

315
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,370
Yeah. Do you think they're okay?

316
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,810
I mean, should we--should
we call around or something?

317
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,970
I mean, how late can dessert go before
places have to start setting up for breakfast?

318
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,750
Okay, sam, I-I g-gotta
ask you a question.

319
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,030
I mean, I know that I'm over willow.

320
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,180
Are you really sure
that you're over todd?

321
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,850
What? Yeah. I mean, why
would u think I-I'm not?

322
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,270
I guess because the pause you took before you said
"yeah" was big enough for me to park my car in.

323
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,050
Okay, first of all, you
have a very tiny car.

324
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,520
And--and--and also, you--
I was just caught off guard.

325
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,500
Just ask me again. Go ahead.

326
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,370
- Okay.
- Okay.

327
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,980
Can you honestly say that todd is just a friend
whom you don't have romantic feelings for?

328
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,680
Okay, that'S...

329
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,910
no, wait. Wait. No, no, no. Please,
please. That's not fair. That's not fair.

330
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,260
You changed the question around.

331
00:15:54,270 --> 00:16:00,300
Sam, look, I really like you, but I can't move
forward unless you just get rid of the pause.

332
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,740
Samantha. Samantha!

333
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,370
A hundred strokes. That's all.

334
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,130
The future of our business
rests on those cupcakes.

335
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,790
I'm so mad at owen.

336
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,010
I mean, making me choose
between him and todd.

337
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,410
I should have him choose between
me and todd, see how he likes it.

338
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,610
Yeah.

339
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,020
Handsome millionaire environmentalist
or the hobo whs living on my couch.

340
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,100
I can see where you'd be stumped.

341
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,040
Maybe he's right about how
I feel, because I really,

342
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,660
really hated it that todd was out
with that miss nude photo princess.

343
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,770
I'm sure you did.

344
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,490
You saw yourself losing
your fallback guy.

345
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,950
I don't even know what that is.

346
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,310
You know, the person you always
keep in the back of your mind,

347
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,650
you know, as a possibility, in case
the one you're with doesn't work out.

348
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,800
Loretta mccloskey.

349
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,940
We'll talk later.

350
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,620
I mean, do you think he's right?

351
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,190
Do you think I'm choosing todd over him?

352
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,330
No, I don'T.

353
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,930
I think you're just afraid of
moving towards something new.

354
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,800
You know, todd is like cookies.

355
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,430
Todd's familiar. Owen is like cupcakes.

356
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,520
Take me. I'm making cupcakes.

357
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,390
Cupcakes are the future.

358
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,070
- I think your future is burning.
- What?

359
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,680
Oh, no! No!

360
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,800
You know, maybe the future is doughnuts.

361
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,810
No, the future is a place where real
estate is a career for 22-year-olds with...

362
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,480
flat stomachs and tinted
moisturizer and cupcakes.

363
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,530
Anyone over 35 is just
a ridiculous relic.

364
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,670
- Is she still saying she's 36?
- 38

365
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,090
So, uh, what is this that
you're trying to decide?

366
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,510
Between owen and todd.

367
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,190
The only pblem is, if I choose owen,
that means I have to get rid of todd,

368
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,970
and then--d then what if it
doesn't work out with owen?

369
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,630
Then I've--I've
lost todd forever.

370
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,330
Okay. Here. Flip it.

371
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,690
Flip a coin?

372
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,510
Heads, it's owen. Tails, it's todd.

373
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,030
this is ridiculous. fine.

374
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,380
Tails. It's todd. Congratulations.

375
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,110
Let me--let me just-- let me do it
again, 'cause I-I barely even tossed it,

376
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,080
and it deserves a fair
chance, right? Okay.

377
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,990
tails. It's todd. Congratulations.

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,550
- Best three out of five.
- No, no.

379
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,000
Sammy, do you really
need to flip it again?

380
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,800
No. Thank you, daddy. I
know what I have to do.

381
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,850
So... where is this photo, and why
couldn't you e-mail it to me, huh?

382
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,310
Please say it's too dirty.

383
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm not sending tony dane a photo.

384
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,650
You gave up faster than I thought.

385
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,690
Perhaps because you've accepted
the inevitability of us.

386
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,770
No.

387
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,430
I'm sending him this.

388
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,860
That is perfect, because I
just got him a giant wallet.

389
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,460
be careful with it.

390
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,920
It's one of a kind, like me.

391
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,530
You got it.

392
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,530
Careful, idiot.

393
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,320
Ask me if I'm over todd. Go ahead.

394
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,730
Okay. Are you over todd?

395
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,500
Yes. Ask me again.

396
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,960
- Are you over t--
- yes!See? No pause.

397
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,910
I want to be with you.

398
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,340
How did you decide this?

399
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,440
I flipped a coin.

400
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,850
You flipped a coin?

401
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,780
And you lost every time.

402
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,770
I'm a little confused.

403
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,950
Okay, it came up "todd" twice in a row.

404
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,140
But that didn't matter.

405
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,780
I didn't even need to see the next flip,

406
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,260
because no matter how obvious it is
or how loud the universe screams at me,

407
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,520
"you're supposed to be with
todd," I wanted it to be you.

408
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,180
That didn't come out right at all.

409
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,750
No, it never does.
It's kinda your thing.

410
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,070
so get this-- the word "decision" comes
from the same root as the word "scissors."

411
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,630
I know that because I spelled
"schism" wrong one day,

412
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,560
and spell check led
me to learn something.

413
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,830
Decisions and scissors
can both be scary.

414
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:16,500
I mean, you can't gouge your eye out with
a decision, but sometimes it feels that way.

415
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,560
with every decision, you're spping
away the choices you don't want.

416
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,690
Hey, frank.

417
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,850
Sometimes you make a decision... and
feel sure you did the right thing.

418
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,180
Oh, hey, todd. I'm glad I caught you.

419
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,850
I just want to tell you that if you want to
go out with willow, then you have my blessing.

420
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,410
Well, thank you.

421
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,520
And what if I wanted to go out with her the
last two nights and part of this morning?

422
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,190
Namaste.

423
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,040
Yeah. okay.

424
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:53,860
But sometimes you can't help but to think a
little bit about the choices you've cut loose.

425
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,100
don't pick it up till we
find out if it's heads or--

426
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,450
no.Let's not find out.

427
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,520
