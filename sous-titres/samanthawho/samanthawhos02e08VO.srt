1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400


2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,000
YOU KNOW HOW WHEN LIGHT HITS A PRISM 
IT DIVIDES INTO A SPECTRUM OF COLORS? 

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,500
WELL, IT'S THE SAME WITH PEOPLE. 

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,400
I DON'T MEAN THEY'RE DIFFERENT COLORS.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
WELL, THEY ARE,

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
BUT I MEAN IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF DAY, 

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,800
THEY REVEAL A WHOLE SPECTRUM OF 
CHARACTER BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD. 

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,100
ME? I'M ON THE FAR END-- 

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,500
SUPERGOOD--WHICH IS HARD WORK, 

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,000
BUT SOME THINGS ARE WORTH 
SINKING YOURSELF INTO. 

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,100
OH!

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,000
OH! 

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,900
HEY.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,000
YEAH. DO YOU THINK OWEN KNOWS
HOW MUCH MONEY HE HAS

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,600
AND THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY
PAY PEOPLE TO BUILD THIS PARK

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,400
FOR THESE KIDS INSTEAD OF US DOING IT?

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,200
WELL, WHEN OWEN AND I WERE TOGETHER,

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,400
HE ALWAYS SAID, "THINGS
WORTH DOING SHOULDN'T BE EASY,"

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,900
THAT THROWING MONEY AT A PROBLEM

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,900
IS NEVER AS REWARDING
AS DOING THE WORK YOURSELF.

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,500
NO, I-I ACTUALLY--
NO, I SAY THAT, TOO. I DO.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,700
OH, AND THE SHOWERING...? 

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,100
DOESN'T SUCK EITHER, HUH?

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,200
EM, HAHAHAHAHA.

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
MEMORIES.

26
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,700
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE WITH AMNESIA.

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,300
YOU REALLY SHOULD.

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
- HEY. HOW ARE MY FAVORITE VOLUNTEERS?
- YEAH.

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
AH. WAIT. HOLD ON A MINUTE. 

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
I GOT DIRT.

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,700
AHH.

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,700
YOU KNOW ME. GIVE TILL IT HURTS.

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,600
AAH! NOW IT HURTS.

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,800
CHASE THINKS I LOVE MY DOGS MORE THAN HIM

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
AND THAT MAYBE IF I DETACH A LITTLE BIT--

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,200
I'M SORRY, BUT THERE'S MUD IN YOUR HAIR.

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,100
WHAT? STILL? WHERE?

39
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
OVER THERE.

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,000
I WASN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING,

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,300
BUT IT WAS STARTING TO MAKE ME SICK.

42
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,700
OH, I JUST INSTALLED THESE 
LOW-FLOW SHOWERHEAD,

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
BECAUSE OWEN SAYS IT'S JUST 
BETTER FOR THE EARTH.

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,300
YAY! I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,800
OH, MY GOD! TONY DANE, MY FAMOUS
BASKETBALL PLAYER BOYFRIEND,

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,900
JUST TEXTED ME A SMILEY FACE 
FOR OUR 2-WEEK ANNIVERSARY.

47
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,400
SEE? A COLON AND A PARENTHESIS.

48
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,200
YOU KNOW, IF YOU TYPE IN "5-8-0-0-8"

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
AND THEN TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN,
IT SAYS "BOOBS."

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,300
I DON'T GET TO PICK MY MEMORIES.

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,600
OOH. OH, YOU BOTH GOT
THE STEAK TARTAR, HUH?

52
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
- OH, IT LOOKS GOOD.
- YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA FINISH.

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,200
- YOU WANNA SHARE IT?
- UH, ACTUALLY I--THANK YOU.

54
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,300
I QUIT EATING MEAT.

55
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,800
- EXCUSE ME?
- OWEN SAYS THAT IN SOME PLACES,

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,600
BOVINE WIND ACTUALLY DESTROYS THE OZONE.

57
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,100
WHAT IS BOVINE WIND?

58
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,400
OH. MM. AND I'M DONE.

59
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,700
DO YOU REALLY ENJOY BEING THIS PERSON?

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
YEAH. I MEAN, IF I DIDN'T,
I WOULDN'T BE DOING IT.

61
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,200
- SAM.
- I WANT TO PUNCH MYSELF IN THE EYE. 

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
YOU KNOW WHAT? A WISE MAN SAID 
THAT THINGS WORTH DOING AREN'T ALWAYS EASY.

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,200
AND WHO SAID THAT? OWEN?

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
THIS ISN'T A BOOK REPORT.
I DON'T NEED TO CITE MY SOURCES.

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
OH, MY GOD!

66
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
TONY DANE, MY FAMOUS
BASKETBALL PLAYER BOYFRIEND,

67
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,900
JUST FINALLY INVITED ME OUT.

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,800
- HEY.
- OH, THIS IS EXCITING.

69
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,300
- WHEN'S THE BIG NIGHT?
- TOMORROW NIGHT.

70
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,000
I ONLY HAVE ONE DAY TO PLUCK, WAX, 
BUFF, TRIM, MOISTURIZE AND WAX. 

71
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,500
YOU SAID "WAX" TWICE.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'M ITALIAN.

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,500
- SAM?
- MM-HMM?

74
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SHOWERHEAD?

75
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,900
OH, I, UH, REPLACED IT WITH
A NEW LOW-FLOW ONE.

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
YOU LIKE IT?

77
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
IT FELT LIKE I WAS STANDING NEXT 
TO A TALL MAN SNEEZING INTO MY FACE.

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,700
ALSO I REPLACED ALL
OF OUR PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES

79
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,000
WITH NEW REUSABLE ONES
THAT TASTE LIKE METAL.

80
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
YOU'RE WELCOME.

81
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS, SAM.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,500
GOING BLIND FROM DIM FLUORESCENT BULBS,
HAVING TO WASH DISHES BY HAND

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,200
BECAUSE I CAN'T USE THE DISHWASHER?

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
WE ALL HAVE TO DO OUR PART.

85
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,400
I DON'T. I-I-I'M NOT DATING OWEN.

86
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,900
AND--AND WHERE WAS ALL THIS
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER?

87
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
ALL WHAT?

88
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,200
YOU KNOW, CHANGING JUST TO PLEASE ME.

89
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
I'M NOT CHANGING TO PLEASE ANYBODY.

90
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,200
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULD HAVE CHANGED FOR YOU

91
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,000
IF IT MEANT ME BECOMING A BETTER PERSON.

92
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,800
I WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED YOU TO

93
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,300
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE
ENDED UP RESENTING ME FOR IT.

94
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,000
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
NOW YOU'RE THE RESENTING ONE

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,100
BECAUSE YOU FEEL LESS THAN SUPER

96
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,600
IN THE FACE OF MY BEING SO SUPER-DUPER.

97
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
GREAT. WOULDN'T WANT TO BRING YOU DOWN.

98
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,100
OH, AND I WASN'T GONNA
TELL YOU THIS, BUT, UM,

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,300
THE FLUORESCENT BULBS MAKE YOU LOOK OLDER.

100
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
THEY DO NOT.

101
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,300
AND I DON'T CARE IF THEY DO.

102
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
AND THEY DO NOT!

103
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,300
AND I LOVE SAVING THE WORLD.
I LOVE IT !

104
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,900
I LOVE IT.

105
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I LOVE IT!

- OH.

110
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,300
PLASTIC BOTTLES?

111
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
YOU SAID THAT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY 
DRINKS OUT OF A PLASTIC BOTTLE,

112
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,700
ANOTHER PERSON DIES.

113
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,800
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,700
WHAT IF THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DIE, 
YOU KNOW?

115
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,000
THIS IS ROAST BEEF.
WHAT ABOUT BOVINE WIND?

116
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,300
YOU KNOW WHAT? WITHOUT WIND,
YOU DON'T HAVE WINDMILLS.

117
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,600
AND WITHOUT WINDMILLS,
YOU DON'T HAVE HOLLAND

118
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,200
OR HOLLANDAISE SAUCE.
DUTCH APPLE PIE.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,100
ABBA.

120
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,300
SAM, DID YOU AND OWEN BREAK UP?

121
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
NO, SHE'S JUST CHEATING ON HIM.

122
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
I AM NOT CHEATING ON HIM.

123
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,200
I'M JUST GIVING MYSELF SOME SLACK, 
YOU KNOW?

124
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,500
AND THIS WAY, I'M NOT GONNA RESENT OWEN

125
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,200
AND I CAN BE WITH HIM
AND I CAN ALSO BE MYSELF.

126
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,300
OH. AND OWEN'S OKAY WITH THIS?

127
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,400
OH, NO. NO, I WOULDN'T 
DO THIS IN FRONT OF HIM.

128
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,100
NO WAY. HE WOULD NOT LIKE THAT.

129
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
SO YOU ARE CHEATING.

130
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,100
NO. CHEATING IS LYING,
ALL RIGHT?

131
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,500
I'M JUST DOING SOMETHING THAT
I DON'T WANT HIM TO KNOW ABOUT.

132
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,800
IS THAT LYING? YOU KNOW,
IT'S A VERY GRAY AREA.

133
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900
IT REALLY ISN'T.

134
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,600
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S HEALTHY
TO KEEP SECRETS FROM YOUR MAN.

135
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER, TO THIS DAY,

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,900
DOESN'T KNOW I STOPPED
BREAST-FEEDING YOU AT 4 WEEKS.

137
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I MEAN, THESE JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT.

138
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,900
NO, I SWITCHED YOU TO FORMULA.
YOU TURNED OUT FINE.

139
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,700
I TURNED OUT MEAN AND SOULLESS.

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,300
WELL, MAYBE IF I HADN'T CUT IT
WITH THAT NONDAIRY CREAMER...

141
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
TIMES WERE HARD.

142
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,300
OH, YEAH. OKAY. 

143
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
ANDREA BELLADONA?

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
YES, THAT'S ME.

145
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,900
MR. DANE'S CAR IS WAITING OUTSIDE.

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,300
HE SENT ME A CAR?

147
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,500
TONY DANE SENT ME A CAR?

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,700
DO YOU THINK HE CAN COME INSIDE
SO PEOPLE CAN SEE US TOGETHER?

149
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,800
- NO.
- OH.

150
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
OH.

151
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,400
SO WHERE'S MY GUY?

152
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
COME ON. GET IN.

153
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
- HEY. 
- COME ON. GET IN.

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
HEY.

155
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
HEY.

156
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,200
YOU PEOPLE HAVE THE WRONG CAR.

157
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,700
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE ALONE?

158
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
I LIKE THAT.

159
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
NO, DENA, I CAN'T GO SHOPPING WITH YOU TODAY.

160
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,100
I HAVE TO GO FINISH THE PARK WITH OWEN TODAY.

161
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
MAYBE NEXT WEEK?

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,300
NO, WAIT A MINUTE. NEXT WEEK
WE'RE HOSING OIL OFF PELICANS.

163
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,100
YEAH. I'M SORRY. HAVE FUN
WITHOUT ME, THOUGH, OKAY?

164
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

165
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,400
- HEY. YOU ABOUT READY TO GO?
- YEAH.

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,600
- I GOT YOUR MASK.
- MASK?

167
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,700
YEAH, WE'RE SPREADING MANURE
FOR THE LAWN TODAY.

168
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,500
DON'T WANT TO GET THAT STUFF IN YOUR LUNGS.

169
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,100
IF I KNEW IT WAS MANURE DAY,
I WOULD HAVE SET THE ALARM FOR EARLIER.

170
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,900
OWEN!

171
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,300
HEY, WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG?

172
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
I JUST THREW UP.

173
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
OH, THAT CAME ON FAST. YOU ALL RIGHT?

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
NO. I'M SORRY.

175
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,500
I SHOULD GO HOME.

176
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,300
- I'LL COME WITH YOU.
- NO! NO, YOU CAN' JUST...

177
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,600
YOU--YOU HAVE TO GO FINISH 
THE PARK FOR THOSE KIDS,

178
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
SO THAT THEY...

179
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,400
THEY HAVE A PLACE TO EXERCISE AND BE HEALTHY,

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,300
SO THAT... THEY DON'T GET SICK LIKE ME.

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
OKAY, WELL, WE'LL MISS YOU.

182
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,400
YEAH, I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.

183
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
NOW GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I THROW UP IN MY MASK.

184
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,600
GO. GO.

185
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,900
YOU ARE ONE HANDSOME WOMAN.

186
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
OH, GOD.

187
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,200
AND I NORMALLY USE THAT PHRASE
FOR SOMEONE MANNISH OR ELDERLY.

188
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,700
WHEN THEY DID THE LOBOTOMY, DID
THEY GO IN THROUGH YOUR EYE?

189
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
HUH?

190
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,500
I HEAR YOU WENT OUT
WITH TONY DANE LAST NIGHT.

191
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,300
YES, I DID, AND HE WAS WONDERFUL.

192
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,700
IT WAS PERHAPS THE GREATEST
EVENING OF MY YOUNG ADULT LIFE.

193
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,500
- YOU WERE IN THE ENTOURAGE, HUH?
- YEAH, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ABOUT.

194
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,600
I NEVER EVEN SAW THE GUY.
THE LIMO WAS PACKED.

195
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,300
IT WAS LIKE A CLOWN CAR,

196
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,500
JAMMED FULL OF THE WORLD'S
MOST BEAUTIFUL CLOWNS.

197
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,700
THERE'S LEVELS, OKAY? YOU DON'T JUST...?

198
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,800
YOU GOTTA WORK YOUR WAY UP.

199
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,300
IN THE LIMO MEANS YOU'VE MADE THE ROSTER.

200
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
WELL, I'M ABOUT TO CUT MYSELF FROM THE TEAM.

201
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,200
TONY INVITED ME TO CLUB ROULETTE TONIGHT,

202
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,100
AND I'M ABOUT TO ...? 

203
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,500
CLUB ROULETTE ? NO NO NO.

204
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,300
YOU HAVE TO GO. THAT'S THE INNER CIRCLE.

205
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
YEAH?

206
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,600
WAIT A MINUTE. WHY ARE YOU SO 
DESPERATE TO GET ME TOGETHER WITH TONY?

207
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,200
BECAUSE THE QUICKER YOU ARE DONE WITH HIM,

208
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,000
THE SOONER YOU SHALL BE MINE.

209
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,300
WHEN IT COMES TO YOU, THE ONLY
THING I SHALL BE IS REPULSED.

210
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,000
NO, THIS IS GOOD, WHAT WE'RE DOING.

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS BETTER THAN 

212
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,800
BUILDING A PARK, 'CAUSE WE'RE--
WE'RE CREATING JOBS.

213
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,500
WE'RE STIMULATING THE ECONOMY.

214
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,800
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

215
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,900
- I LOVE THE STRAP ON THOSE SHOES. 
- OOH.

216
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,600
OHH, IS THAT SILK? OH, MY GOD.
THAT WOULD LOOK SO GOOD

217
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,400
- WITH A PAIR OF JEANS.
- SAM?

218
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
- HUH? AAH!
- HI.

219
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WILLOW, HI. WILLOW.
UH, DENA, THIS IS WILLOW,

220
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,100
OWEN'S BEST FRIEND,
WHO HE TALKS TO ALL THE TIME.

221
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,900
HI. I'M SAMANTHA'S BEST FRIEND
WHO SHE TALKS TO ALL THE TIME.

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,900
OH, WOW. WELL, ENOUGH ABOUT ME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

223
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,800
OH, WELL, GUESS WHO WORE
THROUGH ANOTHER SHOVEL? 

224
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
YOU.

225
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,300
SO HOW ARE YOU? OWEN SAID YOU WERE SICK.

226
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,800
YEAH, EXACTLY,

227
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,100
BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KONW, THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED HIM TO THINK.

228
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,300
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

229
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,200
YOU DON'T EVER LET ME FINISH, WILLOW.

230
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,300
BECAUSE SEE ALL THESE 
CLOTHES THAT WE BOUGHT?

231
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,000
THESE ARE FOR POOR PEOPLE
WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEIR OWN.

232
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,300
- THEY ARE?
- YEAH, 

233
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,600
BUT LOOK, REALLY, REALLY,
PLEASE DON'T TELL OWEN.

234
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,400
HE'LL BE SO UPSET ABOUT THIS.

235
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,300
YOU KNOW, HE HATES TO THROW MONEY AT THINGS.

236
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,500
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
YOU SAID THAT.

237
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,000
OH. OKAY. WELL, BYE.

238
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,600
BYE, FELLOW DO-GOODER.

239
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,000
OWEN WON'T KNOW, RIGHT? I MEAN,
I-I PULLED THAT OFF, DIDN'T I?

240
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,800
UH, WELL, HARD TO SAY.

241
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,400
IS WILLOW VERY, VERY STUPID?

242
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,200
- NO.
- THEN YOU'RE DEAD.

243
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,800
- HELLO?
- HEY. HEY. IS THAT OWEN?

244
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,900
- SURE. THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
- IS IT HIM? IS IT HIM?

245
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,900
DOES HE SOUND MAD?

246
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,100
- OKAY. OKAY. THANKS.
- HEY. HEY.

247
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,900
- NO, THAT WAS FRANK...
- OH, GOD.

248
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
TELLING ME OWEN WAS ON HIS WAY UP.

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
WHAT? NOW? TODD!

250
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,700
SO WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

251
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,900
I LIED TO OWEN ABOUT BEING SICK

252
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO SCOOP POOP IN THE PARK.

253
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
AND THEN I RAN INTO WILLOW
WHILE I WAS SHOPPING,

254
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,300
SO NOW HE'S PROBABLY HERE
TO BREAK UP WITH ME.

255
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,000
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

256
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
ARE YOU STILL DATING WILLOW?

257
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,200
NO, THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.
SHE MET SOME--

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I NEED YOU TO CALL HER

259
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,500
AND SEE IF SHE TALKED TO OWEN, ALL RIGHT?

260
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,700
OH, GOD. THIS IS A DISASTER!

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
MAYBE WILLOW DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

262
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,300
AND OWEN'S HERE
TO SEE HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
WISE UP, MAN. WOMEN TALK, OKAY?

264
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,700
WE ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE.

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HEY, OWEN. COME IN. COME IN.

266
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,300
HEY. HOW'S SHE DOING?

267
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
HUH.

268
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,600
HEY, PUKE-Y. HOW YOU FEELING?

269
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,600
OH, ACHY, STIFF,

270
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
THE OCCASIONAL DIARRHEA.

271
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T WASH THE SHEETS
BECAUSE WE'RE SAVING WATER.

272
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,600
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP,
TODD. YOU CAN GO NOW.

273
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,000
GOOD, 'CAUSE I'D HATE TO GET
THE OCCASIONAL DIARRHEA.

274
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,200
SO HOW DID IT GO AT THE PARK TODAY?

275
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,300
WE FINISHED. WE MISSED YOU, THOUGH.

276
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,900
YEAH. I WAS SICK, VERY SICK.

277
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,300
I KNOW. YOU TOLD ME.

278
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
YEAH. 

279
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,600
WHY? DID, UH, SOMEONE SAY I WASN'T?

280
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,700
- WHY WOULD THEY SAY THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST, UM,

281
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,900
I JUST THINK THAT THERE
SHOULD BE A LEVEL OF TRUST.

282
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,000
- AGREED.
- BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WITHOUT TRUST,

283
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,400
THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

284
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,900
OH. UH, LISTEN. HEY,
I BOUGHT SOME SOUP FOR YOU.

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,500
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH WITH THE CHARADE, OKAY?

286
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,600
I'M TIRED OF THESE GAMES, OWEN.

287
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,300
I KNOW THAT WILLOW TOLD YOU 
I WASN'T SICK,

288
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,800
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T CARE,
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT I'M WEAK,

289
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,500
THAT I'VE BEEN CHEATING ON YOU.

290
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,000
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN, CHEATING?

291
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,900
I CANNOT LIVE THIS LIFESTYLE ANYMORE.
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

292
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,400
AND, LIKE, LAST WEEK, I WAS GONNA 
RECYCLE THIS--THIS SODA CAN, RIGHT?

293
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,500
BUT THE RECYCLING BIN WAS,
LIKE, WAY DOWN THE STREET,

294
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,400
SO I JUST STOOD THERE
FOR, LIKE, HALF AN HOUR,

295
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,900
DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT THE--THE RUBBER 
I WOULD LOSE OFF MY SHOES WAS--WAS 

296
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,100
WORTH THE METAL I WAS GONNA SAVE 
BY RECYCLING THE CAN

297
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,000
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH WE CARE ABOUT 
THE ENDANGERED RUBBER TREES APPARENTLY,

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,400
AND I JUST REALLY DON'T WANT
TO THINK THAT HARD ABOUT TRASH.

299
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,000
SAM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL THIS.

300
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE YOU, NOT ME.

301
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,600
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF--
WHAT IF ME LIKES MEAT?

302
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,900
ME LIKES WEARING LEATHER?

303
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,800
AND ME LIKES LONG SHOWERS?

304
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,200
AND I AM TALKING LIKE A MUPPET.

305
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
I DON'T CARE.

306
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,600
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO DO ALL THE THINGS I DO.

307
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,600
BEING ME IS A MAJOR PAIN IN THE ASS.

308
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,000
- YEAH, IT REALLY IS.
- I KNOW. 

309
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,700
OH. THANK YOU.

310
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,400
OH, BY THE WAY,
WILLOW NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
OH. WOW.

312
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,600
SHE'S A VERY NICE LADY.

313
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,500
OR PERHAPS NOT VERY BRIGHT AT ALL.

314
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
HEY, ANDREA. YOU CAME.

315
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,300
WHAT THE HELL? TONY'S TEXT SAID I 
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE V.I.P. ROOM.

316
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,000
I KNOW. THIS IS THE V.I.P ROOM.

317
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,100
SO WHERE IS HE?

318
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
OH, TONY'S IN THE V.I.P.'s
V.I.P. ROOM.

319
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,900
OH, MY GOD! IS THERE NO END?

320
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,300
IT'S LIKE THOSE RUSSIAN NESTING DOLLS.

321
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,100
UGH! I'M OUT.

322
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
OH, COME ON. YOU THINK 
TONY DANE LIKES A QUITTER?

323
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,800
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE COMPETITION.

324
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,600
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
WRESTLE ONE OF THESE SKANKS TO THE GROUND?

325
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,900
WELL, AS MUCH AS I WOULD ENJOY THAT,

326
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,100
I MEAN COMPETITION WITH OTHER GUYS.

327
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,400
JUST START MAKING OUT 
WITH THE FIRST GUY YOU SEE.

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
RIGHT NOW. IT COULD BE ANYONE.

329
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,200
THE GUY STANDING RIGHT 
IN FRONT OF YOU, LIKE HERE...

330
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,500
IN THE GENERAL VICINITY OF WHERE I AM.

331
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
YES. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

332
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,500
THAT COULD WORK.

333
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,800
HEY, TONY DANE!

334
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,200
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

335
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
PLEASURE.

336
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,600
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD SAY 
THANK YOU. THAT WAS MY IDEA.

337
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
YOU LOOK GREAT TONIGHT.

338
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THANK YOU.

339
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I FEEL GOOD.

340
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,000
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF NICE TO JUST 
BE ABLE TO THROW THE CLOSET DOOR OPEN

341
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,700
AND PICK OUT WHATEVER I WANTED TO WEAR

342
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,300
WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK ABOUT 
WHAT IT WAS MADE OF

343
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,700
OR WHETHER LITTLE 
FOREIGN CHILDREN WERE INVOLVED.

344
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,500
COTTON, SILK AND NO.

345
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
WHATEVER.

346
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
SALAD FOR THE LADY?

347
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
UH, ACTUALLY, I'M THE SALAD.

348
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,800
YEAH. AND I'M THE STEAK. MOO!

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
- WELL, ENJOY.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

350
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,200
OH, HEY, UH, UH, I DON'T KNOW 
IF I TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE,

351
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
BUT THE MAYOR IS GONNA BE 
AT THE PARK DEDICATION NEXT SUNDAY.

352
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,700
REALLY? THAT'S SO EXCITING.

353
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,500
THERE'S A SLIM CHANCE 
THE GOVERNOR WILL BE THERE,

354
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,000
ALTHOUGH NOT REALLY EXPECTING ANYTHING--

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,300
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE 
EATING STEAK IN FRONT OF ME,

356
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,400
PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENTUAL
DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD.

357
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,300
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

358
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,200
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

359
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,900
UH, NOTHING. I WAS JUST 
TALKING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR.

360
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,900
OH. RIGHT.

361
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
UM, THE GOVERNOR. OF COURSE.

362
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,300
I'M SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOU.

363
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,200
OH, NO, NO. I WAS JUST SAYING 
THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL SHOW UP

364
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,900
TO THESE THINGS--
YOU SELFISH, LAZY HYPOCRITE.

365
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,300
IT MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU 
TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

366
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,800
AND LOOK YOURSELF IN THE FACE 
AND KNOW THAT YOU ARE

367
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,000
A PATHETIC HUMAN BEING.

368
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,600
IT IS. IT REALLY, REALLY IS.

369
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
IS WHAT?

370
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,700
- WHAT? 
- YOU SAID "IT IS."

371
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,900
YEAH. IT IS.

372
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,700
THE STEAK--IT IS, UM, MEATY.

373
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
MOO!

374
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,200
I MEAN, I SHOULD BE HAPPY,
RIGHT? WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

375
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,700
THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION,
BY THE WAY. OR MAYBE IT'S NOT.

376
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,100
YOU KNOW, I'M FINALLY GETTING 
TO BE MYSELF AROUND OWEN

377
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,400
AND HE'S LETTING ME,

378
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,500
AND I'M STILL NOT HAPPY.

379
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,200
SAMANTHA, SWEETHEART,

380
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,500
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT 
I ALWAYS SAID TO YOU

381
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,400
WHENEVER I WOULD MEET 
ONE OF YOUR NEW BOYFRIENDS?

382
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,200
NO, I DON'T.

383
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,500
I WOULD SAY,
"SAMANTHA, YOU CAN DO BETTER."

384
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,600
REALLY? YOU THINK I CAN?

385
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,200
NOT THIS TIME. OWEN'S PERFECT.

386
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,700
I KNOW HE IS.

387
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
SO I HAVE TO SUCK IT UP AND JUST BE BETTER,

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,100
AND ONE DAY WE'LL HAVE THE PERFECT WEDDING

389
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,300
AND PERFECT KIDS AND THE PERFECT LIFE,

390
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,500
AND I'LL BE PERFECTLY MISERABLE FOREVER.

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,700
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LET ME HELP 
YOU PICK OUT YOUR WEDDING DRESS.

392
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,800
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, SINCE THE ACCIDENT,

393
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,700
YOU'VE JUST HAVE FORGOTTEN
WHAT YOU LOOK GOOD IN.

394
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,700
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

395
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,400
I MEAN, OWEN IS EVERYTHING 
THAT I'VE EVER WANTED IN SOMEONE

396
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,000
EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE TINY, LITTLE DETAIL--

397
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
THAT WHEN I'M WITH HIM, I FEEL LIKE CRAP.

398
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
LISTEN.

399
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,800
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS,
SOMEONE CAN BE PERFECT ON PAPER.

400
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,200
IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE PERFECT FOR YOU.

401
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,400
YOU KNOW, IF SOMEONE DESCRIBED
YOUR FATHER TO ME,

402
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,800
I'D THINK THEY WERE TALKING
ABOUT A SAINT BERNARD.

403
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
BUT WHEN I'M WITH HIM,

404
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
I FEEL GREAT.

405
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,400
I WANT TO FEEL LIKE THAT.

406
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
HOW DO YOU BREAK UP
WITH THE PERFECT PERSON?

407
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,900
I MEAN, HE'S DONE NOTHING WRONG.

408
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
WELL, YOU TELL HIM YOU'RE MOVING.

409
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,000
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,
YOU FAKE YOUR OWN DEATH.

410
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,700
I'M NOT GONNA FAKE MY OWN DEATH.

411
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,800
I CAN BARELY FAKE BEING SICK.

412
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
NO, I'M GONNA...

413
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
I'M GONNA TELL HIM THE TRUTH,
'CAUSE HE DESERVES THAT.

414
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
OKAY. 

415
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,700
DO YOU KNOW I HAVE AN OLD BOYFRIEND 
BACK IN MINNEAPOLIS 

416
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
WHO STILL THINKS I'M DEAD?

417
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,500
I ALWAYS WONDERED 
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO JUST

418
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,400
KIND OF DROP BY ONE DAY AND SAY HI.

419
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,900
OH, THAT WOULD BE FUNNY.

420
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,100
YEAH. THAT'D BE A RIOT.

421
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
COME IN.

422
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,200
HEY, OWEN, I... I KNOW
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED FIRST,

423
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
BUT I REALLY JUST NEEDED TO GET THIS--

424
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,300
OH, YOU'RE NURSING A BABY LAMB.

425
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,100
YEAH. CUTE, HUH?

426
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,100
A RESCUE ORGANIZATION I STARTED 
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SAVED HIM.

427
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,300
HIS MOM WAS TAKEN TO SLAUGHTER.

428
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
BUT I'M GONNA FOSTER HIM 
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS,

429
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,300
AND THEN HE'S GOING 
TO A PETTING ZOO FOR THE BLIND.

430
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

431
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,900
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I, UM...

432
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,500
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS,

433
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
- BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS-- 
- WAIT. 

434
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
NO. I WAS GONNA SURPRISE 
YOU WITH THIS ON SUNDAY,

435
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,000
- BUT I HAVE TO DO IT NOW, OKAY?
- OKAY.

436
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,600
YOU KNOW THE PARK 
THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON...

437
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
UH-HUH.

438
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,700
WELL, WE'RE DEDICATING IT TO YOU.

439
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,500
BECAUSE YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD 
TO TRANSFORM YOURSELF,

440
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,600
JUST LIKE WE TRANSFORMED
A VACANT LOT INTO A BEAIFUL SPACE.

441
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I'M MOVING.

442
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
MOVING? TO WHERE?

443
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
PORTLAND.

444
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,300
WHAT? WOW.

445
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,600
WELL, AT LEAST I HAVE OFFICES IN OREGON.

446
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

447
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,100
MISSISSIPPI. PORTLAND, MISSISSIPPI.

448
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,900
- NEVER OF HEARD OF IT.
- IT'S A SMALL TOWN.

449
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
IT'S A LITTLE, TINY TOWN.

450
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,600
IT'S ACTUALLY ON A FLOODPLAIN,
SO IT KIND OF COMES AND GOES.

451
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
OH.

452
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
OH. HEY...

453
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,100
THAT'S NOT TRUE. I'M LYING.

454
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
- SORRY?
- I'M NOT MOVING.

455
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
- OH.
- OWEN,

456
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,700
I WANT TO BE A GOOD PERSON,

457
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
BUT WHEN I'M WITH YOU,

458
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,100
I'M REMINDED THAT I'M NOT 
AS GOOD AS I WANT TO BE.

459
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,100
SO I CAN SAY IN COMPLETE HONESTY 
THAT IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S ME...

460
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
BECAUSE OF YOU.

461
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I'M SORRY.

462
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,100
YEAH, I-I HAD A FEELING THIS WAS COMING.

463
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,700
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONE 
TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH ALL THIS.

464
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,100
OH. YOU MEAN WILLOW?

465
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
AND AIMEE.

466
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
AND KAREN.

467
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
AND LISA. 

468
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,400
LIKE I SAID, I'M A MAJOR PAIN IN THE ASS.

469
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,600
YOU WANT TO HOLD THE LITTLE GUY?

470
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
OH,

471
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
NAH.

472
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,900
I'LL PROBABLY JUST EAT HIM.

473
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
SO OKAY, BABY STEPS. 

474
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,000
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS YOU MAY WANT SOMETHING, 

475
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,100
NOT EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS IN YOUR GRASP. 

476
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,300
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULDN'T REACH FOR IT. 

477
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,500
IT'S DEFINITELY BETTER THAN 
STANDING THERE DOING NOTHING. 

478
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
HEY. I'LL GET YOU UP THERE, BUDDY.

479
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,200
MOMMY! STRANGER!

480
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,000
NO,NONO! I WAS JUST--
I WAS JUST HELPING WITH THE--

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,200
NO TOUCHING. NO TOUCHING.

482
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
HEY. GUYS...

483
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,900
AM I A BETTER PERSON THAN I WAS BEFORE?

484
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,700
OH, PLEASE. YOU'RE SO DISGUSTINGLY GOOD,

485
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,600
I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T LIVE
WITH SEVEN DWARVES.

486
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
- REALLY?
- I'D EVEN LET YOU BABYSIT MY DOGS,

487
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,300
AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST 
COMPLIMENT I CAN GIVE ANYBODY.

488
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,100
THANK YOU, DENA. IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

489
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,100
- SO WOULD YOU?
- WOULD I WHAT?

490
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,400
BABYSIT MY DOGS, BECAUSE MY THERAPIST WANTS

491
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,900
CHASE AND I TO GO AWAY FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS WITHOUT THEM.

492
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,800
- LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS. IT WORKED!
- WHAT?

493
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,500
TONY'S FINALLY CALLING ME.

494
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,100
OKAY, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? 
WILL YOU ANSWER THE PHONE?

495
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
YOU THINK I SHOULD?

496
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
- DEFINITELY.
- YES.

497
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,500
YOU GUYS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT MEN. YES!

498
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,800
OKAY, SO I COULDN'T MAKE IT 
WORK WITH THE PERFECT GUY, 

499
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,600
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ME 
A BAD PERSON, BECAUSE HEY, 

500
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,900
WOULD A BAD PERSON GET 
A WHOLE PARK NAMED AFTER HER? 

501
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,900
I THINK NOT. 

502
