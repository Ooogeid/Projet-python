1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,760
Since breaking up with the perfect
guy,i've discovered plentyof imperfect ones.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,800
I definitely don't fall
for every guy i meet,

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,230
- but when idofall...
- Honestly,it's really nothing.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,280
Okay.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,670
I'm mike.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,380
- Samantha.
- I fall fast.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,500
And i always land hard.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,400
Oh,it hurts!

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,610
I just want it to stop!

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,640
Oh,trust me,you're not the only one.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,000
It's okay,sweetie.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,430
We're gonna get through
this like we always do.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,720
I think she might kill herself.

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,370
I'm not gonna kill m elf,okay?

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,260
I know you won't! You are strong!

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,890
I'm gonna need belts,shoelaces
and-- and any of your ties.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,220
I have one tie. You can't have it.

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,220
But what if she,you know... You know?

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,430
Then i'll need it for the funeral.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,500
What is wrong with me?

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,080
It's like i have absolutely
no learning curve,you know?

22
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,000
I,like,i meet a guy,i
- i puteverythithat i have into that relationship for three weeks,

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,680
And then i just end up
in a ball on the floor.

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,550
Too bad they didn't know you when
you gavenothing to a relationship.

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,020
They might've stuck
around for four years.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,000
That's it. You know what? No more men.

27
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,600
Good. Take a break.

28
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,810
Maybe that's it. I just need to...

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,590
I just need to be single for a while.

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,690
You know,just stand on my own.

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,040
But not on a ledge,right?

32
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,750
You know what? Just saying
that... I feel better.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,470
Oh,it hurts!

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,830
Make it stop!

35
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,390
Honey,i think you need to eat food.

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,540
Oh,god. Mike and i used to eat food.

37
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,820
What happened?

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,830
She was feeling great.

39
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,760
I have no idea.

40
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,140
I just asked her if there might be something
she was doing to keep driving all these men away,

41
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,580
And then i guess she thought
of something really sad.

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,190
You know,i forgot. How pairs of
underwear do i pack for a week?

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,480
- Nine.
- Are you sure?

44
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,740
Last time,i packed
9,and it was not enough.

45
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,790
Then pack 12.

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,150
Nah,it's too much. I was
thinking more like 10 or 11.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,800
Sam,any thoughts on this?

48
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,480
W- wait a minute-- a sec.
Y- you guys are going away?

49
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,130
When were you gonna tell me this?

50
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,480
What-- what,when i
started tolove youtoo much?

51
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,240
I ammakingyour father take a vacation.

52
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,350
His doctor said his blood
pressure is sky-high.

53
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,560
I don't want him keeling over.

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,410
A vacation--
that's what i need.

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,810
I need to go away.I need
to go away with my family,

56
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,520
just get away from anything
that reminds me of mike.

57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,810
Well,come on along. We
were just gonna ******

58
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,350
- yeah.
- Stop.

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,510
Well,that's a good idea. We'll
make it a family vacation.

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,540
Well,i'm game.

61
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,810
We're going up to that resort on lake
wapahowi that we used to go to every year.

62
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,890
You loved that place.

63
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,230
Uh-huh,the lake resort!
Yeah,that's... That was fun!

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,130
Really? You remember the lake resort?

65
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,860
No. No,but sometimes that just works.

66
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,410
Really? Your mom wantsmeto come?

67
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,200
Yeah. Well,i mean,she said i could bring
one friend-- just not andrea,so... Yeah.

68
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,950
I always wanted to go with you as
a kid... But my mom was always sick.

69
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,170
But now she's dead!

70
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,680
- That didn't come out right.
- No. No.

71
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,330
But listen. Please,please,please
don't say anything to andrea,okay?

72
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,180
I
- i need to handle this very delicately,so... Bzzt!

73
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,500
I love these giant mugs. They
make my hands look extra teeny.

74
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,890
- Sam and i are going away!
- Dena!

75
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,560
What is she talking about? Where
are you going with her and not me?

76
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,180
Nowhere that you would want to go.

77
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,300
How do you know that?

78
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,140
On vacation with my parents. See?

79
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,670
Well,it doesn't mean i wouldn't
have liked to have been asked.

80
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,840
I know. I'm sorry.

81
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,920
Andrea,would you malintkeha who to

82
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,430

with my dad singing "rhinestone cowboy"?

83
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,790
Thank you. Yes,i'd love to go.

84
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,260

Okay,shh.

86
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,850
Listen,my mom said i can only bring
one person,and i already asked dena.

87
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,480
And her mom's finally dead.

88
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,800
- Lucky.
- Yeah.

89
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,460
Dad,thanks so much for
stopping,but you know what?

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,040
I don't think i can go
here,so i'll just hold it.

91
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,820
Well,this is where we're staying.

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,180
So i'll be holding it for a week.

93
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,390
They sure fixed up the place.

94
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,040
Um,i know i'm a guest and i
shouldn't be nitpicky,but,um...

95
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,450
We're going to be murdered here.

96
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,510
All right,girls,no complaing.

97
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,590
That man's life depends
on this vacation,

98
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,550
And we're all gonna enjoy ourselves no
matter how much drinking i have to do.

99
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,870
Oh,here,i-i don't care what
it looks like or smells like.

100
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,190
I'm out of the city,away
from men and heartbreak...

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,480

Yeah,since my dad died.

110
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,890
Oh,i'm so sorry to hear
that. He was such a nice man.

111
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,870
Did they ever catch his kill?

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,680
I know.

113
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,130
Wow,look at you,sam.

114
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,340
And you... Friendly innkeeper.

115
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,810
Samantha,it's brad... Little brad.

116
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,240
Oh,good lord. He was your first love.

117
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,710
Of course he was.

118
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,930
What do you mean "first love"?

119
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,990
Howard,that last summer,she showed up late
for every meal with leaves in her hair.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,370
What did you think she was doing?

121
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,200
Bird-watching.

122
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,630
She said she was bird-watching,and
that's what she was doing.

123
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,060
I'm gonna go unpack the car.

124
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,030
No hea lifting!

125
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,950
I swear,you die up here,i'll
bury you right where you drop!

126
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,940
Well,there aren't a lot of
birds here in the winter,

127
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,090
But there's a family
of badgers we can watch.

128
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,030
Look,i,um,i'm sorry.

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,420
I'm s-sure all that bird stuff was
a lot of fun and everything,but...

130
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,190
I have amnesia.

131
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,700
I have the bubonic plague.

132
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,800
No! I don't. No.
This is-- we-- we...

133
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,970
Rember that game we used to play where you
would say something that started with an "a,"

134
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,710
And i would name one
that started with a "b"?

135
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,050
No.

136
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,250
Amnesia?

137
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,200
Oh,i'm sorry.

138
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,520
Oh,no,no,no. It's okay.

139
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,440
It's sort of like ho ? Having a
surprise party every single day.

140
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,170
Like finding out about us. Surprise!

141
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,480
Okay,um,here are your room keys.

142
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,150
Uh,just settle in.

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,110
And if you need anything,don't
be afraid to ask.

144
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,320
Well,then how about a
dirty martini,three olives?

145
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,040
How's that for getting settled in?

146
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,230
Yes,we no longer serve alcohol.

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,180
Uh,the liquor license got too expensive.

148
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,720
Surprise!

149
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,690
So he was my first kiss,huh?

150
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,820
Yeah,you'd come back from your
week and tell me all about it.

151
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,530
And i remember every ng detail because
i used to write about it in my diary,

152
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,630
Except i used my name inead of yours.

153
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,360
Well,why didn't you warn me about that?

154
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,800
I didn't think he'd still be here.

155
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,350
I mean,what grown adult lives in the same
house they grew up in and never leaves?

156
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,030
You.

157
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh,that's true.

158
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,400
Andrea?

159
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,770
Oh,my god!

160
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,150
You guys come here,too?

161
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,570
How crazy is that?

162
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,030
Well,"crazy" is one way to put it.

163
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,360
No,i come here all the time.

164
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,920
I love it. It has such... Mice.

165
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,840
Hey,did you see the
guy who runs this place?

166
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,250
You know,normally,i do not go
for hill people,but he was hot.

167
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,200
That's brad. He and sam used to hook up.

168
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,410
Long ago when we were
kids,and just with this part.

169
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,480
Well,time to use the other part.

170
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,610
No,it is time to do nothing with nobody,

171
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,390
And he is exactly the nobody i'm going
to do nothing with,because he is cute,

172
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,020
And we have a history,and
i am a sucker for that.

173
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,210
So keep him away from me,or
else he'll rip my heart out

174
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,640
if not him,somee will.

175
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,290
I put your father down
for a nap. Can i...

176
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,880
Andrea,what the hell are you doing here?

177
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,380
I can be here. It's a free country.

178
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,340
You can't just invite yours--
oh,wait,you brought alcohol.

179
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,540
- You always have alcohol.
- Do i?

180
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,610
Oh,it's-- it's
hard to say.

181
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,120
Come on,andrea,have a--
an-drea,have a heart.

182
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,670
My husband's dying!

183
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Where'd you find this?

184
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,340
Oh,i was poking around,looking for a secret
soundproof basement with a drain in the floor,

185
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,390
- and i und fun games.
- Cool.

186
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,900
Except we only have...

187
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,980
Two e's,an "a" and a curiously
strong breath mint with a "z" on it.

188
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,740
I don't wanna touch that.

189
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,520
Mind if i join you?

190
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,300
No. You can.

191
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,290
Great.

192
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,150
Would you like a mint?

193
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,340
Hey,sam.

194
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,720
Oh,hey,dude. What's up?

195
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,820
What's going on? I,uh,sort of get
the feeling you're avoiding me.

196
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,050
Avoiding you? No!

197
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,140
Oh,actually,no,i was
looking for you. Um,i was.

198
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,540
That's why i
- i ran out here. Um,you work here.

199
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,800
So what would you recommend?
'Cause i'm,like. Starving.

200
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,070
I've been wanting to show you something.

201
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,820
You know what? There's only one bag
of those chips,and i'm going to...

202
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,030
Stay here just to make sure
that no one else gets it.

203
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,150
Come on. It'll take
two seconds. Come on.

204
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,430
- Okay. - It's right--
come on,it's right here.

205
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,300
- Come on,come on.
- You want me to see a tetherball? What?

206
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,780
Look.

207
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,320
Oh,my god! Look at that!

208
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,670
My hand was so small.

209
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,300
We did it so they would always
be one handprint together.

210
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,620
Look. We made a heart.

211
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,190
Yeah.

212
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,930
I know why this place is falling apart.

213
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,160
Because the help's spending so much
time hitting on the guests,you know?

214
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,610
That's what this-- yeah,maybe
just a few more fresh towels,

215
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,590
- A little less fresh behavior,you know?
- What?

216
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,120
Yeah,you heard me.

217
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,150
- 58,59,60,6--
- hi,sweetie.

218
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,250
Hey,where have you been?

219
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,120
And how come you didn't
ask me to go on your walk?

220
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,860
'Cause you're supposed to

221
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,260
well,i hate relaxing.

222
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,390
And i can't rock anymore.

223
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,270
I've already rocked 4,208 times,and
thers 61 trees in that direction.

224
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,360
Always have to be busy.
Always have to have a hobby.

225
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,140
Remember when i got you
that wine-making kit?

226
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,180
Yeah,i wasn't very good at that.

227
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,440
Yes,you were.

228
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,290
It had a nice,oaky finish.

229
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,190
Well,i don't know how. I made
it in a plastic garbage can.

230
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,960
Well,the point is,what can you tell
me about fermenting these berries?

231
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,770
Well,one-- they would probably poison
you,and two,it would take three months.

232
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,800
Shoot.

233
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,040
About what the donner
party ate all winter.

234
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,890
No one ever asks what they drank.

235
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,160
I don't know how you resisted brad
with the handprints and the moonlight

236
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,210
and the look in his eye which could be love or
could be crazy,but either way,it's attention.

237
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,870
Oh,i know. I felt bad about being
harsh,but i had to act fast,you know?

238
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,910
I felt like a trapped wolf who had to
chew off my leg before i kissed him.

239
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,720
And who wants to kiss a girl with
a wolf leg in her mouth. Well...

240
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,040
- Oh,my god.
- Oh,my god.

241
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,270
Looks like you chewed
off the wrong girl's leg.

242
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,220
She is supposed to be my friend.

243
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,670
I mean,how could she do this?

244
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,540
You did say you didn't want brad.

245
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,930
No,i said i didn't wantto want him.

246
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,750
That doesn't mean that
idon't want him,which i don't.

247
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,880
Well,i can't believe she got confused.

248
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,540
Oh,i'm not saying i
should be mad about it.

249
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,440
I'm just saying,like,okay,it's
like if My favorite food is shrimp,

250
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,130
so a waiter brings me
shrimp,but i can't eat shrimp

251
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,760
Because it makes my tongue swell
up,so i don't eat the shrimp,

252
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,800
But that doesn't mean that i want andrea grabbing
shrimp off my plate and giving it a massage.

253
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,050
Well,on the bright side,you-- you don't
have to keep pushing brad away now.

254
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,340
You think?

255
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:43,760
Yeah. I mean,in a way,she was kind of
protecting you by being a slimy tramp.

256
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,440
You know,you're right. You're right.

257
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,050
She's actually doing me a
favor by being a slimy tramp.

258
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,150
Yeah?

259
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,330
And if i didn't have a boyfriend back
home,i'd hit that w shoo? Fast for you.

260
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,680
- Thank you.
- Sure.

261
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,780
Amateur.

262
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,070
See,this is exactly what i wanted--
just sitting by the fire,together.

263
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,550
Not being murdered.

264
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,820
Can't get any better than that.

265
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,240
Hey,guys.

266
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,220
What's going on?

267
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,270
Oh,nothin'.

268
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,600
What's goingn with you?

269
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,910
I just talk a walk in the woods.

270
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,570
Oh,the air out here-- i really
think it makes me prettier.

271
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,350
Wow,you've got a lot
of leaves in your hair.

272
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,530
Oh,i was chasing this raccoon,and he
went through the branches and then i--

273
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,600
Oh,sorry. Just was.

274
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,200
Hey,look,everybody's here.

275
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,360
Yeah,looky,looky.

276
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,580
Yeah,just a bunch of friends hanging
out together,sitting by the fire.

277
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,000
So... Who wants to play charades?

278
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,840
Oh,howard,you are not playing charades.

279
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,500
All that jumping around-- no,it'll
be like playing russian roulette.

280
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,100
We'll play that game where you
get to guess what people are--

281
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,070
Guess what you're thinking
without saying any words.

282
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,770
You mean charades?

283
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,240
I said no words.

284
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,440
Are you drunk?

285
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,120
- Areyou?
- Yes.

286
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,080
Okay,dena,why don't you start us off?

287
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,810
Oh,okay!

288
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,540
Here we go!

289
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,530
All right.

290
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,940
Ice crea maker!

291
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,690
It's a movie,regina.

292
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,390
Three words.

293
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,990
Ice cream maker-- three
words. Do not take me on.

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,960
Did you steal my booze?

295
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,240
Oh,come on. No one's
stealing anything...

296
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,450
- Except maybe boyfriends,huh?
- What?

297
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,630
Guys,i'm doing "the
breakfast club" here.

298
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,820
You talked. You talked.
Come on. My turn.

299
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,910
You play advanced rules.

300
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,280
Okay,i'm gonna make this one easy.

301
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,100
Oh,easy! Easy! I got it! Andrea!

302
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,710
Hello?

303
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,150
It's a movie. Four words.

304
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,090
Ooh,first word...

305
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,470
- Worm!
- Slimy.

306
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,000
Lawyer. Jerk.

307
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,730
Backstabber. Forest tramp.

308
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,520
Gump! Gump! "forrest gump."

309
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,080
Ay,what is your problem?

310
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,440
You know what my problem is?

311
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,040
Is that i saw you in the woods with
brad,and don't say that you weren't there

312
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,330
Because dena saw
it,too,and she was pissed.

313
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,470
"caddyshack"?

314
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,260
"ghostbusters"!

315
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,500
You said you didn't even want him.

316
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,980
But that doesn't mean that
i wantedyouto have him.

317
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,620
Well,then you're in luck,because
i didn't do anything with him.

318
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,970
- He likes you.
- Really?

319
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,270
Okay,nemovie. First word is "the."

320
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,030
All the leaves in your hair.

321
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,030
I told you,i was chasing mr. Raccoon.

322
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
He had the perfect fur
for the trim on my vest.

323
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,630
"french connection."

324
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,180
No,the--
"the sting."

325
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,770
Look,i don't want him. I'm not with him.

326
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,220
You take him. Go get him. I don't care.

327
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,630
Yeah,but that's the thing. I can't go
for it,because idocare. That's my problem.

328
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,410
I'm not like you,you know?I
can't just throw myself in and--

329
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,940
and have fun and get leaves all
in my hair and just walk away.

330
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,140
It's not fair! I wanna be like
you. I wanna be dead inside!

331
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,800
I just wanna be dead!

332
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,470
"the dead zone"!

333
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,630
Sam,don't do it! You
have so much to live for.

334
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,270
- "fisher king"!
- Yes.

335
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,370
Just,can you please, just
give me back my shoelaces?

336
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,410
Not until i know how you're feeling.

337
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,290
Okay,that's the problem, right?

338
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,400
I'm feeling. I am feeling constantly.

339
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,490
I'm like a robot who's been
which is totally stupid,

340
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,170
Because if you're gonna take the time
to make a robot, it should at least,like,

341
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,540
Be able to walk around
the room and pick up stuff.

342
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,330
Please stop saying that you're a robot.

343
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,150
Hey,dena,uh, can i talk to sam?

344
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,660
Okay, but don't listen to her.

345
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,520
- She has tricks to make you crazy.
- Okay.

346
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,960
- Oh,can i sit?
- Yeah.

347
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,380
Are you gonna use that as
some sort of teaching tool?

348
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,350
'Cause,see, inside are
the seeds of something new,

349
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,110
and then they're
protected by this big...

350
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,130
Nah,i just picked it up outside.

351
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,420
- It's pretty though,huh?
- Yeah. Thanks,daddy.

352
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,810
I was just rembering all the
summer that we came up here,

353
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,200
And every year you'd get in a big fight
with whatever girlfriend you brought along,

354
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,100
Usually over some boy, and
then at the end of the week,

355
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,810
You'd get in a fight with him and end up dunking
him in the lake or beaning him with one of those.

356
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,640
And then you'd cry all t
home in the car. I loved it.

357
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,750
That sounds awesome.

358
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,390
Well,because two hours after you got home,
you'd be fine and on to the next thing.

359
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,220
You know,just-- just
living your life,you know?

360
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,210
Going for it.

361
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,720
Yeah,and i've-- i've seen some of
that come back since the accident.

362
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,740
Really?

363
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,960
- You gotta live, right?
- Yeah.

364
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,550
I mean,it's like me.

365
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,990
If i listen to your mother and sat around,
afraid that my heart was going to explode,

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,110
I wouldn't enjoy a thing.

367
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,890
Thanks,daddy.

368
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,160
Sam?

369
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,760
Andrea,i am so sorry i was so mean.

370
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,180
It's all good.

371
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:52,350
Good,because i'm gonna go and
apologize to that there brad.

372
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,930
And who knows? Maybe
i'll just go for it.

373
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,670
Bird-watching. She's
just going bird-watching.

374
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,740
Yeah.

375
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,470
Don't ring my bell. It don't ring it.

376
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,640
Are you still mad about last
night when i was acting all silly?

377
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,200
Last night-- was that the
night you called me the help?

378
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh,come on. That old joke?

379
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,520
Look... I'm really sorry. Okay?

380
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,440
I-i was just coming
off a really bad breakup

381
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,790
which was coming off of a
really bad breakup, and i just...

382
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,830
Didn't want my heart to explode.

383
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,110
I never planned on exploding
your heart,samantha.

384
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,860
For the last 20 years.

385
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,310
Well,i've been thinking about you,too...

386
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,390
Prably. I really don't know. Maybe.

387
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,900
So what do you wanna do?

388
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,340
Well,maybe you could
show me those badgers.

389
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,680
They're so cute.

390
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,660
You don't wanna get too
close,though. They're really mean.

391
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,990
Oh,you're really talking about badgers.

392
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh,okay,well,that...
That could be fun,too.

393
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:36,860
It hurts! Oh,god! It hurts so bad!

394
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,300
***********

395
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,460
********

396
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,480
******** I don't want her
throwing herself out on the road.

397
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,780
Okay,everybody.

398
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,400
no matter how hard i keep landing,

399
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,350
I guess i owe it to myself to fall, because
the heart wants what the heart wants.

400
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,670
And apparently, mine
wants a nasty bruise.

401
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,710
* Like a rhinestone cowboy *
