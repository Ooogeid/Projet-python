1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,918
And it's something
you just get to love.

2
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,918
My plants reject my love.

3
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,150
Maybe they're teenagers.

4
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,117
I try, but it's just so hard

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,100
being both father and
mother to them. Eh.

6
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:26,517
Hey. What's wrong?

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,417
There was a message.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,018
Uncle walter died.

9
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,018
Oh, no, todd. Yeah, i...

10
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,484
oh, god. I'm so sorry.

11
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,951
Are you okay?

12
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,584
No, i'm fine. Um, he was your uncle.

13
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,117
What?!

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,085
Oh, no!

15
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,551
Oh, my god. This is
my first family death.

16
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:46,384
It's my first funeral.

17
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:48,684
Oh, poor warren...

18
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:50,451
wa... wally... what?

19
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:51,784
Walter. Walter.

20
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:54,417
He was your dad's stepbrother. Oh.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,417
And to be honest,
he kind of hated him.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,684
Yeah, but still, someone died.
I mean, that's so sad.

23
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,618
I have the cutest
black dress. Yeah.

24
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:02,884
Oh, my god.

25
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:04,985
I win!

26
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:07,751
Oh, it's an open casket, dad.

27
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,317
I don't think i'm ready
to see a dead body.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,250
Oh, they fix 'em
up to look almost real.

29
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,417
They inject this rubbery
stuff into their veins,

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,951
makes 'em more posable.

31
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,284
It's how we get mannequins.

32
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,517
Dad.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,884
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Come on. What?

34
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,818
And you, young lady,
the least you could do

35
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,884
is muster a tear for your uncle.
Mom, i can't. I didn't know him.

36
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,918
Well, then pluck a nose hair.

37
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:32,417
Do not embarrass me in front of the
family. Look, i don't know anybody here,

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,351
you know,
which is kind of sad for me...

39
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,584
because i just don't
have any connection to...

40
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,985
no. I'm sorry. Yes, it is sad.
The newlys are dropping like flies,

41
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:43,918
and you're not exactly churning
out the replacements. Pow! Good one.

42
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,117
I'm sorry. It's not you. I'm sorry.

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,284
Funerals just remind me
of the shortness of life.

44
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,718
I mean, don't you even want kids?

45
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:56,884
Mom! Well... well, look at
her. She's doing her part.

46
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,884
Look, i haven't
thought about it, okay?

47
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,751
There are still three
keys on my key chain

48
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:05,651
i have no idea what they're for.
Just one thing at a time.

49
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:09,051
Just remember, you've only
got so many eggs left in there.

50
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:11,085
At your age, your ovaries are

51
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:14,150
churning like a broken motel
ice machine.

52
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,250
Hey, are you not going in?
I don't know.

53
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,150
Are you a relative? Yeah.

54
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:20,684
I'm sorry, but if you
could hold her for a second,

55
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,618
i'll be right back. Yeah. Okay.

56
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,150
I just waited so long to
see walter dead. Thank you.

57
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,399
Okay. Okay.
All right, holding a baby.

58
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:31,417
Oh, you're very squirmy.

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,150
Top-heavy...

60
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:38,351
oh, my god, your head smells
so... so, so good.

61
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:41,317
Oh, no.

62
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,317
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Do you want a handkerchief?

63
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,705
I want a baby!

00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,451

66
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,250
oh, my god! Look at this!

67
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,384
Can you believe we were this small?

68
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:02,384
Oh, i'd kill to fit into that. I don't know
what it is. It's like i smelled that baby,

69
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,384
and something unleashed in me,
you know?

70
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,584
You know, how birds, they
feed their young by, like...

71
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,150
bleh in their mouths? I used
to think that was totally gross.

72
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,317
Now i think it's beautiful.
Now i want a baby.

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,085
I want to puke in its mouth. You used to
puke in your own mouth. I miss those days.

74
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:17,351
Ah! He did it again.

75
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,184
That was walter's lawyer.

76
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,551
Son of a bitch left me an airplane.

77
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,951
We won an airplane? Yeah,
4-seater, single engine, beauty.

78
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:26,517
Howard, that's wonderful.

79
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,918
Let's go to south beach for
lunch. Regina, can't you see

80
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,150
that walter is taunting
me from the grave?

81
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,117
Howard, please. No, he's saying
that i could never get an airplane

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,150
unless he gave me one.
Well, screw him.

83
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:40,751
I'm gonna sell it and buy a
pinball machine. No, you're not.

84
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,718
Oh, yes, i am. Oh, no, you're
not. I am not gonna buy into

85
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,684
this ridiculous
competition between you two.

86
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,417
We have an airplane. I'm gonna
sign up for flying lessons.

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,918
So take that...

88
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:57,018
paula drake, and your
precious little koi pond!

89
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,517
Mr. Cellophane, no. Get our
new doggy out of your mouth.

90
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,851
Do you know how long it
takes to adopt a baby?

91
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:07,250
It's so stupid. What if i
don't want a baby in two years?

92
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,684
Yeah, that may be the
point. Y... hey, you know

93
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,684
what they used to make us do in
high school?

94
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,217
They used to give us an egg
and we'd have to carry it around

95
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,918
for the week so we, you know,
got to see how hard it is

96
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:21,517
to take care of something. Here.
Try it. Aah! Oh, i wasn't ready.

97
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,718
Indeed.

98
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:27,051
Your dog's eating my baby.

99
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:33,951
No. No, no, no, no. Sam. Sam. Look.

100
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:36,150
Oh, my god.
They think you're pregnant.

101
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,951
You're going to make
a wonderful mother.

102
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:41,117
She won't. That's not a baby.

103
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,217
That a bagel. I ate a bagel.

104
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,217
That's what i get for eating
breakfast one time in 20 years.

105
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,451
Everybody gets to be a mommy but me.

106
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:53,618
Mr. Cellophane, no. Release your
foster puppy.

107
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:57,818
Come o... sam, will you
hold him for a second?

108
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:02,684
Come o

109
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,018
dena?

110
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:09,851
Sam...

111
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,484
hey.

112
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:15,866
You like him? His name's baby.

113
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,885
A dog? No. No.

114
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,351
Isn't he cute?

115
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:23,050
Hi. Get you off of there.
You get off of there.

116
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,117
Sam, a dog is a lot of work.

117
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,618
I can handle it.

118
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,584
I already dropped him, and
he totally didn't break.

119
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,651
Come on. Let's go take him for a
walk. Sam, no. I don't want a dog.

120
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:36,084
Fine. Good. Then more dog for me. No, i'm
serious. It's your dog. I'm not helping.

121
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,084
Yeah, well, you know what?
I'm serious.

122
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,084
I'm seriously insulted
that you even think

123
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,351
that i would need your help.

124
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:44,950
I mean, it's... it's not
like it's 1862 or something.

125
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:47,950
Women can have dog
babies on their own.

126
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:53,684
Look, i assure you, it's not
gonna impact you in any way.

127
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:57,885
And i would like to buy that shoe.

128
00:05:57,968 --> 00:05:59,217
Okay, bedtime.

129
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:07,084
Mommy has to work in the
morning, so night-night.

130
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,284
* oh, i like you so very much *

131
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:13,084
* so much, in fact,
i gotta wake you up *

132
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,984
* it's not that i
have words to speak *

133
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,618
* i just wanna see
you looking at me *

134
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:21,418
* and wait *

135
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,451
* in that state *

136
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:36,317
* in an hour when the sun
comes up, we're gonna... *

137
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,151
of course.

138
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:40,151
Hello? Samantha?

139
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,151
Mom. Mom, why are you
calling me so early?

140
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:46,151
It's 11:00. You were supposed
to cover our showing today.

141
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,851
What? What? Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

142
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,851
Samantha, if you're not gonna

143
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,885
take this job seriously,
then don't do it.

144
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:55,751
Look at me! I'm an aviatrix!

145
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:58,718
Okay, let's fly. Give me the
keys. Uh, soon, yes, but i...

146
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,718
first, i need you to sign this release
form. Release form? What for? Mm.

147
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,251
In case something happens.
Like what?

148
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:07,251
Oh, you mean like i'm the first
woman to fly around the world?

149
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,251
I'm not signing away my life story.

150
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,818
No, that... that's not gonna happen.

151
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,284
No, this just says
we're not responsible

152
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,351
if you have an incident.

153
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:17,984
With?

154
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:25,584
The ground.

155
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,418
Look, could i just drive it
around the parking lot instead?

156
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,950
Hey, look. We're even.

157
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:34,451
Jimmy choos.
Though it's not his fault.

158
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:36,484
It has the word "chew" right in it.

159
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,418
All right, come here, you.
Look, you have a good day.

160
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,418
When i get back, we're
gonna have a nice, long nap.

161
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:52,251
All right? You two be good.

162
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:58,518
Oh, my cell phone.

163
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:03,418
Hey, i...

164
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:09,851
one of us was not good.

165
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:11,917
Yes.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,451
Yes, yes, yes.

167
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,785
I'm gonna wear you
like a little sweater,

168
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,351
and then i'm gonna get
some coffee right now,

169
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:21,251
and then you and i are
gonna go everywhere, okay?

170
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,584
What?

171
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,651
Oh, come on.

172
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:27,317
That wasn't there before.

173
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:37,885
Uh, one house drip, please.

174
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,017
That's a bad dog owner, huh?

175
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,017
I mean, who is it?

176
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,718
I don't know.

177
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:45,984
Frank. What are you doing here?

178
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,584
You realize i'm not actually
attached to your building,

179
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,950
don't you?

180
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,451
I'm on a break.

181
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:53,451
Oh. Yeah,
i'm just getting some coffee.

182
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,484
My new little doggy
and i were up all night,

183
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,451
just playing and frolicking and...
yes, i heard from your neighbors.

184
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:02,418
What, they heard him barking?
No. They heard you crying.

185
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,117
Here you go. No.

186
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,151
Laughing, frank. I was laughing.

187
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,151
Oh, god. I'm in hell, frank.

188
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:10,151
I mean, he's... he
chews furniture all day,

189
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,151
he spins around all night.

190
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,117
I mean, doesn't he know he's
not gonna catch his tail?

191
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,184
Like, does he not understand
that? I remember those nights.

192
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,117
Maddie's first night in the house,

193
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,618
my wife and i were
up every five minutes.

194
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,751
Oh, yeah? What kind of breed is she?

195
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,651
Maddie's your daughter, isn't she?

196
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:30,050
Yes. God, you have a daughter,
frank. I mean, how do you do it?

197
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,917
24 hours with a dog, and i
am absolutely losing my mind.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,618
I me, what am i gonna
do if i have a child?

199
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,017
You know, i used to be a tour guide.

200
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,751
Frank, my attention span is like...

201
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:43,217
people were allowed to
get off at wrigley field.

202
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,151
When they got back on, i
counted, and i couldn't leave

203
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:49,551
until the same number
of people got back on.

204
00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:51,317
That's parenting.

205
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,351
If, at the end of the day, you
have the same number of kids

206
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,484
you started out with,
that's a good tour.

207
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,017
Right. Yeah.

208
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,917
That's a... that's a good goal.

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,384
I can do that. Thank you.

210
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,184
What?

211
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,251
Baby... he was just right here.

212
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,418
Oh, no. Oh, no. Baby!

213
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,584
Another tip...
tie your child up inside.

214
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,967
Oh, bad mommy.

215
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,385
Oh, good. You're here.
Um, i'm just curious.

216
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,284
Did you happen to take any
pictures of baby this morning

217
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:28,418
that would make a good poster?
You lost the dog, didn't you?

218
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,418
Huh. Well, look who's all
full of questions suddenly

219
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:32,917
about the dog.

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,851
I thought you didn't care, which
is why you wouldn't watch him,

221
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,051
which is why i had him to lose.

222
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:41,784
Dena is gonna be very disappointed in you.
Okay, so shouldn't we be out looking for the dog?

223
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,917
I've been looking,
okay? But don't you help.

224
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,951
No, no, please. I'd rather you
do the "i told you so" dance,

225
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:50,018
because as you said, i
cannot take care of a dog,

226
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,617
much less a baby.

227
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,251
Okay, i get it. You're mad
at me because i was right.

228
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:56,851
And there it is.

229
00:10:56,934 --> 00:11:02,650
Wow. That did not take long at all.

230
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,851
Hey, everyone!

231
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:06,485
Todd is right!

232
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:09,351
You hear that, chicago?

233
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:12,351
Yeah, you know what? I-i think
i'm gonna go out for a while.

234
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:14,917
Yeah, you know what? You
should, 'cause i'm sure

235
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,284
everybody wants to see
the guy that was right.

236
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,550
Here he comes, chicago!

237
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:21,550
Start the parade!

238
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,351
Crap.

239
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:28,917
Another plant died.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,650
Where's sam? Oh, i
guess she's running late.

241
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,318
You know new dog owners...

242
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,717
it always takes them forever
to get out of the house.

243
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,717
I guess we're gonna talk now,
huh? Fun.

244
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,684
So what's with all the baby stuff?

245
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,784
I thought you were gonna tell the press
you aren't pregnant. Well, i was going to,

246
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,251
but then the stores just
started sending me things.

247
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:48,684
Look at this bag... -

248
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,351
$3,000. Gorgeous.

249
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:52,884
Isn't that a diaper bag?

250
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,351
Not unless it has a diaper in it.

251
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:58,118
What the hell is this for?

252
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,451
Oh, i just figured it out. Ah.

253
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,650
Here we go.

254
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,284
Martini.

255
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,617
And for the famous pregnant lady,

256
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,851
i brought you a club soda.

257
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,650
A club what? What's in there?

258
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:14,418
Club soda.
I saw you in the tabloids.

259
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,451
No drinking.

260
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:19,318
All right, that's not gonna happen.

261
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:21,318
All right, isten up, everyone!

262
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,617
I am not pregnant.

263
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,184
I am thin. I am... i am very thin.

264
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:31,284
Take a picture. Tell your friends.

265
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:39,118
Sure, have a sip.

266
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:41,184
You rang?
Yeah, thanks for coming up.

267
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,084
I'm on hold with
one of the shelters,

268
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,051
but i need you to take these
flyers and pass them out, okay?

269
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:48,151
You lost your horse, too?

270
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,550
I had to draw from memory, all
right? You remembered you had a horse?

271
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:56,451
Hey! I came to see e doggy.

272
00:12:56,534 --> 00:13:00,833
You think she saw me?

273
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:04,751
Hey. I'm sorry about that.
The stupid door keeps slamming.

274
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,484
Seriously, frank, someone's
gonna lose a finger.

275
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:11,284
Guess which one i'd miss most.

276
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:14,318
Hey, you know what? Dena,
i was just about to turn in.

277
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:16,850
Oh, i'll just be a second.
Where's baby?

278
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:19,251
Um, he's out, um, like a light. Oh.

279
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:23,217
He's sleeping. Oh, well,
he'll want to see me.

280
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,251
Baby! Yeah, he won't come.
He's... he's really, really stupid.

281
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,751
Oh, shy. He is shy. He is so shy.

282
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:31,917
Oh, well, uh, i want
to give him his new toy.

283
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,618
You know,
i'm gonna be honest with you.

284
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:38,051
I have given him so many toys. But he'll
want this one from his aunt dena. Won't you?

285
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:42,618
Won't you, baby, huh? Won't
you, baby? Yes, you will.

286
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:45,651
Oh, whew. Hey. He just
ran right into the closet.

287
00:13:45,734 --> 00:13:48,251
He's quick.
Did you see him go in there?

288
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:51,484
Oh, look at that. So cute.

289
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,584
Oh, okay. I'll just take a peek.

290
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,584
No. Just... here, i'll
take it. I'll take the toy.

291
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,618
I'll give it to him. Oh.

292
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:01,318
Hey there, you.

293
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:04,318
Oh! Whoa! Was i wrong.

294
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:07,884
He is really loves...
he loves this toy.

295
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:11,418
I'm gonna get it!

296
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:19,950
Oh, boy. He's a real fighter!

297
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23,484
I won.

298
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,418
So where's the dog?

299
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:28,017
Oh, he, uh, just scooted
right on out of here.

300
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,017
Probably went underneath
the bed or somethin'.

301
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,017
Oh! Okay. No! No! Don't
look under the bed.

302
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,017
Don't look under the bed.
No! Why not?

303
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,117
No, because... oh, boo.

304
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,618
Your christmas present
is underneath there.

305
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:41,017
Really?

306
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,884
This early? Oh. Yeah,
i saw it in the store,

307
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,618
and i was like, "that
is so dena," so i got it.

308
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:55,785
He look who i found outside.

309
00:14:55,868 --> 00:15:00,451
Merry christmas.

310
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:04,351
Hey, regina, can i come in?

311
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:07,484
I, uh, i just got a call
from your instructor.

312
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:11,484
He wanted to lock up for the night.

313
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,884
I can't do it, howard.

314
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:16,384
I can't go up in this thing.

315
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,384
Well, let's sell it then.

316
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:21,351
I mean, it gets lousy
mileage on the highway.

317
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,351
No, we can't sell it.

318
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,751
This plane was gonna
make us do things...

319
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,917
zip off to atlantic
city for the weekend,

320
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,484
fly to bora bora,

321
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,518
have a massage from bare-chested men

322
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,484
who fed us mangoes
and rubbed our feet...

323
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:42,884
doesn't sound sanitary.

324
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:48,817
I wanted us to be the
newlys who have adventures.

325
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,984
They're fascinating people, howard.

326
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,584
Well...

327
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,117
you know, we can still do things.

328
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,017
We can sell the plane

329
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,850
and then take a trip to bora bora.

330
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:03,051
Really? You'd go?

331
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,518
Well, yeah. Why not?

332
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,518
You get to see one
of those fire dances

333
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:10,384
and get a massage... from a woman.

334
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:12,651
Oh, we could, huh?

335
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:24,418
And we'd have enough left
over to buy a pinball machine.

336
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,785
I win.

337
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:30,351
I'm so sorry, dena. I-i
just took my eyes off of him

338
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:33,351
for one second. Well, don't beat
yourself up, sam. I mean, dogs run away.

339
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:35,751
That's why we inject microchips
into their necks, right?

340
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,751
I mean, yes, we do.

341
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:39,685
Don't we put things in your neck?

342
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:41,984
I'm trying to get one into chase,

343
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,984
but he's a light sleeper,
so... well, thank you.

344
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:48,051
Bye. Bye. Oh, hey,
thanks for finding him.

345
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,017
Where was he? Side street...

346
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,017
oh. Staring in the
window of a shoe store.

347
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,917
You know, the thing
is, before he got lost,

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,184
it's like a small part of me was
wishing i had never gotten him,

349
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,184
but then when he was gone,
all i could think about was,

350
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:03,984
please be okay. Oh.

351
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:06,184
Well, he does sort
of grow on ya. Yeah.

352
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:09,984
You know, maybe tomorrow we could take
him to the park. No, i'm giving him away.

353
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:12,217
What?

354
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,217
Wait. Sam. No, i'm not
ready to feel like that...

355
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,217
thinking and worrying
that much about something.

356
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,917
I mean, i get lost myself,
like, nine times a day.

357
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,117
I'm already enough to handle. Well,
sure. Yeah, wh-whatever you want.

358
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,017
I mean, it's up to you.

359
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,785
I mean, why start including me
in any decisions around here?

360
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:33,351
Hey, todd? Do you know
where the corkscrew is?

361
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:41,651
I know we had it when we
snuck wine in the movies.

362
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,418
What's this?

363
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:46,084
Oh, it's nothing. Give
it to me. Baby names?

364
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:49,084
Oh, it was on sale. I
collect names. Give it.

365
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,151
Hmm. You highlighted some.
Let's see.

366
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:54,518
"Cynthia"... no.

367
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:55,817
And holden.

368
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,718
Holden deepler.

369
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:01,084
Oh, god, i would have no
problem spanking that kid.

370
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,817
I was goofing around. You
said you might be pregnant.

371
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,718
When? Thredays ago. You
were gonna take a test.

372
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,184
I did. I passed. No baby.

373
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:12,551
Wait. You took the
test without me there?

374
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,584
What, you wanted to watch me pee?

375
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,584
Because, you know, i could
direct you to some web sites,

376
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:20,051
if that's what you're into.

377
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:22,817
No, forget it. No baby...
that's all i wanted to know.

378
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,751
It's great.

379
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,017
I'll just open up the wine.

380
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:47,351
How about gaylord? Gaylord deepler?

381
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:50,751
Here. Stay there.

382
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:59,651
Hey. Why are you acting this way?

383
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,584
Because when a guy
storms out of a room,

384
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,584
he likes to slam a door,

385
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:08,950
and i don't have a door,
and you can't slam a couch.

386
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:12,518
Look, i'm sorry i didn't
involve you in this...

387
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,284
or anything.

388
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,484
I just...

389
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,718
i can't play house with you, okay?

390
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:21,217
Huh? I mean, it's hard
enough living here,

391
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,785
remembering we're not together,

392
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,584
and then you bring in
something to care about

393
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,251
and expect us to act like a family,

394
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,850
and i have to remember,
we're not that either.

395
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,284
See? This is what i mean...
soone so self-involved

396
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,518
that doesn't even realize that
you're going through something

397
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:38,017
should not be raising a baby.

398
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,084
Yet.

399
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:44,584
Don't move. He's sleeping.

400
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:48,051
Wait. Wh-wh-what? I have
to stand here all night?

401
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:50,950
Yeah. I'll get you a
blanket. No, no, no. Sam. Sam.

402
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:58,651
Shh. Don't move. Don't you move.

403
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:01,451
It is kind of remarkable we
have this instinct to nurture,

404
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,318
to raise another living creature.

405
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:08,318
Do we do it to feel important?

406
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:11,318
To be the center
of someone's universe?

407
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:14,950
That's more like it. Oh!

408
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,184
* to listen to the
voice that told me *

409
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,950
maybe we want it to turn us
into someone we want to be

410
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:21,950
but aren't ready to be. Here you go.

411
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:25,418
Someday, maybe, just not yet.

412
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:27,184
* always love *

413
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,184
being a parent is pretty
much all sacrifice,

414
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:33,817
so until i can give another
person all that it takes,

415
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,184
i'm gonna stick to my
plants, holden and cynthia.

416
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:42,017
You can leave these things
anywhere, and they stay put.

417
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,950
Sorry, frank!

418
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:48,618
* squeeze the air and
keep the rest out *

419
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:51,017
and at least now i know
that when i am ready,

420
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,418
i might not have to fly solo.

421
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,184
* even when you then cross it out *

422
00:20:56,267 --> 00:21:00,017
* always love *

423
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,718
* hate will get you every time *

424
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:17,917
* always love *

425
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,418
when you're little,
nighttime is scary

426
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,651
because there are monsters
hiding right under the bed.

427
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,618
When you get older,

428
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,651
the monsters are different...

429
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:29,300
self-doubt...
