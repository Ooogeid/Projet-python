1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,852
<i>Previously on The vampire Diaries...</i>

2
00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:04,503
<i>For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.</i>

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,737
<i>I know the risk,
but I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,854
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

5
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:11,417
- Our love for Katherine wasn't real.
- It was real for me.

6
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:14,221
I'm gonna bring her back.
There's a tomb underneath the church.

7
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,677
A spell sealed Katherine
in that tomb, protecting her.

8
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:18,476
- Tell me how to get in.
- The grimoire.

9
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,145
- Where is it?
- Check the journal. Jonathan Gilbert's.

10
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,994
The grimoire. It was Emily's, right?

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,671
That's what you need to reverse
the spell. I'll help you.

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,769
You just couldn't
live without me, huh?

13
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:29,987
Your eye!
Where'd she go?

14
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,739
- Where'd who go?
- Anna.

15
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,743
I wouldn't.

16
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,408
Don't try to escape.

17
00:01:57,796 --> 00:01:58,993
Don't even move.

18
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,163
Do you understand?

19
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,024
I understand.

20
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,593
- Seriously?!
- I told her not to move!

21
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:19,415
I did that eye thing you taught me.

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,308
You forgot the lesson about vervain.
She dates a vampire, Ben, duh!

23
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,436
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Doesn't matter.

24
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,383
Mystic Falls Team
1x14 - Fool Me Once

25
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:53,255
Croutch, Dark_Chii, McFly,
MiniBen314, Paulp, Thirteen & WoLF971.

26
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,520
Anna took Elena.

27
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,753
Yeah, I got that from
your 600 voicemails.

28
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:06,307
All night long, every single street
in town, I've been searching.

29
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:09,230
What if your blood
hasn't passed out of her system?

30
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,555
Then at least you know
you'll see her again.

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,691
Please.

32
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,414
What do you know?
You were with Anna.

33
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,812
You must know where she's living.
Just tell me where I can find her.

34
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:22,225
You can go.

35
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,871
Really.

36
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:27,706
You know,

37
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,750
all I can remember is hating you.

38
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,961
There might've been a time
when it was different

39
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,797
but your choices have erased
anything good about you.

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,591
But see, I also know

41
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,010
that you've just
as much reason to hate me.

42
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,567
This all began with me.

43
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,207
Katherine got taken away from you

44
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,394
because of me.

45
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:52,771
And I'm sorry.

46
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,310
Apology accepted.

47
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:00,402
So please,

48
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,033
just tell me what you know.

49
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,986
It's Elena, Damon.
If you know something...

50
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,330
tell me.

51
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,548
I mean this sincerely.

52
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:19,333
I hope Elena

53
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,127
dies.

54
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:33,355
You're okay!

55
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,323
- My head...
- Come here.

56
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,149
Ben is a v...

57
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,822
They can hear.

58
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,913
- I was so stupid!
- He had all of us fooled.

59
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,911
What's going on?
Why are we here?

60
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:53,968
It must have something to do with
the tomb and Emily's spell book.

61
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,252
Spell book?

62
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,630
Damon said that it could be used
to open the tomb.

63
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:00,377
Why didn't I know
about any of this?

64
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:04,470
I was trying to keep you out of it,
hoping it would never come to this.

65
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:05,916
Come to what?

66
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:08,161
They need a witch...

67
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:11,352
to break the spell
and let the vampires out.

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
- No way.
- I know...

69
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,236
You're wasting your time.

70
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:23,607
I'm not gonna help you.

71
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,517
That's why she's here.

72
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:30,621
Motivation for you to behave.

73
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:33,869
You know,
you shouldn't be so desperate.

74
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:36,126
You made it too easy.

75
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,463
She wants to talk to you.

76
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,854
You really are
Katherine's doppelganger.

77
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:50,641
You must have
the Salvatore boys reeling.

78
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,456
- Who are you?
- I'm Anna.

79
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:56,188
Your brother
may have mentioned me.

80
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,651
I mean, we're, like,
practically dating.

81
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,969
Ten kegs? You know how much damage
we could do with ten kegs?

82
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:08,242
- Duke's got it all hooked up.
- Duke's a douche.

83
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:11,578
Yeah, a douche with ten kegs.
Aka, my new best friend.

84
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:16,250
- What's the problem, Gilbert?
- Don't have one, Lockwood.

85
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,934
Yeah, I didn't think so.

86
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,129
- You ever get bored of it?
- Of what?

87
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,297
Yourself?

88
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:26,264
Keep laughing, buddy.

89
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:29,746
Where is Elena?

90
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,474
I have been texting her and Bonnie
all day about Duke's party.

91
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,268
She went somewhere with Stefan.

92
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:36,985
I am so not going
to be one of those girls

93
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,719
who disappears just because
she has a new boyfriend.

94
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:40,941
Who is Duke?

95
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,310
Some guy that graduated
a couple years ago.

96
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,280
And he throws a party
every time he comes home from Duke.

97
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:48,365
Wait, Duke goes to Duke?

98
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:50,826
His real name is Bob or something.

99
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,572
He's a total ass.
But he buys the beer.

100
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,889
Maybe you should come.

101
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:00,836
- I don't think so.
- No, seriously. Everyone goes.

102
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,464
Even quiet loner little brothers.

103
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,050
Think about it.

104
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,115
So I have a speech.

105
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:17,227
It is fully scripted and
well-rehearsed. Are you ready for it?

106
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:19,563
- You wrote a speech?
- Yes.

107
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,260
It's a "You kissed me and I don't
want things to be weird" speech.

108
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:24,526
It's pre-emptive.

109
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,533
Pre-emptive.

110
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:30,574
You know, in case you were
having second thoughts or regrets or

111
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,701
- were, like, ooged out...
- Ooged, huh?

112
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,954
Can I just get on
with the speech part?

113
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,019
- Go for it.
- So

114
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,301
I know that you don't think that
this is going to work out between us.

115
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:44,588
I just want to let you know that
right here and right now,

116
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,299
I'm offering you an out.
Like an escape clause.

117
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,426
Why are you giving me
an escape clause?

118
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:53,806
I don't want to make assumptions
about what it is we are doing here.

119
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:55,664
Got it.

120
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:57,838
So...

121
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,011
if you would like
to exercise it, just...

122
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:02,981
let me know.

123
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:04,817
I'm good, but thanks.

124
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:10,698
Good.

125
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:12,295
So...

126
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,618
- See you for Duke's tonight.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,917
- Yes?
- Hi there.

128
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,212
- I'm looking for Bonnie.
- She's not here.

129
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,590
- Do you know when she would...
- Never.

130
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:33,220
You have quite an opinion
for someone who doesn't know me.

131
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,955
You got some nerve knocking
on a Bennett witch's door

132
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,559
- and asking her for anything.
- What'd I do?

133
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:42,437
Spirits talk, Mr. Salvatore,
and so does my granddaughter.

134
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,305
You are no friend to us.

135
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,525
Now get off my porch.

136
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:49,331
Step outside and say that.

137
00:08:57,886 --> 00:08:59,186
I am not Bonnie.

138
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,582
You don't want to mess with me.

139
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,966
Bonnie's not gonna open the tomb.

140
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,248
I think she will.

141
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,303
Do you really want
Katherine out that bad?

142
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:16,727
Trust me.

143
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,496
No one I know wants
to see that girl again.

144
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:21,871
Except Damon, the lovestruck idiot.

145
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,645
Then what is it?

146
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,453
Or who is it?

147
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,318
My mother's in there.

148
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,854
Katherine couldn't help herself.
She just...

149
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,575
had to toy around
with both of the Salvatore brothers.

150
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:38,827
And when she got caught,

151
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,489
so did my mother.

152
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,099
I watched
Jonathan Gilbert take her away.

153
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,032
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,920
You really mean that, don't you?

155
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,669
Yeah, I think we'll skip
the dead mom bonding so

156
00:09:57,794 --> 00:10:00,557
- you can start serving a purpose.
- Which is what?

157
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,725
Leverage.

158
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,479
This belong to you?

159
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:15,072
- Are you okay?
- <i>She's fine, for now.</i>

160
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,340
Tell me you have the grimoire
and she'll stay fine.

161
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,995
- I can get it.
- <i>Which means your brother has it.</i>

162
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,593
And I have the witch.
So one of you...

163
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:27,584
had better meet me in the very public
Town Square in 30 minutes

164
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,502
so we can safely discuss how fun
it's gonna be to work together.

165
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,880
Go ahead. Grovel again.

166
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:39,132
Wait, no.

167
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:41,621
I don't care.

168
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,970
I'm leaving.

169
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,299
Keep them buttoned down.
Compsion won't work.

170
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,115
Just use violence.

171
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,574
Right. I got that.

172
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:03,936
Sit. Behave.

173
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,332
So you're the key to this.

174
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:08,662
Literally.

175
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:11,078
The one who opens the door.

176
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,463
Tell me,

177
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,845
how long have you been a witch?

178
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,070
Is there anything to drink here?

179
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,688
Are you offering?

180
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,556
There's water on the nightstand.

181
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,853
Can I have a sip?

182
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:44,063
Come back in, shut the door!

183
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,163
Don't hurt her!

184
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,531
Don't make me!

185
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,334
Lock it.

186
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:06,038
What happened to you last night?

187
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:07,809
Sorry, I had to leave.

188
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,395
- I told your sister to tell you.
- I haven't seen her.

189
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,441
- I gotta run, so...
- Do you want to go to a party tonight?

190
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:16,109
Do I what?

191
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,342
The guy that's throwing it is a total
douche, but it's supposed to be fun.

192
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,531
I figured, you know,
safety in numbers.

193
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:25,010
So you're finally
ready to go out with me, are you?

194
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,138
It's been a while
since I've been to a party,

195
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,913
and I kinda wanna get back out there.
And not be such a loner.

196
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:33,603
And... I like you.

197
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,588
You're fun, and...

198
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:38,617
you're also kinda
strange and lurky, but,

199
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,592
I guess I like that, too.

200
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,179
So, yeah, you should
come to the party. With me.

201
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:47,599
It's in the woods
by that old cemetery.

202
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,353
It's there, huh?

203
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,771
That sounds cool.

204
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:54,523
I'll meet you.

205
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,480
Okay! Great!

206
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:58,659
Cool.

207
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:13,291
Got a hot date, or you just planning on
nabbing the entire Gilbert family?

208
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:16,116
A party, right next
to the old cemetery.

209
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:18,372
Isn't that nice of them?

210
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,507
Lots of warm bodies
for starving vampires.

211
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,801
I told you.
I work alone.

212
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:24,278
Yeah, so do I.

213
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:27,659
But you're minus a witch
and I'm minus spell book.

214
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:29,057
So what do you say?

215
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:31,671
Stefan will come after you,
you know that.

216
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,395
For messing with Elena.

217
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:36,011
Then he won't be too happy
if I kill her

218
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:38,086
when I don't get what I want.

219
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:43,071
When do you want to do this?

220
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:48,076
God, it's like 1864 all over again.

221
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:52,212
You Salvatores are truly
pathetic when it comes to women.

222
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,004
Tonight. After sundown.

223
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:56,710
Meet at the church.

224
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,301
Witches don't have
eternal life, right?

225
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,345
So you guys can die.

226
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,222
Yeah, we can die.

227
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:14,477
That sucks.

228
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,051
Let's get outside.

229
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,349
When the sun goes down,

230
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:28,608
leave town.

231
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:30,538
If I ever see you again,

232
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:31,963
I will kill you.

233
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,004
How did you know where we were?

234
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,572
Many things can fuel
a witch's power.

235
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:45,779
Worry, anger.

236
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,222
After Stefan told me that they had
taken you, I had a lot of both.

237
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,809
Simple locator spell
was easy after that.

238
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:56,405
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:58,901
About all of this.

240
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,274
Not as sorry as they're gonna be.

241
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,778
So what do we do now?

242
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,543
For now, you need to stay here.

243
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:08,770
A prisoner, in my own home?

244
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,544
- I don't think so.
- I can't protect you

245
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:13,954
- if you leave the house.
- We'll protect ourselves.

246
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:18,625
We need to let him
have Katherine back.

247
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:22,379
He's not gonna stop until he gets her.
If we help him, maybe that ends it.

248
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,631
No! He doesn't deserve
to get what he wants.

249
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,758
What other choice do we have?

250
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,221
Witches being pulled down
by vampire problems.

251
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:35,141
As much as we tried
to do to stay out of it.

252
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,771
I'll open the tomb.

253
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:43,959
You get your brother's girl,
and destroy the rest with fire.

254
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:46,945
Then this will be all over.

255
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,615
- We still have to get Damon to agree.
- He already agreed once.

256
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,243
And then we double cross him.
So now he's angry.

257
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,287
He's hurt.
There's a difference.

258
00:15:58,076 --> 00:15:59,791
I think I know what I have to do.

259
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,566
You've got to be kidding me.

260
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,139
It was Stefan.

261
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,143
- There was nothing I could...
- Shut up! Stop talking.

262
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,590
Without the witch,

263
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:26,292
we don't have Damon or the grimoire.

264
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:29,532
Damon's not gonna stop.

265
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,886
He'll find a way to get in.

266
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:36,396
We're gonna be there when he does.

267
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,550
I'm gonna have to change the locks.

268
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:52,469
Did you stage a jailbreak?

269
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,346
- Stefan.
- Oh, brother.

270
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:57,390
Ever the white knight.

271
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,435
I convinced Bonnie to help you.

272
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,753
I doubt that.

273
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,249
I'm not going to say that I'm sorry

274
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:06,849
we got the Grimoire
without you last night, becausen

275
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:08,274
I'm not, really.

276
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,174
At least you're honest.

277
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,949
I was protecting
the people I love, Damon.

278
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:15,533
But so were you,

279
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:18,687
in your own, twisted way.
And as hard as it is to figure,

280
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:21,456
we're all on the same side,
after the same thing.

281
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,577
- Not interested.
- Yes, you are.

282
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:26,802
Because you were willing
to work with us yesterday.

283
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,777
Fool me once, shame on you.

284
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:33,009
When we were in Atlanta, why didn't you
use your compulsion on me?

285
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:37,793
Who's to say I didn't?

286
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:40,254
You didn't.

287
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,278
I know you didn't.

288
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,387
But you could have.

289
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:49,843
You and I...

290
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,775
we have something.

291
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,216
An understanding.

292
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,650
And I know that
my betrayal hurt you,

293
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:03,483
different from how it is
with you and Stefan, but,

294
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:07,377
I'm promising you this now,
I'll help you get Katherine back.

295
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:12,757
I wish I could believe you.

296
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,370
Ask me if I'm lying now.

297
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,182
No animal will stop, by the way,
no matter what I do.

298
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,021
Then we'll deal with it.

299
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:53,465
I didn't compel you in Atlanta
because we were having fun.

300
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,744
I wanted it to be real.

301
00:19:03,045 --> 00:19:04,395
I'm trusting you.

302
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:09,615
Don't make me regret it.

303
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:26,414
The Duke party. I forgot.
I hope they stay clear of the church.

304
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:28,238
Your hope, not mine.

305
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:32,078
Where have you been?

306
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:35,215
Long story, no time to tell it.

307
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,775
- Wasn't talking to you.
- Sure you were.

308
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:39,552
We haven't met. I'm Matt.

309
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,471
There's a reason we haven't met.

310
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,825
You and I are going that way.

311
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,450
I'm sorry, you guys.

312
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,335
Cleared the debris away.

313
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:56,687
Set the torches like you asked.
We can get down now.

314
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:00,143
What is that?

315
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:03,314
It's everything I need
to destroy them.

316
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,028
Are you sure Damon
will come back with her?

317
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,001
Brother, witches.

318
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:14,730
- Everything okay?
- I just want to get this over with.

319
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:16,005
Are we ready?

320
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:17,654
I guess so.

321
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,582
I'll be right back.

322
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:36,651
- You got any weed?
- Wait, you're kidding me, right?

323
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,350
You act like a total dick
every time we cross paths, and

324
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:41,906
now you wanna party with me?

325
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,237
I'm not Gilbert.
I'm just asking you question.

326
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:45,869
I don't get you, man.

327
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,113
It's a party.

328
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:49,747
You're a partier, okay?
There's no need to psychoanalyze it.

329
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:53,418
I don't party anymore. And even
if I did, it wouldn't be with you.

330
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:55,248
No problem.

331
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,571
Carry on just
standing there, by yourself.

332
00:20:58,913 --> 00:20:59,913
All alone.

333
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:01,843
The enemy of fun.

334
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,221
Do you even have any friends?

335
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,006
Thank God.

336
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,141
Weird hello, but okay.

337
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:22,875
What's the matter?

338
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:24,824
Nothing, just...

339
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:27,963
It's nothin'.

340
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:30,209
Come on, let's walk.

341
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:35,898
Air.

342
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:37,355
Earth.

343
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,831
Fire.

344
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:41,204
Water.

345
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:45,386
That's it, just water from the tap?

346
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,160
As opposed to what?

347
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:51,184
I just figured maybe it would have
to be blessed or mystical or something.

348
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:56,606
What's that?

349
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,181
It's for Katherine.

350
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,485
Gotta have something
to get her going.

351
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,695
Unless your girl's
offering a vein to tap.

352
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:07,325
Admit it.

353
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:10,954
You can't wait to get rid of me.

354
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:15,792
I can't wait to get rid of you.

355
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,004
You ready?

356
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:25,189
This place is wild.

357
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,428
- You kinda like dead people, huh?
- I'm strange, remember?

358
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:32,331
You okay?

359
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:37,453
This place makes me
think about someone.

360
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:38,828
A dead someone?

361
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,641
No, no, just...

362
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,903
someone I used to know.

363
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:50,076
We made it all of, what,
37 minutes in that party?

364
00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:52,453
Not your scene?

365
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,621
No, I'm not really sure
what my scene is anymore.

366
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,820
So what do you say?
You wanna be...

367
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:02,995
wanna be part of my non-scene?

368
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:07,704
I would happily be a part
of your non-scene, except...

369
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,299
I'm leaving.

370
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:12,852
Wait, what?

371
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,643
Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.

372
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:21,998
That's a bummer.

373
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:26,526
So...

374
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:28,913
Guess this is good-bye.

375
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:32,432
I guess it is.

376
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,881
Anna, your face!

377
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,550
- It's nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.

378
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:54,196
You didn't have
to hit him that hard.

379
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:55,558
Yes, I did.

380
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,062
Grab him, and let's go.

381
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,560
I'm taking him to meet my mother.

382
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,454
Where's your date?

383
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:15,579
Who knows?

384
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:17,849
Is the honeymoon over already?

385
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:18,974
Maybe.

386
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,363
After all that grief
you gave me about liking her.

387
00:24:21,488 --> 00:24:23,920
I figured it would have lasted
longer than five minutes.

388
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:27,331
I don't know if I can do
the whole public couple thing.

389
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,592
She seems like
she might be a little clingy.

390
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:32,553
Well, good.
I need my boy single anyway.

391
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:35,607
Incoming.

392
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:39,811
- There you are.
- Here I am.

393
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:46,009
Yeah, I'm not drunk enough, so
I'm just going to go get another beer.

394
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,164
So...

395
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:50,289
So.

396
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,532
I have another speech.

397
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:54,057
Okay.

398
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,669
The hand thing with Elena,

399
00:24:58,377 --> 00:24:59,539
it was lame.

400
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:01,278
Well, I was lame.

401
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,710
And your feelings for Elena aside,

402
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:08,881
Damon was there,
and he was always such a jerk to me.

403
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:10,295
And...

404
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:14,305
I wanted to show off that
I was with the good guy.

405
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,556
So, anyway, I was lame.

406
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:20,059
So...

407
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:21,372
Forgiven?

408
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,035
Of course.

409
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:43,711
- What are they sayin'?
- Sounds Latin.

410
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,536
I don't think it's Latin.

411
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,769
What's happening?

412
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:08,837
It worked!

413
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,902
Of course it worked.

414
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,671
We have some fires to build.

415
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,310
I'm gonna go get the gasoline,
I'll be right back.

416
00:26:22,772 --> 00:26:24,322
- You ready?
- What?

417
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,919
You think I'm going to go in there
by myself so you can seal me in?

418
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,417
Don't take her in.
I'll bring the walls down.

419
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:33,048
You'll bring walls down if I don't.
You think I trust you?

420
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:35,718
- As much as I trust you.
- Enough! Both of you.

421
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:37,595
Look, he needs leverage.

422
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,807
He needs to know that you're not
gonna shut the door when he gets inside.

423
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,932
I get it.

424
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:43,542
I'll go.

425
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:46,045
May I?

426
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,181
Dark down there?

427
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:03,972
I thought I told you to leave.

428
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:05,503
I considered it.

429
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:07,784
Then I thought, screw you.

430
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:08,909
Hey, hero.

431
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:12,138
I'm going down there
to get my mother.

432
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,207
- Can't let you do that.
- Well,

433
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:18,163
Ben's about to make a main course
out of Elena's little brother,

434
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:20,088
so you can stop me or him.

435
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:22,765
Your choice.

436
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:36,726
What is that?

437
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:39,148
They can sense you.

438
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:41,867
Now. Where is she?!

439
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:51,210
- You're not going in there.
- You think you can stop me?

440
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,434
Why did you let her go in?

441
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,852
Because she isn't coming out, baby.

442
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:11,099
None of them are.

443
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,894
Do you really think
that she cares about you?

444
00:28:17,468 --> 00:28:18,868
You're disposable.

445
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:21,817
I don't care. She already
gave me what I want.

446
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:26,078
You're going to say "eternal life"?
You're really that stupid?

447
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:29,653
You know, I've heard about you.

448
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:32,168
You don't feed.

449
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:36,130
You're not strong enough to beat me.

450
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,844
Is that all you got?

451
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:44,427
I got this.

452
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:54,500
Where's Elena?

453
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:56,127
Damon took her inside.

454
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:57,446
What?!

455
00:29:58,054 --> 00:30:00,214
If you go in there,
you won't come out.

456
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,874
What did you do?

457
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:05,820
Opening the door
didn't remove the seal, it just...

458
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:07,179
opened the door.

459
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,647
What's the seal?

460
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,724
Some seals keep vampires
from entering.

461
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:14,221
This one keeps them from...

462
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:17,146
- coming out.
- Elena's human.

463
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,141
She can leave.

464
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,318
Anna and Katherine can't.

465
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,560
Damon can't.

466
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,032
You weren't even planning
on breaking the spell, were you?

467
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,250
I told you.

468
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:32,329
I'll protect my own.

469
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,792
Elena can get out.
That's all that matters.

470
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:39,882
You must have a taste for it.

471
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:43,785
You scream and shriek
and even bother to escape,

472
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,677
but then you just come
right back to it.

473
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:50,473
Mother!

474
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,644
- Your boyfriend did this, you know.
- His father did.

475
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,355
And Jonathan Gilbert.
Made a choice a long time ago

476
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,732
that it would be Gilbert blood
that brought her back to life.

477
00:31:01,857 --> 00:31:03,807
I had Jeremy all ready to go,

478
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,446
but...

479
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:16,610
You can't just leave him in there!

480
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:18,185
He made his choice!

481
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,546
Here.

482
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,715
Just tell me what to do. I'll do it!

483
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,633
We are not strong enough.

484
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:29,044
Even if we were able
to bring the seal down,

485
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:31,680
there's no guarantee that
we can get it back up again.

486
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:35,434
You said it yourself. Many things
can fuel a witch's power.

487
00:31:36,336 --> 00:31:37,336
Help me!

488
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,480
Or I'll do it alone.

489
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,590
Please don't!

490
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:55,922
Let her go!

491
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:02,722
Go, go. I'll be right behind you.

492
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,613
He's right behind me.

493
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,961
Stefan, what are you doing?

494
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:29,671
It's gonna be okay.

495
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,115
- We'll fix it.
- What is it?

496
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,530
I can't.

497
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,077
Can't? Can't what?

498
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,014
The spell's still up,
we can't get them out.

499
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:39,139
Yet.

500
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:41,959
You went in there not knowing
if you could come back out?

501
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:48,951
I heard you scream.

502
00:32:50,712 --> 00:32:53,429
We can't leave him in there.
We promised him, both of us.

503
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:55,023
I know.

504
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:57,406
Even if we're able
to break through the seal,

505
00:32:57,531 --> 00:32:59,931
we won't be able
to hold it for long.

506
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:07,315
She's not here!

507
00:33:08,347 --> 00:33:09,597
She's not here.

508
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:11,499
What?

509
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:13,866
She's not here!

510
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:31,579
I think it's working!

511
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,055
I just wanted my mother back.

512
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,350
Jeremy's fine. He's
outside. We won't touch him.

513
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:44,938
Keep going!

514
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:47,026
They better hurry.

515
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,526
They can't hold it much longer!

516
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:57,696
We need to get out of here.

517
00:33:57,821 --> 00:33:59,846
It doesn't make sense.
They locked her inside.

518
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,206
If we don't leave now,
we're not getting out.

519
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,821
How could she not be in here?

520
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:06,377
It's not worth spending
all of eternity down here!

521
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,995
She's not worth it!

522
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:14,013
Please.

523
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,524
I can't!

524
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,115
Yes, you can!

525
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:08,802
Is this for real?

526
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:11,065
Is what for real?

527
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:12,948
You being all...

528
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,578
cool and honest and open?

529
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,563
Speech number three?

530
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,571
I want this to work.

531
00:35:24,732 --> 00:35:26,977
And I'm scared that
you're gonna change your mind

532
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:29,052
and you're not gonna want it.

533
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:31,083
I don't want to mess it up.

534
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:34,939
I don't want to mess it up, either.

535
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:50,162
He's okay.

536
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:52,185
He's all right.

537
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,296
I'm sorry.

538
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:34,566
Let me help you.

539
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:37,562
I'm fine.
You don't need to coddle me, baby.

540
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:41,240
It was a big spell, Grams.
I could tell it took a lot out of you.

541
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:43,198
I'll be fine.

542
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:55,069
How's your head?

543
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:57,341
It's all right. I just...

544
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,843
I wish I knew how I passed out.
I didn't drink that much, I swear.

545
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:03,169
And you don't remember anything?

546
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,038
The whole thing's
pretty cloudy. I just...

547
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:08,600
I know how this looks. I'm sorry.

548
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,937
No, Jeremy, you don't be sorry.
You didn't do anything, okay?

549
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,407
I've gotta head over to Bonnie's
for a little bit, but,

550
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:19,319
is there anything that you need?

551
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,587
No, I'm just... I'm gonna crash.

552
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,283
Well, Jenna's here,
and I'll be back soon.

553
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,275
- You knew Katherine wasn't in there.
- You wouldn't have helped me.

554
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,864
- Why do you get happy ending?
- Please, you wouldn't have helped me!

555
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:06,481
- You know you wouldn't!
- Why do you get it and I don't?!

556
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:09,161
The guard, the one at the church,
the one who lock us in.

557
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:12,664
She promised to turn him.
He was obsessed with her.

558
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,851
She had him under her spell,
like everybody else!

559
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,839
He let her go.

560
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,929
The last I saw her

561
00:38:27,754 --> 00:38:28,854
was Chicago.

562
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:30,950
1983.

563
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,977
She knew where you were, Damon.

564
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,531
She didn't care.

565
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,694
Sorry.

566
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,545
I just got to Bonnie's.

567
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,263
Everything all right?

568
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:05,300
How's Damon?
Is he going to be okay?

569
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,100
I don't know.

570
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:10,097
Can I call you later?

571
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:11,639
Yeah, of course.

572
00:39:57,156 --> 00:39:58,406
Grams, wake up!

573
00:40:10,648 --> 00:40:11,648
Wake up!

574
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,785
She's not breathing!

575
00:40:14,184 --> 00:40:15,537
She's not breathing!

576
00:40:15,837 --> 00:40:17,289
Please, wake up!

577
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:22,972
Yes, I need
an ambulance, to Oak Street.

578
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:25,169
It's an emergency, quick!

579
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:29,342
- She'll be fine.
- No, no! I can fix this!

580
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,136
Grams, I can fix this!

581
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,528
