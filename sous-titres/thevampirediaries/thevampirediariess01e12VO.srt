<i>Previously
on "The Vampire Diaries"...</i>

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:05,004
<i>For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.</i>

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>I know the risk,
but I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,344
- She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
- Our love for Katherine wasn't real.

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,095
I'm gonna bring her back.

6
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,441
You know, my great-grandfather
actually showed me a journal.

7
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,887
He had written all of this
creepy stuff about vampires.

8
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,895
Your turn.
Any sad relationship stories?

9
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,689
Fell in love, married young...

10
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:25,934
wife died.

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,694
I've never been in your room before.

12
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,282
- Who am I you?
- You are not Katherine.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,285
- Why do I look like her?
- You were adopted.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,949
How you doin' in there?

15
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,470
Stefan,
who was that man in the road?

16
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:58,683
I don't know. Do you remember
anything else about him?

17
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:00,318
I wish.

18
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:02,367
I never really saw his face.

19
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:06,107
He was wearing a hoodie.
All I can remember is that

20
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,125
there was these black boots
coming towards me.

21
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:11,904
I brought some vervain

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,490
for you and Jenna. And...

23
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,293
I made this bracelet for Jeremy,

24
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:19,852
few extra on for friends.

25
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:22,083
You can put it in jewelry, or...

26
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:25,044
you can even put it
in food or drink, but...

27
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,080
as long as it's in you or on you,

28
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:29,155
a vampire cannot control you.

29
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,592
- So much to remember.
- I know,

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,804
but there's another vampire in town.
So until we find out

31
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,072
who it is and what he wants,
we have to be careful.

32
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,905
It's gonna be $22.

33
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,657
Elena, I need the money!

34
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:59,535
Here. Come in.
Just put it on the table.

35
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,022
Keep the change.

36
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:16,177
Thanks.
And you have yourself a good night.

Mystic Falls Team

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,607
Croutch, Dark_Chii, McFly,
MiniBen314, Paulp, Thirteen & WoLF971.

39
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:40,618
- What are you lookin' for, Damon?
- Not your concern.

40
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:44,121
But putting Elena in harm's way,
that is my concern.

41
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,166
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Atlanta.

42
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:50,211
Elena and I had a blast.

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,297
I get it.

44
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,833
You're just bitter because

45
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,461
one of us gets to be with
the person that we love, and...

46
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,970
poor Katherine is just out of reach.

47
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,512
Unless there's another way for
you to get into that tomb.

48
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:05,370
- Is that what Bree said?
- You're pathetic when you're fishing.

49
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:07,650
You're transparent
when you're deflecting.

50
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:10,503
Don't you have school?

51
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,053
Surprised? It's a good essay.

52
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,013
Your thoughts are clear, and
your argument is well laid out.

53
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,288
It's just...

54
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:29,375
you don't actually think
there are vampires in Mystic Falls?

55
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:32,403
No. I mean,
I think statistically there's been

56
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:34,672
more animal attacks,
mysterious deaths,

57
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:37,174
people gone missing, in more than

58
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,889
any other place in the whole
commonwealth of Virginia.

59
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:42,025
It's conjecture, but creative,

60
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,890
which is why you got the "A."

61
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,560
I just wouldn't get too caught up in
the whole conspiracy theory of it all.

62
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,219
I won't.

63
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,691
The source that you cited

64
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,107
for the 1860s info...
Jonathan Gilbert...

65
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,212
My ancestor's journal?

66
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:01,755
- I'd really like to see that sometime.
- Really?

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,621
A first-person account
of the civil war? That's like,

68
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,287
porn for a history teacher.

69
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,583
You think my essay's creative,
wait till you get a load of this thing.

70
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,004
Thank you.

71
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:25,446
It's so pretty.

72
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:26,775
Thank you.

73
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,157
It'll go with, like, everything.

74
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,561
What's the occasion?

75
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,605
No occasion.
Just a little friend gift.

76
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:34,615
Lesbian friend necklace?

77
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,400
'Cause we're freaky like that?

78
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,319
Your friendship is important to me.

79
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,987
- Why are you being so mushy?
- Because

80
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,991
you've been avoiding me,
and I wanted you to know that

81
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,493
whatever is going on
with you and Matt, it's okay.

82
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:50,945
I was gonna talk to you about that.

83
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:52,548
I was, but,

84
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:54,627
there's just not much to say.

85
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,795
We've hung out a couple times.

86
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,270
That's it, but...

87
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:03,010
I just feel like
we've peeked as friends.

88
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,723
This is weird.
I shouldn't be talking you about this.

89
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:11,151
- It's weird. It's weird, right?
- It's a little weird, but...

90
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:13,729
If it's what you and Matt want,
then it's not about me.

91
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,913
But it's all about you.

92
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,777
Matt's not over you and
we all know it.

93
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:23,906
I'm with Stefan now. Matt understands
that. He knows he has to move on.

94
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,207
What do you know?

95
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,293
- Ben McKittrick. What's up, man?
- Rough season, bud.

96
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:40,755
It's kind of hard to recover when
you have to forfeit half your games.

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,680
You gonna be workin' here?

98
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:46,608
Followin' in your footsteps,
minus the state championship.

99
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,847
Can't all be football gods.

100
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:52,393
So what's the plan? Cook line?

101
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:54,435
Busboy.

102
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,818
I can't believe you're adopted.

103
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,153
- I never saw that coming.
- And it gets weirder.

104
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,899
I looked at my birth certificate.

105
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:07,380
It lists Miranda and Grayson
Gilbert as my birthparents.

106
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:10,328
- None of it makes any sense.
- Which is why you should ask Jenna.

107
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:12,496
First of all, the Elena I know

108
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,873
would always want the real truth,
good or bad.

109
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,085
- And second of all?
- You just found out your boyfriend is a

110
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:19,516
vampire,

111
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,256
so unless your birthparents
are aliens...

112
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,841
How bad could it be?

113
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,177
Look, I have to go to the store.

114
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,695
My outfit for the dance
is severely lacking accessories.

115
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,457
I'll pay the bill.

116
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:39,182
What do you want from me?

117
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,350
- I think we need a fresh start.
- You tried to kill me.

118
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:44,880
But I didn't,
and if I wanted to, I would have.

119
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,572
Does that not count for anything?

120
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,908
You know, I can start fires with
my mind. Fires kill vampires, right?

121
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,330
Just stay the hell away from me.

122
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,790
Everything okay over here?

123
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:58,424
Yeah, we're fine.

124
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:01,045
I wasn't talkin' to you.

125
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,891
Thank you.

126
00:07:15,188 --> 00:07:16,488
Anytime, Bonnie.

127
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:20,397
- Wait. You remember me?
- I didn't graduate that long ago.

128
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,808
- You're makin' me feel old.
- Sorry. I didn't...

129
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,075
I didn't mean that. I just...

130
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,738
I didn't know you knew me.

131
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,873
I always know a pretty face.

132
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:45,022
- Hello.
- <i>Hello, Elena.</i>

133
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:46,754
Hey, who's this?

134
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,364
<i>You hit me with your car.</i>

135
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:51,846
<i>Is that a new one?</i>

136
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,892
<i>You got away from me.</i>

137
00:07:57,354 --> 00:07:58,854
<i>You won't next time.</i>

138
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,279
Why me?

139
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,125
What does he want with me,
and if he's trying to kill me,

140
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,645
then why call first?

141
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,479
That's because we're predators,
Elena. We hunt. We stalk.

142
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,854
It's often as exciting as the kill.

143
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:22,904
I want you to take this.

144
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,712
This is Jeremy's pocket watch.

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,914
- How did you get it?
- I took it from Damon,

146
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,482
who took it from Logan,
who must have taken it from you.

147
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:33,507
- What happened to it?
- Well, it's not just...

148
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:36,458
a watch. It's a...
it's a sort of compass,

149
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,100
but it points to vampires.

150
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,060
Why did my father have it?

151
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:53,611
Gilberts were one of the
founding families, and back in 1864,

152
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:56,819
they were among those
who sought to eradicate the vampires.

153
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,298
The compass was used to find us.

154
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,643
Did you know them?

155
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:05,772
Yes.

156
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,749
I want you to keep this. That way,
you'll know if you're ever in danger.

157
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,604
I've never seen you such a mess.

158
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:25,397
Don't talk smack.

159
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,443
I mean, I just thought that you told
everyone else what to do.

160
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:31,528
Well, I do that, too,

161
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,655
but if you want
something done right,

162
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:36,036
you gotta do it yourself.

163
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:43,165
You know, I just like
that we're hanging out.

164
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,542
Who knew... you and me?

165
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,503
Well, who knew you could be fun?

166
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,048
So what are you wearing
to this dumb dance, anyway?

167
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,363
Should we color-coordinate?

168
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,192
I'm not goin'.

169
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,512
Why not?

170
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,264
I gotta work,
bussin' tables at the Grill.

171
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:02,055
Since when are you a busboy?

172
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:04,616
It's a job.

173
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,564
You know, some of us have to work.

174
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:11,236
With our mom in and out,
things are tight, so...

175
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:14,863
I didn't mean it like that. I just
meant that I didn't know you had a job.

176
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:16,615
Well, I do.

177
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,066
I gotta go.

178
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,044
- How'd it go?
- What?

179
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,337
The paper.

180
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,215
I got an "A." Thanks
for the articles. They really helped.

181
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,842
Cool. So
what'd he say about the vampires?

182
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,323
- Did he believe it?
- I don't even believe it.

183
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:40,681
It's just a paper, Anna.
Anyways, I...

184
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,249
I gotta get goin'.

185
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:47,285
Do you wanna
do something later, maybe?

186
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:50,645
Sorry. I'm stuck on
punch duty at the school dance.

187
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,068
How'd you get stuck with that?

188
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,086
Well, I'm failin' English,
so I copped a plea.

189
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,949
So, maybe, you know,
tomorrow or something.

190
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:04,449
I'm being pushy again, aren't i?

191
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,709
Thanks for the help. I'll...
I'll see you around.

192
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,930
I spoke to the insurance company.

193
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,255
Car's totaled.

194
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:26,727
- You can keep using mine for now.
- So you're coming to the dance?

195
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:30,605
Alaric asked me to help chaperone.

196
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,739
Why didn't you tell me, Jenna?

197
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,876
Your mom was gonna do it eventually.

198
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,901
I never thought I'd have to.

199
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:48,676
If my mom were here right now
and I asked,

200
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,658
she'd tell me the truth.

201
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:57,585
Your dad was about
to leave the office one night

202
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,460
when this girl showed up.

203
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,649
She was 16,

204
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,231
a runaway and

205
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,765
about to give birth.

206
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,103
He delivered her baby,
and he gave her a place to stay but

207
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:12,189
a few days later, she disappeared.

208
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,558
And there you were.

209
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,530
Your parents were trying so hard to
have a baby. It just wasn't happening.

210
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,040
All Miranda ever wanted
was to be a mom.

211
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,955
Well, why were my parents' names
on the birth certificate?

212
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,084
Your dad was a doctor, Elena.
He took care of it.

213
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,587
They didn't wanna lose you,
so they kept it quiet,

214
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,580
told as few people
as possible, but if

215
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:40,092
anyone ever wanted proof,
they had documentation.

216
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:43,815
What else do you know about her?

217
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:45,575
The girl.

218
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:47,527
Just her name.

219
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:48,965
Isabelle.

220
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,490
You got the hair right.

221
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:08,161
Why are you bringing me
dad's journal?

222
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,379
'Cause you were looking for it.

223
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:13,979
- And why would I want it?
- Gee, I don't know, Damon.

224
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:16,461
Maybe you wanna do a little bit of
posthumous bonding.

225
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,581
Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it.

226
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:23,677
I have. Nowhere in it does it
say anything about Katherine

227
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,845
or the tomb or how to open it.

228
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,561
I'm not surprised.
Man could rely spell his own name.

229
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:29,808
I'm really sorry

230
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,327
that it won't be
of any help with your

231
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:34,980
diabolical plan, the sequel.

232
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:39,901
- You know, I could help you.
- You...

233
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,239
help me?

234
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,031
I don't know.
Seems a little unnatural.

235
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,117
I'll do anything
to get you out of this town,

236
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:50,996
even release Katherine.

237
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,123
What about the other 26 vampires?

238
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,693
They can't come.
They have to stay put, but Katherine,

239
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,418
I would consider that.

240
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,132
What are you doin'?

241
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:02,753
What's your angle?

242
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:04,426
Think about it.

243
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:11,433
- Why would I trust you?
- See that's your problem, Damon.

244
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,102
You apply all of your shortcomings
to everybody else.

245
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,656
If history's any indication,

246
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,031
there's only one liar among us.

247
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,605
Stefan's phone. How may I help you?

248
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,649
- Where is he?
- <i>He's on his way to you,</i>

249
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:44,109
forgot his phone.

250
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:47,415
Thank God.
This compass was spinning.

251
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:50,156
Stefan must be here. Thank you.

252
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,908
You're welcome.

253
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:06,847
Are you okay?

254
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:08,091
Are you okay?

255
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:15,936
How did he get in?

256
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:18,143
He was invited in.

257
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:21,279
He posed as a pizza
delivery guy last night.

258
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:24,349
Well, he gets points for that.
Did he say what he wanted?

259
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,732
No. He was too busy
trying to kill me.

260
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:28,904
And you have no idea who this is?

261
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:33,250
Don't look at me like that.

262
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,994
- I told you we had company.
- You think there's more than one?

263
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:38,069
We don't know.

264
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:43,084
He was invited in.

265
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:48,715
Then we go get him tonight.

266
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,010
- You up for it?
- What do I have to do?

267
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:55,513
Let your boyfriend take you
to the dance. We'll see who shows up.

268
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,047
That's a bad idea.

269
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:58,975
Till we get him,
this house isn't safe.

270
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,203
For anyone who lives in it.

271
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,065
It's worth a shot.

272
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,776
I'll do it.

273
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,517
I'll be with the two of you.
I'll be safe.

274
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:54,744
Look at you.

275
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,909
I figured I'd stand out less
if I dressed up.

276
00:17:58,772 --> 00:17:59,772
Liar.

277
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:02,387
Okay, I'm a sucker
for the decade dance.

278
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:06,084
I went to school here, you know.
They do the 60's and 70's, too, FYI.

279
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:07,731
Can't wait.

280
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:12,041
Can I get you a drink?
I hear the punch is real boss.

281
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:20,849
Having fun?

282
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:22,888
No, but...

283
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:26,730
this took about 2 hours,
so I'm at least staying half of that.

284
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,880
What's Damon doing here?

285
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,571
He wanted to come.

286
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,656
I promise. He'll behave.

287
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,984
So what is this, like, a threesome now,
you and the Salvatore brothers?

288
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:43,538
No, but if I'm gonna be with Stefan,
then I have to learn to tolerate Damon.

289
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:46,291
- It's not like I can kill him.
- There's a thought.

290
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:47,834
I'll help.

291
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:52,873
I'm really starting
to see a change in Jeremy.

292
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:53,998
Finally.

293
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,741
Losing someone
you love so suddenly, the...

294
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,916
the trauma and
the grief there it's...

295
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:01,514
some of the tougher things
I'll face in life.

296
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,875
From someone who knows.

297
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,110
You have no idea what happened?

298
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:10,356
That's the hard part, not knowing.

299
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:12,692
Is it okay to talk about your wife?

300
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:15,195
There's not much to talk about.

301
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:19,837
That must be impossible to deal with,
not having any answers.

302
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:23,209
I'd be lying to you if I told you
it didn't keep me up at night.

303
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:24,399
Wondering

304
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:26,456
why, by who,

305
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:29,250
maybe one day.

306
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:31,618
Hope so.

307
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:35,902
I hope so.

308
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,604
Wanna dance?

309
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:51,648
I'm out of here.

310
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,416
Please give me another chance.

311
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:57,695
Back off, Damon.

312
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,841
Where did they go?

313
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:06,037
- I don't know.
- What'd you say to 'em?

314
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:07,914
I was perfectly polite.

315
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,502
Would you like to dance?

316
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:14,129
I would love to.

317
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,840
May I have this dance?

318
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:57,422
Shouldn't you guys be able to
sense each other or something?

319
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,466
It doesn't work that way.
See him anywhere?

320
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:03,245
Not unless he has a pompadour.

321
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,766
Not one of the better
fashion trends.

322
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,054
Come on. I'm sure
you looked great back then.

323
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,629
Are there pictures?

324
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,666
Burned. Buried.

325
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,591
Seriously,
what was it like, the 50's?

326
00:21:15,716 --> 00:21:18,568
'Cause in my mind,
I have this picture of somewhere

327
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,086
between "American Bandstand,"
"Grease." It's all,

328
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:22,928
varsity sweaters and milkshakes.

329
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:25,187
Well, that and, you know,

330
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:28,917
McCarthyism and segregation
and nuclear arms race.

331
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,292
Okay, but there were poodle skirts.

332
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,824
There were poodle skirts.

333
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,869
You're so teaching me
how to do the hand jive.

334
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:39,694
That's not gonna happen.

335
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:57,273
You neglected to mention
this was a theme party.

336
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,955
What are you doin' here?

337
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,985
Seeing as you also neglected
to invite me,

338
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,862
I took matters into my own hands.

339
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:05,698
- You're doin' that thing again.
- What thing would that be?

340
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:09,336
That thing where you pretend
we're dating, even though we're not.

341
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:11,788
You mean stalking. Yeah.

342
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,082
Get over yourself.

343
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:17,371
Come on. I've never been
to a school dance before.

344
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:18,496
Humor me.

345
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,407
Let's sit up there.

346
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,123
Be a little more obvious, Bonnie.

347
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,583
Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.

348
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,508
What? It's just a drizzle.

349
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,688
Ben McKittrick? Really?

350
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,107
He's hot.

351
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,412
He's a washed-up jock
who pours drinks for a living.

352
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,479
You could do way better.

353
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:47,187
What's up?

354
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:09,929
Yeah, I don't recognize you.
How'd you get roped into chaperoning?

355
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:14,475
Alaric Saltzman.
I'm the new history teacher.

356
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:18,985
The... cursed faculty position.

357
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,510
So I've been told.

358
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,320
Salvatore, as in, Stefan?

359
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:27,363
He's my little brother

360
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm his legal guardian,
hence the chaperoning.

361
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:34,454
I hear he's very bright, not that
I've had a chance to see for myself.

362
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,789
Well, his attendance record's
a little spotty.

363
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,391
Family drama.

364
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:40,918
No parents?

365
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,504
It's just the two of us now.

366
00:23:45,343 --> 00:23:47,258
You live here your whole life?

367
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,476
On and off.

368
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:50,303
Travel a bit.

369
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,471
Really?

370
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:52,842
Where?

371
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,367
Around the States?

372
00:23:57,365 --> 00:24:00,605
I'm sorry. I'm nosy.
I... I don't mean to pry.

373
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,400
- Look, it was nice meeting you.
- You, too.

374
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,027
Enjoy the rest of the dance.

375
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:18,490
Tonight was so much better on paper.

376
00:24:19,181 --> 00:24:21,709
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.
Go and talk to him.

377
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,711
Be bold and fearless.

378
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:26,756
This coming from the girl who's
been eye stalking the bartender.

379
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:29,105
You're right.

380
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,020
Twice in one day.

381
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,314
- Lucky me.
- I'm proving something to my friend.

382
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:46,784
- What's that?
- That you don't have to sit around

383
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:48,930
and wait for a guy
to come up to you.

384
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,539
Does that mean that
you're asking me out on a date?

385
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:54,534
- Does that mean you want me to?
- Well, what did you have in mind?

386
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,410
Do you like karaoke?

387
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,625
But I...

388
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,759
would really like
to go on a date with you.

389
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:16,295
Seriously?

390
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,275
Is that for me?

391
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,393
Do you see anyone else
in the vicinity?

392
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:22,408
Do you need something?

393
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:24,272
Are you mad at me or something?

394
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,003
- I'm not mad. I...
- Then why are you being so weird?

395
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:29,317
- I'm not. I'm working.
- You're avoiding.

396
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:30,945
No. I have a table to clean.

397
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,283
That's the kind of thing that
washed-up jocks do to make a living.

398
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:46,794
You don't go to school here.
You know, you don't have to help.

399
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,421
I don't mind. It's fun.

400
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,716
Before I forget, can I
borrow your ancestor's journal?

401
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,968
- Why?
- You said I could read it.

402
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:56,679
I don't have it.

403
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,350
Obviously you didn't bring it here,
but I can walk you home.

404
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,268
No. I mean,
I gave it to my history teacher.

405
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:06,769
Wait. Why did you give it to him?

406
00:26:06,894 --> 00:26:09,370
- Because he wanted to read it.
- You know, you shouldn't be

407
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:12,264
- giving that to just anybody.
- But I should give it to you?

408
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,055
Loan. Loan it to me.

409
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,380
Well, I loaned it to Mr. Saltzman.

410
00:26:16,505 --> 00:26:19,029
Maybe he's in his classroom.
We can get it back.

411
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:21,904
What's the big deal
with the stupid journal?

412
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,615
Your eye.

413
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,670
There's something in it.
Forget it. I gotta go.

414
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,316
Maybe he's not gonna show.

415
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:45,561
You mean we did
all this dancing for nothing?

416
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:47,459
The horror.

417
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,775
- I'm really sorry for all this.
- It's my choice.

418
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,493
I decided to be here.

419
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:56,864
I officially signed up for it so I don't
wanna hear you apologizing anymore.

420
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:04,051
Show me how it's done in the 50's.

421
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:06,562
Come on. One move?

422
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,392
Now you remember that, because
it's never gonna happen again.

423
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:45,354
- What are you doin' here?
- Trying to get the journal,

424
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,143
as in sticking to the plan,
something you're not doing.

425
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,458
Leave the girl alone.

426
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:52,703
I like her.
She looks like Katherine.

427
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:55,548
She's not Katherine.
Katherine is in the tomb.

428
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,825
I know, but until we open that tomb,
I got her to play with.

429
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,371
Dot be stupid. That girl is
with the Salvatore brothers.

430
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,560
They don't scare me.
They never have.

431
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:06,559
Please, Noah. Don't do this.
You're gonna ruin everything.

432
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,396
You got nothin' to worry about. I'm not
gonna let anything happen to you.

433
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,523
You will get what you came for.

434
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:14,859
Just let me have my fun.

435
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:19,731
She looks like Katherine.

436
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:42,803
You really can't take him
anywhere, can you?

437
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:51,838
The back corner.

438
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:57,401
Get Damon.

439
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:17,421
What did I do?

440
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:18,797
Where is he?

441
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:21,801
I was getting a soda, and then
this guy gave me his hoodie.

442
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,088
<i>Here's what you're going to do.</i>

443
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:38,313
<i>There's an exit door behind you.</i>

444
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,277
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

445
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:42,897
<i>Or your brother dies.</i>

446
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:47,576
I can snap his neck so fast
I bet there's not even a witness.

447
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,329
- Start walking.
- Don't you dare touch him.

448
00:29:50,702 --> 00:29:51,852
Keep walking.

449
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,516
Through the door.

450
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,327
Dickhead.

451
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:14,288
Nobody wants to kill you.
We just wanna talk.

452
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,281
Now you feel like talkin'?

453
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,590
Screw you.

454
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,121
Wrong answer.

455
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,056
Why are you doing this?

456
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:34,105
Because it's fun.

457
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:39,438
What do you want with Elena?

458
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:42,024
She looks like Katherine.

459
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:47,276
You knew Katherine?

460
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,089
You thought you were the only ones.

461
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:56,624
- You don't even remember me.
- Tell me how to get in the tomb.

462
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:07,216
- The grimoire.
- Where is it?

463
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,674
Check the journal. The journal.

464
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,034
It's Jonathan's journal.

465
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:18,915
Jonathan Gilbert's.

466
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:25,586
Who else is working with you?

467
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:30,843
Who else is them?

468
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:35,305
You're gonna have to kill me.

469
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,749
What do we... how are you gonna
find the others now?

470
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:05,941
- He had to die.
- But...

471
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,836
He's been invited in.

472
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,913
Go. I got this.

473
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:34,438
What were you doing?

474
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,294
Looking for Ms. Hilden.

475
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,350
- Why are you in Mystic Falls?
- I got a job as a teacher.

476
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,859
- Do you know what I am?
- You're my student's brother.

477
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:44,146
Is everything
you're telling me the truth?

478
00:33:44,464 --> 00:33:46,857
Then forget
we had this conversation.

479
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,335
No way that idiot was workin' alone.

480
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,879
You are.

481
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:12,454
So the grimoire...

482
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:14,441
that was Emily's, right?

483
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:16,595
That's what you need
to reverse the spell.

484
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,223
When the founding families
burned her, they took her things

485
00:34:19,585 --> 00:34:22,617
and you were hoping that dad's
journal would tell you where it is.

486
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:26,105
Look at you,
puttin' the pieces together.

487
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,273
Good for you.

488
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:30,081
I was half-right.

489
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:32,834
Well, it's out there now.

490
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,655
Let the games begin.

491
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:37,631
My offer still stands.

492
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,994
- With some hidden caveats, no doubt.
- Nothing hidden about it.

493
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,790
No lies. No deception.
I'm there when you open up that tomb,

494
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:47,223
you and Katherine go,

495
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,294
and the other 26 vampires die.

496
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,546
If I agree.

497
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,923
- I'll help you.
- Why should I trust you?

498
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,418
- Because I'm your brother.
- That's not gonna cut it.

499
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:57,243
Because I want you gone.

500
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:14,163
Look, I said something stupid.

501
00:35:14,288 --> 00:35:17,334
I'm sorry, but
I wasn't even talking about you.

502
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:19,577
Yes, you were, Caroline.

503
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,019
Ben could easily be me.

504
00:35:22,144 --> 00:35:23,912
- We're just alike.
- That's not true.

505
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,230
Are you seriously mad about this?

506
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:28,584
Matt, you know me.

507
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,420
I say stupid things
without thinking,

508
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,089
and then I have to apologize
and take it back, and...

509
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:38,514
I'm a terrible, awful person,
but I'm working on it.

510
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,170
Can we just not do this right now?

511
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,391
When do you get off?

512
00:35:46,029 --> 00:35:49,123
Look, this thing we've got,
it's nice, and it feels really good,

513
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,207
and I know you wanna take
the next step.

514
00:35:51,332 --> 00:35:54,132
How do you know that?
Have you even asked me?

515
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:56,320
I'm not over Elena.

516
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,711
I mean, I don't know if I am, but

517
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:05,026
if we go there, then it could mess
things up, and we might lose this,

518
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:08,800
and this is the only good thing
I've got going for me right now.

519
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:11,887
So if it doesn't work,
I'll just disappoint you and hurt you,

520
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:13,812
and I don't wanna do that.

521
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:18,081
Well, big problem, Matt,

522
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:20,803
because you took the next step
all by yourself,

523
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,971
and you played
the whole thing out in your head

524
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,724
and you decided to bail
before even giving it a shot.

525
00:36:26,343 --> 00:36:28,477
So this really great thing
that we have,

526
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,689
don't worry about losing it,

527
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,147
'cause it's already gone.

528
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:41,490
Thank you.

529
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,858
I needed that.

530
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:46,199
Well, thank you for... for coming.
I really appreciate it.

531
00:36:46,324 --> 00:36:48,474
You made the evening much more...

532
00:36:50,118 --> 00:36:52,334
Well, you made it, period.

533
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,166
I'm glad I could help.

534
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:57,228
And thank you for
putting up with all that wife talk.

535
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:59,053
I gotta stop doin' that.

536
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,859
It doesn't bode well for dating.

537
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:04,513
Is that what this was, a date?

538
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:06,974
Definitely not a date.

539
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,183
But Friday...

540
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:11,409
you, me, and dinner and a movie,

541
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:13,832
that could be a date.

542
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,775
- How about it?
- Works for me.

543
00:37:19,435 --> 00:37:21,852
You can talk about your wife
all you want.

544
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:23,532
It's gonna take time to heal.

545
00:37:23,861 --> 00:37:25,367
We should just be ourselves.

546
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:29,037
Still, I think I'll keep
the Isabelle talk to a minimum.

547
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:32,207
- Isabelle?
- Yeah. That was her name.

548
00:37:33,026 --> 00:37:34,418
Where was Isabelle from?

549
00:37:34,828 --> 00:37:37,588
Virginia. I mean, not too...
not too far from here, actually.

550
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,372
Care, get in the truck.

551
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:54,007
What?

552
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:05,577
This'll never work.

553
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:18,431
Doing okay?

554
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,843
Is it weird if I say yes?

555
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,138
- Is it true?
- I should feel more upset

556
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,406
or scared or something, but I...

557
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,768
feel kind of exhilarated.

558
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,700
It's the adrenaline.

559
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:37,681
You'll crash soon enough.

560
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:39,126
Yeah, I guess.

561
00:38:40,157 --> 00:38:41,757
I fought back tonight.

562
00:38:42,568 --> 00:38:43,637
It felt good.

563
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:45,824
I wish you didn't have
to fight at all.

564
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:46,949
Still...

565
00:38:52,783 --> 00:38:54,421
I need to tell you something,

566
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:57,496
and I don't know
how you're gonna feel about it.

567
00:38:57,891 --> 00:38:58,891
What?

568
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,882
I told Damon that I'd help him
get into that tomb

569
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,550
to get Katherine back.

570
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,383
But it was a lie.

571
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:10,305
I let him believe that
he could trust me.

572
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:14,893
Well, then why would you be
worried about telling me?

573
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,161
Because he can be
very persuasive, and you two have

574
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,462
bonded lately.

575
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,652
That doesn't mean I trust him.

576
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:26,588
It's gonna take
a lot more than just a

577
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,218
road trip and a rescue
for me to forget

578
00:39:29,343 --> 00:39:31,535
who Damon is
and everything he's done.

579
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:35,939
I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena,

580
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:37,666
but I can't let him do it.

581
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:39,182
Then don't,

582
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:41,712
and I'll help you,
whatever it takes.

583
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:25,881
Don't sneak up on me.

584
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:28,501
You love it.

585
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:32,387
Where's Noah?

586
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,474
His obsession got the best of him,
and so did the Salvatore brothers.

587
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:38,226
- They killed him?
- Tortured and staked.

588
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:41,229
- You're not very upset.
- I warned him, Ben,

589
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,752
and he was just gonna
screw everything up anyway.

590
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:46,627
Let's be honest.
He wasn't exactly an asset.

591
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:50,521
- How'd you do?
- The witch is totally crushing on me.

592
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,942
Did you get the journal?

593
00:40:53,694 --> 00:40:56,244
But I know where it is,
and I'll get it.

594
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:18,976
Croutch, Dark_Chii, McFly,

595
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:21,551
MiniBen314, Paulp,
Thirteen & WoLF971.
