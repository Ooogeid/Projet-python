1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:02,030
<i>Previously on The Vampire Diaries...</i>

2
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:05,046
<i>For over a century,
I have lived in secret until now.</i>

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,175
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,925
- How come you don't sparkle?
- Because I live in the real world

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,217
- where vampires burn in sun.
- You go in the sun.

6
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:14,196
I have a ring. It protects me.

7
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:16,796
- The pocket watch. Where is it?
- It's supposed to be mine.

8
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:18,391
Did you get the Gilbert watch?

9
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:20,505
- I can get it.
- Good. We're gonna need it.

10
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,687
- What is that?
- A very important crystal.

11
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:25,130
You're the mystery guy
and I like that.

12
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:27,151
But with mystery comes secrets.

13
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,445
- I just need you to trust me.
- Trust is earned.

14
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:32,573
- My God, Caroline, what happened?
- Nothing

15
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,868
Did Damon hurt you?!
There are bruises all over Caroline.

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,336
I'm handling it.

17
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:39,604
Vervain could weaken him
if he ingested it.

18
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,874
It would help you to the upper hand.

19
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:46,003
I knew I couldn't spike your drink,
so I spiked hers.

20
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,800
- Five bodies all drained of blood?
- They've come back.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,441
Where is my ring?

22
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,944
Won't be needing it anymore.

23
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:16,826
How long have I been here?

24
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,044
Three days.

25
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:21,448
What are you doing?

26
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:24,728
During the dark ages when
a vampire's actions threatened to

27
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:27,503
expose or bring harm
upon the entire race,

28
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,171
They would face judgment.

29
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,608
They sought to reeducate them

30
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,634
rather than to punish them.

31
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:37,388
You know what
will happen if I don't...

32
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:40,546
- feed on blood.
- You'll grow weaker and weaker

33
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:43,185
and eventually you won't be able
to move or speak.

34
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,603
In a week your skin will desiccate
and you'll mummify.

35
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,157
A living corpse.

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,375
Unable to hurt anyone.

37
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:52,246
Ever.

38
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:55,032
So what, you're just going
to leave me in the basement,

39
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:55,975
Forever?

40
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,701
I've injected you with enough
vervain to keep you weak.

41
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,973
Once your circulation stops,
I'll move you to the family crypt,

42
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:04,648
and then in 50 years,
we can reevaluate.

43
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,544
- I'm stronger than you think.
- You always have been.

44
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:11,350
But you're not sntronger
than the vervain.

45
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:12,975
And we both know it.

46
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,509
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:23,127
Didn't have to be this way.

48
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,442
Mystic Falls Team
1x05 - You're Undead to Me

49
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:37,790
Croutch, Humanidyne,

50
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,000
Illyria, McFly,

51
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:40,432
MiniBen314, Thirteen,

WoLF971

53
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:14,860
I'm sorry, I'm almost done.

54
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:17,403
It's okay. Take your time.

55
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,667
I think you might be in trouble.

56
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:30,247
What did you do?

57
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,858
Elena saw me.

58
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,201
I'm a drug-using delinquent.

59
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,142
A girl in bed
doesn't really rank. Sorry.

60
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:46,008
Are you aware
of what's going on upstairs?

61
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,980
- And you have no objection?
- He could be craftier about it,

62
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,899
at least make an effort
to sneak her in and out.

63
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,842
And just so you know,

64
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:57,946
I won't be home for dinner.

65
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,949
So you're actually going to do it.
You're gonna go out with Logan.

66
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:04,906
I'm going to show up
and torture him, yes.

67
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:07,788
And have you heard from Stefan?

68
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:11,938
Not since he left that very vague
message three days ago.

69
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,919
"Hi... Elena,

70
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:16,797
I... have something I have to do.

71
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:19,616
I'll... explain in a few days."

72
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:22,437
Haven't you called him?

73
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,430
Not going to, either.

74
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:27,455
And you're okay with everything?

75
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,997
No, I'm not okay with any of it.

76
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:32,104
But I'm not gonna
cry about it, either.

77
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,045
I was going to write in my diary
this morning and then I thought,

78
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,542
what am I going to write?
Honestly, I'm not gonna be

79
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,322
one of those pathetic girls whose world
stops spinning because of some guy.

80
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,990
Okay, then.

81
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,797
I'll be fine.

82
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,912
He's awake.

83
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,031
He's weak, but it's probably best
to stay out of the basement.

84
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,698
He's Damon. I'm not sure
how dangerous he still might be.

85
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:56,337
- You're going to school?
- Came here to live a life.

86
00:04:56,505 --> 00:05:00,132
It's about time I get back to that.
And Elena if she's still speaking to me.

87
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,718
Why haven't you called her?

88
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,236
What am I suppose to do,
feed her another lie?

89
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:07,083
I hate lying to her, Zach. I'm not
good at it. She already thinks

90
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,783
- I'm hiding something.
- What choice do you have?

91
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:12,857
You came here because you wanted to live
as normal a life as you could.

92
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:15,242
You knew this was going
to be a part of it.

93
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:19,276
I remember the party.

94
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:23,444
Damon came up
behind me and... he was...

95
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:25,546
kissing my neck or...

96
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,242
biting my neck.

97
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,704
I passed out. It's like there's...

98
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,572
holes in my memory lately.
It's just weird.

99
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,185
- Maybe I let him bite me.
- Why would you do that?

100
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:43,569
Can we just not talk about it,
okay? I just...

101
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:46,513
Donn't want to talk about Damon.
I don't want to talk about

102
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,638
any of it.

103
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:50,367
Just want to go back to normal.

104
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:54,621
What are you doing with that candle?

105
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:57,873
Nothing.

106
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:00,449
What's this?

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,500
Damon gave it to me.

108
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,709
Or he was going to give it to me.

109
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
All I know is,

110
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,589
- it's mine now.
- It's ugly.

111
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,167
Well, get your hands off it.

112
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,442
The sexy suds car wash is tomorrow.

113
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,814
The football team
and the band have committed.

114
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,407
Well, not all the band. Just the ones
who could pull off the bikini.

115
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:34,622
I want, in your face, sexy.

116
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:37,447
I mean, it's a fund raiser,
for God's sake.

117
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:40,190
Unbelievable.

118
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,027
- It's like nothing happened.
- She's in denial.

119
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,667
You know, I gotta go.

120
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,519
Be somewhere right now.

121
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:57,166
I'm so sorry I haven't called.

122
00:06:58,886 --> 00:06:59,936
No worries.

123
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,211
- I'll live.
- I was...

124
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:03,714
dealing with Damon.

125
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,508
And did you...
deal with Damon?

126
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,970
For four days?

127
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:12,685
You have every right
to be upset with me. But...

128
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,110
can I explain it all to you? Please.

129
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,368
Sure.

130
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:17,687
When?

131
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,398
I gotta be home after school, but
the Grill, on four o'clock?

132
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,003
Thanks.

133
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,654
Stefan, where is Damon?

134
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,115
He has some
serious apologizing to do.

135
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,117
He's gone, Caroline.

136
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,870
When is he coming back?

137
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:36,830
He's not coming back.

138
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,376
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,179
This is a good thing.

140
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,559
I know that.

141
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,280
Have you seen Stefan?

142
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:12,084
If you want to kill some time...

143
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:13,636
you can rack.

144
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,704
Come on.
We haven't played in forever.

145
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:19,768
I'll let you brick.

146
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,148
I'm full of vervain.

147
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:49,657
I've been putting it
in my coffee for 16 years.

148
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,816
My blood will only make you worse.

149
00:08:57,124 --> 00:09:00,539
So it was your vervain.
Good for you.

150
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:02,597
Good for you.

151
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,591
Family only runs so deep.

152
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,551
We're not family, Damon.
Only in the most dysfunctional sense.

153
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:16,707
In fact, I avoided having a living,
breathing, loving family because of you.

154
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:20,836
I don't guess I could talk you into
bringing me a rabbit or something?

155
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:24,045
I'd settle for Stefan's diet
at this point.

156
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,920
You know I can't do that.

157
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,632
You succeeded, Zach.

158
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,154
I'm shutting down.

159
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,269
You're like your grandfather.

160
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:40,287
He didn't like it when
I came to visit, either.

161
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,955
But you don't visit, Damon.
You appear,

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,989
unannounced, reminding me
that this isn't my house,

163
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:48,864
that you're just
permitting me to live here.

164
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,897
Hell, that you're
permitting me to live.

165
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:53,759
Someone had to mow the lawn.

166
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:59,237
I came to say good-bye, Damon.

167
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:06,702
Unlock the door, Zach.

168
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:23,155
Keep it up.

169
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,500
The more energy you expend,
the faster you'll go.

170
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,023
And there's Vicki,
all nonchalant in the bathroom

171
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:31,171
like it's no big deal
they're hooking up.

172
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:35,572
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. Your brother
and my sister, that's weird.

173
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,304
How late is he?

174
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:44,533
Hitting the hour mark.
Nothing's wrong, thought.

175
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:48,844
Which means I'm not talking
boy problems with you.

176
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:49,898
Good.

177
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,616
I mean, it's not like we were ever
best friends or anything.

178
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,066
Here goes...

179
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,242
What do you think of Stefan?
Is he a good guy?

180
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,081
- Why? What's he done?
- Not any one thing.

181
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,106
He's just so secretive all the time.
I think there's something that

182
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:12,388
he doesn't want me to know, which
makes me want to know all the more.

183
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:14,886
Like what? Like that
he's a serial killer and he

184
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:18,135
- keeps a clown suit in his trunk?
- No, of course not.

185
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,887
But what do we know
about him, really?

186
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:22,931
He's great at football.

187
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,459
A little bit of a loner.

188
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:27,996
And as much as I hate saying it,

189
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,147
He might be a nice guy.

190
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:35,944
So you think
I'm just being paranoid?

191
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,779
I think you should talk to him.

192
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,171
Talk to who?

193
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,576
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

194
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,787
- What happened?
- I got held up.

195
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:47,998
Is everything okay?

196
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,543
- There was this thing with my uncle.
- And you couldn't call and tell me

197
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,543
that you were going to be
an hour late?

198
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:54,755
You two have fun.

199
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:58,281
I'm really sorry.

200
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,093
It was unavoidable.

201
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,811
What was unavoidable?

202
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,695
- Please...
- No, Stefan, don't you get it?

203
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,521
Every question
gets a vague non-answer.

204
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,304
What is so awful
that you're afraid to tell me?

205
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:15,479
I know you.

206
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:20,572
My God.

207
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:22,866
- I'm sorry?
- I know you.

208
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:25,342
How can it be?

209
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,788
I think you have
the wrong person, sir.

210
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,606
You haven't aged a day.

211
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:35,033
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

212
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,538
Can we... can I take you home

213
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:39,898
and we can talk about it?

214
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:41,412
Is that okay?

215
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,926
Wait, what was that?

216
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,412
I don't know. Nothing.

217
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,675
Right, nothing. Okay...

218
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:52,936
I gotta go, Stefan.

219
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:54,165
Excuse me.

220
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:07,615
<i>I tried.</i>

221
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:10,163
<i>I want so much to make things right,</i>

222
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,781
<i>but every instinct in my body
is telling me to be careful.</i>

223
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,045
<i>What you don't know can hurt you.</i>

224
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,563
Evening, sheriff.

225
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,098
Anything?

226
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:25,449
We went over the entire
west side of the lake.

227
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:28,412
All the caverns by the falls
were clean, no signs of habitat.

228
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:29,960
They're staying in town.

229
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:32,334
We canvassed all abandoned
buildings and warehouses.

230
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,481
- There has to be a private residence.
- And that much harder to locate,

231
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,733
if not impossible. These creatures are
smart. They know how to go undetected.

232
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,754
Someone who only comes out at night
should eventually become obvious.

233
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,932
- What about the watch?
- I'm working on it.

234
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,553
I knew the Gilberts.

235
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:49,536
That watch is passed down to the men
in the family. I'd start with Jeremy.

236
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,143
I can't believe you really came.

237
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,461
You have an hour.

238
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,171
Make it count.

239
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,837
You okay?

240
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:03,249
Is Vicki in there?

241
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,677
Don't answer a question
with another question.

242
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:06,835
Maybe.

243
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,764
What's wrong with you?

244
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:12,684
I'm miserable.

245
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:15,437
You should go gesomething to eat.

246
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:36,041
- What are you doing here?
- Dinner.

247
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,305
Jeremy told me that chicken
parmesan is one of your favorites,

248
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,455
and I happen to be a good cook.
The italian roots demand it.

249
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,551
I can even make my own homemade
mozzarella. Only tonight, it is...

250
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,846
unfortunately store-bought. Sorry.

251
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:53,183
I don't know what you're
trying to accomplish.

252
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,560
You want to know me, right?

253
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,058
Well, I figure if
you're gonna dump me,

254
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:00,683
you should at least,

255
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:02,961
know who you're dumping.

256
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,570
So let's start with Katherine.

257
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:10,794
She was... the most beautiful
girl that I had ever met.

258
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:14,703
She had this perfect olive skin.

259
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,181
And...

260
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,445
she had this laugh. It was ridiculous.
I mean, her laugh made you laugh.

261
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:24,941
And she was fun.
She knew how to have a good time.

262
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:25,866
But...

263
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,261
Katherine was also
very impatient and entitled

264
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,842
and selfish, and... impulsive.

265
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:33,974
Enter Damon.

266
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,477
He claims that he was
with her first. I don't know.

267
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,195
I do know that I did
some things that...

268
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,956
I'm not proud of.

269
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,126
And my biggest regret...

270
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:50,657
is not being able
to make it right before she died.

271
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:55,346
I miss her, but...

272
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:59,347
I'm no longer crippled by her loss.

273
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:05,860
It was very nice what you did
for Stefan. Very romantic.

274
00:16:05,985 --> 00:16:07,635
I was feeling romantic.

275
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:09,915
Look what I found.

276
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,446
"Take one tablet every 4 to 6 hours,
as needed for pain."

277
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:17,767
Those are left over
from the car accident.

278
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,585
So she won't miss them.

279
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,975
Not with that, that's an antique.

280
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,689
I feel like we're
always getting high.

281
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:36,745
- That's the beauty of choice.
- Well, then let's choose not to.

282
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,914
I mean, we don't have to be
high all the time, right?

283
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,176
I really hope you're not one of those
guys who, now that we're together,

284
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,045
tries to change everything about me.

285
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:50,583
Good.

286
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,708
I'm an avid reader,
a huge Fitzgerald fan,

287
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,813
<i>The Great Gatsby</i>, his masterpiece.

288
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,342
But I'm no snob.
I love some good Grisham.

289
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:08,276
I think <i>Seinfeld</i> is the best american
television show for the past 50 years,

290
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:10,945
but <i>I Love Lucy</i> is all-time.

291
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,293
"The loving cup" episode
was the best, I think.

292
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:15,209
Huge Scorsese fan.

293
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,995
I can watch <i>Taxi Driver</i>
over and over again.

294
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:20,866
Here, let me.

295
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,290
As far as music,
it's pretty much across the board.

296
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:27,042
Dylan, Hendrix, Patsy, Willie

297
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,173
or Kanye. You know what,
I even like that one Miley song.

298
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,182
- Easy.
- I didn't say anything.

299
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,552
This is for the garlic bread, right?

300
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:38,307
Because I'm not eating garlic
unless you agree to, too.

301
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,517
Are you kidding? I love garlic.

302
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:46,273
You okay?

303
00:17:47,138 --> 00:17:48,934
Yeah. I think so.

304
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:04,274
Your face...

305
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,418
I think I got something in my eye.

306
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:27,355
I think that my paranoia has turned
into full-blown hallucinations.

307
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:30,546
Part of your charm.

308
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,372
No, Tiki, do not
do the one-piece, okay?

309
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:03,771
I've seen it on you. Trust me.

310
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:07,187
Yeah, but you're going for
stripper pole vibe this year.

311
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:14,675
Yeah, maybe we should wash
the cars in slow motion.

312
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:22,999
What?

313
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:24,538
Sorry.

314
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:27,801
So I'll just see you tomorrow.
Two-piece.

315
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,160
I bet you're feeling pretty good
about yourself, aren't you?

316
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,094
Not particularly.

317
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:06,119
You won.

318
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,563
You got the bad guy.

319
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:12,877
Now nothing could come
between you and Elena.

320
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:16,464
Except the truth.

321
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,759
The lies will catch up
to you, Stefan.

322
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,320
As long as you keep lying
to yourself about what you are.

323
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:26,245
The beauty of you in there
and me out here...

324
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:28,685
is that I can walk away.

325
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:43,452
No friend discounts.

326
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:47,036
No freebies. No pay you laters.
We are not running a charity here.

327
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,454
No, we are not.

328
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,878
The event is called
sexy suds, you know.

329
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:00,800
- Did we just get scolded?
- And judged, yeah.

330
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:04,603
I'm sorry, but I guess you're going
to have to take that off.

331
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:06,180
I think you have to go first.

332
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:15,946
Sorry, so not sexy.

333
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,595
I disagree.

334
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,371
None of that tortured pining stuff.

335
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:32,552
I'm just observing.

336
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,753
Tiki. This one's yours.

337
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:39,701
Why do I always get the homely ones?

338
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:44,260
Just to be clear, your car's a POS.

339
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,471
We can wash it but it's still a POS.

340
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,972
You don't have to be rude.

341
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,840
Rude is uglying up
the road with that junk.

342
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,601
Wet and wild, Tik.

343
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,799
All proceeds are going to
the school's athletic department

344
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,512
still healing from the tragic death
of their football coach William Tanner.

345
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,971
The citizens of Mystic Falls
coming together in support

346
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,596
of one of their own.

347
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,670
Cut it.

348
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,942
- Classy.
- Thank you.

349
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:41,442
But you're still going to
video the girls in bikinis, right?

350
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,320
53% of americans watch
the news with the sound off.

351
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:49,228
Thank you for dinner.
I had a nice time.

352
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:52,724
Do you remember the last time
we were in the school parking lot?

353
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:56,612
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- Really?

354
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:01,039
Especially not having sex
in the minivan.

355
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,049
That was a good day.

356
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:07,769
What?

357
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,633
You're getting soap in that.

358
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:12,742
It's fine.

359
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:16,185
I noticed at Damon has one, too.
Is there a story behind it?

360
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:20,354
Yeah, it's the family crest
from the Italian Renaissance.

361
00:23:23,758 --> 00:23:25,108
What's the stone?

362
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,399
It's called lapis lazuli.

363
00:23:29,136 --> 00:23:32,486
You should really take it off.
I could put it in my bag.

364
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:35,105
No, it's... it's fine, really.

365
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,111
Thanks, though.

366
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,304
I'm gonna get some towels.

367
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:56,632
We're out of towels
and those shimmy things.

368
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:58,978
I'll go get some more.
Mind the money.

369
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:34,787
Caroline, help me.

370
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,982
That'll be $20.

371
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:50,571
I saw you last night.
You were talking to a friend of mine,

372
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:52,376
at the Grill?

373
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:55,785
Well...
I thought it was somebody I knew.

374
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:01,457
It can't be. It's just my mind
Playing tricks on me.

375
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:04,210
Where do you think
you'd seen him before?

376
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:08,297
When I first moved here, I stayed at
the Salvatore boarding house.

377
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:12,094
Stefan was just
passing through to visit his uncle.

378
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:15,680
I mean, none of us knew he was
even here until the attack.

379
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,248
- The attack?
- His uncle got killed.

380
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:21,422
Mauled by an animal in the woods.

381
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:26,232
His uncle, Zach?

382
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:32,338
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think
I'm familiar with the story.

383
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:35,408
How could you? I mean,
this happened years ago.

384
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:38,703
Grandpa, you gotta go.
Mom wants you home.

385
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,244
He wasn't bugging you, was he?
He's a little Alzy-heimer.

386
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:47,075
He was sweet.

387
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,799
I'm sorry.

388
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:54,689
Are you sure
that the man that you saw

389
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:58,097
that you knew, his name
was Stefan Salvatore?

390
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:04,145
I remember his ring
and his brother...

391
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,977
When was this?

392
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:14,642
It was early june,

393
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:16,897
1953.

394
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,216
June, 1953.

395
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,908
Caroline finally freed you, huh?

396
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:46,604
I don't know where she went.
She abandoned me.

397
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,234
I realized earlier, I had no idea
that your family was from Iitaly.

398
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,969
Last name Salvatore
didn't do it for you?

399
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:01,077
Are there any other
Salvatores in Mystic Falls?

400
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:02,745
My uncle Zach.

401
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,013
Where did everyone else go?

402
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,109
Kinda just spread out.

403
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:10,657
Why?

404
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,758
I'm just trying to
learn more about you.

405
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,265
Where are you taking me?

406
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,140
We can't hide out
in your room all the time.

407
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:25,038
Welcome to my other
favorite party place.

408
00:27:25,356 --> 00:27:26,806
What, the cecemery?

409
00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:28,855
Yeah. It's cool, huh?

410
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,458
What's up, Jared?

411
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:36,570
- You baby-sitting, Donovan?
- This is Jeremy. He's cool.

412
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,688
Smoke up.

413
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:51,849
Your car was done an hour ago.

414
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,932
You're saying that out loud why?

415
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:58,009
Elena, right? I think
I met you once when you were 9.

416
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,761
Your emotional maturity level
when we were together.

417
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:03,473
Here I thought
we were making progress.

418
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:07,121
Is he enough in your good graces
that I can ask him for a favor?

419
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:10,032
If I do her a favor,
will I get back in your good graces?

420
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,732
A very reluctant maybe to both.

421
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,453
Done. Wait. One condition.

422
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:18,029
Dinner, tonight, your house.

423
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:18,997
Fine.

424
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:21,286
But you're eating leftovers.

425
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,802
What do you need?

426
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:26,287
Do you have access to old
news stories, say...

427
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:28,122
- fifties?
- At the station.

428
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,351
Between the archives and the Internet,
we pretty much have everything.

429
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,086
I have this report way past due.
It'd be a life saver.

430
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,654
Heading there now.

431
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:36,927
Let's go.

432
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,259
If anyone asks,
you don't know where I went.

433
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,720
I don't want Caroline
to know that I left.

434
00:28:58,466 --> 00:28:59,366
<i>Help me.</i>

435
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,589
What is this?

436
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:03,823
How did I know that you were here?

437
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,970
Because I wanted you to.

438
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:08,514
Very, very badly.

439
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:15,655
Let me out of here. Please.

440
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,740
You bit me.

441
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,134
You liked it.

442
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:21,777
Remember?

443
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:27,285
Why do I keep remembering
the same things, but,

444
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:29,535
in different ways?

445
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:32,688
You remember what
I want you to remember.

446
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,999
And now that the vervain has
passed out of your system,

447
00:30:37,124 --> 00:30:39,670
you won't remember
what you're about to do.

448
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,290
What am I about to do?

449
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:46,942
You're gonna open the door.

450
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,849
You're gonna open the door.

451
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:02,735
Get out of here.

452
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:03,777
Run!

453
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:05,946
Run!

454
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:50,072
Sweeper duty.

455
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,637
What?

456
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:54,036
- We have to clean the pavement.
- It's a car wash.

457
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,914
- By definition, the pavement's clean.
- But not dry.

458
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,208
- And I'm doing this why?
- Caroline bailed,

459
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,276
so that leaves me in charge.

460
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,800
Fabulous.

461
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,342
What just happened?

462
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,667
You were in some kind of a trance.

463
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,338
Did I do this?

464
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,141
I think so, yes.

465
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,185
Nobody else saw, did they?

466
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,099
Don't tell anybody.

467
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:05,899
Please.

468
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,072
We digitized
all our archives last year.

469
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,428
You can pull all the remote
footage right up on screen.

470
00:33:15,553 --> 00:33:17,757
What is it exactly
you're looking for?

471
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:19,997
An incident from 1953,

472
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,833
if it even happened,
at the old Salvatore boarding house.

473
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,401
Sorry, one second.

474
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,296
A fire? All right, be right there.

475
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:31,425
I gotta go. You believe there's
actual news to cover in this town?

476
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:35,304
All right, use keywords to search the
database. It's pretty easy to navigate.

477
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,170
And Brady down in tech will help
you out with anything you need.

478
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:39,295
All right?

479
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,063
Could you put in a good
word for me with Jenna?

480
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,650
You got it.

481
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,858
Good luck.

482
00:33:53,255 --> 00:33:54,055
What?

483
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:56,226
I'm stoned in a cemetery.

484
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,079
They don't mind, they're dead.

485
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,248
You know what?
I'm gonna take this up a notch.

486
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:08,931
Nice.

487
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,097
Vickies from Vicki.

488
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,343
Well, thank you, Elena Gilbert,

489
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,780
whoever you are.

490
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:17,425
You took those from the house?

491
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,181
She wasn't using it.

492
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,840
She's gonna notice if they're gone.
That's not cool.

493
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,790
- It's no big deal, Jer.
- Yeah, it kinda is, Vick.

494
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:27,965
Damn, dude.

495
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,091
- Vicki brought the party police.
- Shut up, Tony.

496
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,390
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to make you mad.

497
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:40,216
What are we doing, partying
in a cemetery with a bunch of losers?

498
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:41,745
Those are my friends.

499
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,084
They're waste of space
small-town lifers.

500
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:46,125
Yeah? What am I?

501
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,446
- You're different, Vick.
- No, you are.

502
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:52,211
You're the kid with the big house who's
acting out because his parents died.

503
00:34:52,336 --> 00:34:54,065
Guess what... You'll get over it.

504
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,019
You will pull yourself together,
move on and one day tell your kids

505
00:34:57,144 --> 00:34:59,308
stories about
your dark period growing up.

506
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:03,432
And I'll still be here, waiting tables
at the Grill, partying at the cemetery

507
00:35:03,557 --> 00:35:06,019
With a bunch of waste of
space small-town lifers.

508
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:08,147
Go home, Jeremy.

509
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:12,315
If I want to feel like crap about
myself, I'll just go back to Tyler.

510
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,501
Have you seen Elena?

511
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,141
No, not for a while.

512
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,583
- You think she went home?
- Not sure.

513
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:28,976
Thanks.

514
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,687
I'm not saying this for you.
I'm saying it for her.

515
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:34,612
But...

516
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:38,427
she's big on trust. So whatever
you're holding back from her,

517
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:42,556
the more you try to hide it, the more
she won't stop till she figures it out.

518
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:03,368
This is Michael Fell reporting to you
from the Salvatore boarding house,

519
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,789
where a brutal animal attack
has ended in tragedy.

520
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:11,341
They're bringing out the bodies.
See if you can get closer.

521
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,749
Is that the nephew?

522
00:36:47,697 --> 00:36:49,524
I didn't see you at the car wash.

523
00:36:51,618 --> 00:36:52,668
Left early.

524
00:36:54,187 --> 00:36:55,712
Honey, are you okay?

525
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:58,604
Anything you want to talk about?

526
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:02,007
Is it a boy thing?

527
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:06,810
If I want to talk boys,
I'll call dad.

528
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,767
At least he's successfully
dating one.

529
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,490
<i>Dear diary,</i>

530
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,569
<i>I'm not a believer.</i>

531
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:37,546
<i>People are born, they grow old
and then they die.</i>

532
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:40,092
<i>That's the world we live in.</i>

533
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,064
<i>There's no magic,
no mysticism, no immortality.</i>

534
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:54,479
<i>There's nothing
that defies rational thought.</i>

535
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,653
I don't know what's happening to me.

536
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:03,998
I know, dear.

537
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,179
<i>People are supposed
to be who they say they are</i>

538
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:24,754
<i>and not lie or hide
their true selves.</i>

539
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:28,999
What are you doing here?

540
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:31,058
Hey, man.
Just looking for the bathroom.

541
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,390
<i>It's not possible.</i>

542
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:45,565
<i>I'm not a believer, I can't be.</i>

543
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:49,575
<i>But how can I deny
what's right in front of me?</i>

544
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,245
<i>Someone who never grows old...</i>

545
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,123
1953.

546
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:56,928
<i>Never gets hurt...</i>

547
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,587
Oh, my God, your hand!
Is it deep? How bad is it?

548
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,383
<i>Someone who changes in ways
that can't be explained...</i>

549
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:07,886
Are you okay?
Your eye.

550
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:15,227
Your face.

551
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:16,868
<i>Girls bitten...</i>

552
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,477
- My God, what happened to you?
- It's nothing!

553
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:21,232
<i>Bodies drained of blood...</i>

554
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,777
Did she say what
kind of animal it was?

555
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,946
She said it was a vampire.

556
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:42,148
No, I'm good.

557
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:52,417
Not it.

558
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,042
- Not it.
- Not it.

559
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:12,784
Hey, man, you okay?

560
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:17,299
Come here.

561
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:19,632
Come here.

562
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:24,504
- You don't look good.
- Come closer.

563
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:26,646
I have something...

564
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:29,162
that I have to tell you.

565
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:36,558
I got you, I got you.

566
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:37,727
It's okay.

567
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,292
What are you?

568
00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:23,298
