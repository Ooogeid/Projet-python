<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries...

2
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.</i>

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>I know the risk,
but I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,134
- She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
- Why do I look like her?

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,560
You were adopted.

6
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:14,555
This girl showed up.
She was 16 and about to give birth.

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,353
- What else do you know about her?
- Just her name, Isobel.

8
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:20,990
My wife Isobel spent her life searching
paranormal activity in this area.

9
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,964
- Where's your wife?
- Damon killed her.

10
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,726
There's a tomb underneath the church.
The spell sealed Katherine in that tomb,

11
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,764
protecting her.
I'm gonna bring her back.

12
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:31,864
She's not here!
You knew Katherine wasn't in there.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,408
She knew where you were,
and she didn't care.

14
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:53,969
You scared me.

15
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,931
Do you know what day it is?

16
00:00:58,202 --> 00:00:59,402
It's Saturday.

17
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,769
And what year?

18
00:01:04,186 --> 00:01:05,272
It's 2010.

19
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:09,235
- Are you okay?
- Thank you.

20
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,987
Wait, what's your name?

21
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:13,548
It's Harper, sir.

22
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,423
How did you get out here?

23
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:18,953
Why are you dressed like that?

24
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:24,834
You seem like a very nice person.

25
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,421
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

00:01:34,348 --> 00:01:37,013
Croutch, Dark_Chii,
McFly, MiniBen314, Thirteen.

28
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:01,456
It's me just checking in,
seeing how you're doing.

29
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:06,153
We miss you here. Don't let
your aunt drive you too crazy.

30
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,544
Come home soon. Love you.

31
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,297
What are you doin' out here?

32
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,048
- It's cold.
- Thinking,

33
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,233
writing.

34
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,802
The funeral for Bonnie's grandma,

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,520
it brought back a lot
about mom and dad.

36
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:22,141
I was wondering.
You said that you would do

37
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,602
some digging about them,
the adoption.

38
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,036
- Right.
- So did you?

39
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,774
Dig?

40
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,310
Come on inside.

41
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,406
Your dad kept everything
from his medical practice...

42
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,924
records, logs,
old appointment books.

43
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,328
I found an entry from
the night you were born.

44
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,246
Patient and a birth date.

45
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,789
- Isobel Peterson.
- Do you think that's her real name?

46
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:49,794
Pregnant teenage runaway?
Probably not. First name, maybe.

47
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,047
But where'd she get Peterson?
Classmate? Best friend?

48
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,215
So...

49
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,594
I Binged it. I searched
for all the Petersons in this area

50
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,555
born the same year as Isobel,
found three. Two men...

51
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,352
and a woman, Trudie,
who lived in Grove Hill, Virginia.

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,420
- That's not far from here.
- Well, watch this.

53
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:21,818
She was a cheerleader.

54
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,620
Trudie still lives there.

55
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:27,976
This is her address.

56
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,458
What about Isobel?

57
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,791
I couldn't find anything about her.

58
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,765
Listen. There's something else.
Mr. Saltzman, Rick,

59
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,933
his wife was from around here,

60
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,228
and her name was also Isobel.

61
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,864
Wait.

62
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,181
"Was," as in...

63
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:58,285
She died.

64
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,710
Alaric's wife might have been
your mother?

65
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:09,911
It can't be true, right? I mean,
the coincidence alone is just crazy.

66
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:15,796
I have the address
for her friend Trudie.

67
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:17,794
You wanna talk to her.

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,508
I don't know.

69
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:23,735
I don't know.

70
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:27,224
If it's true
and they are the same person,

71
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,442
that means that my birth mother

72
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:30,701
is dead,

73
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,105
and I don't know
if I could handle that.

74
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,195
Did Jenna tell you anything
about Alaric's wife?

75
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,655
How she died?

76
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,992
Just that she was killed and
the case was never solved.

77
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:48,537
You knew that already?

78
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,919
The night at the school
when he attacked me,

79
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,963
he told me some things
about her death.

80
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,050
It's not possible.

81
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,302
The coincidence is... It's too much.

82
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:06,388
Listen, if you do decide to go

83
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,506
talk to Isobel's friend,
I'll go with you. Yeah?

84
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:11,977
I just don't know
what I'm gonna do yet.

85
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,111
I should get going. I gotta go

86
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,579
deal with Damon.

87
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,174
- How's he doing?
- He's dealing, in his...

88
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:28,743
own way.

89
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,216
How do I taste?

90
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:45,761
So much better than your friends.

91
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:49,431
Don't tell them.
They might get jealous.

92
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,061
Buzzkill Bob.

93
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,606
Greetings.

94
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:00,628
Can we talk?

95
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,486
Without the...

96
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:03,817
tri-delts.

97
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,490
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of them.

98
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:09,952
They're really good
at keeping secrets.

99
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,332
You're worried about me.
That's nice. Don't be.

100
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,501
There's no need. I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be?

101
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,046
I spent the last 145 years
with one goal,

102
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,716
get in that tomb. I succeeded.

103
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:27,177
Granted, Katherine wasn't in there
to be rescued, but why dwell?

104
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:30,464
It's so liberating
not having a master plan,

105
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,189
because I can do
whatever the hell I want.

106
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,701
- That's kind of what I'm afraid of.
- Relax.

107
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:39,356
I haven't killed
anyone in... too long.

108
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,309
- Those girls?
- Will end up in their dorm

109
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,705
with headaches,
think they blacked out.

110
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:50,623
Business as usual.

111
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,663
Predictable you didn't pull
me over here for a pep talk.

112
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,881
So drink up. Spill it, brother.

113
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,619
There was a woman you may
have known a few years back

114
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:05,049
named Isobel
in North Carolina at Duke.

115
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,802
You wanna discuss the women
in my past right now? Seriously?

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,420
- You killed her.
- What's your point?

117
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:15,226
I just wanna know if you
remember anything about her.

118
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,645
- It's like a needle in a haystack.
- Well, think hard. It's important.

119
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:23,567
Nothing is important, not anymore.

120
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,904
Great chat.

121
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:30,274
I have to go and exploit some
women in the name of grief,

122
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,442
which I'm sure you understand.

123
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,622
"TTFN" said the tri-delt.

124
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,714
What?

125
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:48,175
This is boring. I'm bored.

126
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:51,528
But...

127
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,932
we have this entire house
to ourselves.

128
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,434
I mean, it's practically
a bachelor pad.

129
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,269
And...

130
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:00,874
So...

131
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:04,192
shouldn't we do something
a little bit more

132
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:05,941
bachelor-paddy?

133
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,925
What? Something like this?

134
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,819
Something like that.

135
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,205
I don't know.
This is a pretty good show.

136
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,498
Seriously?

137
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,695
Not on my couch.

138
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,862
I don't know.
It's just weird,

139
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,257
me being raffled off
like a Disney cruise.

140
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:55,033
In this town, fundraising
is like indentured servitude.

141
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:56,827
You don't have a choice.

142
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,163
And besides, you're a bachelor,

143
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,167
and you're eligible,
so there you go.

144
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,250
Here. Let me help you with this.

145
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,915
- I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
- What?

146
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,061
I am totally gonna ruin this moment,

147
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,355
but I have to tell you.

148
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,989
Elena recently found out
she was adopted,

149
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,964
and she's been looking
for her birth mother...

150
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:34,323
- whose name was Isobel.
- Isobel? Like my wife?

151
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,202
- Isobel never had a baby.
- Are you sure?

152
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,215
Not before you were together?

153
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
No way.

154
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:51,082
This is Elena's birth mother.

155
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:02,809
She never told me.

156
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,039
I'm gonna go.

157
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,349
My name is Elena Gilbert.

158
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,228
I wanted to talk to you
about Isobel Flemming.

159
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:49,606
Well, I haven't heard
that name in years.

160
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,546
How do you know her?

161
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:53,763
I think that...

162
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:59,992
Do you know if she had a baby
that she gave up for adoption?

163
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,374
You're her daughter.

164
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:14,172
I was just gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

165
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:16,861
Sure.

166
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,868
The kitchen's this way.

167
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,273
I wasn't gonna come.
I didn't think I was,

168
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,276
but I was driving and
I hit this stoplight, and

169
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:38,655
it made me think about when
I was learning how to drive and then

170
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,371
my mom would always warn me about
this blind turn on the left-hand side,

171
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:45,078
and then I was thinking
about my mom, and...

172
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,529
I had your address.
I'm sorry for barging in.

173
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:49,954
It's no problem.

174
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,487
Just a surprise, though.

175
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,505
I haven't thought
about Isobel in years.

176
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,614
When was the last time you saw her?

177
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,834
About 17 years ago,

178
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,928
when she left to go have you.

179
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,296
We kept in touch for a while, but,

180
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:06,975
you know, people drift apart.

181
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,687
- And you don't know where she ended up?
- She was in Florida for a while.

182
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,482
She was on her own.
I know it wasn't easy.

183
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,518
Do you have any idea

184
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:19,154
who my father is?

185
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:23,450
I could never get her to fess up.

186
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:29,534
Anyway,
she finally pulled it together,

187
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,826
got into college on a scholarship.

188
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,001
- Where did she go?
- Somewhere in North Carolina.

189
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,770
Duke, I think.

190
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:39,007
Smart girl, smart school.

191
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:42,305
Let me just grab that.

192
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:57,132
So it's been a few months.
Where you been?

193
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:01,196
Here and there, never one place
too long. You know Pete.

194
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,407
No, actually, I don't, because

195
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,525
you never brought him around.

196
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,913
So blonde's the new
flavor of the month, huh?

197
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,222
So sorry I scared her off.

198
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:14,918
She's not a flavor, mom. I like her.

199
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,574
- So she's the one?
- No, probably not, but maybe.

200
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:23,051
Matty, seriously,
Lezzie Forbes' daughter?

201
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,595
Mom, seriously, knock it off.

202
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:28,432
Ice, please.

203
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,607
So...

204
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:39,317
you heard from Vic?

205
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,638
But don't worry.

206
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,113
She'll come home eventually
when she needs something.

207
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,116
- I played that game.
- Are you playing it now?

208
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,201
- No.
- Then what are you doin' home?

209
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,246
You trying to say I need
a reason to come back?

210
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,042
Sit down. Eat with me.

211
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,881
Tell me everything I've missed.

212
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,722
Thanks for meeting me.
Something's come up.

213
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,890
Jenna told you.

214
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:14,019
So it's true. Your wife Isobel
was Elena's birth mother.

215
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,020
What does Elena know?

216
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:20,334
- About your wife?
- About everything. You, your brother.

217
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,236
She knows what I am, and she knows
that you know about the vampires.

218
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,698
Does she know
about Damon and Isobel?

219
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:30,243
I couldn't tell her,
not until I was sure.

220
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,829
You said you'd help me.

221
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,516
I asked Damon without saying too much.
He doesn't remember.

222
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,310
- Ask him again.
- Damon is not stable right now.

223
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:41,133
He murdered my wife or at the very
least made a meal out of her.

224
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:43,798
- When has he been stable?
- I'm telling you not to push this.

225
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,889
- Give me a reason not to.
- Your survival.

226
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:48,261
How's that for a reason?
I'll handle it, but for now,

227
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,129
I need you to let it go.

228
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:53,642
Is that what you'll tell Elena?
Let it go?

229
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:00,646
Leave Elena out of this.

230
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,126
I need to know what happened.

231
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,197
I think you would, too.

232
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,857
I need something more
than just your wife's name,

233
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,044
a picture, something
I could show Damon.

234
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,048
Just a few more minutes.

235
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:38,436
- Can't you finish this in the morning?
- But I like working at night.

236
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:40,480
See, I like sleeping at night.

237
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:41,982
With you.

238
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:49,489
Okay, I'll bite.
What is it, thesis stuff?

239
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,513
Look, baby, I'm in a 3-way
here with you and your computer,

240
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:58,623
the least you can do is
let me know what you're up to.

241
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,919
I was doing research, and
I dug up all this stuff

242
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:13,722
about this small town in
Virginia near where I grew up.

243
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,017
It's isolated,
out of the way, and quiet,

244
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,853
and every now and then,
people die mysteriously,

245
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,030
and they say that it's animal attacks.
Except, these bodies

246
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:24,441
are drained of blood.

247
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:29,083
It's vampires. It has to be.

248
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,902
I'll get my garlic and holy water,

249
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,036
and maybe, just maybe...

250
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,663
We can get some sleep. Come here.

251
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:41,374
Look, this is why I love you,

252
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,170
because you believe in
all of this stuff,

253
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:49,215
so much so that you're making
a degree out of it. You're like...

254
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:52,844
Mulder, except hotter and a girl.

255
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,513
This is not a joke, Rick.

256
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,530
You think that this is cute,

257
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:02,079
but I'm gonna prove it.

258
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:11,029
And Mulder was right in the end.

259
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,742
They came to the games for us.

260
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,579
The football team hadn't won in years.
We were the stars.

261
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,957
Well, Izzie was.
But I was a damn good backup.

262
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:24,918
This is great. Thank you.

263
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,336
You're welcome.

264
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:29,571
You haven't touched your tea.

265
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,184
- What is this?
- It's just some herbal mixture.

266
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,019
Vervain?

267
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:48,841
- You know.
- Know what?

268
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:53,363
You didn't invite me in,
and you're serving vervain tea.

269
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,531
You know.

270
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,785
I think that you should
probably leave.

271
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,728
Wait. What are you not telling me?

272
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:02,163
Please leave.

273
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,416
Now!

274
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,204
Bourbon.

275
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,087
Behold the teacher.

276
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,555
Don't you have some papers to grade?

277
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:56,938
It's more fun with a buzz.

278
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,400
Well, most things in life are.
Sober's depressing.

279
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,391
You don't strike me as somebody
who gets depressed.

280
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,559
You say that like you know me.

281
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,065
Just a hunch.

282
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,366
- You have a good afternoon.
- Not likely.

283
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,444
- Daytime drinking, huh?
- It's all the rage.

284
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,169
- Listen, I need a favor.
- You ever been in love?

285
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,129
- Excuse me?
- Have you ever been so

286
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,758
bent on someone, that you just have
your heart ripped out by them?

287
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:38,426
You forget I was married.

288
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,471
Right. Gay husband.

289
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:46,005
She'll have what I'm having.

290
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Sit down.

291
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,601
There's a fundraiser here tonight

292
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,776
that the Founder's council
is throwing.

293
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,894
The town's most eligible bachelors
get raffled off for dates, and...

294
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,075
well, we're short a bachelor.

295
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,996
Is this what you do
when there's no...

296
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,196
Vampires? Organize bachelor raffles?

297
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:10,625
Trust me. At this point,
I miss the vampires.

298
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:15,547
You're a hero to this town, Damon.
I know most people don't know it,

299
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,967
but you are,
and you're single and a catch.

300
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:20,917
Come on. Help me out.

301
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:23,763
Carol Lockwood won't let me live
it down if I come up empty-handed.

302
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:28,866
You know, a room full of women

303
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:31,202
clamoring to win a date with me

304
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:34,263
- sounds tasty.
- Thank you.

305
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:35,944
One thing.

306
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,887
Can you get information
on someone for me?

307
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:40,738
Alaric Saltzman,
the history teacher.

308
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,746
There's just something
a little off about him, and...

309
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:47,537
I just wanna make sure that the high
school did their homework on this guy.

310
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:49,886
- You got it.
- Thanks.

311
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:01,134
- May I help you?
- Thank you for the text.

312
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,612
You're welcome.

313
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:07,987
I didn't tell her anything.

314
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:10,143
- I kept my promise.
- Good.

315
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,722
The girl, though...
She knew something.

316
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,816
That won't be a problem.
She won't get any closer to the truth.

317
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:19,487
Good.

318
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:23,364
- So I'm done?
- Yes. You're done.

319
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,044
No! I won't invite you in.
You can't come in!

320
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,082
I'm not a vampire, so, yes, I can.

321
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:37,712
I don't understand. I did
what you told me. I did my part!

322
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,680
And now I have to do mine.

323
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:31,785
Better.

324
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,476
Me.

325
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,353
- You look...
- Dashing?

326
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:38,231
Gorgeous? Irresistible?

327
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,650
Wrecked. You look wrecked.

328
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,652
No reason why.

329
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,071
Do you know that
I am one of Mystic Falls'

330
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,282
most eligible bachelors?

331
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,913
- How are you doing?
- Never better.

332
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,409
What can I do for you?
I'm a barrel of favors today.

333
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:03,596
It's my newfound purpose...
how can I help people?

334
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,427
I'm just meeting Stefan.
We're going to the fundraiser.

335
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:11,202
Help a guy out, will you?
I can't...

336
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:13,378
get this.

337
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,527
So,
I found out who my birth mother is.

338
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:26,578
Who cares?

339
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:29,274
She left you.

340
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,742
She sucks.

341
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,783
There you are.

342
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:45,256
I need a bigger jacket.

343
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,091
You know,

344
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,559
an occasional sorority girl might...

345
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,181
help fill you out a little bit.

346
00:23:57,878 --> 00:23:58,978
He's fine.

347
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,314
- He's Damon.
- Maybe this heartache

348
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,525
will be good for him. It'll remind him
he has one, even if it doesn't beat.

349
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,111
Won't hold my breath.

350
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,283
So I went to see Trudie Peterson.

351
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,162
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.

352
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:20,625
- How was it?
- She has vervain.

353
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,669
She knows about vampire stuff,
and it can't be a coincidence.

354
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:26,861
It isn't.

355
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,841
This is...

356
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:31,469
- Alaric's wife.
- This is her.

357
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,887
This is Isobel.

358
00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:34,889
He gave this to you?

359
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,600
Everything he knows about
vampires, he learned from her.

360
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,218
He believes that...

361
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,562
she was killed by one.

362
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:48,069
Listen, Elena, there's a lot
about Isobel that Alaric can tell you,

363
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:52,240
but I need you to hold off
a little while before you talk to him.

364
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,408
Why?

365
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:57,203
I know that it's a lot to ask of you
but will you do that for me?

366
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,750
Tickets for the raffle
are now on sale.

367
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:06,671
All proceeds benefit the annual
founder's day celebration.

368
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,214
That's a good look for you.

369
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:10,758
What?
Embarrassing and uncomfortable?

370
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,469
Yep. That's... that's the one.

371
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:19,204
I'm sorry about earlier.
It was just kind of a...

372
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:20,560
shock.

373
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,878
I'm sorry for dropping it on you,

374
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,583
- but I felt like you should know.
- I get it.

375
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,733
At some point,
maybe you and Elena could talk.

376
00:25:28,475 --> 00:25:31,075
I'm sure she'd like
to hear about Isobel,

377
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,600
what she was like.

378
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,575
Or not. No pressure.

379
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:39,399
I don't know if that's a great idea.

380
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:42,874
At least not...
not for a while.

381
00:25:45,423 --> 00:25:49,023
- Where'd our girlfriend go?
- She's on her way to the Grill.

382
00:25:49,642 --> 00:25:52,353
I wanted to talk to you.

383
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:55,011
This is the woman,

384
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,847
Isobel, from North Carolina.
Remember her now?

385
00:25:58,402 --> 00:25:59,974
- Who wants to know?
- I do.

386
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,792
Who else wants to know?

387
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:06,189
- Did you kill her?
- Sorry. Don't know her.

388
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:07,998
Are you comin'?

389
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:11,007
The real housewives
of Mystic Falls await.

390
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,465
He's already been hit on, like,
35 times. He's total cougar bait.

391
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,090
- Impressive.
- More like embarrassing.

392
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:20,105
Hi, Mrs. Donovan.

393
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:23,581
- Elena, honey.
- Hi, Kelly.

394
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,875
- Long time, no see.
- How are you doing?

395
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,085
Same old.
Matty tells me you broke his heart.

396
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:30,546
Just kidding. Calm down.

397
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:32,673
He found his rebound girl.

398
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,687
Here you go, sweetheart.
However many that'll buy.

399
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:39,915
I just hope I don't get bachelor 3.
I dated him in high school.

400
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,433
Not impressive.
In any way.

401
00:26:45,536 --> 00:26:46,736
Very exciting.

402
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:57,949
I've got the big date planned.

403
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:01,369
It's a romantic dinner,
secluded spot somewhere woodsy.

404
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,680
You're making me think
I should buy a ticket.

405
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:07,208
Well, you are in charge.
You could always rig it.

406
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:11,973
Pardon me.

407
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:18,077
I ran the check on the history teacher.
You want this before or

408
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:20,215
- after your big debut?
- How's it look?

409
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,266
He checks out. Couple of speeding
tickets. It's a rough story, though.

410
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,421
Turns out his wife went missing
a few years back in North Carolina.

411
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:27,796
North Carolina?

412
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,157
She have a name?

413
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:54,171
And what do you do,
bachelor number 3?

414
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:57,675
- Yeah, I'm a plumber.
- Well, isn't that wonderful?

415
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,643
We could always use more plumbers.
Moving on.

416
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:04,607
Number 4, "Alaric Saltzman."

417
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:07,593
That's quite a mouthful.
What do you do, Alaric?

418
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:09,968
I'm a teacher at Mystic Falls high.

419
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,566
Beauty and brains, ladies.
This one's a keeper.

420
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:16,068
- What do you teach?
- History.

421
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:18,779
History. Give us a fun fact

422
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,107
about Mystic Falls, something crazy.

423
00:28:28,393 --> 00:28:31,493
He's probably saving
the best stories for his date.

424
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,712
And last, but not least...

425
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:38,245
Damon Salvatore.
We don't have much on you.

426
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,801
Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.

427
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,928
Do you have any hobbies,
like to travel?

428
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:45,786
Yeah. LA, New York.

429
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,517
Couple of years ago,
I was in North Carolina,

430
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,735
near the Duke campus, actually.

431
00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:53,939
I think Alaric when to school there.
Didn't you, Rick?

432
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:57,026
Yeah, 'cause...
I know your wife did.

433
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:00,196
I had a drink with her once.

434
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,075
She was a great girl.
I ever tell you that?

435
00:29:05,073 --> 00:29:06,327
'Cause she was...

436
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,033
delicious.

437
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:20,975
- Are you okay?
- I just need some air.

438
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,351
He killed her?
Damon was the vampire that killed her?

439
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:34,587
I don't know what happened. Alaric
said that they never found the body.

440
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,267
I know. I'm sorry. I wanted

441
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:39,652
to tell you, but I just...
I wanted to know more.

442
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:42,092
I was feeling sorry for him,

443
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:44,907
hoping that this whole
Katherine thing would change him.

444
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,993
- I'm so stupid.
- He doesn't know the connection to you.

445
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,729
I thought about confronting him,
but he's already so on edge.

446
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:52,935
- Why are you protecting him?
- Because

447
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,794
you're not the only one
hoping that he might actually change.

448
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
That man.

449
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:08,889
I saw that man outside of Trudie's.

450
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:11,085
Get back inside. Come on.

451
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:19,150
And bachelor number 3 goes to...

452
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,770
3-7-4-5-8.

453
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:23,552
That's me...

454
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,409
Kelly Donovan. Lovely.

455
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:32,707
You and the plumber
should have so much fun.

456
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,832
Congratulations, Mrs. Donovan.

457
00:30:35,343 --> 00:30:37,084
Okay, just stop.

458
00:30:37,547 --> 00:30:39,128
Stop trying so hard.

459
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,381
This thing you're doing,
this nice thing, it's fake,

460
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,468
like you, like your mom,
and for some reason, Matt fell for it,

461
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,698
but that doesn't mean that I will.

462
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:49,263
I don't like you, okay?

463
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:52,451
So tell plumber boy
I'll be at the bar.

464
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:59,077
Easy there.
Buy a ticket like everyone else.

465
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:01,609
Did you enjoy that, rubbing
it in to Alaric Saltzman?

466
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,612
- What?
- Just as I was starting to think

467
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,271
that there was something
redeemable about you.

468
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,346
- Am I missing something here?
- Did I forget to mention

469
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:12,828
earlier when we were talking
about my birth mother,

470
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,914
the one that gave me up?

471
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:17,124
Her name was Isobel.

472
00:31:20,107 --> 00:31:21,107
Go ahead.

473
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,117
Reminisce about how you killed her.

474
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,345
Let's get you home.

475
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,698
- I have a message for you.
- What?

476
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:43,679
- Who are you?
- Stop looking.

477
00:31:44,164 --> 00:31:45,819
Stop looking for what?

478
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,637
She doesn't want to know you.
She doesn't want to talk to you.

479
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,701
You need to stop looking.
Do you understand?

480
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,969
She's alive?

481
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:57,540
- Does that mean she's a...
- Elena, he's under a compulsion.

482
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,250
- Do you understand?
- I do.

483
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,418
Good.

484
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:05,422
I'm done now.

485
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,123
Come on. Let's get out of here.

486
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,528
3-7-6-4-9.

487
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:31,073
- That's me.
- Congratulations.

488
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,090
And bachelor number 5,
Damon Salvatore.

489
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,919
3-7-5-5-2.
Would you look at that.

490
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,880
3-7-5-5-2.

491
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,715
What are the chances? Me.

492
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:51,109
Where'd he go?

493
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:53,847
I'm gonna call you later.

494
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,935
I think it's time to
let this vampire crap go.

495
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,355
I mean, the research, the trips,
it's become an obsession.

496
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,150
- This is important to me, Rick.
- Why? Why is it so important?

497
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:09,361
Explain it to me.
I mean, make me understand.

498
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:15,784
What's the point of this?

499
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:18,704
You don't want kids.
You're barely ever home.

500
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,373
- I want us to be normal people.
- Maybe I don't want to.

501
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,168
Maybe I want...

502
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,170
more.

503
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,672
- Here we go. Home, sweet home.
- Wait. Why... why are we back here?

504
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:38,515
- I wasn't ready to leave.
- Yeah, you were, mom.

505
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,530
- You're the best, Matty.
- I know.

506
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,888
I'm sorry...

507
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:51,612
I was gone so long.

508
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:56,408
Why are you really home, mom?

509
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:01,422
It's Pete.

510
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:03,290
He's gone,

511
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:06,669
and it's all my fault.
I did it. I always do it.

512
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,437
No, you didn't, mom.
It's not your fault.

513
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,638
You're all I have left.

514
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,642
Please don't leave me.

515
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,187
I'm not goin' anywhere.

516
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,050
Are you really this stupid?

517
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,053
Guess so.

518
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,888
You gonna put down the stake?

519
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:12,860
- That's courage.
- Where's Isobel?

520
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:16,238
- What have you done to my wife?
- You want me I killed her?

521
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,450
Would that make you happy?
Cause I think you know what happened.

522
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,351
I saw you feeding on her.

523
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:23,276
I did, and I wasn't lying.

524
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,165
She was delicious.

525
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:33,380
Come on. What do you think happened?
Not an inkling?

526
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:35,966
Never considered the possibility?

527
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,310
I turned her.

528
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:42,890
- Why?
- She came to me,

529
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,311
all pathetic, looking for vampires.

530
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:47,144
There was something about her,

531
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,604
something I liked.

532
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,774
- Something special.
- You turned her because you liked her?

533
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:56,028
I slept with her because I liked her.
I turned her because she begged me to.

534
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,120
But you knew that, too, didn't you?

535
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:06,580
Guess she wasn't happy at home,
wasn't happy with life in general,

536
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,373
wasn't happy with you.

537
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:14,849
This is a shame.

538
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:18,498
We're kindred spirits,
abandoned by the women we love.

539
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:20,223
Unrequited love sucks.

540
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:24,643
Sounds like I got a lung.

541
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,226
Which means I get to sit
here and watch you die.

542
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,818
What happened? What did you do?

543
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:19,695
Do what? He attacked me.

544
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:26,243
All I did was tell him the truth.
His wife didn't want him anymore.

545
00:37:26,832 --> 00:37:28,704
It's not my fault he couldn't
handle it.

546
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,748
- Like you've been handling Katherine?
- I'm handling it fine.

547
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:34,911
You know what?

548
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:38,069
Isobel came to me. She found me.

549
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:41,508
And if she's related to Elena,
that means she's related to Katherine.

550
00:37:41,795 --> 00:37:44,154
Maybe Katherine sent her to me.

551
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,055
Stop it.

552
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,392
You don't have to keep looking.

553
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,475
Can't be a coincidence
Isobel sought me out.

554
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:52,242
Can't.

555
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,856
I'm assuming
you'll take care of this.

556
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,771
What happened?

557
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,391
- What's going on?
- You were just...

558
00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:35,145
Did Damon turn you?

559
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,117
I went for him, and then he...

560
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:43,946
- He stabbed me.
- You must have vampire blood

561
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,814
in your system.
Somebody slipped it to you.

562
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:49,159
It's something else.

563
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,245
Then how?

564
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,196
Surprise gifts aren't fair.

565
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:03,799
I always feel bad for not
getting you something.

566
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,117
Just open it.

567
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:09,977
That's a giant piece of jewelry.

568
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:13,558
I know. It's ridiculous.
Just tell people it's a family heirloom.

569
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,043
- Nobody questions that.
- Where'd you get this?

570
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:18,814
If I told you, you'd laugh at me.

571
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:21,942
But promise me
that you'll always wear it.

572
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,945
It'll protect you from all the things
that go bump in the night.

573
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:28,240
A ring to ward off the demons, huh?

574
00:39:28,543 --> 00:39:29,843
Consider it a...

575
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:31,994
a token of my love,

576
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:35,539
my affection,
and if nothing else, an apology

577
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,040
for being so crazy.

578
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:42,139
- You were definitely crazy.
- I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed,

579
00:39:42,264 --> 00:39:43,797
and I'm a horrible wife.

580
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,758
But you love me anyway.

581
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,410
Yes, I do.

582
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:53,786
This ring protected me.

583
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:00,814
That's impossible.

584
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:03,671
I know.

585
00:40:42,555 --> 00:40:44,055
<i>Was there a problem?</i>

586
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:48,203
<i>Did you find her?</i>

587
00:40:48,676 --> 00:40:49,976
<i>What's going on?</i>

588
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:22,555
It's Harper.

589
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,609
I'm glad you found us.

590
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:33,351
This gentleman is a friend of mine.
May he come in?

591
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,285
Any friend of Pearl's
is a friend of mine. Please do.

592
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,453
Come in.

593
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,490
Annabelle, close the door, please.

594
