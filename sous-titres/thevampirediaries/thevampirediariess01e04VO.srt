00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,082
<i>Previously on The Vampire Diaries...</i>

2
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:04,354
<i>For over a century I have
lived in secret,</i>

3
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:07,913
<i>Until now. I know the risks,
but I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:12,240
You didn't tell me
that you had a brother.

5
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:13,445
It's complicated.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,686
- <i>She's a dead ringer for Katherine.</i>
- Which one of you dated her first?

7
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:20,062
Katherine is dead, and you hate me
because you loved her.

8
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,556
- I was hoping I'd see you again.
- She's not a puppet. She doesn't exist

9
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:26,150
for your amusement, for you
to feed on whenever you want to.

10
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,223
They're whatever I want them to be.

11
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,696
Wear it for me, for... good luck.

12
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,115
You want to kiss me.

13
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,660
Vervain in the necklace.

14
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,013
It's been a while
since anyone could resist my...

15
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,082
- compulsion.
- <i>There's nothing human in Damon.</i>

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,726
<i>No good, no kindness, no love.</i>

17
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:46,743
<i>Only a monster who must be stopped.</i>

18
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:30,431
<i>This is Logan Fell coming to you live
from the streets of Mystic Falls</i>

19
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,925
<i>with breaking news of another
deadly animal attack.</i>

20
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:36,345
<i>The wild animal terrorizing
the citizens of Mystic Falls</i>

21
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,472
<i>has claimed another victim,</i>

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,540
<i>Local high school student...</i>

23
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,311
<i>Police are certain that
forensic evidence will confirm</i>

24
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,575
<i>that this is the same animal
responsible for recent attacks.</i>

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,500
You know it's coming next.

26
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:17,221
Bad dream?

27
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,622
Do you know how easy it was
to get into your head just now?

28
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:25,519
You really need some human blood.
It might even the playing field.

29
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,308
Football reference.

30
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,240
Too soon.

31
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:42,161
All right, I deserved that.

32
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:45,831
But I just wanted to let you know,
they caught the culprit.

33
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:49,210
The animal responsible for killing
coach Tanner and all those people.

34
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,759
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,630
It was a mountain lion.
Really big one.

36
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,790
It attacked a hunter this morning.
It's all over the news.

37
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:59,011
"Deadly beast captured.
All's well in Mystic Falls."

38
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,229
Why would you over your tracks?

39
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,800
I've decided to stay a while.

40
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:09,396
I'm just having way too much
fun here with you and Elena.

41
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,962
- Can't touch her now.
- The vervain keeps me out of her head.

42
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:14,777
Maybe that's not my target.

43
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:18,239
Believe it or not, Stefan,
some girls don't need my persuasion.

44
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,845
Some girls just can't resist
my good looks,

45
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:24,452
my style and my charm and...

46
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:28,165
my unflinching ability
to listen to Taylor Swift.

47
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,929
This is John Varvatos, dude.

48
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,010
Dick move.

00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:59,442

<i>I can confirm that a 12-foot
puma mountain lion</i>

55
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,631
<i>attacked a hunter and was
subsequently shot and killed.</i>

56
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,415
<i>The hunter is in stable condition.</i>

57
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,648
<i>The real animal is still out there,</i>

58
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:16,023
<i>Waiting for me,</i>

59
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,050
<i>challenging me to fight back,
to stop him.</i>

60
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:23,012
<i>But how do I stop a monster
without becoming one myself?</i>

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,779
To repeat, the animal terrorizing
Mystic Falls has been caught.

62
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:28,065
Scum ball.

63
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:29,977
Scum bucket.

64
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:32,628
- Who are you talking to?
- Him.

65
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:37,776
- The news guy?
- Also known as Logan "scum" Fell.

66
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,738
Did your mom ever tell you
why I moved away from Mystic Falls?

67
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:42,807
No way.

68
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,325
You and him?

69
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,287
- He's cute.
- He is not cute.

70
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,505
There's nothing cute about him.

71
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:55,091
What are you doing with that?

72
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:57,755
I went yesterday and got it
from the safe deposit box.

73
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,175
Mom had told Mrs. Lockwood
she would loan it

74
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,185
to the founder's council
for their heritage display.

75
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,804
Is that grandma Beth's wedding ring?

76
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,841
Originally it was great-great-grandma
Mary's wedding ring.

77
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:12,065
How much do you think this stuff
is worth? You know, like on eBay?

78
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,706
- You're not gonna find out.
- That stuff is mom and dad's.

79
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,191
- You can't just give it away.
- I'm not giving it away.

80
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,443
It's called a loan, Jeremy.

81
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:01,946
Are you okay?

82
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm good.

83
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:09,034
- Sorry.
- Maybe we should press pause.

84
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,614
Yeah, you're probably right.
That was...

85
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,039
getting a bit...

86
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:22,336
How do you look in a suit?

87
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:27,293
- I can pull one off.
- How about tomorrow night?

88
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,555
Will you be my date
to the Founder's party?

89
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,932
- They still do that?
- Have you been before?

90
00:06:33,397 --> 00:06:35,256
No, the Salvatores...

91
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:37,582
don't get invited anymore.

92
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:39,829
Well, this year, there's this

93
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:42,533
heritage project
that meant a lot to my mom.

94
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:46,008
She was really involved
in the Founder's Council, and...

95
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:49,742
it was her favorite party.
I know it sounds really boring, but...

96
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,453
I would be honored
to accompany you, Miss Gilbert.

97
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:56,415
The pleasure is all mine,
Mr. Salvatore.

98
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,214
No yellow. Jaundice.
Go for the blue.

99
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,425
- I don't like the blue.
- Well, I do.

100
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,134
- And if I'm gonna be your date...
- You cannot be my date.

101
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,474
My mother is going to be there,
and she is a very proud gun owner.

102
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,820
I went through a lot of trouble to
make sure this party wasn't canceled.

103
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:18,995
It's very important I be there.

104
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:20,814
Please take me.

105
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:28,133
You should come
to the Founder's party with me.

106
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:30,011
Not if you're wearing that dress.

107
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:35,954
What's so special about this
Bella girl? Edward's so whipped.

108
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,792
You gotta read the first book first.
It won't make sense if you don't.

109
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:43,212
I miss Anne Rice. She was so on it.

110
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,163
- How come you don't sparkle?
- Because I live in the real world,

111
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:49,151
- where vampires burn in the sun.
- Yeah, but you go in the sun.

112
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:50,476
I have a ring.

113
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,346
It protects me. Long story.

114
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,600
Will these bites
turn me into a vampire?

115
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,407
It's more complicated than that.

116
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:02,827
You'd have to feed
on my blood, then die,

117
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:04,940
then feed on a human's,
it's whole ordeal.

118
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:07,384
This book, by the way,
has it all wrong.

119
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:16,627
You can be very sweet
when you want to be.

120
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:18,252
Yes, I can be sweet.

121
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,621
Are you going to kill me?

122
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,343
But not yet.

123
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:32,803
Why not?

124
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,021
Because there's something
I need you to do for me.

125
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:37,096
Anything.

126
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,580
How good are you at getting this
little nose where it doesn't belong?

127
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:41,905
I'm excellent.

128
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:50,948
So what happens with the season?
One big forfeit?

129
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,432
- Are they looking for a new coach?
- I don't know, dad.

130
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:55,650
I doubt anybody's
thinking about that right now.

131
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,268
Founder's party, focus.

132
00:08:57,393 --> 00:09:01,133
- How are y'all doing over here?
- We're doing great, sweetheart.

133
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:09,298
- Is there anything else I can get you?
- We're fine, thanks.

134
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,299
Just the check, honey.

135
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,740
- Here you go, Mayor Lockwood.
- Thanks.

136
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:22,574
You're taking Damon
to the Founder's party? What about me?

137
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,936
- Go with Elena.
- She's asking Stefan.

138
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:26,523
Okay, go by yourself.

139
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,934
Gee, thanks.

140
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:30,822
What about your mom? Is she okay
with you bringing Damon?

141
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,821
And I'm supposed to care why?

142
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,823
He's older sexy danger guy.

143
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,950
Older sexy danger guy?

144
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,993
Is that an official
witch Twitter tweet?

145
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:40,587
No more witch jokes, okay?

146
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:43,627
That whole Mr. Tanner
prediction thing has me freaked.

147
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:48,997
And Damon's not dangerous.
You know, he just...

148
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,618
has a lot of issues
with his brother.

149
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:54,276
You know, like major,
deep-rooted drama.

150
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:55,344
Like...?

151
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,931
I'm not really supposed
to say anything.

152
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,351
Caroline Forbes, when have you ever
kept a secret in your life?

153
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:06,313
But you can't tell Elena.

154
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:09,987
So what you gonna buy me?

155
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,485
Some class.

156
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,406
Your parents are gone.
I guess we can be close now.

157
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,481
What the hell does that mean?

158
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,159
You treat me like trash.
I'm sick of it.

159
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,851
I don't think you're trash.

160
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:23,584
Really? Then who are you taking
to the Founder's party?

161
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Do you want me to ask you
to the Founder's party?

162
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:32,442
- It'll be stupid and lame.
- True.

163
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:36,334
But it'll be less stupid and lame
if you were there.

164
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:44,106
You realize you had to ask him
to ask you, right?

165
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,020
You figure if you dress up like
a respectable young lady,

166
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,338
he'll finally treat you like one?

167
00:10:50,153 --> 00:10:51,553
Screw you, Jeremy.

168
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:55,487
You know you're making the wrong
choice, yet you make it anyway.

169
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,941
It's sad.

170
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:13,797
- I didn't know you were here.
- Just going through Stefan's homework.

171
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:17,092
Boy, this country sure has dumbed down
in the last hundred years.

172
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,644
Why he wants to go
to high school is beyond me.

173
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,758
I mean, in the seventies, he went
Ivy League. Harvard, I understood.

174
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,725
Actually, no.
I didn't get that either.

175
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,061
Go ahead, purge.

176
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,938
Get it out.
What's on your mind?

177
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,026
Why are you here, Damon?

178
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:38,280
To spend time with you, Zach.

179
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:40,907
Family's important.

180
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:42,743
I know you.

181
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:44,995
You always have a motive.

182
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,247
So tell me, what is it this time?

183
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,709
You are in no position
to question me.

184
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:53,587
I didn't mean to upset you.

185
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,543
This is not upset, Zach.

186
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,387
What's going on?

187
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,513
Having a family moment.
Spending some quality time.

188
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:10,228
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

189
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:14,066
And neither are you. How many more
people have to die before you see that?

190
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,109
I see it.
All right, Zach, I see it.

191
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,254
Then why aren't you
doing anything about it?

192
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,579
I can't, Zach.

193
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:20,671
I can't.

194
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,764
It would take human blood.
It's the only way

195
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:24,826
that I could stop him,
and I can't do that.

196
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:31,375
Vervain could weaken him

197
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,335
If he ingested it.

198
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,301
It would help you to the upper hand.

199
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:38,102
Vervain hasn't grown here
since 1865.

200
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:39,947
Damon saw to that.

201
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,344
The little I had, I gave to Elena.

202
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,682
What?

203
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,168
You've been growing it.

204
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,752
It's just something that's been
passed down through the generations.

205
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:19,647
Blood only runs so deep
when you're related to vampires.

206
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:23,364
Damon would kill me
if he knew that I had it.

207
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,486
But you're telling me.

208
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:27,303
Why?

209
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:30,781
Because I trust you.

210
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,986
And you're gonna need it
if you want to get rid of him.

211
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,743
I'm here for my mom. I was supposed
to pick up a box of stuff.

212
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:50,918
Right here.

213
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:53,808
Please be careful.

214
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,084
Be careful with it, dick.

215
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,194
- Not now, okay, guys? Please?
- I'm fine. He's just being a punk.

216
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,964
- I got your punk.
- Look, Tyler,

217
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,732
Maybe you should go. Tell your mom
that I'll see her tonight.

218
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:10,056
Would it make a difference
if I told you I actually like Vicki?

219
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,974
Not even if you meant it.

220
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,103
Delicate flower
versus naughty vixen.

221
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,171
Tough call. Can we mix them?

222
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:20,028
Look at you,
getting all pretty for your date.

223
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,507
You seem happy-ish.

224
00:14:21,632 --> 00:14:23,040
I am... ish.

225
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,489
Tonight's going to be a good night.

226
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,272
But don't let that stop you
from telling me whatever it is

227
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:30,744
you wanted to tell me
as soon as you walked in the door.

228
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,872
What if I tell you in the morning?
I don't want to ruin the night.

229
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,224
Out with it.

230
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:39,757
Okay, but it has to go in the vault,
because Caroline will kill me

231
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:42,582
If it gets back to Damon
that she squealed.

232
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,884
Apparently Stefan has
a very interesting back story.

233
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,217
Do you know what happened
with his ex-girlfriend?

234
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:53,850
I know that they both dated her
and that's why they have issues.

235
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,603
They both dated her,
only she chose Damon.

236
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:58,813
And that drove Stefan mad so,

237
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,167
he did horrible things
to try and break them up.

238
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,845
He manipulated Katherine.

239
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,626
He filled her head with all these lies
until finally it worked,

240
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,197
and she turned against Damon.

241
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,450
That sounds like one person's side
of the story, meaning Damon's.

242
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,418
I just wanted you to know.

243
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,497
Anyway, his past relationships
are none of my business.

244
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,458
Unless he's a calculating,
manipulative liar.

245
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,574
- That is your business.
- Stefan is none of those things.

246
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:22,796
How do you know?

247
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,765
They still wear ties at this thing?

248
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,976
- Why are you even going?
- It's only fitting.

249
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,894
We were at the very
first one, remember?

250
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,662
I think it's better if we don't draw
attention to ourselves.

251
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:44,004
So you should stay here.
I'll see to it Elena has a good time.

252
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:48,649
My goodness,
I've driven you to drink.

253
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,199
Can't seem to rid myself of you.

254
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,249
What else am I supposed to do,
besides go about living my life?

255
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,704
Go about living my life.

256
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,831
See, there in lies
your eternal struggle.

257
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:01,532
You're dead, dude.

258
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:02,757
Get over it.

259
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:05,647
What do you think?

260
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:15,078
Hello?

261
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,350
Hi, Mrs. Lockwood.

262
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:20,405
What do you mean? It is?

263
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:22,679
Are you sure?

264
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:24,411
Cause I saw it.

265
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:28,129
Let me check.

266
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,214
I will find it and bring it.

267
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:35,945
What's wrong?

268
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:42,250
- God, what now?
- The pocket watch. Where is it?

269
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:43,884
What watch?

270
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,297
The one you stole from mom's box.

271
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,422
Look, Mrs. Lockwood just called me,
freaking out.

272
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:52,342
It was on the list. And she can't
find it, and she thinks

273
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:55,508
- she's the one who lost it.
- Maybe she did. Maybe Tyler took it.

274
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,048
Don't even play that card.

275
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:59,616
You took it. If I go online,
am I going to find it on eBay?

276
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:02,691
- Is that how you pay for your pot?
- Screw you.

277
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:14,783
- I would never sell this, okay?
- Then why did you take it?

278
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,600
Because it's supposed to be mine.

279
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:18,844
Dad said it goes
to the firstborn son.

280
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,289
His father gave it to him,
and now what?

281
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,568
And he was going to give it to you.

282
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,258
Look, Jeremy,
it's still yours, okay?

283
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:38,682
Mom promised Mrs. Lockwood.
What do you want me to do?

284
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,600
Just take it and get out.

285
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:49,611
It's cool not growing old.
I like being the eternal stud.

286
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,738
Yes, being a 150-year-old teenager
Has been the height of my happiness.

287
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:58,484
You cracked a funny, Stefan.

288
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,162
I should have a drink to celebrate.

289
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:10,727
1864.

290
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,137
You and Katherine
were the perfect couple.

291
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:15,135
It was hell watching you
dance with her.

292
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,846
My happiness was short-lived,
as you well know.

293
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:19,055
I remember.

294
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,308
I left the party early,
I was waiting for her.

295
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,191
The night you dropped her off,
I was waiting just inside.

296
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:28,356
You were such a gentleman,
gave her a kiss on the cheek.

297
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,734
And what she really wanted was...

298
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,663
Here's to history
repeating itself, huh?

299
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,719
I admire your effort, Stefan.

300
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:46,583
Pouring yourself a drink
Then spiking the bottle with vervain.

301
00:18:48,146 --> 00:18:50,545
I'm not some drunk sorority chick.
You can't roofie me.

302
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,467
But I can't help but feel a little used.
I thought we were having a moment.

303
00:18:57,863 --> 00:18:59,963
I have to go to the party angry.

304
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:02,818
Who knows what I'll do?

305
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,751
Hi, nice to see you.

306
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,155
- Let's go this way.
- Why?

307
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,780
Line's too long.
We can go around back.

308
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:49,828
Come on, party's in the back.

309
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,743
That was his favorite scotch.
I'm sorry, I thought it would work.

310
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,568
I wasn't counting on it.

311
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:02,116
- You knew it would fail?
- Did what I wanted.

312
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,078
It lowered his guard. He won't
expect me to try again so soon.

313
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,714
I doubled what I put in the scotch.

314
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,921
- You look smashing.
- Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood.

315
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,802
This is my boyfriend Damon.

316
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,520
Oh, well, come on in.

317
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,965
Lovely to meet you. I've been looking
forward to this party for quite a while.

318
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,190
Well, enjoy.

319
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:12,694
Let's get a drink.

320
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:18,369
Wait here.

321
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:23,078
Really, you couldn't even change
out of the badge for this?

322
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:24,590
I'm working, honey.

323
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:27,388
Who's the date
you just tried to sneak past me?

324
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:30,463
- Just some guy.
- A little old for you, don't you think?

325
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:33,041
Cause otherwise you'd approve.
Yeah, I doubt that.

326
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,804
- Hi, Mayor Lockwood.
- Hey, guys, come on in.

327
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:38,929
Thank you.

328
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,051
Where's your dad?

329
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,626
- Memphis.
- Good.

330
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:44,043
With Stephen.

331
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:23,929
Your parents?

332
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:27,221
There's a lot of history here.

333
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,760
It's good to see you.

334
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,212
I thought I might see you here.

335
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,797
- You knew it.
- I dreaded.

336
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:56,457
But were secretly hoping.

337
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,251
And now that I have...

338
00:22:59,353 --> 00:23:03,089
Not so fast. I know you. You have
a lot more insults in you, I can tell.

339
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:07,010
- Your hairline's receding.
- It's not. You want to have lunch?

340
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,713
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Yes, I have.

341
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,180
I'm meaner now.

342
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:16,853
"The founding families
in mystic falls welcomes you

343
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,230
to the inaugural
founder's council celebration."

344
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:21,778
It's the original guest registry.

345
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,880
Look at all these familiar names...
Sheriff William Forbes,

346
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,705
Mayor Benjamin Lockwood.

347
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,282
Is that Damon Salvatore?

348
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,913
And, Stefan Salvatore.

349
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,014
The original Salvatore brothers.

350
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:40,084
Our ancestors.
Tragic story, actually.

351
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,880
We don't need to bore them
with stories of the past.

352
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,348
It's not boring.

353
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:48,468
I'd love to hear more
about your family.

354
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,268
Well, I'm bored.
I want to dance.

355
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:54,057
And Damon won't dance with me.

356
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:56,934
Could I just borrow your date?

357
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,356
- I don't really dance.
- Sure he does. You should see him.

358
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,068
Waltz, the jitterbug,
the moonwalk. He does it all.

359
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:08,321
You wouldn't mind, would you, Elena?

360
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:11,574
It's up to Stefan.

361
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,642
Sorry, but I'm not
gonna take no for an answer.

362
00:24:29,024 --> 00:24:31,174
I want to apologize to you for...

363
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:33,326
being such a

364
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,949
world-class jerk

365
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:38,142
the other night when I tried
to kiss you. There's no excuse.

366
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,010
My therapist says I'm...

367
00:24:41,185 --> 00:24:44,482
acting out, trying to punish Stefan.

368
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:46,109
For what?

369
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,598
It's all in the past.
I don't even want to bring it up.

370
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:50,914
Let's just say that the men
in the Salvatore family

371
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,328
have been cursed
with sibling rivalry.

372
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:56,619
And it all started with
the original Salvatore brothers.

373
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,978
Damon told you to ask me to dance.

374
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,374
Didn't he?

375
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:03,668
Why would he do that?

376
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,910
Would you like one?

377
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:10,836
Thank you.

378
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:15,636
Okay, just tell me
if you see my mom.

379
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,842
The Salvatore name was
practically royalty in this town.

380
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:25,283
Until the war.
There was a battle here...

381
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:27,608
- The battle of willow creek.
- Right.

382
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:30,347
I know, we talked about it in class.

383
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:33,865
Confederate soldiers fired on
a church with civilians inside.

384
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,083
What the history books left out

385
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,119
was the people that were killed.

386
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:40,555
They weren't there by accident.

387
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,733
They were believed to be
union sympathizers. So

388
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:45,321
some of the founders
on the confederacy side back then

389
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:47,821
wanted them rounded up
and burned alive.

390
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,591
Stefan and Damon had someone
they loved very much in that church.

391
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,103
And when they went to rescue them,
they were shot.

392
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,240
Murdered in cold blood.

393
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,435
Who was in the church
that they wanted to save?

394
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,061
A woman, I guess.

395
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:09,507
Doesn't it always come down
to the love of a woman?

396
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,642
Look, I'm sorry that you and Stefa
have this thing between you,

397
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:19,467
but I can't get in the middle of it,
Damon.

398
00:26:20,388 --> 00:26:21,338
I just...

399
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:24,476
I hope you two can work it out.

400
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:26,521
I hope so, too.

401
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:34,286
So you want to dance?

402
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:37,390
Me dancing? Not pretty.

403
00:26:40,236 --> 00:26:43,886
Maybe you could show me around.
I mean, this place is amazing.

404
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:46,366
If you like living in a museum.

405
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:51,144
Maybe I should just

406
00:26:51,396 --> 00:26:54,111
strip naked and give
pastor Bill a lap dance.

407
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,114
I mean, that's why we're hiding
in a corner all night, isn't it?

408
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,047
You're scared of how
I'm going to act?

409
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:01,861
You afraid of what your parents
are going to think about your date

410
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:03,584
from the wrong side of the tracks?

411
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,757
- I don't care about what they think.
- Great.

412
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:07,182
Let's go say hi.

413
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:08,749
Knock it off, Vick.

414
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:11,173
Or we could just, you know,
sneak up to your bedroom.

415
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,047
As long as nobody sees us, right?

416
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:16,134
- Vicki, I swear...
- What's a matter, Ty?

417
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,553
You scared to stand up to your mommy?
It's pretty pathetic.

418
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:20,998
Let go!

419
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:25,553
We didn't get a chance
to say hello earlier.

420
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,853
It's Vicki, right?Matt's sister.

421
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,146
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:33,401
You'll have to forgive my son's
rudeness. He gets it from his father.

423
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,719
Well, that's okay, Mrs. Lockwood.

424
00:27:35,844 --> 00:27:38,394
Tyler and I were just
saying good night.

425
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:46,213
That's what you get when you bring
the trash into the party.

426
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,453
What'd we miss?

427
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,469
We were just chatting.

428
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:31,000
Drink, Damon?

429
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:33,627
No, thanks, I'll pass.

430
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,801
Stefan, do you have
another dance in you?

431
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:43,206
Absolutely.

432
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,531
They look so cute together.

433
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,575
Don't talk, please.

434
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:18,756
Don't shoot!
I'm going to need a refill.

435
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,179
Shooting implies caring.

436
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,302
Feigned indifference. I like it.

437
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,137
I'm over the banter, Logan.

438
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,906
I'd really rather
you just left me alone.

439
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:33,609
I'm sorry, Jenna.

440
00:29:34,682 --> 00:29:36,082
About your sister.

441
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,236
Thank you.

442
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,659
I came to the funeral.

443
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,549
I know.

444
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:49,738
- I saw you.
- I didn't want to push my way in, but,

445
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:52,516
I wanted to be there for you. And...

446
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:55,935
when I heard you were staying
in Mystic Falls, I thought maybe...

447
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,088
Well, maybe I could have
a second chance to make things right.

448
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:10,141
Her name was Monica, wasn't it?

449
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:33,219
I hope Damon didn't
drive you too crazy.

450
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:37,698
No, actually,
he was on good behavior.

451
00:30:37,823 --> 00:30:40,009
He even apologized, and...

452
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:42,256
explained why he is the way he is.

453
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:46,177
And it all goes back to Katherine.

454
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,230
So tell me about her.
What happened?

455
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:03,027
It's not something
I like to talk about.

456
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,356
I get that.

457
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:05,735
I do.

458
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,639
I just want you to
know that you can.

459
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:13,037
I mean, I burden you
with all of my drama, and,

460
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,005
I want you to do the same.

461
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,630
I know.

462
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Thank you.

463
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,683
The truth is, Stefan...

464
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,543
I don't really know
that much about you,

465
00:31:28,668 --> 00:31:31,207
and I'd really love it
if you would open up to me.

466
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,291
Damon said something, didn't he?

467
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:37,937
He likes to play games
and cause trouble, Elena.

468
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:42,009
This isn't about Damon, it's about
me trying to get to know you.

469
00:31:42,662 --> 00:31:45,456
Look, you're the mystery guy,
and I like that.

470
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:49,323
But with mystery comes secrets,
And this thing with Katherine.

471
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,491
Let it go.

472
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,760
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Well, then, say something

473
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:55,635
about yourself. Anything.

474
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,307
Otherwise, I'm left with nothing
but what other people tell me.

475
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:01,932
Don't you see what
Damon has done here?

476
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:05,214
He's trying to get you
to turn against me.

477
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:09,747
Well, then I guess it's working.

478
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,900
This is my fault. I planted doubt.

479
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,868
- I'm a doubt planter.
- It's not your fault.

480
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,926
I feel terrible because I said that
I wouldn't get in the middle of it,

481
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,098
and then, that's exactly what I did.

482
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,770
I got all snotty.

483
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,396
Elena, honey, there you are.

484
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:42,251
I notice the watch
still isn't in the collection.

485
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:47,081
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lockwood. I...

486
00:32:47,983 --> 00:32:50,426
I couldn't find it.
I guess it's still packed up

487
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,511
in my parents' stuff somewhere.

488
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:54,099
I see.

489
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,223
Please let me know
if you do find it.

490
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,107
Where have you been?

491
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:09,028
Looking for you.

492
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,862
Your brother barely danced with me
for five minutes...

493
00:33:12,987 --> 00:33:15,637
Okay, just a minute.
Stand right... there.

494
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:26,462
You're not supposed to touch.

495
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,865
What is that?

496
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,740
A very important crystal.

497
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:33,993
Well, how did you know
that it was there?

498
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:35,768
- Because I put it there.
- When?

499
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:37,643
A long time ago. Tonight,

500
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,391
I'm taking it back, thanks to you.

501
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,846
- Well, what's it for?
- Never you mind.

502
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:43,354
You can't just steal it.

503
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,439
It's not stealing if it's mine.
Come on.

504
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,652
Vodka tonic.

505
00:33:56,955 --> 00:34:00,851
Okay, I know that this is probably
going to be strike 3, but,

506
00:34:00,976 --> 00:34:03,376
I hope you can see it
for what it is.

507
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,334
- And what is it?
- Persistence.

508
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,379
Groveling, commitment.
Take your pick.

509
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,397
I fled town because of you.

510
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:12,424
- Fled.
- I was young and stupid,

511
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,392
and...

512
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:16,320
then things changed. Life got...

513
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:17,899
real.

514
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:21,406
You'd know that better than anyone.

515
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,292
Hypothetically speaking, if allowed,

516
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:31,108
- how would you make things right?
- Well, more groveling, of course.

517
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,530
A recap of the past few years
spent soul searching.

518
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:35,906
Cheese fries.

519
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:39,326
Obvious.

520
00:34:40,008 --> 00:34:41,458
I know my audience.

521
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,309
Yes to lunch. Call me.

522
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:54,717
Look around.
What's missing?

523
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:58,387
The flames, the candles.
Why aren't they lit?

524
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:02,454
There's matches in the kitchen.

525
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:10,212
Bitch.

526
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,769
So how are things with Stefan?

527
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:51,685
Great. Just great.

528
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:52,807
Really?

529
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,126
Well, my radar must be off, cause

530
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,751
I was getting all sorts
of other vibes,

531
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,942
What is that?

532
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:05,282
Don't!

533
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,832
- Oh my God, Caroline, what happened?
- Nothing, okay?!

534
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,834
That is nothing.
Did somebody hurt you?

535
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,952
No, okay, nothing. It just...

536
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,181
My mom would kill me.

537
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:19,398
Did Damon hurt you?

538
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,012
Of course not!

539
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,139
Just leave me alone, okay, Elena?!
God!

540
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,071
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

541
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,074
You stay away from Caroline
or I will go straight to her mother,

542
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:44,061
The sheriff. You got it?

543
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:46,512
Stay away from her.

544
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:56,899
I'm sorry.

545
00:36:57,636 --> 00:37:00,467
I take it all back.
You're completely right about Damon.

546
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,885
What did he do?

547
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,710
There are bruises
all over Caroline's body.

548
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:08,685
Bite marks, and he has her all confused
and messed up in the head.

549
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:13,689
You don't... look surprised.

550
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,729
- I'm handling it.
- Handling it?

551
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:23,094
Stefan, you should be
having him arrested.

552
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,633
Please. I...

553
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:27,411
I don't expect you to understand.

554
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,777
I don't understand anything, Stefan.

555
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:32,249
So why don't you just
clear it up for me?

556
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,829
There are things
that you don't know, okay?

557
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:37,671
Things that I want
to tell you, but I can't.

558
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,689
And I may never be able to.

559
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:42,342
And I just need you to trust me.

560
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:45,786
Trust is earned.

561
00:37:46,106 --> 00:37:48,682
I can't just magically hand it over.

562
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,665
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

563
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:18,295
You look amazing.
What are you doing here?

564
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:22,825
I was thinking maybe I could make
one more wrong choice today.

565
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,311
I still have 17 minutes.

566
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:40,829
Don't!

567
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:44,814
She took it off
and I got flustered, okay?!

568
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:47,866
I didn't know what to say.
But I swear, okay, I did not tell her.

569
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:50,941
I just told her that
you didn't mean to hurt me.

570
00:39:08,935 --> 00:39:10,889
You make me crazy, you know that?

571
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:17,498
It's okay. I forgive you.

572
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:19,147
I swear I didn't say...

573
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:29,578
Unfortunately...

574
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:32,061
I am so...

575
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,319
over you now.

576
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:49,976
What the hell?

577
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:01,015
I knew, I couldn't
spike your drink...

578
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,900
So I spiked hers.

579
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:43,135
There you are. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

580
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:46,565
Are you okay?

581
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:49,764
I'm fine.

582
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,523
Caroline, what happened?

583
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:53,598
I'm fine.

584
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,287
- You're shaking. Caroline... what...
- I'm fine!

585
00:40:59,412 --> 00:41:00,412
Come here.

586
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,635
<i>I did what I had to do...</i>

587
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,110
<i>to protect Elena,</i>

588
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:08,154
<i>to protect everyone.</i>

589
00:41:10,664 --> 00:41:13,312
<i>Yes, Damon, the headline reads</i>

590
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:16,029
<i>"Deadly beast captured.</i>

591
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:18,966
<i>All is well in Mystic Falls."</i>

592
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:23,797
Thank you for staying so late.

593
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:25,922
Did you get the Gilbert watch?

594
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:29,147
She claims it's packed away
in her parents' things.

595
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:31,911
I can get it.

596
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,732
Good. We're going to need it.

597
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,495
- Are you sure?
- Five bodies all drained of blood?

598
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:40,127
I'm certain.

599
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,199
They've come back.
