00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,200
Previously on
the vampire diaries...

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,600
For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,900
I know the risk,
but i had no choice.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,100
I have to know her.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,800
- I'm elena.
- I'm stefan.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,500
I know. We have
history together.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,300
Last spring, my parents' car
Drove off of a bridge into the lake.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,400
You won't be sad
forever, elena.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,800
I live with my uncle.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Any siblings?

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
None that i talk to.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,100
- Hello, brother.
- Damon.

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,000
Elena, she's a dead ringer
for katherine.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,100
Wherever you go,
people die.

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,100
My god, it's vickiee!

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Something bit her,
she's losing a lot of blood.

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,100
Somebody help!

18
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,900
Vampire.

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,300
- Don't you crave a little?
- Stop.

20
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,100
Let's do it. Let's just
go straight for elena.

21
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,500
Imagine what her blood
tastes like!

22
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
Stop! Arghh!

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,000
Stay away
from elena.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,900
I'll take that
as an invitation.

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,100
- Hey. Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,400
I heard thunder.

29
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,000
- There's no thunder.
- Are you sure?

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,100
Because if it rains,
then we won't be able to see the comet.

31
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,600
It's not gonna rain.

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,500
Listen, i...
Got you a little something.

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,000
It's back in the car.

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
- Don't you move.
- Mm-Mm.

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
- Stay dry.
- It's not gonna rain.

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,600
I knew it!

37
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,700
I told you
it was gonna rain!

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,200
Open!

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,500
No!

40
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,100

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,100
Dear diary,

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,100
This morning
is...different.

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,200
There is change.
I can sense it, Feel it.

45
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm awake.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,700
For the first time
in a long time,

47
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,000
I feel completely
and undeniably wide awake.

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,700
For once, i don't regret
the day before it begins.

49
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,100
I welcome the day...

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,000
Because i know...

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
I will see her again.

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
I will see him again.

53
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,700
For the first time
in a long time,

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,300
I feel good.

55
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,400
Do i look adult?

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,400
As in respectfully parental?

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Depends where you're going.

58
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Jeremy's parent-Teacher
conference.

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,700
Hair up or down?

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,300
Sexy stewardess.

61
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,800
Boozy housewife.

62
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,800
Up it is.
You're feisty today.

63
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,000
I feel good, which is rare.
So i've decided to go with it.

64
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,500
Fly free, walk on sunshine,
and all that stuff.

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,500
Where is jeremy?

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,600
He left early.

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Something about getting to
wood shop early To finish a birdhouse.

68
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,000
There is no wood shop,
is there?

69
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
- No.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
You can't be in here, hon.

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
Visiting hours Don't start till 9:00.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,200
I just--
How is she?

73
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,500
She's lost
a lot of blood.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah, but she's
gonna be ok, right?

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
She needs her rest.

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,900
So you come back later.

77
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,200
Come on.

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,700
Originally discovered
nearly 5 centuries ago,

79
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,200
It hasn't been over mystic
falls in over 145 years.

80
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,300
Now, the comet will be its brightest Right
after dusk During tomorrow's celebration.

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Are we bothering you,
mr. Salvatore?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
Ms. Gilbert?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,100
I brought it.

84
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,700
Told you.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,300
Wuthering heights
by ellis bell.

86
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,100
You know, i can't believe
she didn't use her real name.

87
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,100
All the bronte sisters
used pseudonyms.

88
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
It was the time.

89
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,200
Female writers weren't
very accepted then.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,500
Where did you get it?

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Uh, it was passed down.

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
- Through the family.
- Ah.

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,900
I have lots of books.
Go ahead. Keep it.

94
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh, no. I--

95
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,900
But i would like
to read it again.

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,000
I promise
i'll give it back.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Ok.

98
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,100
I'm confused.
Are you psychic or clairvoyant?

99
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,400
Technically,
grams says i'm a witch.

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
My ancestors were these really
cool Salem witch chicks or something.

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Grams tried to explain it all, But she was
looped on the liquor So i kinda tuned out.

102
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,700
Crazy family, yes.

103
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,800
Witches? I don't think so.

104
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,200
Yeah, well, feel free to conjure up the
name and number Of that guy from last night.

105
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
I didn't see him,
you did.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,200
Why didn't you just
talk to him?

107
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,400
I don't know.
I was drunk.

108
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,100
Hey, tyler.
Hey, i'm sorry to interrupt.

109
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,200
I was just wondering how vickie's doing,
Since you guys are so close.

110
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,500
Is she ok?

111
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
She's fine.
Now get out of here.

112
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,500
How bad is she?

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,300
Do they know what attacked her?
Is she going to make a full recovery?

114
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Was she happy to see you?
What room number was she in?

115
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm going
to kick your ass.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,200
Yeah, you keep saying that,
But when are you actually going to do it?

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,100
'Cause i vote
for right here and right now.

118
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,400
Walk away, gilbert.

119
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,100
- It's your final warning.
- No, this is your final warning, dick.

120
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm sick of watching you
play vickie.

121
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,100
You hurt her one more time,
i swear to god, i will kill you.

122
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,000
Damn, that was like
a death threat.

123
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,300
Did you hear that?

124
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,000
They're keeping her overnight
to make sure There's no infection,

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But she should be able
to come home tomorrow.

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
- That's good news.
- Yeah.

127
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,500
Did you get in touch
with your mom?

128
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,800
Called and left a message.

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,100
She's in virginia beach
with her boyfriend, So...

130
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,800
we'll see how long
it takes her to come rushing home.

131
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
Vickie's lucky that she's ok.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,800
I know, and now there's talk
of some missing campers.

133
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,400
Did she say what kind of animal
it was that attacked her?

134
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,500
She said it was a vampire.

135
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,600
What?

136
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Yeah, she wakes up last night
and mutters "vampire" And then passes out.

137
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,100
Ok, that is weird.

138
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,600
I think she was drunk.

139
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,000
So what's up with you
and the new guy?

140
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,200
Matt, the last thing
that i want to do is hurt you.

141
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You know, i'm--

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm actually gonna go back to the hospital.

143
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,000
I want to be there when vickie wakes up,
Get the real story about last night.

144
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Ok.

145
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,600
As jeremy's teacher,
i'm concerned.

146
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,000
All right? It's the third day of school
And he's skipped 6 of his classes.

147
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,000
Mr. Tanner,

148
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,700
Are you aware that
jeremy and elena's parents died?

149
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
4 months ago,
a great loss.

150
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,900
Car accident.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,200
Wickery bridge,
if i remember correctly.

152
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,600
And you're related to the family how?
The, uh, mother's kid sister?

153
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,100
Younger sister.

154
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,400
- Right.
- Yes.

155
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,900
6 classes? Are you sure?

156
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,600
I mean,
that's kind of hard to do.

157
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,600
Not when
you're on drugs.

158
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,900
It's his attempt at
coping, ms. Summers.

159
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,200
And the signs are there. He's moody,
withdrawn, argumentative, Hungover.

160
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,500
Are there any other relatives
in the picture?

161
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,700
I'm their sole guardian.

162
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,100
Could there be?

163
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,500
What are you suggesting,
exactly?

164
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,700
It's an impossible job, isn't it,

165
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,600
Raising two teens?

166
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,700
It's been tough,
But, no, it's not.

167
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,100
Wrong answer.

168
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,500
It is an extremely
impossible job,

169
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,400
And anything less
and you're not doing it properly.

170
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,000
Vick.

171
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,300
Vickie, hey.

172
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,000
Vick, it's matt.
Hey, what's wrong?

173
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,200
No! No!

174
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,300
Get off!
No!

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,300
No!

176
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,100
- No!
- Nurse!

177
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
It was an animal
that attacked you.

178
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
It came out of the night
and jumped you.

179
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,700
You blacked out.

180
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,600
- It's all you remember.
- It's all i remember.

181
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,800
An animal attacked you.
You blacked out.

182
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,100
- It's all you remember.
- It's all i remember.

183
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,700
Nurse! I need help!
It's my sister.

184
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,700
She seems fine.

185
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,700
Well, i was
talking to grams,

186
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,000
And she said the comet
is a sign of impending doom.

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The last time it passed over mystic falls,
There was lots of death.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So much blood and carnage,
It created a bed of paranormal activity.

189
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,100
Yeah, and then you poured grams another
shot And she told you about the aliens.

190
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
So then what?

191
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,400
So then nothing.

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,900
You and stefan
talked all night?

193
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,500
There was no sloppy first kiss
Or touchy feely of any kind?

194
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,100
Nope. We didn't go there.

195
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,500
Not even a handshake?

196
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,600
I mean, elena,
We are your friends.

197
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,400
Ok? You are supposed
to share the smut.

198
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,000
- We just talked for hours.
- Ok, what is with the blockage?

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Just jump his bones already!
Ok, it's easy.

200
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,700
Boy likes girl,
girl likes boy,

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Sex.

202
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,700
Profound.

203
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,000
Where are you going?

204
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,500
Caroline's right.
It is easy.

205
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,000
If i sit here long enough, I'll end up
talking myself out of it Instead of

206
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,400
doing what i started the day
saying i was going to do.

207
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
I picked up dinner.
Tacos.

208
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,000
I had an urge
for guacamole.

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
- No, i'm good, thanks.
- Eat anyway.

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,300
It's a ruse.
I want to talk.

211
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,600
Hey, you! Come.

212
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
Sit.

213
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,700
Back in school,
freshman year,

214
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,600
I could eat my weight in nachos,
With extra cheese.

215
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
It was my munchie food
whenever i got stoned.

216
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,500
You get high?

217
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,900
Did.
Past tense.

218
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,100
But, yeah. Loved it.

219
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,400
Anything to get a little distraction
From life... reality.

220
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,900
And it worked.

221
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,900
For a while.

222
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,600
Never lasts, though.

223
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,000
Hey, i'm not saying i wouldn't
love to rail back and kick it,

224
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,900
But with a thesis looming
And a waistline expanding...

225
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,500
- What the--
- Finally you're awake.

226
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,300
Hey. How are you feeling?

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,500
You look better.

228
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,200
I was worried before.

229
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,400
You really had me freaked out
with all that screaming.

230
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Wait, what are you
talking about?

231
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,200
You don't remember?

232
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,400
I feel fine.

233
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,700
Good, good.

234
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,500
Doctor said you could
come home tomorrow.

235
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Vick, what attacked you
in the woods?

236
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,700
An animal.

237
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,800
What else could it have been?

238
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,800
Hey.
How do you feel?

239
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm ok.

240
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,800
I--I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go grab a coffee.

241
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,300
Hey, jer.

242
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,000
Why are you here?

243
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,400
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

244
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,300
Did you see that look
on matt's face?

245
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,100
That was suspicion.

246
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,600
I don't want people
To find out about us, jeremy.

247
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,800
Well, you gotta
get over that.

248
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,000
Tyler is finally
showing some interest.

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,800
You have to get
over that, too.

250
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,300
Do you see mr. Concerned?

251
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,400
Tyler? Are you under there?

252
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
No.

253
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,700
It's not cool
for people to know.

254
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,500
Ok? I'm older than you,
And matt and elena would freak.

255
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,700
No one's going to suspect anything.
Why wouldn't i check on you?

256
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,900
I mean, i'm the one
who found you.

257
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,000
You are?

258
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,100
Yeah, i carried you
out of the woods.

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,300
Thank you.

260
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,500
Yeah, you're welcome.

261
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,800
Stefan?

262
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,900
Stefan?

263
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,300
I--I'm sorry for barging in.
The door was...

264
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,600
Open.

265
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,100
You must be elena.

266
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,300
I'm damon,
stefan's brother.

267
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,000
He didn't tell me
he had a brother.

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,700
Well, stefan's
not one to brag.

269
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,600
Please, come.

270
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I'm sure stefan will
be along any second.

271
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,400
This is your
living room?

272
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,300
Living room, parlor,
sotheby's auction.

273
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,600
It's a little kitschy
for my taste.

274
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
I see why my brother's
so smitten.

275
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,700
It's about time.

276
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,000
For a while there, I never
thought he'd get over the last one.

277
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,300
Nearly destroyed him.

278
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,900
The last one?

279
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,400
Yeah.
Katherine, his girlfriend?

280
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,900
Oh, you two haven't had
the awkward exes conversation yet.

281
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,000
Nope.

282
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,900
Oops. Well, i'm sure
it'll come up now.

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,300
Or maybe he didn't want to tell you Because
he didn't want you to think he was on the rebound.

284
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,600
We all know how those
relationships end.

285
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,100
You say it like Every relationship
is doomed to end.

286
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,100
I'm a fatalist.

287
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,900
Hello, stefan.

288
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Elena.

289
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,400
I didn't know
you were coming over.

290
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
I know. I should have called, 

291
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
- i just--
- Oh, don't be silly.

292
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,800
You're welcome any time.
Isn't she, stefan?

293
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,200
You know, i should break out
the family photo albums, Or some home movies.

294
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,700
But...i have to warn you.

295
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,500
He wasn't always
such a looker.

296
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,100
Thank you
for stopping by, elena.

297
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,900
Nice to see you.

298
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,500
Yeah, i should probably go.

299
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,100
It was nice
to meet you, damon.

300
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,000
Great meeting you,
too, elena.

301
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,400
Stefan?

302
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
Stefan?

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,300
Great gal.

304
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,500
She's got spunk.

305
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,500
You, on the other hand,
look pooped.

306
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,400
Did you over-Exert
yourself today?

307
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,800
Let me guess--
Hospital.

308
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,300
Someone had to clean up your mess.

309
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,900
Well, were you successful?
Did the powers of persuasion work?

310
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,600
Remember, if you don't feed properly,
None of those little tricks work right.

311
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,300
- How long was elena here?
- Were you worried, stefan?

312
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,900
Scared we may be doomed
To repeat the past?

313
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,100
Isn't that why you play your little game,
"i'm a high school human"?

314
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,300
- I'm not playing any game.
- Of course you are.

315
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,400
We both know The closest
you'll ever get to humanity

316
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,800
Is when you rip it open and feed on it.

317
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,500
What kind of game
are you playing...

318
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,700
Damien?

319
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,700
Guess you'll just
have to wait and see, won't you?

320
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,200
He's on the rebound
and has raging family issues.

321
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,100
Well, at least
it's an ex-Girlfriend.

322
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,800
Wait till you date a guy
with mommy issues Or cheating issues.

323
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,300
Or amphetamine issues.

324
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,400
Jeremy.

325
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,100
Jeremy, where were you?

326
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,700
More stoner stories?
Look, jenna, i get it, you were cool.

327
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,100
And so that's--
That's cool.

328
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,800
Oh, no, no, no!

329
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Ow! Why?

330
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
- Why--Why did you do that?
- Listen up!

331
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,100
Quit ditching class
or you're grounded.

332
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,300
No discussion.

1
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,100
Parental authority,
i like it.

2
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,800
Sleep tight.

3
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,200
Matt.

4
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Mattie?

5
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,400
Tonight, night of the comet.

6
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,000
Would you like a program?

7
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,500
He didn't call, huh?

8
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,400
Or text.

9
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,300
But i realized we never
even exchanged that stuff.

10
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,900
We've never gotten
to the texting part.

11
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
That's an important milestone
in any relationship.

12
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,800
Isn't it? The timing
is wrong, anyway.

13
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,700
When is it ever right?

14
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,300
I'm not ready, bonnie.

15
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,600
Who is?

16
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,500
At least i put
myself out there.

17
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,700
Is that what
you're calling it?

18
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,600
What do you mean?

19
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,800
All i'm hearing is reasons
why you can't.

20
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,600
What is damon doing here?
Why did he come home?

21
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,900
'Cause i came home.

22
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,400
He wants to make my life miserable.
That's how he enjoys his.

23
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,700
Well, he's putting us
all at risk.

24
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
This girl in the hospital
could talk.

25
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
She won't.

26
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,600
- I took care of her.
- You're sure?

27
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm not sure, zach.

28
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,200
I don't know
how well it worked.

29
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,900
I'm not as strong
as damon.

30
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,200
So what happens
if it doesn't work?

31
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't know.

32
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
I'll deal with it.

33
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,700
Is she worth it?

34
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,800
Uncle stefan, this girl
you came back for.

35
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,000
Vickie, what are you
doing here?

36
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,100
Fighting with robert
about my schedule.

37
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
You'd think getting ripped up by a rabid
animal Would merit an extra sick day.

38
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,100
Are you feeling ok?

39
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
I hurt.

40
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,100
Well, the doctor gave
you something, right?

41
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,600
The kid stuff.
Nothing with an "o" in it.

42
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,400
I think they were onto me.

43
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,800
Here. Knock yourself
out, literally.

44
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,900
Thanks, jer.

45
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,400
So you gonna, uh,
watch the comet later?

46
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,700
I hadn't really
thought about it.

47
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,900
But i could be
talked into it.

48
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,500
I'll meet you
out there in a few.

49
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,800
Hey, vick.

50
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,900
How you feeling?

51
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,300
Like you care.

52
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,000
What are you lookin' at,
gilbert?

53
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,200
- Hey, i got some candles.
- Hi.

54
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,100
Thank you.

56
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,900
You're welcome.

57
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Thank you.

58
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Hi.

59
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Hi.

60
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,100
You know, that comet...

61
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,400
It's been traveling across
space for thousands of years.

62
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,200
All alone.

63
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,800
Yeah, bonnie says
it's a harbinger of evil.

64
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,000
I think it's just a ball of...

65
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,200
Snow and ice,

66
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,500
Trapped on a path
that it can't escape.

67
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,900
And once every 145 years,
It gets to come home.

68
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm sorry about yesterday.

69
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,300
I wasn't myself.

70
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,200
You seem to spend a lot
of time apologizing.

71
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,400
Well, i have a lot
to apologize for.

72
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,200
Yesterday,
that wasn't about you, ok?

73
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,200
You didn't tell me
that you had a brother.

74
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,200
We're not close.
It's, uh...

75
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,900
It's complicated.

76
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,200
Always.

77
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,400
He told me about your ex.

78
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,400
??

79
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,800
What did he say?

80
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,600
That she broke
your heart.

81
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,900
That was a long time ago.

82
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,400
When you lose someone,
it stays with you,

83
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Always reminding you
of how easy it is to get hurt.

84
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Elena...

85
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,200
It's ok, stefan.

86
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I get it.

87
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,400
You have no idea
how much i get it.

88
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,200
Complicated brother? Check.

89
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,800
Complicated ex? Check.

90
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,100
Too complicated to even
contemplate dating, double check.

91
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,900
It's ok.

92
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,200
We met, and we talked,
And it was epic, but...

93
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,700
Then the sun came up
and reality set in.

94
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,200
So...

95
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,900
I know you.

96
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,600
Well, that's unfortunate.

97
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,400
I don't--I don't know how, But...

98
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,800
Your face.

99
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Excuse me. Sorry.

100
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,600
Hey, has anyone seen vickie?

101
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,100
You're her stalker.
You tell us.

102
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,000
I can't find her.

103
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
She probably
found somebody else to party with.

104
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,100
Sorry, pill pusher,
i guess you've been replaced.

105
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,400
What's with the pill pusher?

106
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,800
- Ask him.
- You wanna do this right now?

107
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,200
Are you dealing?

108
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
She's never gonna go for you.

109
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,300
She already did.

110
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Over and over
and over again.

111
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
Yeah, right.

112
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,400
You slept
with vickie donovan?

113
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,000
I mean, vickie donovan
slept with you?

114
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,700
- There's no way.
- And i didn't even have to force her into it.

115
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,300
What the hell is he
talking about, todd?

116
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,800
Nothing, man,
just ignore him, he's a punk.

117
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,100
You know what, how about all of you
shut up And help me find my sister?

118
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,900
- We'll check the back.
- I'll check the square. 

119
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,000
I'll come with you.

120
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,300
Oh, no, no, no.

121
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,900
You are coming with me.

122
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,700
So that's your game now,
dealing?

123
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,800
I'm not dealing.

124
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,400
Look, i'm sick Of the tough love speech, jer.
It's really having no impact.

125
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,500
- You and jenna, between the two of you--
- We can stop if you want.

126
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,000
Send you to a therapist
where you'll be forced to deal with it

127
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,600
Or to rehab where you'll sit in group And tell
some stranger how you let your life fall apart.

128
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,500
Or you could talk to me.

129
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
I vote for none
of the above.

130
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,700
Hey.

131
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,100
Have you seen my sister?

132
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,100
- No, sorry.
- I can't find her. She's missing.

133
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,200
I'll keep
an eye out for her.

134
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,900
Hey.

135
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
I saw you at the hospital
yesterday.

136
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,600
Did you?

137
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,800
What were you doing there?

138
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
Visiting.

139
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,200
Visiting?

140
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,000
You know, Elena and i, we've known
each other for a long time.

141
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,800
We might not be together right now,
But i look out for her.

142
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,200
And i'll always
look out for her.

143
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,100
- You really have to stop screaming.
- No, please, stop. Don't...

144
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,600
Shh. I got you.

145
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,500
Excuse me.

146
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,300
No! No!

147
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,400
I gotta do it.
I'm not gonna drop you.

148
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,500
Not bad.

149
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Have you been
eating bunnies?

150
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,300
Let her go.

151
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,400
Shh. Really?

152
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
- Ok.
- No!
- No, no, no!

153
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,400
Relax.

154
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
What's happening?

155
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
I don't need her
to be dead, but...

156
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,300
You might.

157
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
What attacked you
the other night?

158
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
I don't know. An animal.

159
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,500
Are you sure about that?

160
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,600
Think.

161
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,500
Think about it.
Think really hard.

162
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
What attacked you?

163
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,000
A vampire.

164
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,600
- Who did this to you?
- You did!

165
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,700
- Wrong!
- Don't.

166
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,500
- It was stefan.
- Don't.

167
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Stefan salvatore
did this to you.

168
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,700
Stefan salvatore
did this to me.

169
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,000
He's a vampire.

170
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,900
A vicious,
murderous monster.

171
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,200
Please, damon.
Please don't do this.

172
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,900
If you couldn't fix it before,
I don't know what you can do now.

173
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Your choice of lifestyle
Has made you weak.

174
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,500
A couple of vampire
parlor tricks

175
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,300
Is nothing compared to
the power that you could have,

176
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,600
That you now need.

177
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,200
But you can change that.

178
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,200
Human blood gives you that.

179
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
No!

180
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,000
You have two choices.

181
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,100
You can feed
and make her forget.

182
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Or you can let her run,
screaming "vampire" through the town square.

183
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,900
That's what
this is about?

184
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,100
You want to expose me?

185
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
No! I want you to
remember who you are!

186
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,300
Why? So what, so i'll feed?

187
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,000
So i'll kill?

188
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,100
So i'll remember
what it's like to be brothers again?

189
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,400
You know what,
let her go.

190
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,700
Let her tell everyone that vampires
Have returned to mystic falls.

191
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,600
Let them chain me up,

192
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,000
And let them drive
a stake through my heart,

193
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,100
Because at least
i'll be free of you.

194
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,000
Come here, sweetheart.

195
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
- No!
- It's ok.

196
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,900
What happened?

197
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,700
Where am i?

198
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,800
Oh, i ripped
my stitches open.

199
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,800
You ok?

200
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
I took some
pills, man.

201
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,100
I'm good.

202
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,400
It's good
to be home.

203
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,700
Think i might
stay a while.

204
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,600
This town could use a bit of
a wake-Up call, Don't you think?

205
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,600
What are you up to, damon?

206
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,200
That's for me to know
and for you to...dot dot dot.

207
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,100
Give elena my best.

208
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,400
She said you found her
wandering around.

209
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,700
Yeah.

210
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,300
So, um,

211
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,100
Thanks.

212
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,800
Uhh, it's just so much drama.

213
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,200
Ever notice how the druggies
Are the biggest attention whores?

214
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Yeah.

215
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,400
Excuse me. Hi.

216
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,000
- Hi.
- Um, have you guys seen elena?

217
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,500
I think she went home.

218
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,700
I'm gonna give you
Elena's cell number and her email.

219
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,200
She is big on texting,
And you can tell her...

220
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,700
I said so.

221
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,000
Thank you.

222
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,700
You ok?

223
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,900
What happened to you?

224
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,200
That's so rude.

225
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,500
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

226
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,200
Yeah, she kind of wigs out.

227
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,900
It's like her thing.

228
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,300
Jer?

229
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,800
No, it's me,
the hypocrite patrol.

230
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,800
What are you doing?

231
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,100
I've become
my worst nightmare.

232
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,200
The authority figure
Who has to violate a 15-Year-Old's privacy.

233
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,500
Jackpot.

234
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,500
I see the hiding places haven't
gotten any more creative.

235
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,100
What brought this on?

236
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,500
Your ass-Hat of a history teacher
shamed me good yesterday.

237
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,500
You got tannered.
Been there.

238
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,900
"Discover the impossible,
ms. Summers." Got it.

239
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,000
Thanks. Like i didn't know
i was screwing up.

240
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
You're not screwing up,
aunt jenna.

241
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,000
Yes, i am.
You know why?

242
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,300
Because i'm not her.

243
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,100
She made everything
look so easy.

244
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,900
You know, high school,
marriage, having you.

245
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,200
I can't do it.

246
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,600
I'm gonna say or do
the wrong thing,

247
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,400
And he's gonna get worse,
and it's gonna be my fault.

248
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,700
It's impossible.

249
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,000
This is just
the fear talking.

250
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,900
You're a little scared, That's all.

251
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,700
We all are.

252
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,600
I have to go do something.

253
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,200
But are you going to be ok?

254
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,200
Oh...whoo.

255
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,800
Sorry. Didn't mean
to scare you.

256
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,400
No, it's fine. Um...

257
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,900
i was hoping
i'd see you again.

258
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,500
I know.

259
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,100
Cocky much?

260
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,700
Very much.

261
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,400
Hey.

262
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Would you like
to come in?

263
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,400
The comet's actually this way.

264
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,700
Sorry for barging in.

265
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
Especially after earlier.

266
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,600
No, no.
I'm glad you're here.

267
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,100
The way we left things...
i didn't like it.

268
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,800
See, the thing is,

269
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,700
I got home tonight
planning on doing what i always do,

270
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
Write in my diary,

271
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,100
Like i have been since my mom
gave me one when i was 10.

272
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,200
It's where i get everything
out, everything i'm feeling.

273
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,800
It all goes
in this little book

274
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,500
That i hide on the second shelf Behind
this really hideous ceramic mermaid.

275
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,500
But then i realized that i'd just be writing
things That i should probably be telling you.

276
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,900
What would you write?

277
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,000
I would write...

278
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,100
"Dear diary,

279
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,200
"Today i convinced myself it was ok to give up.

280
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,500
"Don't take risks.

281
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,600
"Stick with the status quo.
No drama, now is just not the time.

282
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,800
"But my reasons aren't reasons,
they're excuses.

283
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,900
"All i'm doing is hiding from the truth,
And the truth is that..."

284
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm scared, stefan.

285
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,200
I'm scared that if i let myself
Be happy for even one moment that...

286
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,400
The world's just going
to come crashing down, And i--

287
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,800
I don't know if i can survive that.

288
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,100
Do you want to know
what i would write?

289
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,000
"I met a girl.

290
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,300
"We talked.

291
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,300
It was epic."

292
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,100
"But then the sun came up
and reality set in."

293
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,500
"Well, this is reality.

294
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,400
Right here."

295
