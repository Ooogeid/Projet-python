1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,434
Man: for over a century,
I have lived in secret;

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:06,666
Hiding in the shadows,

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,833
Alone in the world.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,168
Until now.

5
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:13,868
I am a vampire.

6
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:16,035
And this is my story.

7
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:20,068
* when there's fire *

8
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:21,567
* on a crown *

9
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:22,801
* should have turned-- *

10
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,769
An hour's drive
to hear that crap.

11
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,102
You know, it wasn't
even a band.

12
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:28,236
A guy with a guitar.

13
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:29,568
An hour each way.

14
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:30,869
He wasn't that bad.

15
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:32,169
He sounded like
james blunt.

16
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:33,568
What's wrong with that?

17
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:36,002
We already have
a james blunt.
One's all we need.

18
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,902
So why did you come?

19
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:38,902
Because I love you.

20
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,836
Nicely done.

21
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:44,037
* stretches out *

22
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:46,037
* in the way beyond *

23
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:48,270
What's with all the fog?

24
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:49,337
It'll clear
in a second.

25
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:51,504
Watch out!

26
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,737
Are you ok?!

27
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:03,771
We just hit someone!
Oh, my god!

28
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:06,637
Call for help.

29
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,638
Come on, come on!

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,705
Please be alive!

31
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,439
Oh, my god.

32
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:34,273
There's no signal!

33
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,507
Darren!

34
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:39,073
Darren?

35
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,409
I shouldn't
have come home.

36
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:09,142
I know the risk.

37
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,109
But I had no choice.

38
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,809
I have to know her.

39
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,909
Dear diary,

40
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:18,709
Today will be different.

41
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:20,642
It has to be.

42
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,344
I will smile,
and it will be
believable.

43
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:30,110
My smile was saying
"I'm fine, thank you."

44
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:33,344
"Yes, I feel much better."

45
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:37,843
I will no longer be
the sad little girl
who lost her parents.

46
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,145
I will start fresh,
be someone new.

47
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,245
It's the only way
I'll make it through.

48
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:47,478
<i>[Here wego by
mat kearney playing]</i>

49
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,278
Toast.
I can make toast.

50
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,378
It's all about the coffee,
aunt Jenna.

51
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,479
Is there coffee?

52
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:55,513
Your first day of school

53
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:59,346
And I'm totally
unprepared.

54
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,279
Lunch money?

55
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,513
I'm good.

56
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,513
Anything else?

57
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:05,779
A number two pencil?
What am I missing?

58
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:08,212
Don't you have
a big presentation today?

59
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:11,047
I'm meeting
with my thesis
advisor at...now.

60
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:12,447
Crap!

61
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,013
Then go. We'll be fine.

62
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,280
You ok?

63
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:22,180
Don't start.

64
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:26,614
* oh, oh, here we go again *

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,515
* I know
how I lost a friend *

66
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,148
* we go 'round
and 'round again *

67
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:33,947
* oh, oh *

68
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,048
* oh, oh *

69
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,648
So grams is telling me
I'm psychic.

70
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,349
Our ancestors
were from salem,

71
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,482
Which isn't all
that, I know, crazy,

72
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,449
But she's going on
and on about it,

73
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:51,948
And I'm like, put this woman
in a home already!

74
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,882
But then I started
thinking,

75
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:57,350
I predicted Obama and I predicted
Heath Ledger,

76
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,050
And I still think Florida
will break off

77
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:01,050
And turn into little
resort islands.

78
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,549
Elena!

79
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:04,816
Back in the car.

80
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:08,083
I did it again,
didn't I?

81
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,950
I--I'm sorry, Bonnie.

82
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,151
You were telling me that...

83
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,518
That I'm
psychic now.

84
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,451
Right. Ok,
then predict something.

85
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,384
About me.

86
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,084
I see...

87
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:26,018
What was that?!

88
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,252
Oh, my god!

89
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,651
Elena, are you ok?

90
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:31,285
It's ok. I'm fine.

91
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:32,285
It was like a bird
or something.

92
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,218
It came out
of nowhere.

93
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:34,951
Really, I can't be
freaked out

94
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:37,252
By cars for the rest
of my life.

95
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:42,952
I predict this year
is going to be kick ass.

96
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,852
And I predict all
the sad and dark
times are over

97
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,453
And you are going
to be beyond happy.

98
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,321
Major lack of
male real estate.

99
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:19,888
Look at
the shower curtain
on kelly beach.

100
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:22,522
She looks a hot--
Can I still say "tranny mess"?

101
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:24,156
No, that's over.

102
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,456
Ahh, find a man,
coin a phrase.

103
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:28,822
It's a busy year.

104
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,856
He hates me.

105
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,190
That's not hate.

106
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,123
That's "you dumped me, 
but I'm too cool to show it,

107
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,589
"But secretly
I'm listening

108
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:46,090
To air supply's
greatest hits."

109
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,524
Elena. Oh, my god.

110
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,856
How are you?

111
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:53,257
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

112
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,425
How is she?
Is she good?

113
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:56,757
Caroline, I'm right here.

114
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,624
And I'm fine.
Thank you.

115
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,657
Really?

116
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:02,757
Yes. Much better.

117
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:04,291
Oh, you poor thing.

118
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,324
Ok, Caroline.

119
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:07,857
Oh!

120
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:09,459
Ok, see you guys
later?

121
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:11,359
Ok! Bye.

122
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:13,758
No comment.

123
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,392
I'm not going
to say anything.

124
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,125
Don't take more than two
in a six-Hour window.

125
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,426
Hey, Vicki.

126
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:25,026
I knew I'd find you here
with the crackheads.

127
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,493
Hey.

128
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,893
Hey, Pete Wentz called.

129
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,726
He wants
his nail polish back.

130
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:31,592
<i>Pete Wentz, huh?
How old school T.R.L. of you.</i>

131
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,692
Carson Daly fan?

132
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,427
Oh, Ty, be nice.
Be nice.

133
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,793
That's Elena's
little brother.

134
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:38,859
I know who he is.

135
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:40,127
I'll still
kick his ass.

136
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:42,027
* sense of humor's
void and numb *

137
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:44,428
* and I'm bored to tears *

138
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:46,061
* I'm bored to tears *

139
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,327
Hold up.
Who's this?

140
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,194
Elena: all I see is back.

141
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:52,161
It's a hot back.

142
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:54,594
Secretary: your records
are incomplete.

143
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,728
You're missing
immunization records,

144
00:06:56,795 --> 00:07:00,561
And we do insist
on transcripts.

145
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,062
Please look again.

146
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:06,661
I'm sure everything
you need is there.

147
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:14,762
Well, you're right.

148
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,196
So it is.

149
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:19,629
I'm sensing seattle,
and he plays the guitar.

150
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:22,329
You're really going to run this 
whole psychic thing

151
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:24,197
into the ground, huh?
- Pretty much.

152
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:26,464
Jeremy,
good batch, man.

153
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,164
I'll be right back.

154
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,696
Please be hot.

155
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,097
Whoa!
Pants down, chick!

156
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:40,697
Great.

157
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,465
It's the first
day of school
and you're stoned.

158
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:44,331
No, I'm not.
Where is it?

159
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,831
Is it on you?
Stop, all right?!

160
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,198
You need to chill yourself,
all right?

161
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:48,398
Chill myself?
What is that,

162
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:49,498
Stoner talk?

163
00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:51,231
Dude,
you are so cool.

164
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:53,664
Look, stop! I don't
have anything on me.
Are you crazy?

165
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:56,032
You haven't seen
crazy, jeremy!

166
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,865
I gave you
a summer pass,

167
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,132
But I am done
watching you
destroy yourself.

168
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,632
No, no, no,
you know what?

169
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,066
Go ahead.
Keep it up.
But just know

170
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,299
That I am going
to be there

171
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,765
To ruin your buzz
every time,
you got it?

172
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,033
Jeremy, I know
who you are.

173
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,067
And it's not
this person.

174
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,933
So don't be
this person.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,368
I don't need this.

176
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,034
Thank you.

177
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,834
You're welcome.

178
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:54,336
Uh, pardon me.

179
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,769
Um...

180
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,537
Is this the men's room?

181
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,969
Yes. Um,
I was just,

182
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,236
Um--I was just--

183
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,769
It's a long story.

184
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,404
Just...

185
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:18,637
Thank you.

00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,838
Once our home state
of virginia
joined confederacy

187
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:30,005
In 1861, it created
a tremendous
amount of tension

188
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:31,539
Within the state.

189
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,871
People in virginia's
northwest region

190
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:37,272
Had different ideals
than those from
the traditional deep south.

191
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:40,073
Then Virginia
divided in 1863

192
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,473
with the northwest region
joining the union.

194
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:19,542
* do you think
you can find it? *

195
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:22,808
* or did you trade it
for something *

196
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,642

Dear diary,

201
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:39,576
I made it through the day.

202
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:43,210
I must have said,
"I'm fine, thanks,"

203
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,776
At least 37 times.

204
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:48,843
And I didn't mean it once.

205
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,609
But no one noticed.

206
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:55,677
* 'cause
you won't let go *

207
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:58,111
* of anything
you hold *

208
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,445
Elena: when someone
asks, "how are you?"

209
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,378
They really don't
want an answer.

210
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,378
* all I need
is the air I breathe *

211
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:11,611
* and a place to rest *

212
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:13,279
Ok.

213
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,112
Hi, bird.

214
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:19,546
That's not creepy
or anything.

215
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,513
Shoo!

216
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,480
That's what I thought.

217
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:06,449
Ahh!

218
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:12,450
You ok?

219
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,416
Were you
following me?

220
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:19,049
No, I, uh, I just--
I saw you fall.

221
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:21,849
Uh-Huh, and you just
happened to be

222
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,715
Hanging out
in a cemetery.

223
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:27,017
I'm visiting.
I have family here.

224
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:28,551
Oh.

225
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,384
Wow. Tactless.

226
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,616
I'm sorry.
It's the fog,

227
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:35,616
It's making me
foggy.

228
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:38,050
And then back there,
there was this bird,

229
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:40,318
And it was all
very hitchcock
for a second.

230
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,351
That is the bird movie,
right, the hitchcock?

231
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:46,351
I'm Elena.

232
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:48,285
I'm Stefan.

233
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,584
I know.

234
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:52,051
We have history
together.

235
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,286
And english and french.

236
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:56,919
Right.

237
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,985
Oh.

238
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,885
Thanks.

239
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,920
Nice ring.

240
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:15,619
Oh. Um,

241
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,853
It's a family ring, yeah.

242
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,153
I'm kinda stuck with it.
It's weird, huh?

243
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,320
No, no. It's just,
I mean, there are rings

244
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,354
And then there's that.

245
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:34,854
Did you hurt yourself?

246
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,421
Hmm?
Did you hurt yourself?

247
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:37,555
Oh, uh,

248
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,122
I don't know.

249
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:49,988
Oh! Look at that.

250
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:52,721
That is not pretty.

251
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,622
You ok?

252
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,889
You should go.

253
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,390
Take care of that.

254
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,823
Really, it's nothing.

255
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,391
I lost control today.

256
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:15,724
Everything
I've kept buried inside

257
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,591
Came rushing
to the surface.

258
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:28,191
I'm simply not able
to resist her.

259
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:32,891
Thanks.
Hey.

260
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,292
Working.

261
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,326
Thanks, vick.

262
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:41,992
Do you need
another refill?

263
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:44,126
I'd love one.

264
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:49,226
Please tell me
you're not hooking
up with my sister.

265
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,359
I'm not hooking up
with your sister.

266
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,825
You're such a dick.

267
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,926
Hey, what's
your deal?

268
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:56,260
I mean, summer
you act one way

269
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,793
And then school
starts and you can't
be bothered.

270
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,160
Look, jeremy,
I really appreciate
all the pharmaceuticals,

271
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:01,893
But you can't keep
following me around
like a lost puppy.

272
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
When's the last time

273
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,494
You had sex
with a puppy?

274
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,193
Hey, keep it down.
I don't want to tell
the whole world

275
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,227
I deflowered
Elena's kid brother.

276
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:10,328
Yeah, and deflowered
and deflowered.

277
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:12,994
We hooked up a few times
in a drug haze. It's over.

278
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:15,961
You gotta back off
between you ruin things
between me and Tyler.

279
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:18,061
Oh, come on,
the guy's
a total douche.

280
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,794
He only wants you
for your ass.

281
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:21,261
Yeah?

282
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,628
What do you want me for?

283
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,195
His name
is Stefan Salvatore.

284
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,296
He lives with uncle up at 
the old Salvatore boarding house.

285
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,195
He hasn't lived here
since he was a kid.

286
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,262
Military family,
so they moved around a lot.

287
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,162
He's a gemini, and his
favorite color is blue.

288
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,330
You got all of that
in one day?

289
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,630
Oh, please, I got all that
between third and fourth period.

290
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,697
We're planning
a june wedding.

291
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:47,430
I'm meeting Bonnie
at the grill.

292
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:49,963
Ok, have fun.
Wait, I got this.

293
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,030
Don't stay out late,
it's a school night.

294
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:56,197
Well done,
aunt Jenna.

295
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,797
Oh.

296
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,897
Sorry, I was about to knock.

297
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,197
I wanted to apologize
for my disappearing act earlier.

298
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,398
I know it was...

299
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:10,065
Strange.

300
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:12,032
No worries.

301
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:14,165
I get it, blood
makes you squeamish.

302
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,299
Um, something like that.

303
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,299
How's your leg?

304
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,132
Oh, it's fine.

305
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,898
Just a scratch,
barely.

306
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:26,700
How did you know
where I lived?

307
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,466
It's a small town.

308
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,433
I asked
the first person I saw.

309
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,300
Um, I thought
you might want this back.

310
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,133
Oh, I must have
dropped it.

311
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,000
I--
Thank you.

312
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,501
Don't worry,
I didn't...read it.

313
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,401
No? 

314
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,034
Why not? Most people
would have.

315
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,200
Well, I wouldn't want
anyone to read mine.

316
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:53,234
You keep a journal?

317
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:54,535
Yeah, if I don't
write it down,

318
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,201
I forget it.

319
00:16:56,268 --> 00:17:00,001
Memories are too important.

320
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,934
Yeah.

321
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:05,702
I'm just gonna,

322
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:09,403
Um, you don't have
to stay out there.

323
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,869
I'm fine.

324
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:25,570
Sorry, were you going
somewhere?

325
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:28,504
Yeah, I'm meeting
a friend.

326
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:32,637
Do you want to come?

327
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,370
How's Elena doing?

328
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,438
Her mom
and dad died.
How do you think?

329
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:40,571
She's putting on
a good face,

330
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:42,738
But it's only been
four months.

331
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:45,038
Has she said anything
about me?
Oh, no.

332
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:46,038
So not getting
in the middle.

333
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:47,238
You pick up
the phone
and call her.

334
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:49,471
I feel weird calling her.

335
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,238
She broke up with me.

336
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,571
Give it
more time, matt.

337
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:00,673
* when I'm with him *

338
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:02,773

340
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:08,239

* who was spending *

344
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,939
Hey, I'm matt,
nice to meet you.

345
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:19,140
Hi. Stefan.

346
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,340
Hey.

347
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:23,674
Hey.

348
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,041
So, you were born
in mystic falls?

349
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:28,274
Mm-Hmm. And moved
when I was
still young.

350
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,541
Parents?

351
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,441
My parents
passed away.

352
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:36,574
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:39,008
Any siblings?

354
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:40,542
None that I talk to.

355
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,175
I live with my uncle.

356
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:44,841
So, Stefan,

357
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,342
if you're new, then you don't know
about the party tomorrow.

358
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:48,908
It's a back to school thing
at the falls.

359
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:51,108
Are you going?

360
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:52,375
Of course she is.

362
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,176
You promised.

363
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,544
This was
an animal attack.

364
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,277
Don't give me that.
I know the game.

365
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,377
You tear them up enough,
they always suspect
an animal attack.

366
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:19,477
You said you had it
under control.

367
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:21,110
And I do.

368
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,111
Please, uncle Stefan.

369
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:25,978
Mystic falls
is a different place now.

370
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,011
It's been quiet for years,
but there are people
who still remember.

371
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,111
And you being here,

372
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:33,111
It's just going
to stir things up.

373
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:34,745
It's not my intention.
Then what is?

374
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:36,378
Why did you come back?
After all this time, why now?

375
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:39,346
I don't have
to explain myself.

376
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,446
I know that you can't
change what you are.

377
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:47,146
But you don't
belong here anymore.

378
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:49,979
Where do I belong?

379
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:53,079
I can't tell you
what to do.

380
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:55,580
But coming back here
was a mistake.

381
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,946
* you want to know *

382
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,314
* know that
it doesn't hurt me *

383
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,580
* oh, oh, oh *

384
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:06,047
* you want to hear about
the deal I'm making *

385
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:09,515
* and if I only could *

386
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:12,315
* make a deal with god *

387
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:15,847
* and get him
to swap our places *

388
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,481
* be runnin' up that road *

389
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,814
* be runnin' up that hill *

390
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:25,482
* be runnin' up
that building *

391
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:27,249
* hill, hill *

392
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:29,582
* if I only could *

393
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,082
* be running up that hill *

394
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,649
* hill *

395
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:39,050
The battle of
willow creek

396
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:40,183
Took place right at
the end of the war

397
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,983
In our very own
mystic falls.

398
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,950
How many casualties
resulted in this battle?

399
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:47,750
Ms. Bennett?

400
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:50,516
Um...a lot?

401
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,549
I'm not sure.

402
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,118
Like a whole lot.

403
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,817
Cute becomes dumb
in an instant,
ms. Bennett.

404
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:58,218
Mr. Donovan.

405
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:00,550
Would you like to take
this opportunity

406
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,084
To overcome
your embedded
jock stereotype?

407
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:05,051
It's ok, mr. Tanner,
I'm cool with it.

408
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:07,184
Hmm. Elena?

409
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:09,785
Surely you can
enlighten us about

410
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,685
One of the town's most 
significantly historical events?

411
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:14,852
I'm sorry, I--
I don't know.

412
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,952
I was willing to be
lenient last year

413
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:19,085
For obvious reasons, Elena,

414
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,885
But the personal excuses
ended with summer break.

415
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,419
Stefan: there were
346 casualties,

416
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:28,452
Unless you're counting
local civilians.

417
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,086
That's correct.

418
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:31,519
Mister...

419
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:32,653
Salvatore.

420
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,186
Salvatore.
Any relation to

421
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,586
The original settlers
here at mystic falls?

422
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:38,786
Distant.

423
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:40,354
Well, very good.

424
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,321
Except, of course,
there were no
civilian casualties

425
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:43,620
In this battle.

426
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,388
Actually,
there were 27, sir.

427
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:48,620
Confederate soldiers,
they fired on the church,

428
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,487
Believing it to be
housing weapons.

429
00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:51,620
They were wrong.

430
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,421
It was a night
of great loss.

431
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,155
The founder's
archives are, uh,

432
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:59,022
Stored in civil hall
if you'd like to
brush up on your facts.

433
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,855
Mr. Tanner.
[All chuckling]

434
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:06,855
Mr. Tanner: hmm.

435
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:21,522
* note the feeling
when we lift off *

436
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:28,556
* watching the world,
so small and low *

437
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,723
What do you mean,
you never hooked up?

438
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,291
Girl: people look up to me.

439
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,191
I have to set an example.

440
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,557
Bonnie:
just admit it, Elena.

441
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:43,791
Oh, ok, so he's
a little pretty.

442
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:46,258
He has that
romance novel stare.

443
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,958
Stefan looked deep
into her eyes,

444
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,958
Piercing her very soul.

445
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:53,292
Hey! You made it!

446
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:54,226
I did.

447
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:55,992
Well, let's
get you a drink.

448
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,425
Well, I'm--
Oh, come on.

449
00:22:58,492 --> 00:22:59,792
So where is he?

450
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,326
I don't know.

451
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:03,259
You tell me,
you're the psychic one.

452
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:06,659
Right, I forgot.
Ok, so give me a sec.

453
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:08,159
Grams says I have
to concentrate.

454
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,726
Wait, you need
a crystal ball.

455
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:12,593
Ahh.

456
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,260
Ta da.

457
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,694
What?

458
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:25,761
That was weird.

459
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:27,861
When I touched you,
I saw a crow.

460
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,460
What?

461
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:31,028
A crow.

462
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:32,694
There was fog,

463
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,494
A man.

464
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,295
I'm drunk.

465
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,262
It's the drinking.
There's nothing
psychic about it.

466
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:42,695
Yeah? Ok, I'm gonna
get a refill.

467
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,828
Ok.

468
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:48,029
Bonnie!

469
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,329
Hi.

470
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:54,829
Hi.

471
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,629
I did it again,
didn't it?

472
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:58,096
Yeah.

473
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:59,963
I'm sorry.

474
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:04,496
You're upset about something.
Oh, uh,

475
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:07,763
No, it's Bonnie.
She's...

476
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:10,997
You know what?

477
00:24:11,064 --> 00:24:15,031
Never mind.
You're...here.

478
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:17,597
I'm here.

479
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:22,864
* but who decides
which route we take *

480
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:30,232
* as people drift
into a dream world *

481
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:34,198
You know, you're kind
of the talk of the town.

482
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,098
Am I?
Mm-Hmm.

483
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:39,432
Mysterious new guy,
oh, yeah.

484
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:43,133
Well, you have
the mysterious thing
going, too.

485
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,632
Twinged in sadness.

486
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:49,166
What makes you think
that I'm sad?

487
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:54,167
Well, we did
meet in a graveyard.

488
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,000
Right.

489
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:58,433
Well, no, technically
we met in the men's room.

490
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,833
You don't want
to know, it's...

491
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,833
It's not exactly
party chit-Chat.

492
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,633
Well, I've never really been
very good at, uh,

493
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,101
Chit-chat.

494
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,567
Last spring...

495
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:18,302
My parents' car
drove off of a bridge

496
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:19,901
Into the lake.

497
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:23,101
And I was in the backseat

498
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:25,169
And I survived, but...

499
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:28,635
They didn't.

500
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:31,468
So that's my story.

501
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,137
You won't be sad
forever, Elena.

502
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:56,671
No, Ty.

503
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,637
I'm not having sex
against a tree.

504
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:00,338
Oh, come on,
it would be hot.
For who?

505
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:01,704
No, it's not
going to happen.

506
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:03,771
It's not going to
happen, not here,
not like this.

507
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:06,470
No. I said no.

508
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,804
I said no!
Ow, that hurts!

509
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:10,438
Hey,
leave her alone.

510
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:12,505
You know, you're starting
to get on my nerves, gilbert.

511
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,838
Just go, Tyler, get the hell
away from me.

512
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:17,738
Wow. Vicki donovan says no.

513
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:19,471
That's a first.

514
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:23,372
I didn't need your help.

515
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:25,173
It seems like
you did.

516
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,873
He was just drunk.
I'm drunk.

517
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,906
Am I throwing
myself at you?

518
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:29,206
No, you're worse.

519
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:31,006
You want to talk to me,
get to know me,

520
00:26:31,073 --> 00:26:33,940
See into my soul and screw
and screw and screw

521
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,439
Until you're done with me.

522
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:38,307
Is that what
you think?

523
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:41,041
That's what I know.

524
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:49,807
I like Bonnie,
she seems like a good friend.

525
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,207
Best friend
in the world.
And matt,

526
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:54,342
He can't seem to, uh,
take his eyes off of us.

527
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,808
Matt's that friend
since childhood

528
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,242
That you start
dating

529
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:01,108
Because you owe it
to yourselves

530
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:03,409
To see if you can
be more.

531
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:06,342
And?

532
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,875
And then
my parents died,

533
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:12,542
And everything
changes.

534
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:13,676
Anyway, matt and I,

535
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:16,209
Together we just,
I don't know,

536
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:17,876
It wasn't, um...

537
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:20,310
It wasn't...

538
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,509
Passionate.

539
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,077
No.

540
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:33,843
No, it wasn't
passionate.

541
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,378
Hey, um,
are you ok?

542
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:41,444
Um,

543
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:43,011
Your eye,
it just, it's--

544
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,711
Oh, um...

545
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:48,378
Yeah, no.
It's, um, it's nothing.

546
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:50,245
Um, are you thirsty?

547
00:27:50,312 --> 00:27:52,111
I'm gonna get us a drink.

548
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:14,147
Jeremy?

549
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:16,513
Is that you?

550
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,580
Jeremy?

551
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,382
Looking for someone?

552
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,083
Hey.

553
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,616
When you
broke up with me,

554
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:10,917
You said it was
because you needed
some time alone.

555
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:12,550
You don't look
so alone to me.

556
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,483
Matt, you don't
understand. It's--

557
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,817
That's ok, Elena.

558
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:19,184
You do what
you have to do.

559
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,617
I just want to let
you know that...

560
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:25,252
I still believe in us.

561
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:28,585
And I'm not
giving up on that.

562
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,351
* and when I think
about a day without *

563
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:33,751
Matt.

564
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:35,285
* every day's the same *

565
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:37,118
* wish that you could
find someone *

566
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,519
Hey! There you are.

567
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:40,819
Have you been down
to the falls yet?

568
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:42,186
Because they are
really cool at night.

569
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:44,719
And I can show you.

570
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:46,552
If you want.

571
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,153
I think you've had
too much to drink.

572
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,652
Well, of course
I have.

573
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,519
So--
Caroline.

574
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:54,254
You and me,

575
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:56,353
It's not gonna happen.

576
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,120
Sorry.

577
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:06,120
* no, don't *

578
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:08,820
I was wondering
who abducted you,

579
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,188
But now I know.

580
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:13,721
Is she like that with,
uh, all the guys?

581
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:14,955
No.

582
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,288
You're fresh meat.

583
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:17,855
She'll back off eventually.
Hmm.

584
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:20,988
God, you gotta be kidding me!

585
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,255
What is it?

586
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,488
My brother.
The drunk one?

587
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:25,822
That would be the one.

588
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,089
Excuse me.
Need some help?

589
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:29,856
Trust me, you're not
going to want to
witness this.

590
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:32,522
Jeremy!

591
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:33,655
Jeremy!

592
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:35,789
Jeremy, where the hell
are you going?

593
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:36,956
I don't want
to hear it!

594
00:30:37,022 --> 00:30:40,090
Yeah, well, too bad!

595
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:42,456
Vicki? No!

596
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:45,123
Oh, my god, it's Vicki!
Oh, my god!

597
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:48,389
No!

598
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:51,957
Somebody help!

599
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:54,791
Vicki? Vicki,
what the hell?!

600
00:30:54,858 --> 00:30:56,124
What happened to her?

601
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:57,191
Somebody,
call an ambulance!

602
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:59,457
Everybody back up,
give her some space!

603
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,058
It's her neck.
Something bit her.
She's losing a lot of blood.

604
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:03,225
Put this on her neck.

605
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,891
Vicki, Vicki, come on,
open your eyes, look at me.

606
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,593
What's going on?

607
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,492
Someone else was
attacked tonight,
Zach, and it wasn't me.

608
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:52,294
Damon.

609
00:31:54,628 --> 00:31:57,128
Hello, brother.

610
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,761
Crow's a bit much,
don't you think?

611
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,129
Wait till you see
what I can do
with the fog.

612
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,395
When'd you get here?

613
00:32:13,462 --> 00:32:16,429
Well, I couldn't miss
your first day at school.

614
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:20,629
Your hair's different.

615
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:22,562
I like it.

616
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:25,663
It's been
15 years, Damon.

617
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,964
Thank god.

618
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,030
I couldn't take
another day of the nineties.

619
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:31,030
That horrible grunge look?

620
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:34,331
Did not suit you.

621
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:37,064
Remember, Stefan,
it's important
to stay away from fads.

622
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,364
Why are you here?

623
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:40,497
I miss
my little brother.

624
00:32:40,564 --> 00:32:42,031
You hate small towns.

625
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:43,731
It's boring.
There's nothing
for you to do.

626
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,798
I've managed to keep
myself busy.

627
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,531
You know, you left
that girl alive tonight.

628
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:50,131
That's very clumsy of you.

629
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:54,266
Ah. That can be
a problem...for you.

630
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:58,699
Why are you here now?

631
00:32:58,765 --> 00:33:01,266
I could ask you
the same question.

632
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,498
However,
I'm fairly certain

633
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,199
Your answer can be
summed up all into

634
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:07,365
One little word...

635
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:09,133
Elena.

636
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:34,268
Hey.

637
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:36,734
We're gonna go
mainline coffee,
wait for news.

638
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,468
I gotta take
jeremy home.

639
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:43,069
Elena, there's no way
I'm psychic.

640
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:45,368
I know that.

641
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:47,702
But whatever I saw,

642
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:49,969
Or I think I saw,

643
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:53,135
I have this feeling...

644
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:55,736
Bonnie, what?

645
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,569
That it's just
the beginning.

646
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:06,203
She took
my breath away.

647
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,402
Elena.

648
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,737
She's a dead ringer
for katherine.

649
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:15,403
Is it working, Stefan?

650
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,837
Being around her,
being in her world?

651
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,238
Does it make you
feel alive?

652
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:20,338
She's not katherine.

653
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:21,670
Well, let's hope not.

654
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:23,470
We both know
how that ended.

655
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:25,805
Tell me something,
when's the last time

656
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:28,305
You had something
stronger than
a squirrel?

657
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:31,339
I know what you're doing,
Damon. It's not gonna work.

658
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,205
Yeah? Come on.
Don't you crave
a little?

659
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,471
Stop it. Let's do it.
Together.

660
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:37,205
I saw a couple girls
out there.

661
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:39,572
Or just, let's just
cut to the chase,

662
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,906
Let's just go
straight for Elena!

663
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:42,606
Stop it!

664
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:45,472
Imagine what her
blood tastes like!

665
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,973
I can.

666
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,639
I said stop!

667
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,440
I was impressed.

668
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:07,974
I give it a six.

669
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,708
Missing style, but I was
pleasantly surprised.

670
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,975
Very good
with the whole face--

671
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,242
thing.
It was good.

672
00:35:17,308 --> 00:35:19,841
You know, it's all fun and games,
Damon, huh?

673
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:22,374
But wherever you go,
people die.

674
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,542
That's a given.
Not here.

675
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:27,142
I won't allow it.

676
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,976
I take that
as an invitation.

677
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,542
Damon, please.

678
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:33,542
After all these
years, can't we just
give it a rest?

679
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:36,309
I promised you
an eternity of misery,

680
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,809
So I'm just keeping my word.

681
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:40,843
Just stay away
from Elena.

682
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,210
Where's your ring?

683
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:49,177
Oh, yeah, sun's coming up
in a couple of hours,

684
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:52,810
And, poof,
ashes to ashes.

685
00:35:56,878 --> 00:35:58,510
Relax.

686
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:02,844
It's right here.

687
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,246
You should know better
than to think you're
stronger than me.

688
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:20,445
You lost that fight
when you stopped

689
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,445
Feeding on people.

690
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:24,946
I wouldn't try it again.

691
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,412
I think we woke
Zach up. Hmm.

692
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,313
Sorry, Zach.

693
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:48,914
You ok?

694
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:54,581
I called Jenna,
she's on her way.

695
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,715
Those people
in uniforms,

696
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,414
Last time I checked,
they're the police.

697
00:37:09,016 --> 00:37:13,883
People are going
to stop giving you
breaks, jer.

698
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:17,016
They just don't care
anymore.

699
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,149
They don't remember
that our parents
are dead,

700
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:23,782
Because they've got
their own lives
to deal with.

701
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,251
The rest of the world
has moved on.

702
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:30,284
You should try, too.

703
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,416
I've seen you in the cemetery
writing in your diary.

704
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,884
Is that--Is that
supposed to be you
moving on?

705
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:42,484
Mom and dad wouldn't
have wanted this.

706
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:51,352
Are you sober yet?

707
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:54,785
No. 

708
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:56,485
Keep drinking.
I gotta get you home.

709
00:37:56,552 --> 00:37:58,518
I gotta get me home.

710
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:01,619
Why didn't he
go for me?

711
00:38:01,685 --> 00:38:03,152
You know, how come

712
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:06,585
The guys that I want
never want me?

713
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:07,585
I'm not touching that.

714
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,987
I'm inappropriate.

715
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,187
I always say
the wrong thing.

716
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,620
And...

717
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:16,987
Elena always says
the right thing.

718
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:20,320
She doesn't even try!

719
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:21,453
And he just picks her.

720
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,888
And she's always the one
that everyone picks,

721
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:25,721
For everything.

722
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:29,721
And I try so hard,

723
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:30,954
And...

724
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:33,188
I'm never the one.

725
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:37,954
It's not a competition,
Caroline.

726
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:43,189
Yeah, it is.

727
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:46,055
* I was a heartbreaker *

728
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:47,455
* I loved you *

729
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:50,521
* the same way I do *

730
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:57,489
* but I've got so much
wickedness and sin *

731
00:38:57,556 --> 00:38:59,223
* my name is pearl *

732
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,956
* and I love you *

733
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:05,789
* the best way I know how *

734
00:39:05,856 --> 00:39:07,723
Vicki...

735
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:09,624
Hey.

736
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,024
Hey, it's ok.

737
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:12,157
You're gonna be ok.

738
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,457
Matt--
Shh.

739
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:16,191
Hey, don't try
to talk, ok?

740
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:19,124
You're fine.

741
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,024
Vampire.

742
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:32,025
Dear diary,

743
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:34,958
I couldn't
have been more wrong.

744
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:38,325
I thought that I could smile,
nod my way through it;

745
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:40,759
Pretend like
it would all be ok.

746
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:45,526
* some things
we don't talk about *

747
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,359
* better do without *

748
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,193
I had a plan.

749
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:52,560
I wanted to change
who I was;

750
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:55,327
Create a life
as someone new,

751
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:58,294
Someone without the past.

752
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,893
Without the pain.

753
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,227
Someone alive.

754
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:06,561
* you can never say never *

755
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:09,261
But it's
not that easy.

756
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:13,328
The bad things
stay with you.

757
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:14,761
They follow you.

758
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:16,994
* than we were before *

759
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:20,328
* don't let me go *

760
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:22,361
You can't
escape them,

761
00:40:22,428 --> 00:40:25,563
As much as you want to.

762
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:28,728
* don't let me go *

763
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:32,663
* don't let me go *

764
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,762
* don't let me go *

765
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:41,096
* don't let me go *

766
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:44,297
All you can do
is be ready for the good.

767
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:46,363
So when it comes,

768
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,330
You invite it in,
because you need it.

769
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:52,497
I need it.

770
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:56,797
* I will be your guardian *

771
00:40:56,864 --> 00:41:00,064
* for all that's coming in *

772
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:02,331
I know it's late.

773
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:04,264
But, uh...

774
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:07,031
I needed to know
that you were ok.

775
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,399
You know, for months,

776
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:12,332
That's all anyone's
wondered about me.

777
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,299
If I'll be ok.

778
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:16,765
What do you tell them?

779
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:21,265
That I'll be fine.

780
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:23,999
Do you ever mean it?

781
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:27,200
Ask me tomorrow.

782
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:33,966
It's warmer in the house.
We can talk.

783
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:39,000
Would you like
to come in?

784
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:43,267
Yes.

785
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:52,268
