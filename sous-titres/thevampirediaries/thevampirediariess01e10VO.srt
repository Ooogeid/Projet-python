1
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:04,485
<i>For over a century,
I have live in secret until now.</i>

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,631
<i>I know the risk,
but I have to know her.</i>

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,634
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
Hello, brother.

4
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:13,573
There's nothin' about that
Logan guy I killed in here.

5
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:15,848
- Someone's coverin' it up.
- It's a small circle,

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,892
founding families,
few city officials.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,144
I of course will do
anything I can to help.

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,064
Alaric Saltzman.
I'm your new history teacher.

9
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,900
- That's a cool ring.
- Thanks. It was my father's.

10
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,801
I have to leave.
Too many people have died.

11
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:30,745
I can't be a part
of your life anymore.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,293
- Don't go.
- Good-Bye.

13
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:34,784
You know what?
I'm not gonna invite you in.

14
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,243
Some other time, then.

15
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,954
I was dumped.
Yeah, well, Logan's a jerk.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,543
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

17
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:50,466
Why are you here, Logan?

18
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,784
I missed you.

19
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:53,920
I was out of town. I...

20
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:55,445
I got that e-mail.

21
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:57,890
You got an e-mail?

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,142
You didn't send an e-mail?

23
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:05,981
I can explain. Just invit me in,

24
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,688
- and I'll tell you everything.
- I'm not gonna invite you in.

25
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:10,483
- Forget it.
- Come on, Jenna.

26
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,071
It's me.

27
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,032
- The answer's no.
- I know you.

28
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,536
You're always one step from a maybe,

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,830
a tiny nudge to yes.

30
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:26,545
You just pointed out
that I have no self-control.

31
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,087
Clever strategy.

32
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,306
Evening.

33
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,298
You're that guy
from the news, Logan Fell.

34
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,508
I watch you every night.

35
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,136
I used to. I mean,
you've been missing from my TV.

36
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:20,243
- I took some time off.
- I noticed.

37
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,316
I'm Daphne.

38
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:26,012
- You know somethin', Daphne?
- No. What?

39
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:32,434
Mystic Falls Team
1x10 - The Turning Point

40
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:35,887
Croutch, Haize, Humanidyne,
McFly, MiniBen314, Thirteen, WoLF971

41
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:40,196
<i>"I live in fear.</i>

42
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:41,984
<i>It consumes me.</i>

43
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:46,165
<i>In the early evening when I see
the sun begin to fade, the fear comes,</i>

44
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,794
<i>because I know that
the night brings death."</i>

45
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:42,637
Jeremy's got his sketch pad out.

46
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,117
You're kidding.

47
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:47,059
But don't say a word. The minute
we encourage him, he'll put it away.

48
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,562
Psychology major. Check that.

49
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:55,823
You and Stefan?

50
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,686
Update?

51
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:00,652
He knows how I feel and where I stand
and I know where he stands,

52
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:03,513
but it doesn't matter.
He's leaving, moving away.

53
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,549
- Where's he going?
- I've stopped asking questions.

54
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:08,274
The answers get scary.

55
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,769
Yours leaves. Mine returns.

56
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:14,092
He's back.

57
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,811
I didn't let him
past the front door.

58
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,539
Hope you slammed it in his face.

59
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:21,010
- Medium slam.
- 3-strike rule, Jenna.

60
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,361
You're not even allowed
to watch the news.

61
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:25,759
Exactly. No more Logan "scum" Fell.

62
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,268
- So any idea of where you'll go?
- I don't know.

63
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,437
London, maybe. See some friends.

64
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,145
You don't have any friends.

65
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,357
You're right, Stefan.
I only have you, so...

66
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:38,986
- Where are we goin'?
- "We" are not going anywhere.

67
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:42,708
I'm gonna live my life as far
away from you as possible.

68
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,760
But we're a team.
We could travel the world together.

69
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,435
We could try out for
"the amazing race."

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,710
That's funny.

71
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:53,375
Seriously, where are you goin'?
Cause we're not staying in this town.

72
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,283
I'm here to see Damon.

73
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:03,324
Sure. Okay.

74
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:08,463
- What a surprise.
- Sorry to bother you but

75
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:09,938
we need to talk.

76
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:12,219
Come in.

77
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,333
I hope you understand the secrecy.
Stefan doesn't know about this yet.

78
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,955
I'd like to keep it that way.

79
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,601
Of course. Kids are too young
to be brought into this.

80
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,545
So, what do you need?

81
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,438
There's been another attack...

82
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,706
A female victim,
her throat torn out, completely

83
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,875
drained of blood.
It fits the pattern.

84
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:39,544
I'm sorry. I don't understand. I thought
we solved that problem when I...

85
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,132
- staked the blonde one.
- I'm thinking she must have

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,052
<i>turned someone or
multiple someones. I don't know.</i>

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,410
The story for the town is another
animal attack but I'm not sure how long

88
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:51,176
we can keep lying to them.
The Council's in an uproar.

89
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:53,251
We thought we were past this.

90
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:56,251
So, what do we do?

91
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:58,524
You're the only one who's
ever taken on a vampire.

92
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,216
<i>We were hoping you could tell us.</i>

93
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:09,868
And then the ballet dancer
and the krumper did the salsa.

94
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,512
I was awake for that part.

95
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,837
I don't know when you fell asleep.

96
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,621
Did you see the Celine Dion
waltz about cancer?

97
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,734
Those always make me cry.

98
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,170
Yeah. And...

99
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:23,048
then the loud judge kept screaming
and I couldn't take it,

100
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,666
so I turned it off.

101
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,719
I sat through "Family Guy," so

102
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,554
you owed me.

103
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:30,681
Did I miss something?

104
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:33,559
- They've been hanging out.
- Kind of weird, don't you think?

105
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,355
She needs someone nice like him,

106
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,896
as opposed to a homicidal
vampire like Damon.

107
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,164
How are you doing with all that?

108
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,118
I'm freaked out.

109
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:45,904
Damon attacked me.
I could be dead right now.

110
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,798
But I'm also grateful.

111
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,325
To Stefan.

112
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,269
He saved my life...

113
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:57,217
- Have you seen him?
- Not since he told me was leaving.

114
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:59,334
For all I know, he's already gone.

115
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,628
He wouldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

116
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,996
Yes, he would.

117
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:06,091
He thinks he's protecting me.
Clean break and all that.

118
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,261
- So what are you gonna do?
- What am I supposed to do?

119
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:12,723
I already begged him not to go.
If I ask again, I'm being selfish.

120
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,685
- It is what it is.
- Well, maybe it's for the best.

121
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,810
What? Why?

122
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:20,615
I mean, what kind of future could you
have had with him, even if he stayed?

123
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:27,658
- Did you just...
- No, I swear.

124
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,409
Thank you for stopping by.

125
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,627
- Let me know what you come up with.
- Absolutely.

126
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,292
What is wrong with you?
You killed somebody?

127
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,170
Get off of me. A...

128
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:45,195
Don't touch me.

129
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,841
B... If I had, I wouldn't
have been so obvious about it.

130
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,009
C...

131
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,720
There's another vampire in town.

132
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:54,807
- That's impossible.
- Obviously not.

133
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:57,761
Then who could it be?

134
00:07:58,174 --> 00:07:59,474
What do we care?

135
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,499
We're leavin' anyway, right?

136
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:04,817
No, I can't leave now,
and you know that.

137
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:08,801
How are we supposed
to find this person?

138
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,614
Let the adults handle this, Stefan.

139
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,874
See you later, okay? Bye.

140
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,444
We need to talk.

141
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:46,692
- So what's up with you and Forbes?
- Nothin's up.

142
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,945
I saw you two in the hall today.
Don't even try and deny it, bro.

143
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,359
- You're tappin' that.
- No, it's not like that.

144
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,533
Never is
till you become "we people."

145
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:58,795
"We people"?

146
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,624
"We can't make it to the party."
"We'll never miss a game."

147
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,376
"We don't like the color red."

148
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,670
We hung out, like, twice.

149
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:08,915
Like I said, "we."

150
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:13,102
So you have no idea who it could be?

151
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:14,521
None.

152
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:19,183
But it must be somebody new because
leaving a body like that, they're either

153
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,476
sloppy or they're trying
to send a message.

154
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,066
- And you're sure it's not Damon.
- Well, I'm never sure about Damon but

155
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,384
he's been trying to keep
a low profile lately,

156
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,484
so it just doesn't
make any sense to me.

157
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:31,968
So what are you gonna do?

158
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:34,239
Damon's tracking them right now.

159
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:36,512
Look...

160
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,916
I promised you the truth,

161
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,846
so I wanted to tell you.

162
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,261
I want you to be careful.

163
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,380
When I saw you, I...

164
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:53,239
thought you were coming
to say good-bye.

165
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,235
Not yet.

166
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,792
- What do you think?
- Creepy.

167
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,990
Found this old journal
in dad's stuff...

168
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:13,183
Jonathan Gilbert from the 1800s.
He's kind of a freak show.

169
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:16,615
He wrote about demons and all these
people getting slaughtered and...

170
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,450
He was a writer... Short stories,

171
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,869
- horror stuff.
- He wrote fiction?

172
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,914
Figured he was just
a lunatic or a drunk.

173
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:26,739
Well, he was a Gilbert,

174
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,253
Probably a little bit of both.

175
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:38,219
- So what do I do now?
- <i>Just wait. I'll be there in a minute.</i>

176
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:40,347
Can you hurry?
I have things to do.

177
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,165
You could give me that.

178
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,103
So why did you need me to do this?

179
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,571
Because I interfere with the signal.

180
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,291
Can I go now? This has blown,
like, half of my day.

181
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,570
You do that.

182
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,538
Get in your car.
Go home.

183
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,408
Forget I asked you to do this.

184
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:02,202
Okay. Bye now.

185
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:48,399
I have tons
of these wooden bullets, so...

186
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:49,724
nothing funky.

187
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,377
You don't wanna do this.
Trust me.

188
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,214
- That's what you get.
- For what?

189
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,258
You made me like this.

190
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,576
I killed you.
I didn't turn you.

191
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,097
I know what you and your brother are.
I've been watchin' the two of you.

192
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,101
I knew you'd show up here,
and I'm glad you did,

193
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,353
- because I have some questions.
- Me first.

194
00:12:10,238 --> 00:12:12,439
- Who turned you?
- How should I know?

195
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,603
Last thing I remember
is I'm about to stake your brother,

196
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:18,070
and then you grabbed me.
That's it.

197
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,781
Until I wake up in the ground

198
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,938
behind a used-car
dealership on highway 4.

199
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,332
Somebody buried me.

200
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,838
It happens.

201
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:31,205
You bit me.

202
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:32,918
It had to be you.

203
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:36,594
You have to have vampire blood
in your system when you die.

204
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,151
I didn't do that.

205
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,343
Some other vampire found you,
gave you their blood.

206
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,802
- Who?
- That's what I wanna know.

207
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,031
Dude, it's not like the welcome wagon
was waiting with a bundt cake

208
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:50,560
and a handbook. It's been
a learn-as-you-go process.

209
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,604
You know, one minute,

210
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,372
I'm a small-town on-the-rise
news guy, and next thing I know,

211
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:59,799
I can't get into my house, because
my foot won't go through the door.

212
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:02,906
- You have to be invited in.
- I know. I live alone.

213
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:04,732
That sucks.

214
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:07,539
So now I'm at the Ramada
watchin' pay-per-view all day,

215
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,959
eating everything in sight,
including housekeeping.

216
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,484
It could be worse.

217
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:14,466
All I can think about is
blood and killing people.

218
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:17,341
I can't stop killing people.
I keep killing.

219
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:19,392
And I like it.

220
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,466
I'm conflicted.

221
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,926
Welcome to the club.

222
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:27,389
Wait a minute.
Cops only found one body.

223
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,260
I left one. I was tired.

224
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:31,935
But I've been hidin'
the rest of the bodies.

225
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:34,396
- They're right back there.
- You're kidding.

226
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,214
They're just pilin' up.

227
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:49,741
So what do we know?

228
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:52,225
Nothing new to report yet.

229
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:56,718
My highly reliable
deputies are all on alert,

230
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:59,131
but if you feel the need
to be more proactive,

231
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,840
by all means,
grab a stake and have at it.

232
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,293
- What extra precautions can we take?
- For right now, there's nowhere safer

233
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,972
than a crowded public place and for once
we actually know where our kids are.

234
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:21,715
What do you want?

235
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:24,167
Just surprised to see you here.

236
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:28,093
Art usually implies culture,
and culture implies, well, not you.

237
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,377
Go to hell.

238
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,610
Still wanna be an astronaut?

239
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,850
- I can't believe you remember that.
- I can remember the tinfoil

240
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,177
- that you wore on your head.
- I was 8.

241
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,977
How are you doing?

242
00:14:58,136 --> 00:14:59,586
I've had it easier.

243
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,484
You?

244
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,112
I heard some things.

245
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,783
So it's true that you and Stefan...

246
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:11,438
Yeah, it is.

247
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,747
What about you... Matt Donovan?

248
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:20,474
- I heard about Caroline.
- Man, not you, too.

249
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,921
We're friends.

250
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,673
It's not a big deal.

251
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,065
Why am I so overly emotional?

252
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,548
All I can think about
is my ex-Girlfriend. I wanna

253
00:15:45,673 --> 00:15:47,571
be with her and bite her and stuff.

254
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:49,735
You probably love her.

255
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:53,118
Anything you felt before
will be magnified now.

256
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:55,662
You're gonna have to learn
how to control that.

257
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,830
What about walkin' in the sun?

258
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:59,325
I'm a morning person.

259
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,501
You can walk in the sun,
which, by the way,

260
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:05,005
Is pretty cool.
Council'd never suspect you.

261
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,840
It's not in the journals.

262
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,316
The journals?

263
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:11,136
The founding fathers, they
passed down journals to their kids.

264
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,454
Come on, man.
You gotta tell me.

265
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,056
How can you walk around in the sun?

266
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:19,060
- Who turned you?
- How do you walk in the sun?

267
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,018
Who turned you?

268
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,897
You know, I've been
really nice so far,

269
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,522
but I will kill you.

270
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:27,521
Then you'll never know.

271
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,981
- You're not answering my question.
- You first.

272
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:35,785
Seems we're at a bit
of an impasse then, doesn't it?

273
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,072
I have things to do, people to kill.

274
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,248
Guess I'll be needing
a little head start.

275
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,343
I'm guessing you're not here to
plan the path for your future.

276
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,353
You're looking out for me.

277
00:16:58,015 --> 00:16:59,184
Hope that's okay.

278
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,931
You know, I wanted to be a...

279
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,491
a doctor...

280
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:19,228
before everything happened...

281
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,939
but... then I couldn't, cause...

282
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,208
The blood.

283
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,896
I've dabbled in a bunch of
different things, though.

284
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:33,537
Didn't love anything
enough to stick to it?

285
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:36,199
I loved it all. I just...

286
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,056
I had to move on before

287
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:42,076
anybody could notice that
I wasn't getting any older.

288
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,440
- How long before that would happen?
- Few years, usually.

289
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,171
Sometimes shorter.

290
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,406
- And you always left.
- I didn't have a choice.

291
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:01,846
So what about... What about you?

292
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:04,860
What are your plans for the future?

293
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,761
I don't wanna talk
about my future, Stefan,

294
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,570
Because everything you're saying
is making it perfectly clear

295
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:12,431
that you're not gonna be in it.

296
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:16,594
- It's not that I don't wanna in it.
- You can't, I get it.

297
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,654
I heard you the first me
and the second time,

298
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:22,326
and I appreciate you
looking out for me but...

299
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,201
please, if you're gonna leave,
then just go.

300
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:29,983
Hide me.

301
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,318
- What's going on?
- The scum Fell has landed.

302
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,450
Logan's here.

303
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,031
Wait. Logan Fell?

304
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,236
What's going on?

305
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,935
- Are you dodging me?
- It's a form of self-preservation.

306
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,813
Why don't you and Jenna
go somewhere else.

307
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,692
Let's go.

308
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,116
What are you doin' here?

309
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,403
You know, your brother
asked me the same thing.

310
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,635
In fact, why don't we
just skip past all that

311
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,860
who-turned-me stuff
and get the answer that I want?

312
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:30,335
How can I turn into a daywalker?

313
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,802
Damon and I are the
only two that I know of.

314
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:36,841
But you're both very cagey on the how,
which tells me that there is a way.

315
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:40,656
You know, in case you hadn't noticed

316
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,348
I'm quite the celebrity
in this town.

317
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,685
It would be very, very easy
for me to expose you.

318
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:53,802
You wanna know how you can
walk around in the sun?

319
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,026
I do.

320
00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:59,075
You can't.

321
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,467
Don't ever...

322
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:03,988
threaten me...

323
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:05,113
again.

324
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,936
When Logan came to the house,
what did he say?

325
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,423
Fake flattery. Stupid, dimpled grin.

326
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,801
- Puppy dog eyes.
- I'm serious, Jenna.

327
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,095
How did he act? What did he say?

328
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,603
He was the usual Logan,
was charming,

329
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,266
little more manic than usual.

330
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,184
He kept trying to
convince me to let him in.

331
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,725
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

332
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,950
Do not, under any circumstances,

333
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,737
talk to him again.
I'm serious, Jenna, like, ever.

334
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,664
- I was hopin' to see you tonight.
- Career night is the new bowling.

335
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,001
Excuse me.

336
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,502
<i>Logan Fell's a vampire,</i>

337
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:57,012
<i>and when I find him again,</i>

338
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:00,091
<i>I am gonna destroy him limb by limb.</i>

339
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,185
What happened? You okay?

340
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,503
<i>I'm not okay.</i>

341
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,929
I was ambushed.

342
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,529
I was shot.

343
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:09,772
Now I'm vengeful.

344
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,687
- Just gotta find him.
- <i>There's no need.</i>

345
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,064
- He's here at the school.
- <i>You're kidding me.</i>

346
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,901
- Why the hell is he there?
- He's workin' the crowd.

347
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,236
Well, I'll be right there.

348
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:23,328
So...

349
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,549
anything you'd like to share?

350
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,952
- What are you doing?
- Following my future.

351
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,363
- There it is.
- Broadcast journalism?

352
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,259
Broadcast journalism.

353
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,923
Why are you looking at me like that?

354
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,759
You don't even read the paper.

355
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,228
What are you gonna do, stake me?

356
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,888
Bury me in another shallow grave?

357
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,610
- What would the e-Mail say this time?
- I didn't have a choice.

358
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,009
You bitch.

359
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:04,343
I died for you,

360
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,115
for this town.

361
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:09,327
You've known me since I was 6,

362
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:12,622
And you swept me
under the rug like dirt.

363
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,792
- You knew what you were getting into.
- I was one of you.

364
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,169
And now you're one of them.

365
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:26,195
Watch your back, sheriff.

366
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:34,140
Get a backup team to
the school immediately.

367
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:36,187
Keep it within the circle.
It's a V5.

368
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:39,318
I didn't know you drew.

369
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:40,830
It's an elective.

370
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:44,867
Cause it's good stuff. You like
graphics? Cause that's kind of my thing.

371
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,197
What are you doin'?

372
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,917
Well, it's just something
else we have in common.

373
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,910
And what's the other thing? Vicki?

374
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,410
Let's hang out because
we did the same chick?

375
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,532
Go be friends with one
of the many other guys

376
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:57,917
that she screwed.
There's no shortage of 'em.

377
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:07,627
- All right, work it out, tough guy.
- You two, follow me.

378
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,893
Excuse me, Mayor.

379
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,235
- Where are you taking 'em?
- I'm gonna talk to 'em.

380
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,146
All fights should end
in handshakes, don't you think?

381
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,891
Where are you? I'm ready to go.
I'll be outside.

382
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,693
Damsel in distress.
Need a ride?

383
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:30,632
Oh, my God. Logan Fell,
channel 9, is that you?

384
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:33,494
I used to baby-Sit you,
Caroline forbes. Don't mock me.

385
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,790
Well, I was supposed to go home
with Bonnie but I can't find her.

386
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:40,668
It's not a problem, really.

387
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:42,681
It's on my way.

388
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,062
- You know, this is fate.
- And why is that?

389
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,314
Cause I'm interested
in broadcast journalism.

390
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,317
- So can I ask you a couple questions?
- Anything you want.

391
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,830
First, buckle up.

392
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:21,292
Have you seen Logan Fell,
the news guy?

393
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,294
He just gave Caroline a ride home.

394
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,719
Stay here.

395
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,934
Let's get this out of your system.

396
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,311
Go ahead. Fight.

397
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:42,263
You want us to what?

398
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,875
I'm not gonna fight him, dad.

399
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,600
I don't think so, sir.

400
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:48,740
You don't fight in there...

401
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:50,015
like pansies.

402
00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:52,652
You take it outside,

403
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:55,493
fight your battl like men
and move on.

404
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,704
Best lesson my dad taught me.

405
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,202
So let's settle it.

406
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,166
Fight.

407
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,884
- Come on, dad.
- It's not gonna happen.

408
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:07,612
I said fight!

409
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:09,868
What's goin' on out here?

410
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:13,206
Just lettin' these two kids
work it out. We're good here.

411
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:16,331
- Go back inside.
- I don't wanna go back inside.

412
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,774
What I want is an
answer to my question.

413
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:21,807
What's goin' on out here?

414
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,660
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

415
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:28,202
Do I look like a student?

416
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,819
You look like a full-grown
alpha-male douche bag.

417
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,123
You don't talk to me like that.

418
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:37,298
I can have your job like this.

419
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,246
You do that.

420
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:44,704
Then it'll be you and me in this
parking lot working things out.

421
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,044
You cool with that?

422
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:50,318
You just marked yourself.

423
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,637
You all right?

424
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:11,056
Where are you?

425
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:13,988
<i>Your daughter has expressed
an ieresest in journalism.</i>

426
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,782
I think it's important
to foster young minds.

427
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,744
What do you want?

428
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,692
The satisfaction of turning
your daughter into a vampire.

429
00:26:33,387 --> 00:26:35,287
Payback's a bitch, isn't it?

430
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:38,384
Get her out of here.

431
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,322
<i>What happened?! Logan!</i>

432
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,434
Sheriff... It's Damon.

433
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:46,126
- Where's Caroline?
- She's okay.

434
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,088
I'm on Elm street.

435
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:59,277
Gonna try this one more time.

436
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,665
- Who turned you?
- I told you I don't know.

437
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:10,215
This tire iron here could
take your head clean off.

438
00:27:10,843 --> 00:27:13,668
- Is that your final answer?
- How can you side with them?

439
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:17,441
I don't side with anyone.
You pissed me off. I want you dead.

440
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,345
- Who turned you?
- I don't know!

441
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,430
- Well. You're screwed.
- Wait, wait!

442
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,099
- I do know.
- You're lying.

443
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,845
You think you're the only one
that wanna get in that tomb

444
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,770
underneath the old church?

445
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:29,855
If you are lying to me,
I will end you.

446
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,601
I am not lying. There's another way
to break the spell. We can help you.

447
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,577
Meet me at the old church.

448
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:38,823
Take me down. Make it
look real. Make it look real.

449
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:45,246
- Where is she?
- She's okay.

450
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,208
My brother's taken her home.
I'm sorry, sheriff.

451
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,253
I just wasn't strong enough.

452
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:04,508
She's okay. I took her home.
She was shaken up but

453
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:06,879
all she knows is Logan
attacked her. Nothing else.

454
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:08,854
- Where's Logan?
- Damon's...

455
00:28:09,698 --> 00:28:11,698
- dealing with it.
- As in...

456
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:18,535
You saw what happened today, right?

457
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:21,444
I mean, you understand...

458
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,117
why we can't...

459
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:25,359
be together? You see it?

460
00:28:25,484 --> 00:28:28,234
I'm starting to see
a lot of things, Stefan.

461
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:32,835
Come on. I'll...
I'll give you a ride.

462
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:35,567
I can get home.

463
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:38,021
I know.

464
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:42,154
All right. That'd be nice.

465
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:54,427
What do you want?

466
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:56,168
I don't know.

467
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:59,106
I thought that
was weird with your dad,

468
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:00,331
What he did.

469
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:02,992
Is he like that all the time?

470
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:05,201
Is that what you gotta go through?

471
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,990
Man, I get it.

472
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:08,506
I get it.

473
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:11,877
What's your problem?

474
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,251
- I don't need your pity.
- Seriously, you don't have

475
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,969
- to be like this. You don't.
- Just go.

476
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:19,618
What's your problem, man?

477
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,442
I don't know, okay?

478
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,579
I don't know.

479
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:39,499
What I said before...

480
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:41,889
about you leaving, it was harsh.

481
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:44,704
You had every right.

482
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,954
You asked me what I...

483
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,729
wanted my future to be.

484
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:55,876
I wanted to be a writer.

485
00:29:57,307 --> 00:30:00,673
My mom sort of pushed me
into that direction

486
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:03,222
from the time I was able to read.

487
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,881
She supported me,

488
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:07,656
encouraged me,
bought me my first journal,

489
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:09,723
and then she died.

490
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,644
And I can't... see

491
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,440
myself being a writer anymore.
That was something that we shared.

492
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:22,213
I know that you think that you brought
all of this bad stuff into my life,

493
00:30:22,338 --> 00:30:25,072
but my life already had it.
I was buried in it.

494
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,640
This is different.

495
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,600
It doesn't make it any less painful.

496
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:37,649
I know that it's...
That it's hard to understand...

497
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,771
But I'm doing this for you.

498
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,693
You don't get to make
that decision for me.

499
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,821
If you walk away, it's for you,
because I know what I want.

500
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,329
Stefan, I love you.

501
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Don't.

502
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:11,789
Elena, I can't.

503
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,347
Yes, you can.

504
00:32:15,092 --> 00:32:16,542
Don't hide from me.

505
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,024
Who are you?

506
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,734
A friend of Jenna's.

507
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:32,945
Jenna sent you?

508
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:34,943
I came on my own.

509
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:39,067
I get it.

510
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,204
Well, buddy, I know
you think this makes you brave,

511
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:44,915
but actually it makes you
pretty stupid.

512
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:48,252
Either way, here I am.

513
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:52,454
- What do you want?
- Jenna's a good person.

514
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:54,179
She deserves the best.

515
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,385
I'm here to make sure she gets it.

516
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,679
Was that supposed to be a threat?

517
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:00,984
Couldn't you...

518
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:02,583
throw a punch?

519
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,806
Maybe provoke me a little?

520
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,390
I'm not a violent guy by design.

521
00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:11,433
Well, you're not
a very smart one, either.

522
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,660
How's that?

523
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:17,698
Cause you have no idea
who you're talking to.

524
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:38,969
I need a ride.

525
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,337
Sure.

526
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:44,199
Look, I like Caroline.
She's got this....

527
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:46,566
thing. This way about her
and I like her, okay?

528
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:48,937
And I'm not gonna defend it
or apologize about it.

529
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:52,877
So stop your little
bromance bitch act.

530
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,339
I'll be right there.

531
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:30,562
I've never been in your room before.

532
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:35,201
Well, it hasn't changed
much over the years.

533
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:39,369
Do you leave everything here
when you come and go?

534
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:41,344
It's the only place that...

535
00:36:41,923 --> 00:36:43,773
That has remained constant.

536
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:46,799
This room holds every memory
that I ever thought

537
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:48,789
was important enough to hold on to.

538
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:53,957
A lot of memories.

539
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,415
You thirsty or anything?

540
00:36:59,665 --> 00:37:00,665
A little.

541
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:02,017
You?

542
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:07,032
I'm fine.

543
00:37:08,004 --> 00:37:10,554
Let me get you
something to drink, okay?

544
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:53,854
<i>I just wanted to say thank you.</i>

545
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:56,231
I don't know how you did it.

546
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,599
Not following.

547
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,527
We found Logan's body out
by the old Fell warehouse.

548
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,295
<i>It's been disposed of.</i>

549
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:04,265
<i>He was hoarding victims,</i>

550
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,575
- <i>innocent victims.</i>
- What?

551
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,593
This town owes you so much.

552
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,521
So do I.

553
