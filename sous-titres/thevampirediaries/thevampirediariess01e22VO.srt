Damon: Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:04,553
Stefan: For over a century,
I have lived in secret

3
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:06,412
until now. I know the risk.

4
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:07,634
But I have to know her.

5
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,460
Elena... She's a dead ringer
for Katherine.

6
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:11,695
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.

7
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,232
But Damon does.
And you're gonna get it for me.

8
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:15,799
I'm not gonna give
the device to Isobel

9
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:18,002
so she can give it to John who's
gonna turn around and kill me.

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,604
But it'll be useless Bonnie
can take the spell off.

11
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,476
You took a risk with Damon.

12
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:27,977
How did you know that he was
going to give it to me?

13
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,946
'Cause he's in love with you.

14
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:34,984
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.

15
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:36,453
It wasn't right.

16
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,256
But when Elena finds out...

17
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:42,158
She's never going to forgive me.

18
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:15,189
Ow. This dress hurts.

19
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,791
Suck it in, baby.

[Indistinct chattering]

22
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:29,168
Mrs. Lockwood: No, no, no, no.

23
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:30,769
This lineup is all wrong.

24
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:33,506
The marching band should be
in front of the historical society.

25
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:35,174
Matt, time to get on your float.

26
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:39,145
Boys, I asked you to put the
chair on the founder's float.

27
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:41,981
Ladies, time to get on your float.

28
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,350
Look at you, all retro.

29
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:46,951
What are you doing here?

30
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,987
Why wouldn't I be here?

31
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,788
Bonnie deactivated
the Gilbert invention.

32
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:54,593
Isobel's gone. Heh.
And it's Founder's Day.

33
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,730
I'm here to eat cotton
candy and steal your girl.

34
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,465
- Don't start with me, Damon.
- Oh, you started it, Stefan,

35
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:04,301
with that whole "I'm insecure,
leave Elena alone" speech.

36
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,570
I'm just enjoying that.

37
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:08,405
As long as you heard it.

38
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:10,007
Huh? What?

39
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,708
[Chuckles]

40
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,710
You have no sense of humor, Stefan.

41
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:17,313
Actually, I just have no sens
of Damon humor.

42
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:19,449
Damon humor... Hey, look.

43
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:20,850
I get it. I get it.

44
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,785
I'm the better, hotter,
superior choice,

45
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,054
and you're scared now that
Katherine's out of the picture

46
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:27,290
that I'm gonna turn
all my attention to Elena.

47
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:30,360
But don't worry.
Elena is not Katherine.

48
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:33,228
You're right. She's not.

Look at you.

52
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,075
Heh. I know, it's stupid, huh?

53
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:23,977
I'm part of the parade.
But how are you?

54
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:26,046
I've been... I've been so worried,

55
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:28,382
and I feel awful.

56
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,950
Why?

57
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:33,387
You didn't kill my mother.
Your Uncle did.

58
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,556
Are you sure it was him?

59
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,524
Who else would have done it?

60
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,895
He doesn't understand, Anna.
It's who he is.

61
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,797
He hates all vampires.

62
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:46,366
He's just doing what
he thinks is right.

63
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,301
Are you defending him?

64
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:51,105
No. No way.

65
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:52,671
It's just...

66
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,208
I do understand where he's coming from.

67
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,309
He's convinced all the tomb vampires

68
00:03:57,377 --> 00:04:00,880
want revenge on this town,
and he's just...

69
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,882
He's trying to protect it.

70
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,218
They do want revenge.

71
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,120
Or, at least, they did.

72
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:10,088
But that's why we separated from them.

73
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:14,392
My mom wasn't after revenge.
She just wanted her life back.

74
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:18,630
I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.

75
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,698
You're leaving?

76
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:24,034
But I've been thinking.
You could come with me.

77
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:26,871
I could turn you. I mean,
you said you wanted me to.

78
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:29,073
Here.

79
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,108
It's my blood.

80
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:33,844
If you die with it in your system,
you'll come back.

81
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,149
- Anna...
- I know you,

82
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,949
what it's like for you...

83
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:42,852
Being alone, always feeling
empty inside,

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,821
no one to understand.

85
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,391
But when you're a vampire,
you don't have to feel that way.

86
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,559
You can shut it off.

87
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,295
I can show you how.

88
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,067
I wanted to. I did.

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,708
But I don't think I can.

90
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,011
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:16,650
John?

92
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,686
Is... is that even possible?

93
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:22,323
Well, there's no proof, but he dated
Isobel when she was a teenager,

94
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,326
and he was the one who brought her
to your dad's office for the delivery.

95
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,994
My who life, I've never liked this man.

96
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,362
I...

97
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,531
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

98
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,433
I wanted to tell you before
Damon dropped it on you

99
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,135
in some typically inappropriate way.

100
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:38,104
No, I'm happy that
you told me. I just...

101
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,241
I really hope that it's not true.

102
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,410
What am I supposed to do?
Do I just...

103
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,281
Confront him and say,
"Are you my biological father?"

104
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,051
I guess when you're ready.

105
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,486
I'm never gonna be ready.

106
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,224
Stefan, I have enough problems with
the family that I actually care about.

107
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,492
Jeremy hates me, and why wouldn't he?

108
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,728
My journal gave him
every single reason to.

109
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:05,663
He's just hurt. He's confused.

110
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,798
He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki,

111
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,901
for taking away his memory,
for lying to him.

112
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,737
He's your brother.
He'll forgive you.

113
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,973
Just give him some time.

114
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,574
Bonnie: - Say cheese.
- Wait. Hide your cast.

115
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:20,443
- It's not era-appropriate.
- Seriously?

116
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,812
- Yes. [giggles]
- Ok. All right.

117
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,416

I want one with Bonnie now.

118
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:27,885
Here, I can take it.

119
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:32,288
I'll be on the float.

120
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,622
Uhh.

121
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,624
I said I was sorry.

122
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:38,827
You made out with his mother,
and then you beat him to a pulp.

123
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:42,331
You're gonna have to do a
little bit better than sorry.

124
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:45,501
Elena: Jeremy.

125
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:47,736
Heh. I was wondering where you were.

126
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,237
You look great.

127
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:51,072
You guys did a really
great job on the float.

128
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,041
- Go away, Elena.
- Jeremy, come on, please.

129
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:55,476
I don't want it to be
like this between us.

130
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,712
Why don't you have Damon
erase my memory again?

131
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,548
Then I can go back to being
your in-the-dark little brother.

132
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,284
Jerry, please.

133
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:04,919
Just don't.

134
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,320
You won't fix this that easily.

135
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:10,057
Something like this
doesn't just get fixed.

136

148
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,563
What do you want?

149
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,532
Just watching the parade.

150
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,302
- Where are you going?
- Away from you.

151
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,769
I want to say something to you.

152
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:37,272
- Just leave me alone.
- Thank you.

153
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,574
The device that Emily spelled
could have killed me.

154
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:43,744
I don't take what you
did lightly, so...

155
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:45,480
Thank you.

156
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:49,317
- I did it for Elena.
- I know that.

157
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,386
But I'm still very grateful.

158
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:53,454
And...

159
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,689
I owe you.

00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,594
Enjoy the parade.

00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:09,403
Mrs. Lockwood: Let's hear it for the
Mystic Falls High School football team.

162
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,938
All right! Let's show them
our support, everybody.

163
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,947
This is the key.

164
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,017
Once inserted,
the device will be activated.

165
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:28,087
It will work only once for an
estimated time of 5 minutes.

166
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,688
Mayor Lockwood:
Yes. How does it work?

167
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:32,357
It's a high-pitched frequency
that humans can't hear...

168
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,627
Any vampire within a 5-block
radius will be incapacitated,

169
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:37,195
exposing them.

170
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:39,229
At that time,
the sheriff's V5 deputies

171
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,165
will inject them with vervain
and bring them here,

172
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,667
where we'll finish them off.

173
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,569
And you're certain
they're attacking tonight?

174
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,071
I had a source. One of the
vampires from the tomb...

175
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,573
He confirmed the attack.

Man: Everybody listen up.

177
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:53,210
The plan stays the same.

178
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,045
We wait till the fireworks start.

179
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:57,080
Until then, blend in.

180

Stay a part of the celebration.

181
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,817
They'll never see us coming.

182
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:04,420
They want revenge for what
our ancestors did in 1864,

183
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,155
which makes us their targets.

184
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,024
This area here is the stage.

185
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,659
This is where the founding
families are gonna be.

186
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,462
Any questions?

187
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,497
We're taking an enormous risk.

188
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:18,166
We're talking about our families, John.

What are you doing here?

191
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,043
It's the only way to draw
them out and kill them...

192
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,112
All of them.

193
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,033
I like you better like this.

194

The period look, it...

195
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:52,369
didn't suit you.

196
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,706
Is that an insult?

197
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,308
Actually, Elena, is a compliment

198
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,376
of the highest order.

199
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:04,348
Look, I know Stefan is worried

200
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,484
about our friendship.

201
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:08,318
Did he mention something to you, too?

202
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:10,687
No. Did he mention something to you?

203
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:13,323
No. Nothing worth repeating.

204
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,959
So, I think you should stop
with the flirty little comments

205
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,794
and that eye thing that you do.

206
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:19,863

I don't believe that we can't fix this.

211
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:46,287
I lied. I was wrong.

212
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,790
But you're my brother, Jer,
and I love you.

213
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,725
And I have to fix it.

214
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,227
So, just tell me.
What can I do?

215
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,699

I have so many emotions,

- You dick.

You do not talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.

And from now on, don't talk to
your sister that way, either.

Cut her some slack.

She erased my memories.

No, I did.

226
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,171
She was protecting you.

227
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:42,240

She was a threat to you,

I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.

- Well, see, Damon,

to do the right thing
for nothing in return.

- Liz, we need to do this.

We have no choice. This is the reason
for the secret council.

Our founding fathers created the
secret council for just this purpose.

I'm the sheriff. It's my call.

are planning an attack tonight.

with tomb vampires.

What's the matter?

00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,259
- That noise.

Take this. Go. Go. Go!

I don't know what happened.
He just dropped.

370
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:54,093
He's not the only one. Cops are grabbing
everyone who's gone down,

371
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:56,763
- injecting them with vervain.
- What?

372
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,867
They're rounding up the vampires.

373

Please help him.

The device is done.

382

The only thing keeping
them down is the vervain.

We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.

and then it just stopped.

393
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:23,129
I saw at least 5 vampires go down.

394
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,430
They were taking them to
your family's old building.

395

It's the Gilbert device.
It has to be.

But how did he get it to work?

397

Bonnie unspelled it.

398
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:35,174
Maybe she didn't.

399
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,041
She did. We saw her do it.

No, no, no. He's right.
Think about it.

401
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:42,446
We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device

402
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:44,783
that could protect
people against vampires.

403
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,651
So we could protect you.

him since this started.

No, really.

531
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:33,471
Look...

532
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:36,907
I know you think you took it away,

533
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:40,143
but it's still there.

534
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:42,713
Even if I can't remember why,

535
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:45,249
I still feel empty.

536
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:47,217
Alone.

537
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:53,423
And making me forget won't fix it.

538
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:56,526
It won't fix what's really wrong.

539
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:06,301
What I did to Vicki

540
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,037
was wrong.

541
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,674
Sorry for my part.

542
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:21,516
Anna said that vampires
don't have to feel pain.

543
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:25,219
That they could turn it off
if they shut out their humanity.

544
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:29,323
That's very true.

545
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,426
Is it easier that way?

546
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,361
Is what easier?

547
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,831
[Scoffs] Life.

548
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:40,133
Life sucks either way, Jeremy.

549
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:43,437
At least if you're a vampire,

550
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,639
you don't have to feel bad
about it if you don't want to.

551
00:32:45,706 --> 00:32:47,674
Is that what you did?

552
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:49,609
I did it for...

553
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:53,012
I did it for a very long time.

554
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:58,517
And life was a lot easier.

[Crickets chirping]

556
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:11,529
Hey, man.

557
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,032
I'm so sorry.

558
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,435
Look, I don't even know what happened.

559
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:20,472
It's ok, man.

560
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,040
Alright.

What's happening?
Is she all right?

562
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:37,988
Oh, there was some internal bleeding.

563
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:39,189
We're taking her into surgery.

564
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:40,757
What else did they say?

565
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:41,791
Is she going to be ok?

566
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,927
They're going to do
everything they can.

567
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:52,768
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?

568
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:56,238
I left her message
telling her I was here.

569
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,139
You need to call her.

570
00:33:58,207 --> 00:33:59,941
What is it?

571
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:03,745
It's your dad.

you just missed Elena.

576

I was looking for you, actually.

Oh.

00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:14,411
Elena is my best friend.

579
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:16,646
And because she loves you,

580
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,349
I couldn't let you or Damon
die in that fire.

581
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,750
I'm very grateful, Bonnie.

582
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,119
I hope you know that.

583
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:25,455
I do. But I hope you know
that things have to change.

00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,491
Damon has to change.

585

We both want the same thing.

We both want to protect
the people we care about.

The difference is, for you,

00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,601
Damon is one of them.

589
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,604
You saw what I was able to do tonight.

590
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,040
I know who I am now.

591
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:48,044
And if Damon spills so much as one drop

592
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:53,115
of innocent blood, I'll take him down.

Let's hope it doesn't.

What are you doing here?

597
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:30,517
A failed and feeble attempt
at doing the right thing.

Which was...

It's not important.

Tonight I...

found myself wanting to protect it.

How does that happen?

It's not in me.

every reason to hate me,

Why do you sou so surprised?

Because she did it for you.

Which means that
somewhere along the way,

You know, I first met Isobel
when I was a teenager.

I fell in love with her instantly,

634

although I'm pretty sure

635

she never loved me.

She was special.

And part of why I hate
the vampires so much

638
00:39:56,913 --> 00:39:58,346
is because what she became.

How it ruined her.
