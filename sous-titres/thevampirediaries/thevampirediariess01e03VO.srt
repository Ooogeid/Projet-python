1
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,713
Good morning.

2
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,550
Please... Don't.

3
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:17,136
Don't do that.

4
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:27,897
Get away from me!

5
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:31,726
This could have gone
a completely different way.

6
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,326
Mystic Falls Team
1x03 - Friday Night Bites

7
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:43,680
Croutch, Humanidyne,

8
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:44,883
Illyria, McFly,

9
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,316
MiniBen314, Thirteen,

10
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,291
WoLF971

11
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,281
I'm not saying don't date the guy.
I'm just saying take it slow.

12
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:00,763
You were the one
who said to go for it.

13
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,831
Now I'm saying take it slow.

14
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,190
- Why the about-face?
- It's not an about-face.

15
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:08,062
You're single for the first time
in your entire high school career.

16
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,141
It's the perfect
time to play the field.

17
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,351
Because I'm so that girl.

18
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,945
- Seriously, what are you not saying?
- It's stupid.

19
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,488
- What?
- Spit it out.

20
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,710
I accidentally touched Stefan

21
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,785
and got a really bad feeling.

22
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:25,734
Is that it?

23
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,498
It was bad bad!

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,951
Is the whole witch mojo thing again?

25
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,980
You know what? I'm just concerned.

26
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:35,501
This is me expressing concern
about my best friend's new boyfriend.

27
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:38,259
And I love you for it, I do.

28
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,727
But I feel good.

29
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:44,265
It's been a hard year,
and I'm starting to kind of feel like

30
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,588
things are getting back
to normal again.

31
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:49,663
And you know what?
Stefan is a big part of that.

32
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,235
I rock. I scored 2 tickets

33
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,609
to the Posers saturday night.
They're playing at the Rat.

34
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,384
You and Tyler have fun.

35
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,910
Don't be like that.
Come on. I want you to go.

36
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,199
You're not worried everyone's going to
know you're screwing the stoner geek?

37
00:04:08,324 --> 00:04:09,920
Wait... everyone already knows.

38
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,592
But it's not
like that anymore, so...

39
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:14,628
now we can be friends and just hang.

40
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,626
Tell me something, was it the drugs?

41
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,757
Were you sleeping with me
because of the drugs?

42
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:20,593
Screw you.

43
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,911
No, if there's another reason,
please, I'm all ears.

44
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,144
Good morning, Elena.

45
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:34,773
Good morning, Bonnie.
I gotta find Caroline.

46
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:37,294
She's not answering her phone.

47
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:40,096
- So I'll see you, guys.
- Bonnie, wait...

48
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,700
She doesn't like me very much.

49
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:48,261
She doesn't know you.
She's my best friend.

50
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,789
She's just looking out for me.
But when she does,

51
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:53,062
She will love you.

52
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,168
Look,

53
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,128
there's Elena and her new boyfriend.

54
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,255
What are they doing?

55
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:00,007
They're walking,

56
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,217
walking, walking.

57
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,844
Yep. Right into the sunset.

58
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,263
- You're a dick.
- While you just stand there

59
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,383
looking like one of those
little yard trolls.

60
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,358
Gnomes.

61
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,354
Here's what we're going to do.
Are you free tonight?

62
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,471
- Yes.
- Perfect.

63
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,818
Dinner, my house. 8 o'clock.
You, me, and Bonnie.

64
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,643
You two will spend some
quality time and she'll get to see

65
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:24,823
what a great guy you are.
Mission accomplished.

66
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:29,828
What am I supposed to do, Ty?
She made her choice.

67
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,790
Let her know she made the wrong one.

68
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:35,292
What are you doing?
Ty, don't...

69
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:59,046
That throw was insane.
I didn't know you played football.

70
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:01,421
I used to.
It was a long time ago.

71
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:04,297
So why don't you try out
for the team?

72
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,240
Yeah, I don't think so.

73
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:10,030
- So you don't like football?
- No, I love football.

74
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:12,871
I think it's a great sport.
But in this case,

75
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,457
I don't think football likes me.

76
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:19,738
You saw Tyler over there,
and we both know how Matt feels.

77
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:23,055
They don't know you.
To them, you're mysterious loner guy.

78
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,593
Wouldn't hurt to be part of.
Make some friends.

79
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,555
Says the girl who spends
her alone time writing in a cemetery.

80
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:34,935
Come on. There's more to me than just
gloomy graveyard girl.

81
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,022
There's a whole other Elena
that you have yet to meet.

82
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,859
She was into everything, very busy.

83
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,840
I look forward to meeting her.

84
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,390
And when will that be?

85
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:44,315
Soon.

86
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:46,414
She's working on it.

87
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,324
World War II ended in...

88
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,142
Anyone got anything?

89
00:06:58,092 --> 00:06:59,041
1945.

90
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,962
FYI, our team sucks.
They could use you.

91
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,089
- Pearl harbor.
- Can't.

92
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:05,507
I'm a loner.

93
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:07,682
Miss Gilbert?

94
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,495
Pearl harbor?

95
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,803
December 7th, 1941.

96
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:15,601
Thank you, Miss Gilbert.

97
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:18,248
Anytime.

98
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,245
Very well.

99
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:23,150
- The fall of the Berlin Wall.
- 1989.

100
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:25,110
I'm good with dates, sir.

101
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,411
Are you?

102
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,097
How good?

103
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,069
Keep it to the year.

104
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,351
Civil rights act.

105
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:34,996
1964.

106
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:39,625
- John F. Kennedy assassination.
- 1963.

107
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,169
- Martin luther king.
- 68.

108
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,962
- Lincoln.
- 1865.

109
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,964
- Roe vs. Wade.
- 1973.

110
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,050
- Brown vs. Board.
- 1954.

111
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,302
- The battle of Gettysburg.
- 1863.

112
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,971
- Korean War.
- 1950 to 1953.

113
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,390
It ended in 52.

114
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,727
Actually, sir,

115
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:00,588
It was 53.

116
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,991
Look it up, somebody.

117
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:08,888
Quickly.

118
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:10,823
It was 19...

119
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,990
53.

120
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,337
How did you know all of that?

121
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,836
Years and years
of crossword puzzles. It's...

122
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,161
a loner thing.

123
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,923
Nice job! Nice job!

124
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:39,768
Mr. Lockwood, is there
anything you're good at?

125
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,480
Cause it isn't history, and it sure
as hell isn't defending the ball!

126
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,774
- Yes, coach.
- Now do it again!

127
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,642
Oh, my God! You're here!

128
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,845
Yep. I can't be sad girl forever.

129
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,235
The only way to get things
back to the way they were

130
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,798
are to do things that were.

131
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:21,560
- And you're coming to dinner tonight.
- I am?

132
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,328
You and me and Stefan.

133
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,513
You have to give him a chance.

134
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:27,983
Tonight's no good.

135
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:31,256
Have you seen Caroline?
I texted her like a hundred times.

136
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,322
Don't change the subject,
Bonnie Bennett.

137
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,240
You're going to be there.

138
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,659
Fine. I'll go.

139
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:38,827
Good.

140
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:41,201
Varsity trials were last spring,
Mr. Salvatore.

141
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:42,785
I wasn't here then, sir.

142
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,275
And you're not here now,
as far as I'm concerned.

143
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,295
I realize that you and I didn't
get off to the best start, and...

144
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,965
I want to apologize for that.

145
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:56,178
I've played football before. Wide
receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good.

146
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,266
Well, I won't be asking you
who won the super bowl in 71.

147
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,809
'71 was the...

148
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:06,480
Sorry. I understand that, sir.

149
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:09,858
Just to see you
get knocked on your ass.

150
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,720
Borrow some gear.

151
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,323
Go! Before I change my mind.
Let's run it again!

152
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,036
First my girlfriend, now the team?

153
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,114
Dude, this is an opportunity.

154
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:26,959
Football's a contact sport.
Sometimes people get hurt.

155
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:32,267
Seriously, where is Caroline?

156
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:34,424
I don't know.
It's not like her.

157
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,794
Try her again.

158
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,700
Oh, my God.

159
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:50,175
That must be the mystery guy
from the Grill.

160
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,985
That's not a mystery guy.
That's Damon Salvatore.

161
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:55,105
Salvatore, as in Stefan?

162
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:02,327
I got the other brother.
Hope you don't mind.

163
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,964
Sorry I'm late, girls.

164
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:05,330
I was busy.

165
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:10,544
All right, let's start with the double
pike herkey hurdler, what do you say?

166
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,204
1, 2, 3, 4,

167
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,719
5, 6, 7, 8.

168
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,595
1, 2, 3, 4,

169
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,097
5, 6, 7, 8.

170
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,312
Elena, sweetie,
why don't you just observe today?

171
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:29,641
Okay?

172
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,260
Keep going! Okay.
Do it again from the top.

173
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:44,161
Blue lady!

174
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:45,986
Blue lady!

175
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,749
Set, hut! Go!

176
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,172
Come on, Tyler, cover it!

177
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:00,589
Get it.

178
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:04,696
Line up!

179
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:59,347
I hate to say it,
but he's got skills.

180
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:01,317
<i>I think he needs a buddy pass.</i>

181
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:02,292
<i>Really?</i>

182
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,189
<i>You don't get to walk on the field</i>

183
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:06,425
<i>and act like you own
the place after 5 minutes.</i>

184
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,774
Just hang one up there
and I'll take care of the rest.

185
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:09,999
Do it again.

186
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,359
All right, let's huddle up.

187
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:13,892
Set, hut!

188
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:26,555
Welcome to the team, buddy.

189
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,600
You gonna live, Salvatore?

190
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,979
- Yeah.
- Walk it off, son.

191
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:38,767
That was my bad.

192
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:40,552
It's all right.

193
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,216
How were tryouts?
Did you make the team?

194
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,577
Very Emerson, the way you...

195
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,033
reveal your soul with so many...

196
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:11,099
Adjectives.

197
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:14,854
What are you doing here?

198
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,505
I've come to apologize.

199
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,610
I've been doing some thinking,
some...

200
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,789
soul searching, and...

201
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:27,045
I want us to start over.

202
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,409
We need to put the past behind us.

203
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:32,216
You're my little brother,

204
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:33,991
And if you want to live

205
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:36,249
A normal, happy human life,

206
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,418
Then I want that for you.

207
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,545
Maybe I can do it, too.

208
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,476
That I can learn to be a non-living

209
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:45,287
Living person.

210
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:49,554
Maybe there's hope for both of us.

211
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:02,359
You know, it doesn't have
to be this way, Damon.

212
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,252
Of course it doesn't.

213
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,448
I saw Elena today, btw.
That means "by the way."

214
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,408
She was at cheerleading practice.

215
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,210
She looked so...

216
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,510
perky in her little...

217
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,592
short shorts. Just...

218
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:20,641
Simmer down,
I didn't even go near her.

219
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:23,252
I've got my own cheerleader now.

220
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,027
That reminds me... I gotta run.

221
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:26,352
I have a date.

222
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,067
Sweaty palms.

223
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:29,794
Wish me luck.

224
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:37,216
You explain it. Last night,
I'm watching Nine-O,

225
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:39,104
a commercial breaks come on
and I'm like,

226
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,611
I bet it's that phone commercial.
And sure enough,

227
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,632
it's that guy and the girl
with the bench,

228
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:45,557
He flies to Paris and he flies back.

229
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,195
- They take a picture.
- Come on.

230
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,566
That commercial's
on a constant loop.

231
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:51,541
Fine. Well, how about this?

232
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,204
Today I'm obsessed with numbers.

233
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:57,880
Three numbers.
I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22.

234
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:00,294
How weird is that?

235
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,551
Maybe we should play the lottery.

236
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,235
- Have you talked to your grams?
- She's just gonna say

237
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,602
it's because I'm a witch.
I don't want to be a witch.

238
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,172
- Do you want to be a witch?
- I don't want to be a witch.

239
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:14,598
And putting it in a nice bowl
isn't fooling anybody.

240
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,947
Okay, serving spoons.
Where are the serving spoons?

241
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:19,603
Little drawer on your left.

242
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:32,282
So you've been in this
kitchen like a thousand times.

243
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,750
Yeah, that's it.

244
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:39,751
He's here. Don't be nervous.
Just be your normal loving self.

245
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:47,108
Birthday candles.

246
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,033
Did Tanner give you
a hard time today?

247
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:09,551
Well, he let me on the team, so...

248
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:11,934
I must have done something right.

249
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:14,263
Bonnie, you should have
seen Stefan today.

250
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:17,123
- Tyler threw a ball right at him...
- Yeah, I heard.

251
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:25,293
Why don't you tell Stefan
about your family?

252
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,304
Divorced. No mom.
Live with my dad.

253
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,817
No, about the witches.

254
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:37,013
Bonnie's family has a lineage
of witches. It's really cool.

255
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,081
Cool isn't the word I'd use.

256
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:42,620
Well, it's certainly interesting.
I'm not...

257
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:45,995
too versed, but I do know
that there's a history of...

258
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,650
Celtic druids
that migrated here in the 1800s.

259
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,868
My family came by way of Salem.

260
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:51,843
Really?

261
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,147
Salem witches?

262
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,064
I would say that's pretty cool.

263
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:59,703
Really? Why?

264
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,371
Salem witches are...

265
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:03,719
heroic examples of

266
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,417
individualism

267
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,960
and nonconformity.

268
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,800
Yeah, they are.

269
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:17,502
I wonder who that could be.

270
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,558
Surprise!

271
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:25,061
Bonnie said you were doing dinner,
so we brought dessert.

272
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:26,926
Hope you don't mind.

273
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:33,737
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for Elena to invite me in.

274
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,206
He can't...

275
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,370
He can't stay.

276
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:42,359
Can you, Damon?

277
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:45,365
Get in here.

278
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,460
We're just... finishing up.

279
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,211
It's fine. Just come on in.

280
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:02,725
You have a beautiful home, Elena.

281
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,373
Thank you.

282
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,608
I cannot believe that
Mr. Tanner let you on the team.

283
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,780
Tyler must be sealing.

284
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,088
But good for you.
Go for it.

285
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:18,364
That's what I always tell him.
You have to engage.

286
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,938
You can't just sit there and wait
for life to come to you.

287
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:23,620
- You have to go get it.
- Elena wasn't so lucky today.

288
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,664
It's only because you missed summer
camp. I don't know how you're ever

289
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:29,768
- going to learn the routines.
- I'll work with her. She'll get it.

290
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,931
I guess we can put her in the back.

291
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:33,797
You don't seem like the...

292
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,590
cheerleader type.

293
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:38,843
It's just 'cause her parents died.
Yeah, I mean,

294
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,465
she's just totally going through
a blah phase.

295
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,946
She used to be way more fun.

296
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,599
And I say that with
complete sensitivity.

297
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:51,924
I'm sorry, Elena.
I know what it's like

298
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,323
to lose both your parents.
In fact, Stefan and I

299
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:57,529
have watched almost every single
person we've ever cared about die.

300
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,781
We don't need to get into
that right now.

301
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,033
You know what, you're right, Stef.
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:05,274
The last thing I wanted to do
was bring her up.

303
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:14,420
Don't do that.
Not while I'm working.

304
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,752
I'll see you later.

305
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,896
She's my sister
and I love her, but...

306
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,170
sometimes she can really
make you work for it.

307
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,581
I find it pretty easy.

308
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:48,621
I get it. Hitting me to impress her.

309
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,398
That's real nice.

310
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,667
I don't need to impress her.

311
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:54,342
I already won.

312
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,505
- Now you're dead.
- Am I?

313
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,356
Cause it seems like I'm standing
here waiting for you to man up.

314
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:01,481
Ty, don't!

315
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:03,553
The next time I see you, Gilbert...

316
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,421
No, next time I see you.

317
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,360
What are you doing, Vick?

318
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:17,122
One more.

319
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,041
Thank you.

320
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:24,168
Nice save.

321
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:26,565
I like you.

322
00:21:27,074 --> 00:21:28,674
You know how to laugh.

323
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:30,579
And you make Stefan smile,

324
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:33,330
which is something
I haven't seen in a very long time.

325
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:38,338
Earlier, did you mean... Katherine?

326
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,216
How did she die?

327
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:46,095
In a fire... Tragic fire.

328
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:47,941
Recently?

329
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:50,703
It seems like it was yesterday.

330
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,646
What was she like?

331
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,568
She was beautiful.
A lot like you in that department.

332
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,446
She was just very complicated and...

333
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:06,908
selfish and at times not very kind,
But very sexy and seductive.

334
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:10,906
So which one of you dated her first?

335
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:16,269
Nicely deduced.

336
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,341
Ask Stefan.

337
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,838
I'm sure his answer
differs from mine.

338
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,140
I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.

339
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:35,395
Why do you say that?

340
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,772
I saw you at practice.
You looked miserable.

341
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,473
You saw that?

342
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:43,569
I used to love it.
It was fun.

343
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,544
Things are different this year.

344
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:47,747
Everything that used
to matter doesn't anymore.

345
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:49,694
So don't let it. Quit, move on.

346
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:51,077
Problem solved.

347
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:54,948
Some things could matter again.

348
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:55,873
Maybe.

349
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:57,048
But...

350
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,211
Seems a little unrealistic to me.

351
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:06,968
I'm sorry.

352
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:10,805
About Katherine.

353
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,625
You lost her, too.

354
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:22,054
Need some help?

355
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:24,978
Sure, why not?

356
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,239
Matt tries, but he's just
having a really hard time.

357
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,324
You have to understand that

358
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,794
they were each other's first.
You know, like,

359
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,269
from the sandbox.

360
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:40,218
That's a really nice scarf.

361
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:42,924
- Thank you, it's new.
- Can I see it?

362
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,174
I mean, would you mind
taking it off?

363
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:47,467
I can't.

364
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:48,535
Why not?

365
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,303
You okay?

366
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,605
All I know is that
I can't take it off.

367
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,437
What are you two kids talking about?

368
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:02,364
I was just commenting on her scarf.

369
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:06,389
Hey, you know... Elena and Bonnie
are finishing up the dishes.

370
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:08,326
Why don't you go
see if you can help?

371
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:10,451
Does it look like I do dishes?

372
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:12,568
For me?

373
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:15,735
I don't think so.

374
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:23,586
Go see if Elena needs
help in the kitchen.

375
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,760
You know what?

376
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:28,601
I'm gonna go see if Elena
needs some help in the kitchen.

377
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:29,526
Great.

378
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,502
They are people, Damon.

379
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:43,592
She's not a puppet.
She doesn't exist for your amusement,

380
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:45,803
for you to feed on
whenever you want to.

381
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,828
Sure she does.
They all do.

382
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,119
They're whatever I want them to be.
They're mine for the taking.

383
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:53,570
All right, you've had your fun.
You used Caroline,

384
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:55,686
you got to me and Elena,
good for you.

385
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:57,711
Now it's time for you to go.

386
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:59,555
That's not a problem.

387
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:00,901
Because...

388
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,417
I've been invited in,

389
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:06,337
And I'll come back tomorrow night
And the following night

390
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,705
And I'll do...

391
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:09,757
with your little cheerleader

392
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:12,135
Whatever I want to do.

393
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:15,346
Because that is
what is normal to me.

394
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,530
Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.

395
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,634
That makes one of us.

396
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:31,347
Come on. Your brother isn't as bad
as you make him out to be...

397
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:02,796
<i>There must be a shred of humanity
left inside my brother.</i>

398
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:04,725
<i>Somewhere.</i>

399
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,824
<i>I keep hoping.</i>

400
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,675
<i>But how do I make him see it?</i>

401
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,620
<i>And how do I protect her?</i>

402
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,559
Look at you.
You look hot in your Jersey.

403
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,660
What happened? No more cheerleader?

404
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,435
I quit.
I'm a quitter.

405
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,258
Hey, you're not a quitter.

406
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,943
You suffered a great loss.
You're not the same person.

407
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:02,263
You should be looking ahead.

408
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,763
You should be starting over. Okay?

409
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,711
I hope you don't think this is

410
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:11,786
too soon or too weird, but...

411
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,701
I wanted you to have this.

412
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:24,201
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

413
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,527
It's something that
I've had forever, and...

414
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:29,316
I've never wanted to
give it to anyone until now.

415
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,126
I'd very much like it if you'd...

416
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:33,457
wear it

417
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:34,879
for me, for...

418
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:37,012
good luck.

419
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:40,206
Is that rose that I smell?

420
00:28:40,961 --> 00:28:42,111
It's an herb.

421
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:43,721
It's nice?

422
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:45,332
I love it.

423
00:28:48,906 --> 00:28:49,706
And...

424
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:52,042
I wanted to thank you

425
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:55,246
for pushing me
to try out for the team.

426
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:59,281
- It feels really good.
- We're a pair.

427
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:00,905
I quit, you start.

428
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:02,194
Right.

429
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:04,872
We're a work in progress.

430
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,994
We'll figure it out.

431
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:23,174
And you're not in uniform because...

432
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:52,146
Wait, wait, wait...

433
00:29:56,671 --> 00:30:00,297
Let's be honest here. In the past,
we used to let other teams

434
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,841
come into our town

435
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,659
and roll right over us!

436
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:08,180
But that is about to change.

437
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,645
We've got some great new talent
tonight starting on the offensive line,

438
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:18,436
and I'm gonna tell you right now,
It has been a long time

439
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:20,401
since I have seen a kid like this

440
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,169
with hands like these.

441
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:32,329
This blows. He can't start the guy.
He just got here.

442
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,513
<i>That have been waiting for us
to put a check in the win column,</i>

443
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:39,088
<i>I have only one thing
to say to you...</i>

444
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,511
your timberwolves are hungry.

445
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,816
- Hey, you. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

446
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:51,613
Is that Jeremy?

447
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:55,637
What do you care?

448
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:57,465
Don't look so down.

449
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,149
You can have her when I'm done.

450
00:31:04,193 --> 00:31:05,654
Tyler, stop it!

451
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,494
Stop, you're hurting him!

452
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,340
Tyler, stop!

453
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,419
Stop it! Tyler, stop!

454
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,237
Hey, he's down! Enough!

455
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,725
- Ty, enough!
- Get off me!

456
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:38,354
What the hell, Jeremy?

457
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:41,607
- Put your head up, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine!

458
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,425
- Yeah, you smell fine.
- Just stop, okay?

459
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,030
Come on, man.
Come on.

460
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,798
Oh, my God, your hand.

461
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,134
- It's fine.
- Is it deep? How bad is it?

462
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:54,808
Come on!

463
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:01,752
- But... I saw it, it was...
- He missed.

464
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,704
It's not my blood.

465
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,185
See? I'm fine.

466
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,509
I saw it. The glass
cut your hand. It was...

467
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:10,062
I'm okay.

468
00:32:11,689 --> 00:32:13,681
It's almost kick-off time,
all right? So...

469
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:16,141
I'll see you after the game.

470
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:28,070
Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly.
Can you stand straight, please?

471
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,818
Could someone please help Tiki?

472
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:32,915
- Where you been?
- Can I ask you a question

473
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,369
and you give me a really
serious no-joke response?

474
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,087
- Of course. What is it?
- The bad mojo.

475
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:40,807
When you touched Stefan
and you had that reaction...

476
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:43,596
You know what, forget I said that.
Your little dinner party plot

477
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:46,335
- totally won me over.
- No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it?

478
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,360
Did you see something, or...

479
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:53,387
It wasn't clear like a picture.
Like today,

480
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,204
I keep seeing those same numbers
I told you about...

481
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:58,017
Eight, fourteen, twenty-two.

482
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,020
When I touched Stefan,
it was a feeling.

483
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,187
And it vibrated through me,
and it was cold,

484
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:05,541
and it...

485
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:07,526
And what?

486
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:09,778
It was death.

487
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,157
It's what I imagine
death to be like.

488
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,173
You scared me.
What are you doing here?

489
00:33:30,336 --> 00:33:33,273
- I'm hiding from Caroline.
- And why is that?

490
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:36,472
- I needed a break.
- She talks more than I can listen.

491
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:38,641
That could be a sign.

492
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:40,939
Well, she's awfully young.

493
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:43,064
Not much younger than you are.

494
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,661
I don't see it going anywhere
in the bigger picture.

495
00:33:47,786 --> 00:33:50,361
- I think she'd drive me crazy.
- Caroline does have

496
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,877
some really annoying traits,
but we've been friends

497
00:33:53,002 --> 00:33:55,562
since the first grade
and that means something to me.

498
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:58,737
Duly noted. I'm sorry
if I make you uncomfortable.

499
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,562
That's not my intention.

500
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:02,398
Yes, it is.

501
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:03,916
Otherwise you

502
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:07,419
wouldn't put an alternate meaning
behind everything you say.

503
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:11,513
You're right.

504
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,885
I do have other intentions,
but so do you.

505
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:16,518
Really?

506
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:18,706
I see 'em.

507
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:23,145
- You want me.
- Excuse me?

508
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,813
I get to you.
You find yourself drawn to me.

509
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,599
You think about me even when
you don't want to think about me.

510
00:34:28,724 --> 00:34:30,317
I bet you even dreamed about me.

511
00:34:32,054 --> 00:34:33,354
And right now...

512
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:35,301
you want to kiss me.

513
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:44,775
What the hell?

514
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,611
I don't know what game you're
trying to play with Stefan here,

515
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:49,318
but I don't want to be part of it.

516
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:51,468
And I don't know what
happened in the past,

517
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:53,599
But let's get one thing straight...

518
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,092
I am not Katherine.

519
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:05,177
You gonna be able to play?

520
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,218
Yeah, I'm good.

521
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:09,797
What you did back there...

522
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:12,759
You had Jeremy's back.

523
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:14,901
He's a messed-up kid.

524
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:17,491
- Somebody's gotta look out for him.
- I know.

525
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:20,821
This week at practice I was a dick.

526
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:22,654
Had your reasons.

527
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:23,779
No excuse.

528
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,920
Good luck tonight.
We're lucky to have you.

529
00:35:40,284 --> 00:35:41,584
Isn't that nice?

530
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:44,171
Stefan joins a team, makes a friend.

531
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:48,094
It's all so,
"rah, rah, go team, yeah!"

532
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:50,397
Not tonight.
I'm done with you.

533
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,652
Nice trick with Elena.
Let me guess...

534
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,490
vervain in the necklace?
I admit, I was a bit surprised.

535
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,534
It's been a while since anyone
could resist my compulsion.

536
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,487
Where'd you get it?

537
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:06,856
Does it matter?

538
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:10,397
Guess I could just seduce her the
old-fashioned way. Or I could just...

539
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,075
eat her.

540
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,847
You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.

541
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:20,586
No?

542
00:36:21,485 --> 00:36:24,473
Because deep down inside,
there is a part of you

543
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,091
that feels for her.

544
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:29,193
I was worried
that you had no humanity

545
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:31,094
Left inside of you,

546
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:33,710
That you may have actually
become the monster

547
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:35,275
That you pretend to be.

548
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,998
- Who's pretending?
- Then kill me.

549
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:39,223
Well, I'm...

550
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:41,824
- I'm tempted.
- No, you're not.

551
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,232
You've had lifetimes
to do it, and yet,

552
00:36:44,357 --> 00:36:46,505
here I am. I'm still alive. And...

553
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,030
And there you are.

554
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:49,915
You're still haunting me.

555
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:53,324
After 145 years.

556
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,720
Katherine is dead.

557
00:36:57,755 --> 00:37:00,592
And you hate me
because you loved her,

558
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,929
And you torture me
because you still do.

559
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:05,644
And that,

560
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:07,678
my brother,

561
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,900
that is your humanity.

562
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:18,061
What the hell?
We've got a game to play!

563
00:37:18,675 --> 00:37:20,375
If that's my humanity...

564
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:23,199
Then what's this?

565
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:33,625
Anyone,

566
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:34,942
anytime,

567
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:36,381
any place.

568
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,314
Tanner's M.I.A. I think
he had a little bit too much beer.

569
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:44,475
Don't talk to me right now.
I'm pissed at you.

570
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,804
What's your problem?

571
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,286
You're my problem, all right?
You're a bully.

572
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:50,878
A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man.
And I'm sick of it.

573
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,519
What was that about tonight?

574
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,207
What's beating up
the new guy going to prove?

575
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:58,667
Or screwing with my sister, or
pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother.

576
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,861
Girlfriend?
I don't know how to tell you this,

577
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,613
but she dumped your ass.

578
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,007
Are you for real?!
You want to hit me?

579
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:06,283
I'm on your team.

580
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:08,509
This was over the line.

581
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,990
Even for you.

582
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,184
Somebody help!

583
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:48,645
It wasn't just for the drugs.

584
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,129
What kind of animal could be
doing all this? Why would it...

585
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:09,164
come out of the woods and attack
someone in the middle of town?

586
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:11,189
I don't know.
I don't know.

587
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,705
I was so sure that
you cut your hand.

588
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:17,823
I saw it.

589
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:20,500
I'm gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be fine, okay?

590
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:21,675
We're fine.

591
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:24,169
That's what matters.

592
00:40:40,932 --> 00:40:42,632
<i>I thought there was hope</i>

593
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,523
<i>that somewhere deep inside,</i>

594
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,570
<i>something in Damon was still human,</i>

595
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,410
<i>normal.</i>

596
00:40:58,002 --> 00:40:59,302
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

597
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:02,245
<i>There's nothing human left in Damon.</i>

598
00:41:03,307 --> 00:41:04,207
<i>No good,</i>

599
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,022
<i>no kindness.</i>

600
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:07,334
<i>No love.</i>

601
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:09,794
<i>Only a monster</i>

602
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:12,855
<i>who must be stopped.</i>

603
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:51,247
