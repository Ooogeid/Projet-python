00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,754
<i>For over a century,
I have lived in secret until now.</i>

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,942
<i>I know the risk.
But I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:08,925
Elena.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,093
That necklace contains
an herb called vervain.

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,040
It protects you
from being compelled.

7
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,348
Our love for Katherine
wasn't real, Damon.

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,142
I'm gonna bring her back.
There's a tomb underneath the church.

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,437
A spell sealed Katherine in
that tomb, protecting her.

10
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,898
- Who are you?
- A friend of Jenna's.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,861
Alaric Saltzman.
I'm your new history teacher.

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,572
Gran showed me this...
I'm a witch.

13
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,701
- His face was like...
- Are you okay?

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,151
- What's going on?
- I'm gonna tell her the truth.

15
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:41,143
I know you think that you brought
all of this bad stuff into my life.

16
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:43,417
- But my life already had it.
- This is different.

17
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,035
I know what I want.

18
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,213
I've never been in your room before.

19
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,923
This room holds every memory

20
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,259
that I ever that I thought
was important enough to hold onto.

21
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,373
Elena. It's Stefan.

22
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:02,519
I know that this picture
must have confused you.

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,630
But I can explain.

24
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,815
I need to explain.
So, please, when you get this,

25
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:10,001
call me.

26
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,631
How you doing in there?

27
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,795
You look stuck.

28
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:12,004
It's my seat belt.

29
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,844
Let me get you out of there. I want you
to put your hands on the roof.

30
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,536
Just like that.
You ready?

31
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:20,995
One...

32
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,482
two...

33
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:23,763
three...

34
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:26,115
I got you.

35
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:29,146
Are you okay?

36
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:30,691
Can you stand?

37
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,243
Anything broken?

38
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,068
You're fading fast.

39
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,472
Look at me. Focus.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,490
Look at me.

41
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:51,452
I look like her.

42
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,130
What?

43
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:05,309
Upsy-daisy.

46
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,410
<i>I found one.</i>

47
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,369
<i>After years of research and study,</i>

48
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,936
<i>there it was right in front of me.</i>

49
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,333
<i>I was terrified.</i>

50
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:32,921
<i>As I stared it in the eyes,
I drove a stake through its heart.</i>

51
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:36,155
<i>I was right about Mystic Falls.</i>

52
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,260
<i>There is evil here.
I can sense it.</i>

53
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:41,178
<i>Feel it.</i>

54
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:42,972
<i>It's everywhere.</i>

55
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,096
It's not even 7:00 yet.

56
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,409
Which means you shouldn't be
awake for at least six hours.

57
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:05,314
I hate morning people.

58
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:09,290
I'm going to be home late.

59
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,792
- I love you.
- And I love you too.

60
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,284
Morning.

61
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,579
Where are we?

62
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:51,304
Georgia.

63
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Georgia?

64
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,159
No, no. No, we're not.
Seriously, Damon. Where are we?

65
00:04:57,284 --> 00:04:59,334
Seriously, we're... in Georgia.

66
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,725
How you feeling?

67
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,486
There's broken bones. I checked.

68
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,389
My car...

69
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,021
There was a man.

70
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,237
I hit a man.

71
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:13,812
But then he got up and...
Who was that?

72
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,130
That's what I would like to know.

73
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:17,983
Where is my phone?

74
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:21,153
We really need to go back.
Nobody knows where I am.

75
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,321
Pull over.

76
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,115
I mean it, Damon. Pull over!

77
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:27,284
Stop the car!

78
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,037
You were so much more fun
when you were asleep.

79
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,051
I'm fine.

80
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:46,512
We have to go back.

81
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,598
Come on. Look.
We've already come this far.

82
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,100
Why are you doing this?

83
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,811
I can't be in Georgia
I wrecked my car.

84
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,437
I have to go home.

85
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,231
This is kidnapping.

86
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:59,900
That's a little melodramatic,
don't you think?

87
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,418
You're not funny.

88
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:04,363
You can't do this.
I'm not going to Georgia.

89
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,931
You're in Georgia.

90
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,877
Without your magical necklace
I might add.

91
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,952
I can very easily make you...

92
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:12,816
agreeable.

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,999
What are you trying to prove?

94
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:20,671
That's my phone.

95
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:25,852
It's your boyfriend.

96
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,369
I'll take it.

97
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,912
- Elena's phone.
- Where is she?

98
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:32,474
Why do you have her phone?
Is she okay?

99
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,934
She's right here.

100
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,166
And, yes, she's fine.

101
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,855
Where are you? Let me speak to her.

102
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:40,855
He wants to talk to you.

103
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:48,365
I don't think she wants
to talk to you right now.

104
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,826
Damon, I swear to God,
if you touch her...

105
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,494
You have a good day.

106
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:53,704
Bye-now.

107
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,472
Look. No one knows where I am.
Can we please just go back?

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,891
- We're almost there.
- Where is there?!

109
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,998
A little place right outside
of Atlanta. Come on, Elena.

110
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:19,146
You don't wanna go
back right now. Do you?

111
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,266
What's the rush?

112
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,484
Time-out. Trust me.

113
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:27,154
Your problems are still gonna
be there when you get home.

114
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,032
Look. Step away from
your life for five minutes.

115
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:31,879
Five minutes.

116
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:38,999
Am I gonna be safe with you?

117
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:44,505
Will you promise not to do
that mind control thing with me?

118
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,841
Can I trust you?

119
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,177
Get in the car.

120
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,345
Come on.

121
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:05,354
I... can't find my ring.
I took it off for the gym, I...

122
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,944
I thought I put it...

123
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,760
there it is.

124
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:13,379
Losing family heirlooms... bad.

125
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:17,539
How's your extra credit coming?
You pick a topic?

126
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,331
Mystic Falls, the civil war era.

127
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,666
What's the angle?

128
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,294
My family... I found a journal
of an ancestor who lived in the 1800s.

129
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,547
And the Gilberts were
one of the original

130
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,715
founding families
of Mystic Falls. So...

131
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,793
That sounds good.

132
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,888
I haven't seen you lately.

133
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:38,513
How are you doing...

134
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:40,035
with everything?

135
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,825
I'm fine. It's all fine.

136
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,950
Good.

137
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,271
Are you back in school?

138
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:48,610
Actually I came here to find you.

139
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,322
I was hoping you could help
me with something. A spell.

140
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,398
I know Elena's okay with all of this and
I appreciate what you did to help me

141
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:02,038
but I'm not really ready
to dive into it with you just yet.

142
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,459
I understand that.
But I need your help.

143
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,912
It's Elena. She's with Damon.

144
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,951
I have Elena's necklace.

145
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:14,961
I was just hoping you could use this
to make some sort of a connection.

146
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:18,030
- I just need to know that she's okay.
- How do you know I can do this?

147
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:21,523
Because I've known a few witches over
the years. I've seen what they can do.

148
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,948
- I'm still new at it.
- It's okay.

149
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,772
Give it a shot.

150
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:42,618
There's nothing.

151
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,918
Nothing's happening.
Usually there's an image or...

152
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,237
Tell me if anyone's looking.

153
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,048
All right.

154
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,750
- What is it?
- Something's wrong.

155
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,493
- With Elena?
- With me.

156
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:18,659
There's something wrong with me.
I have to go.

157
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,453
I'm sorry, Stefan. I can't help you.

158
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:29,044
So, where's my car?

159
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,131
I pulled it off on the side of the road.
I don't think anyone will bother it.

160
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,399
What about that man in the road?

161
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,403
- Was he a...?
- From what I could tell. Yeah.

162
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:40,978
You don't know him?

163
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:43,803
If I've never met him,
I wouldn't know him.

164
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:47,771
I mean, it's not like we all hang out
together at the vamp bar and grill.

165
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,041
Where are we?
You brought me to a bar?

166
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,950
I'm not old enough.
They're not gonna let me in.

167
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,368
Sure they will.

168
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,839
It can't be.

169
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:22,832
My honey pie.

170
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:33,608
Listen up everybody!

171
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,320
Here's to the man
that broke my heart,

172
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:38,196
crushed my soul,

173
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,764
destroyed my life,

174
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,285
and ruined any
and all chances of happiness!

175
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,412
Drink up!

176
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:54,372
So, how'd he rope you in?

177
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:57,382
I'm not roped in.
Actually, I'm dating his...

178
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,635
Honey, if you're not roped,
you're whipped.

179
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,762
Either way, just enjoy the ride.

180
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,140
So, how did you two meet?

181
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:06,725
College.

182
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:08,852
You went to college?

183
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,270
I've been on a college campus, yes.

184
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:14,418
About 20 years ago, when I was
just a sweet, young freshman,

185
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:16,293
I met this beautiful man,

186
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:17,768
and fell in love.

187
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:20,325
And then he told me
about his little secret,

188
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,991
made me love him more. Cause,
you see, I had a little secret

189
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,994
of my own that
I was dying to share with somebody.

190
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:27,704
She's a witch.

191
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,499
Changed my world, you know.

192
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,958
I rocked your world.

193
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,169
He is good in the sack, isn't he?

194
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,421
But mostly he's just a...

195
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,151
a walk away joe.

196
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,344
So,

197
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:46,412
what is it that you want?

198
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,757
I am so sorry.

199
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,575
There was this one book
wedged between the other. And

200
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,900
I pulled and then kaplunk, kaboom.

201
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,900
Are you okay?

202
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:29,975
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

203
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,758
- I'm Anna.
- Jeremy.

204
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:58,462
Thank God you're back.

205
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:00,255
And hello to you, too.

206
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,857
What's the matter?

207
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:06,261
My powers are gone, Grams.
I can't do anything,

208
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,598
even when I concentrate. And there's
nothing in in any of these books

209
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,668
- that can tell me how to get them back.
- Hang on, now. Just calm down.

210
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,479
Tell me what happened.

211
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:17,829
I can't.

212
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:19,604
We keeping secrets now?

213
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,318
I have to.

214
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,903
I'm sorry. I promised.

215
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:25,536
Please,

216
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:26,661
help me.

217
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:33,288
Well, first of all, there's nothing
in any of these that's gonna help you.

218
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,499
If you're blocked, it's in here.

219
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:37,375
You gotta clear it out,

220
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,085
then you're back in business.

221
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,762
Clear what out?

222
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,271
Whatever is got you so scared.

223
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,380
I'm so sorry.

224
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,298
<i>Where are you? Why didn't you call?</i>

225
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:54,994
I was so tired last night.
I fell asleep at Bonnie's.

226
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:58,063
And then this morning,
I just wanted to get to school.

227
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:00,184
Are you okay?

228
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:02,868
You know, Stefan and stuff.

229
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,963
Come on,
there's gotta be another way.

230
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:12,623
After all these years,
it's still only Katherine.

231
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:14,615
How do you even know
she's still alive?

232
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,090
Well, you help me get into
that tomb and we'll find out.

233
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,145
I already did.

234
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,361
20 years ago. Remember?

235
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:25,679
Three easy steps...
Comet. Crystal. Spell.

236
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,594
There's a little problem with number 2.
I don't have the crystal.

237
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:33,682
That's it, Damon. There is no
other way. It's Emily's spell.

238
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:36,528
What about a new spell

239
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:39,563
with a new crystal that
overrides Emily's spell?

240
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,093
It doesn't work that way, baby.

241
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:45,819
Emily's spell is absolute.
You can't get into that tomb.

242
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:53,956
Anybody here?!

243
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,520
<i>Elena, is that you?</i>

244
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,197
I'm here.

245
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:13,737
<i>Where are you?</i>

246
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:15,418
You lied.

247
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,327
Not until I explain, please.

248
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,120
So, you didn't lie?

249
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,887
Just tell me where you are.
So that I can come get you.

250
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:24,542
How am I connected
to Katherine, Stefan?

251
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,628
I honestly don't know.

252
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,946
And I'm supposed to believe that?

253
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,465
<i>It's the truth. I...</i>

254
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:32,801
Listen...

255
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,555
You okay?

256
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,743
Don't pretend to care.

257
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,351
I know you're gloating inside.

258
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:51,953
It's Bree.

259
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:54,728
You'll never guess
who walked into my bar.

260
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,482
Anybody?!

261
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,341
Can I help you?

262
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:57,244
I'm Stefan.
I'm a friend of Bonnie's.

263
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,764
Her dad told me
that she might be here.

264
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:03,889
She was.

265
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,352
- Not anymore.
- Do you know where she went?

266
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,937
No. But you do.

267
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:09,355
I'm sorry?

268
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,164
I told her to face down her fear.

269
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,889
And I'm sensing now that
you know exactly why she was scared.

270
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,698
You know what I am.

271
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,242
And yet you offered me your hand,

272
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,660
which means you wanted me
to see that I can trust you.

273
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:26,695
Can you?

274
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:30,341
I trust you'll keep her safe.

275
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,837
You'd better be on your way, then.

276
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,715
I'm not going to invite you in.

277
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,740
I'm sure you understand why.

278
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,178
This aisle is
local and state history.

279
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:46,727
And civil war is one over.

280
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,007
What do you need?

281
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:50,175
Local. 1860s. Do you work here?

282
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,441
You want reference. This way.

283
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,102
Home-schooled. I study here
for a mock school environment.

284
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,570
Here we go.

285
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:02,617
Original settlers, town archives,
Founders stuff. It's all here.

286
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:05,203
So, what's your topic?

287
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,791
The town's fear and hysteria surrounding
the war and how it influenced

288
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,794
- certain writers of the time.
- You might want to focus that.

289
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,772
The origin of local
folklore and myths.

290
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:17,618
You mean the vampires?

291
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,319
Let's just say that I'm
descended from Katherine...

292
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:25,494
Does that make me part vampire?

293
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,965
Vampires can't procreate.

294
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,362
But we love to try.

295
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:33,398
If you are related,

296
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:36,442
it would mean Katherine had
a child before she was turned.

297
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:40,440
Did Stefan think that
he could use me to replace her?

298
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,699
Kinda creepy if you ask me.

299
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,661
Come on? You don't like pickles?
What's wrong with you?

300
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,498
How can you even eat? If...
technically you're supposed to be...

301
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,458
Dead.

302
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,752
It's not such a bad word.

303
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,399
As long as I keep a healthy diet of

304
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:58,974
blood in my system,

305
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:02,013
my body functions pretty normally.

306
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:05,954
This nice act.

307
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,071
Is any of it real?

308
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:13,396
- Here you go, honey.
- Thank you.

309
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:16,190
I'll have one too.

310
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,862
Time out, remember?
For five minutes?

311
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,230
Yeah, well that five minutes
is going to need a beer.

312
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:26,412
There you go.

313
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,993
You're kidding me, right?
There's no such thing as vampires.

314
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:38,546
Well, there's not
a lot of documentation

315
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,069
but the stories have been
told since the civil war.

316
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:43,968
My granddad used to tell me
these creepy stories when I was little.

317
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,013
And he said that his
granddad told them to him.

318
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:50,767
That would be folklore. Vampires are
a metaphor for the demons of the day.

319
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:53,647
- Which are?
- The union soldiers.

320
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,176
I've read the stories myself.
They talk about the enemy,

321
00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:58,107
the demons that attack night.

322
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,401
That sounds like vampires to me.

323
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,320
Allegorical vampires.
Which is what it is.

324
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:06,115
Creative expression during
a very volatile time.

325
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,969
I mean, a country at
war doesn't want realism.

326
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,454
They want fantasy.
Thus, vampire fiction.

327
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:15,333
Man, you're smart.

328
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:19,170
I gotta give it to you.
When I first saw you, I missed it.

329
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:22,594
Yeah.
I've had a rough go of it lately.

330
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:25,593
But I'm just now
getting back to my old self.

331
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:31,076
Well, good luck on your paper.
I gotta get home.

332
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:35,496
You know, my great-grandfather
actually showed me a journal once

333
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:39,500
of an ancestor and he had written
all of this creepy stuff about vampires.

334
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,234
It was actually really believable.

335
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,702
Wait. A journal?

336
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:44,658
Why?

337
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:47,949
Are you sure you have to go?

338
00:22:54,448 --> 00:22:55,698
Come on, phone!

339
00:22:58,524 --> 00:22:59,524
Great!

340
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:35,955
It's me. It's Stefan.

341
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,866
The ground gave way and I fell.

342
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,091
It's okay. It's okay. Calm down.

343
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:45,515
- Come on, let's get you out of here.
- How?

344
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:48,288
Just close your eyes.

345
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,155
Trust me.

346
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,254
You can open your eyes now.

347
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,872
- I didn't want to scare you.
- How did you know where I was?

348
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:16,287
Well, your grandmother told me what
you were doing. I guessed the where.

349
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:20,262
I heard them.

350
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:22,014
Down there.

351
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,136
Behind the door.

352
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:27,027
Are they in pain?

353
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:29,096
In the beginning...
yes. But not anymore.

354
00:24:29,221 --> 00:24:31,846
They've been starved
to the point of dessication.

355
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,181
- But if they have blood...
- That's not going to happen.

356
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,829
They can't get out. Emily saw to that
when she had you destroy the crystal.

357
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:41,896
You're safe.

358
00:24:44,255 --> 00:24:45,255
Ready...

359
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:46,687
go!

360
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,596
That's three.

361
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,058
Do you need a bib?

362
00:24:54,183 --> 00:24:57,886
Sorry I can't unhinge my jaw
like a snake to consume alcohol.

363
00:24:58,072 --> 00:24:59,572
Whatever. All right.

364
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:00,882
Who's next?

365
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:02,654
Another round, Bree.

366
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:05,294
Honey, you should be on the floor.

367
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,047
I am not even drunk.
My tolerance is, like,

368
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,086
way up... here.

369
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,662
All right. Here you go.

370
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:26,782
So, you have no idea
where the journal is?

371
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:30,444
Nope. Gramps died. And all the kids
split his stuff. I can ask.

372
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:34,014
I just find it weird that our ancestors
kept the same kind of journal.

373
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:35,281
It's crazy.

374
00:25:35,406 --> 00:25:38,119
Maybe it's based in
some partial reality.

375
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,455
It's gotta be a metaphorical.
My ancestor wrote short stories.

376
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,083
So, that's why you're hung
up on the fiction of it all.

377
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,332
No, I'm hung up on fiction of it all

378
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:49,755
because I've seen "The Lost Boys"
and "Near Dark," like, 50 times.

379
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,273
Are those movies?

380
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:54,443
I've never seen them.

381
00:25:55,626 --> 00:25:57,332
Maybe we can have a fright night

382
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:59,707
and rent a whole bunch
of vampire movies.

383
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:03,853
Yeah, yeah, sure.

384
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:06,731
Why does it sound
like a no way in hell?

385
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:10,548
Sorry, I'm blunt.

386
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:14,822
It's... I don't want
you to get the wrong idea.

387
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,158
I just recently
got out of something,

388
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:19,493
it's a little too soon, you know?

389
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:22,299
Please, sure. No worries.

390
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:24,332
I meant as friends.

391
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,028
Look, I really gotta go. So...

392
00:26:32,078 --> 00:26:33,828
Nice meeting you, Jeremy.

393
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:54,705
Hold on, it's loud in here.

394
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,730
<i>Where are you? Are you okay?</i>

395
00:26:58,318 --> 00:27:01,535
No, I'm good. Eveything's fine.
Hold on. I can't hear you.

396
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,720
Where's your girl?

397
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:24,308
She was right back there.

398
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,349
What the hell?

399
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:19,056
Who are you?

400
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:20,622
That's perfect.

401
00:28:21,253 --> 00:28:22,603
You have no idea.

402
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,875
What are you talking about?
What did he do?

403
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,700
He killed my girlfriend.

404
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,214
What did she do to you, huh?
What did she do to you?!

405
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:36,384
Nothing.

406
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:38,321
I don't understand.

407
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,926
My girlfriend went to visit Stefan,

408
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,044
and Damon killed her. Got it?

409
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,931
Lexi was your girlfriend?

410
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:53,731
She told me about you. She said

411
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,149
you were human.

412
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:57,916
I was.

413
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,779
Lexi turned you?

414
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:09,914
If you want to be
with someone forever,

415
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:12,333
you have to live forever.

416
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:20,800
She loved you.

417
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:22,416
She said that,

418
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:25,012
when it's real, you can't walk away.

419
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,391
Well, that's a choice
you're not gonna have to make.

420
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,894
Don't. Don't, please,
don't hurt him...

421
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:37,983
I'm doing you a favor.

422
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,089
Lexi loved you.

423
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:43,280
And she was good.
And that means you're good too.

424
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,825
Be better than him.

425
00:29:46,864 --> 00:29:48,914
Don't do this. I'm begging you!

426
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,330
Please.

427
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:14,508
Thank you.

428
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:19,606
It wasn't for you.

429
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:35,791
Now, look who's
returned from battle.

430
00:30:40,568 --> 00:30:42,423
Can I talk
to your friend for minute?

431
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:48,841
Thank you.

432
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:53,893
I appreciate your help, Stefan.

433
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:56,178
You're welcome...

434
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:57,544
Sheila.

435
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,691
I wasn't sure you remembered.

436
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:03,023
October 1969.

437
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:04,848
I was barely a teenager.

438
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:08,365
And you were leading what was
probably the only anti-war

439
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,701
sit-in within miles of Mystic Falls.

440
00:31:12,198 --> 00:31:14,872
You know when you spoke,
people were mesmerized.

441
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:17,583
I know I was.

442
00:31:17,912 --> 00:31:19,662
Until the cops showed up.

443
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,867
You took a big risk
coming to see me earlier.

444
00:31:24,992 --> 00:31:27,343
Letting me read you,
realize who you were.

445
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:30,429
It could have gone a
completely different way.

446
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,256
Your family has a...

447
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:34,466
very long history of...

448
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:35,991
keeping my secret.

449
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:40,538
I knew that I could trust you if you
believed I was worthy of your trust.

450
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,616
Bonnie knows, doesn't she?

451
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:46,173
Yes.

452
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:49,748
Please understand that
our loyalty can only extend so far.

453
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:54,666
This town won't be easy
on any of us if they figure it out.

454
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,788
And I'll protect my
own before anybody else.

455
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:59,274
I know that.

456
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:02,363
As long as we're clear

457
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,306
Goodnight, then.

458
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:08,842
Goodnight, Sheila.

459
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:24,137
We were just leaving, and
I wanted to say goodbye.

460
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:27,892
Good to see you again, Damon.

461
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:29,902
No kiss?

462
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,491
I'm full of vervain.

463
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:35,411
I put it in everything I drink.

464
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,371
And you're telling me this why?

465
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,989
Lexi was my friend.

466
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,451
How could you?

467
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:47,958
The tomb can be opened.

468
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:50,634
You're lying!

469
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,221
Emily's grimoire, her spellbook.
If you know how she closed the tomb

470
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:57,474
the reversal process will be
in her book. You can open that tomb.

471
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,292
And where is this book?

472
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,329
You have no idea.

473
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:02,896
I'm telling you the truth.

474
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:05,797
And I believe you.

475
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:08,665
My dear, sweet Bree.

476
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,988
That's why I'm almost sorry.

477
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,466
So, why did you bring me with you?

478
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,145
Well you're not the worst
company in the world, Elena.

479
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,190
You should give yourself
more credit.

480
00:33:46,495 --> 00:33:47,524
Seriously?

481
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:52,352
You were there in the road.
All damsel in distress-like.

482
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,446
And I knew it would piss off Stefan.

483
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:56,571
And...

484
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,437
you're not the worst
company in the world, Elena.

485
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,457
I used to be more fun.

486
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,901
You did okay.

487
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:08,898
I saved your life.

488
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,049
I know.

489
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:13,967
And don't you forget it.

490
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:37,939
You could have told me.

491
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,870
- I wanted to tell you.
- You said no more lies.

492
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:43,467
Only the truth.

493
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:46,369
I can handle the truth, Stefan.

494
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:48,043
As crazy as it is,

495
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,422
I can handle the fact
that you are a vampire.

496
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:53,085
And you have

497
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:55,451
a vampire brother. And that...

498
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:57,489
my best friend is a witch.

499
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,681
I can accept the fact that the world

500
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,045
is much more mysterious place
than I ever thought possible. But...

501
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,170
this...

502
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,521
this lie, I can't take.

503
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:11,062
What am I to you?

504
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:13,569
Who am I to you?

505
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,410
You are not Katherine.

506
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:18,532
You are the opposite
everything that she was.

507
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,000
And when did you figure that out?
Before you kissed me?

508
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,329
Before we slept together?

509
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,608
Before I met you.

510
00:35:29,854 --> 00:35:30,854
What?

511
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:33,271
The first day of school.

512
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:35,639
When we met.

513
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:39,511
It wasn't for the first time, Elena.

514
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:42,791
Then when was it?

515
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,003
May 23, 2009.

516
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,268
But that was...

517
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,920
That was the day your parents' car

518
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:52,124
went off the bridge.

519
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,400
You were the?

520
00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:59,009
Every couple of years
that I come back here

521
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,470
to see Zach and see my home.

522
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,635
Last spring,

523
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,438
I was out in the woods,

524
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,558
by old Wickery bridge.

525
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,110
And I heard the accident.

526
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:12,857
All of it.

527
00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:16,452
I was fast getting there,
but not fast enough.

528
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:19,657
The car was already submerged.

529
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:23,162
Your dad,

530
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:27,309
he was still conscious.
I was able to get to him,

531
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,527
but he wouldn't let me help him

532
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:32,773
until I helped you.

533
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,111
When I woke up in the hospital,
nobody could

534
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:42,363
figure out

535
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:44,493
how I got out of the car.

536
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,409
They said it was a miracle.

537
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:50,084
I went back for them.

538
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,875
But it was too late.
I couldn't...

539
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:55,871
I couldn't save them.

540
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,315
When I pulled you out,

541
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:01,343
I looked at your face and
you looked like Katherine.

542
00:37:01,468 --> 00:37:03,512
I couldn't believe the resemblance.

543
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,683
After that, I spent months
making sure that you weren't her.

544
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,351
I watched you. I learned
everything that I could about you.

545
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,564
And I saw that you were nothing like

546
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:16,100
Katherine. And I...

547
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,100
wanted to leave town, but,

548
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,795
Elena, I couldn't.
I couldn't leave without knowing you.

549
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:26,432
I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you.
I wanted to.

550
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,204
But you were so sad.

551
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:35,266
Why do I look like her?

552
00:37:37,957 --> 00:37:39,590
Elena, you've been through so much.

553
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:41,888
Why do I look like her, Stefan?

554
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,969
What are you not telling me?

555
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:46,843
It didn't make any sense to me.

556
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,623
You were a Gilbert.
She was a Pierce.

557
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,144
But the resemblance was too similar.

558
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,521
And then I learned the truth.

559
00:37:56,486 --> 00:37:58,442
You were adopted, Elena.

560
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:03,536
There you are.

561
00:38:05,511 --> 00:38:06,811
Okay, look.

562
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:10,963
I know I don't know you, so don't
ask me why I did this. I just,

563
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:14,019
sometimes...
well, mostly all the time...

564
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:17,144
I have this need to be right.
So I googled and...

565
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,300
What is it?

566
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,548
Proof. Sort of.

567
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,642
What does this mean?

568
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,288
I only went as far back as 1942, and

569
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,661
found that there's been a string
of animal attacks periodically

570
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:40,776
in and around this town
for the past 75 years.

571
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,519
It's consistent.

572
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:46,239
In '62, five bodies found.

573
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,764
In '53, four people killed.

574
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:52,746
In '74, three people dead. And
there's been five this year.

575
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:56,116
All attacked. All suffered
major blood loss,

576
00:38:56,374 --> 00:38:58,205
as in drained of blood.

577
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,932
How do you know this?

578
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:08,202
Your birth certificate
from the city records.

579
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:11,077
It says Elena Gilbert.
Mystic Falls General.

580
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:15,153
But there's no record
of your mother ever being admitted.

581
00:39:15,278 --> 00:39:18,230
There's no record of her ever
being pregnant.

582
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:20,893
What else do you know?

583
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:24,628
For me to go any further, I would've
had to look into the Pierce family,

584
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,008
and I couldn't do that.
It's too much of a risk.

585
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:30,139
If someone found out I was asking
about Katherine... Listen to me,

586
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:31,618
it doesn't matter.

587
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:33,395
You are the woman

588
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,141
that I love.

589
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,675
I love you.

590
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,318
I don't set a lot of rules, Elena.

591
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,405
Not with you. I trust
you to tell me the truth.

592
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:11,235
Where were you?
And why did you lie to me about it?

593
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,493
I thought that
we were closer than that.

594
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,034
Now is not the time you want
to talk to me about lies.

595
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,249
Don't do that. Don't turn this
back on me. I didn't do anything.

596
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,498
Question...

597
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:21,960
Am I adopted?

598
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,841
I trust you to tell me
the truth too, Jenna.

599
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:29,766
How could you not tell me?

600
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,720
I thought we were closer than that.

601
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:35,891
Elena, I didn't...
They asked me not to.

602
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,559
I don't want to hear it!

603
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,541
I love you.

604
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,702
I'm going to be late tonight.

605
