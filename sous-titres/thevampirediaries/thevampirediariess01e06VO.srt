<i>Previously on The Vampire Diaries...</i>

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,701
For over a century, I have
lived in secret, until now.

3
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:07,108
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:08,883
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,791
Is that "Damon Salvatore"?
And that's "Stefan Salvatore."

6
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,451
The original Salvatore brothers.

7
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:16,098
1864, you and Katherine
were the perfect couple.

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,958
- Did you get the Gilbert watch?
- I can get it.

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,854
- You okay?
- Come here.

10
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:23,285
I got you.

11
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,525
- I know you.
- I think you have the wrong person.

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,253
You haven't aged a day.

13
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:30,122
There are things
that you don't know,

14
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:32,448
things that I want to tell you
but I can't.

15
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,035
Are you sure that the man you knew,
his name was Stefan Salvatore?

16
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,562
- When was this?
- 1953.

17
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:44,660
<i>Dear diary,</i>

18
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:46,142
<i>I'm not a believer.</i>

19
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,787
<i>People are born, they grow old
and then they die.</i>

20
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,051
<i>That's the world we live in.</i>

21
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:56,073
<i>How can I deny
what's right in front of me?</i>

22
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:58,461
<i>Someone who never grows old...</i>

23
00:00:58,586 --> 00:00:59,986
<i>never gets hurt...</i>

24
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:03,437
<i>Someone who changes in ways
that can't be explained...</i>

25
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:05,474
<i>Girls bitten...</i>

26
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,574
<i>Bodies drained of blood...</i>

27
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:07,871
- You must be Miss Pierce.
- Please...

28
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,042
Call me Katherine.

WoLF971

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,312
What are you?

35
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,649
What are you?

36
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,035
You know.

37
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:44,330
- I don't.
- Yes, you do,

38
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,123
or you wouldn't be here.

39
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,608
It's not possible.

40
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,001
It can't be.

41
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,534
Everything you know...

42
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:03,615
and every belief that you have
is about to change.

43
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,436
Are you ready for that?

44
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:09,999
What are you?

45
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,199
I'm a vampire.

46
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:27,248
I shouldn't have come.

47
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:30,096
Please.

48
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:38,275
- How did you do that?
- Please don't be afraid of me.

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Let me go.

50
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,743
There's things that you have
to know and understand.

51
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,518
- Let me go!
- Please.

52
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,478
I would never hurt you.

53
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:39,607
You're safe with me.

54
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:45,367
All those animal attacks,
those people who died...

55
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,535
That was Damon.

56
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:49,684
I don't drink human blood.

57
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,276
That's not how I choose
to survive, but Damon does.

58
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:55,294
I'll explain everything to you,
but I beg you, Elena,

59
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,462
- do not tell anybody.
- How can you ask me that?

60
00:04:58,587 --> 00:05:00,987
Because you knowing this
is dangerous

61
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,760
for so many reasons.

62
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,054
You can hate me,

63
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,222
but I need you to trust me.

64
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,067
Just go.

65
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,145
Just go, please. Go.

66
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:16,312
If you mean me no harm,
then you'll go.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,573
I never wanted this.

68
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:42,067
- I want my ring.
- Where are you?

69
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,685
I'm at the sizzler.

70
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:46,572
I had the buffet.
Where's my ring?

71
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,949
I don't have it.
Where are you? What have you done?

72
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,462
What have you done?
You're the one that locked me

73
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:55,164
in the basement and starved me,
so whatever I've done,

74
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,082
whoever I've sucked dry is on you.

75
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,559
You're being careless.
How many more animal attacks

76
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:02,302
- is this town gonna believe?
- I know how to cover my tracks.

77
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:05,108
- Where's my ring?
- I gave it to Zach to hide.

78
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,301
Probably shouldn't have killed him.

79
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,765
You almost got me.
Where is it?

80
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,393
I'll get it back but I need time.

81
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,890
What, you Fedex it for Rome?
Where is it?

82
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:21,482
I want my ring,
or my next stop's Elena's.

83
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,606
I already want you dead. Don't give
me another reason to make it happen.

84
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,820
Don't give me another
reason to rip you apart.

85
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,506
Is that gonna be before or
after you get your ring back?

86
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:31,065
Just get it.

87
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,376
You just don't wanna die, do you?

88
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,336
You said you would explain everything.
That's why I asked you to meet me here.

89
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,839
When you google "vampire,"
you get a world of fiction.

90
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,924
- What's the reality?
- I can tell you

91
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,510
- whatever you wanna know.
- I know you eat garlic.

92
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,220
And somehow,
sunlight's not an issue.

93
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,182
Here's your drinks.

94
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:22,269
- Thank you.
- We have rings that protect us.

95
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,062
- Crucifixes?
- Decorative.

96
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,064
- Holy water?
- Drinkable.

97
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,524
- Mirrors?
- Myth.

98
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,736
- You said you don't kill to survive.
- Animal blood keeps me alive

99
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,196
but not as strong as Damon.
He can be very powerful.

100
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:35,390
And yet you let him
get involved with Caroline?

101
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:38,417
Forcing Damon not to do something
is much more dangerous, believe me.

102
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,094
- He was hurting her.
- He was feeding on her.

103
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:44,758
He was able to take away her memories
of being bitten using a form of

104
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,829
mind compulsion. She never knew
what was happening to her. If he wanted

105
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,624
- to kill her, he would have.
- Is that supposed to make it okay?

106
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:52,049
None of this is okay.

107
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:54,086
I know that.

108
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:02,514
Are there any others,
aside from you and Damon?

109
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,789
Not in Mystic Falls, not anymore.

110
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:06,230
Not anymore?

111
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:10,743
There was a time
when this town was...

112
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:15,155
very much aware of vampires,
and it didn't end well for anybody.

113
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,574
That's why it's important
that you don'tell anyone.

114
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,245
I can't promise that.

115
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:27,312
Give me today.

116
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:30,565
I will answer any
questions that you have,

117
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:32,288
and when it's over,

118
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:36,107
you can decide for yourself what
you wanna do with what you know.

119
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:37,551
It'll be your choice.

120
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,168
Never smelled one this bad before.

121
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:51,358
- It tried to cover its tracks.
- Are you sure?

122
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:54,203
I'm positive. You only burn a corpse

123
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:56,841
to try to hide cause of death
and there are no shell casings.

124
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,212
We know who they are?

125
00:10:58,337 --> 00:11:00,779
Doc'll have to
check their dental records.

126
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:02,972
What story should I run?

127
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:05,243
Drug deal gone bad.

128
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,474
It's not too big a stretch.

129
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,185
I got the Gilbert watch.

130
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:12,908
Good.

131
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:16,030
Found this in the brush
about 10 yards away.

132
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,851
You know her?

133
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,080
I went to high school
with her mother.

134
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,898
Think she's one of these?

135
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:33,848
I hope not.

136
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,042
Where are you, Stefan?

137
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:42,617
I'm trapped at the house,
and I'm getting really bored

138
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,773
and really impatient and I don't do

139
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:46,621
bored and impatient.

140
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,776
Bring me my ring.

141
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,511
Damn it.

142
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:55,341
Don't get blood on the couch.

143
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:56,645
Please.

144
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,022
I got you good, didn't I?

145
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,735
You're not gonna be any fun today.

146
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,828
I'm so gonna regret this.

147
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,301
Drink up.

148
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:38,152
Drink it up.

149
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:42,594
Don't drip.
There you go. Good girl.

150
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,514
That's it.

151
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:50,582
Stop here.

152
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,865
What are we doing here?

153
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:06,778
I want to show you something.

154
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,038
In the middle of nowhere?

155
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:12,197
This...

156
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:14,458
didn't used to be nowhere.

157
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,130
Used to be my home.

158
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:38,900
- It looks so...
- Old?

159
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,961
It's because they are.

160
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,489
Wait. How long have you...

161
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,281
I've been 17 years old...

162
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:53,248
since 1864.

163
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,905
You said you wanted to know.

164
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,758
I'm not gonna hold anything back.

165
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,332
Half century before
the boardinghouse was even built,

166
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,105
this was my family's home.

167
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:20,093
Damon and I...

168
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:23,363
we were both born here.

169
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:26,812
The Salvatore brothers,
best of friends.

170
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,814
Wait. Where did you learn this game?

171
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,507
Camp outside Atlanta. One of the
officers picked it up at Harvard. Catch.

172
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,375
Wait a minute.

173
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,211
What are the rules?

174
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,753
Who needs rules?

175
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,484
Mind if I join you?

176
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:49,997
Well, you could...
you could get hurt.

177
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,182
My brother likes to play rough.

178
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,470
Somehow, I think
that you play rougher.

179
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,237
Why are you just standing there? That is
a girl who clearly wants to be chased.

180
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:07,864
If you don't do it, I will.

181
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,401
You knew Katherine in 1864?

182
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:21,782
Damon made it seem like...

183
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:24,542
Damon was trying
to make you think that...

184
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,508
I was still heartbroken.

185
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,969
He saw that I was happy with you

186
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,138
- and he wanted to ruin it.
- All because you loved the same woman

187
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,267
145 years ago?

188
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:40,377
She wasn't...

189
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:42,666
just any girl.

190
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,944
I win. What's my prize?

191
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,661
What would you like it to be?

192
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,832
They extended your leave?

193
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:02,127
I was simply having too much fun
to return to battle.

194
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,420
Your commitment to
the confederacy is inspiring.

195
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,717
Well, this works out
wonderfully for me.

196
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,316
How's that, Miss Katherine?

197
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:12,828
Now I'll have both of you here
to keep me entertained.

198
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:15,932
First and foremost, I'll need someone
to escort me to the Founder's ball.

199
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,393
- With pleasure.
- I would be honored.

200
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:23,645
The smart and kind
Salvatore brothers

201
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,520
both coming to my rescue.

202
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,469
How will I ever choose?

203
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:35,879
She chose me.

204
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,255
I escorted her to the ball

205
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,630
at the original Lockwood mansion.

206
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,220
The first Founder's party...

207
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:47,464
where you signed the registry.

208
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,228
I didn't care that...

209
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,431
I had gotten something
that my brother wanted.

210
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:59,053
I didn't even care if it hurt him.

211
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,803
I only knew that...

212
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,686
I wanted her.

213
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,293
So he was upset.

214
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,487
That's the thing about Damon.

215
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,448
He doesn't get mad.

216
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:17,153
He just gets even.

217
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,078
That shower was so great.

218
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,533
What did you give me?

219
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,559
Some blood. You loved it.

220
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:36,612
I did?

221
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:40,078
Wait. I'm confused.
How did we get here?

222
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,175
We met in the woods.
You were drunk. I attacked you.

223
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,627
Then I killed all of your friends
and brought you here,

224
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:49,478
gave you same blood.
You loved it.

225
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,603
And now we're gonna party
till the sun goes down.

226
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:57,021
But first, can I have another hit?

227
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,227
That blood was so good.

228
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:00,954
Only if I can.

229
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,730
What Damon wants,

230
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:13,764
Damon usually gets.

231
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:16,465
I didn't know it at the time, but...

232
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:18,430
turns out that night...

233
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,517
Katherine was with him, too.

234
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,479
So he stole her from you,
not the other way around?

235
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:29,378
Turns out

236
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,402
she wasn't ours to steal.

237
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,423
I will love you forever.

238
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:57,727
Forever is a very long time,
you know.

239
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,305
Not long enough.

240
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:30,418
Good morning.

241
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:33,194
Clear the room, please.

242
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:36,998
You're upset.

243
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:41,216
Your face,

244
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,591
- it was like a demon.
- But you're not afraid.

245
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,518
Get away from me. Get away.

246
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,409
It doesn't change
the way you feel about me.

247
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:52,023
You will not tell anyone.

248
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,528
We will go on exactly as we have.

249
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,782
We will go on.

250
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:06,687
You have no idea of the future
I have planned for us, Stefan...

251
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,374
You, me, and Damon.

252
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,958
No rules.

253
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:16,766
She could control
my mind and Damon's.

254
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:20,051
And she compelled each of us to
keep the secret from the other.

255
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,469
She wanted all of us to be together

256
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:24,379
forever.

257
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,525
Didn't work out that way, but...

258
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,950
Damon and I,

259
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,040
looks like we're stuck
with each other...

260
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:36,303
Like it or not.

261
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,953
Is that Damon's ring?

262
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:42,282
I took it from him,
but I have to give it back.

263
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:47,161
- Don't, Stefan. Keep it hidden.
- Elena, if I don't give it to him,

264
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,927
he'll retaliate in the only way
that he knows he can hurt me.

265
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,332
And how is that?

266
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:54,437
By hurting you.

267
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:04,637
- Doc ID the bodies?
- A few townies. Notorious druggies.

268
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:06,873
I suppose...

269
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:09,517
that'll make it easy
for people to buy the story.

270
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:12,562
- And Vicki Donovan?
- She's not one of the deceased.

271
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:15,326
- Where the hell is she?
- I wish I knew.

272
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:16,701
Sorry I'm late.

273
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:19,156
You have the watch?

274
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:51,567
- It's ready.
- That's it?

275
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:52,936
That's it.

276
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:07,150
I am so over Tyler,

277
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:09,619
so over him.
I knew from the beginning

278
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,221
that I was only a piece of ass
to him, but I thought maybe

279
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:14,750
if he got to know me better,
he might see something more.

280
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,875
But no.

281
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,709
Now, Jeremy, on the other hand,

282
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,127
that's all he's ever seen in
me is something more,

283
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:21,589
and I like that.

284
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:25,575
Elena's brother?

285
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:30,248
So, Elena used to date my brother,
and they were always together,

286
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:33,225
so Jeremy would always be hanging
around and crushing on me and...

287
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,271
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
You're, like, totally cool and so hot.

288
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:40,191
- I know.
- Don't you wanna be in love?

289
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:41,943
I've been in love.

290
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,904
It's painful and pointless
and overrated.

291
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,699
Except when it isn't.

292
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,167
No more talking.

293
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,923
Let's dance.

294
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,603
My mom spends most of her time
in Virginia Beach with Pete.

295
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:03,900
He drives trucks.

296
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:05,949
I don't remember my dad,

297
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:08,362
but from what I gather,
he's not worth remembering.

298
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:10,897
Your life is so pathetic.

299
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:13,830
I mean, I'm the screwed-up one.

300
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:16,162
Matt's got it so easy.
He's the golden boy.

301
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,123
I mean, he's gonna get
a football scholarship

302
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,086
and marry Elena and have a lawn
mower and some babies, and...

303
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:26,669
when I think of my future,
I just come up blank.

304
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:30,100
You are so damaged.

305
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,931
I mean, you don't have
one hint of self-esteem.

306
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,892
None.

307
00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:45,606
- I think I know what can help you.
- So what's that?

308
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,364
Death.

309
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:28,734
What happened?

310
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:32,042
- We were dancing, and then...
- Then I killed you.

311
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,941
- What?
- You're dead.

312
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:36,659
I'm dead?

313
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:40,152
Yeah, let's not make a big deal
out of it. Drank my blood, I killed you

314
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:43,084
and now you have to feed in
order to complete the process.

315
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,073
You're wasted.

316
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:49,159
You don't wanna be
out there all alone.

317
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:52,550
You're about to get really freaky.

318
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:56,042
I had a really good time.
I just wanna go home.

319
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,576
You're gonna start craving blood,
and until you get it,

320
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:01,088
you're gonna feel very out of it.
You have to be careful.

321
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:02,413
Come on, move.

322
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:05,518
See? You're already
starting to fall apart.

323
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:09,233
- And I'm going home now.
- Okay, fine. I'm just warning you.

324
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,519
Actually, you know what?
You should go.

325
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,655
In fact, if I were you,

326
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,116
I would stop by
your boyfriend Jeremy's house.

327
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:20,453
- Yeah, whatever. Bye.
- Tell Elena I said hi.

328
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,997
And if you see Stefan,
tell him to call me.

329
00:26:32,603 --> 00:26:34,579
I got Stanley on
the moore street entrance.

330
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:36,677
The rest of us'll cover
other access points.

331
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,568
Call him or call me if that thing
goes off. Don't use the radio.

332
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:41,679
- Cellphones only.
- Got it.

333
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:43,017
You've got 8 rounds.

334
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,971
Remember,
wood bullets won't kill him

335
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:47,878
but it'll wound him enough
for you to get close and stake him.

336
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:50,066
You sure you can handle this?

337
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:51,854
Of course I can.

338
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,197
You ever staked a vampire before?

339
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,130
Have you?

340
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,451
Coming!

341
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,749
The sun is killing me.
My eyes are on fire.

342
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:08,713
Where have you been?

343
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,250
It's good. Everything's good.

344
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,643
Did something happen?

345
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:19,001
I'm hungry.

346
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:20,776
What do you got to eat?

347
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,688
You're high?
It's the middle of the day.

348
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,524
Could you just not talk so loud?
My head, it hurts.

349
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:33,553
I need quiet.

350
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,012
The mind control...

351
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,210
You said Katherine used.

352
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,803
Do you ever do that to me?

353
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:58,527
That necklace,

354
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,721
it contains an herb called vervain.

355
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,027
It protects you from
being compelled.

356
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,641
I wanted to

357
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,893
protect you from Damon's influence.

358
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:12,486
But I also wanted to...

359
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:15,318
protect you from me.

360
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:21,664
Elena, you should
never take that necklace off...

361
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:24,817
because no matter
what happens after today,

362
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,918
no matter how you feel about me...

363
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,708
You'll know that you were
free to make your own choice.

364
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,737
- Where is she?
- Come this way.

365
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,551
What's she on?

366
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,394
I don't know.

367
00:28:57,563 --> 00:28:58,763
How you doin'?

368
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:00,656
Not good, Mattie.

369
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:03,741
- I hurt.
- Okay, where's it hurt?

370
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,910
My gums. My jaw hurts.

371
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,454
My gum... there's something
in my gums, and it hurts.

372
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:10,823
Just leave me alone.

373
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,242
Don't be like that.
Let's get you home.

374
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,669
- Just turn it off!
- Turn what off?

375
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,537
The talking, the chatter,
just turn it off.

376
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,726
<i>Three bodies were found dead in what
is believed to be a drug deal gone awry.</i>

377
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,020
<i>The bodies have yet
to be identified.</i>

378
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:36,361
<i>They were discovered earlier today
over at the old Mystic Falls cemetery.</i>

379
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:38,859
- That's where we were last night.
- What happened?

380
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,709
<i>... homicide, and are fast
under way looking for suspects.</i>

381
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:43,746
<i>They're asking anyone
with information...</i>

382
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:45,574
- I'm calling the cops.
- Don't.

383
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,880
What happened after
I left last night, Vick?

384
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,164
- You okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

385
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:53,962
Damn, Vick.

386
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:58,775
- What's going on?
- She's really messed up.

387
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:00,791
Elena, back up.

388
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:03,843
Look at me.

389
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,135
Focus.

390
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,722
You're gonna be fine.

391
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,435
Everything's gonna be fine.

392
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:17,565
Guys, take her up to bed. Shut the
blinds. She's gonna be okay. Come on.

393
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,109
Come on.

394
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,784
You know what's wrong with her?
What is it?

395
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:33,461
- She's transitioning.
- Transitioning to what?

396
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:35,332
A vampire.

397
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:37,393
What?

398
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,628
Damon must have gotten to her.
She's new.

399
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,839
She hasn't completed
her transformation yet.

400
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,340
How does she do that?

401
00:30:47,396 --> 00:30:49,446
She has to feed on human blood.

402
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,767
And what if she doesn't?

403
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,883
She'll die.

404
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,904
She may only have a few hours.

405
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:08,097
- She's upstairs with him right now.
- It's okay. She doesn't know

406
00:31:08,222 --> 00:31:10,674
- what's happening to her yet.
- So when is she gonna know?

407
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,716
Right now, she doesn't remember
anything. A part of her is still human,

408
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:16,256
but slowly, the deeper she
gets into the transition,

409
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:18,375
the memories will
start to come back,

410
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,493
and then she'll know she
has to make the choice.

411
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,508
The same choice you made?

412
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:40,456
I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.

413
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,193
You just...
you need to sleep it off, okay?

414
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,322
She was fine,
and then she just freaked out.

415
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:46,880
I'm gonna go look for her.
Call me if you hear anything.

416
00:32:47,738 --> 00:32:49,059
I can track her.

417
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,184
Go.

418
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,807
I think I got something.
It's pointing towards the old cemetery.

419
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,275
Headed your way.

420
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,944
- Maybe we should check in with Matt.
- He'll call when he finds her.

421
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,406
- What are we supposed to do?
- We wait. We're supposed to wait.

422
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,784
I don't know what's wrong with her.

423
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,202
She'll be fine.

424
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:00,484
It'll all be fine.

425
00:34:13,158 --> 00:34:14,658
Jeremy, go upstairs.

426
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:20,474
You're afraid of me.

427
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,742
I'm gonna go out on
a limb here and guess.

428
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:25,688
Stefan finally fessed up.

429
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,368
Stay away from me.

430
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:31,282
There's no need to be rude.
I'm just looking for Stefan.

431
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:33,807
May I come in?
Wait. Of course I can.

432
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:35,671
I've been invited.

433
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,043
We can cut to the chase if you want.
I'm not gonna kill you right now.

434
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:51,377
That wouldn't serve
my greater agenda.

435
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,215
So...

436
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:55,968
Where's Stefan?

437
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,554
He's out looking for Vicki.

438
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:01,598
Don't look at me with
those judgey little eyes.

439
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,560
Girl's gonna thank me
for what I did to her.

440
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,228
Did you thank Katherine?

441
00:35:15,308 --> 00:35:16,947
Got the whole life story, huh?

442
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,916
- I got enough.
- I doubt that.

443
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,340
Tell my brother I'm looking for him.

444
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:32,992
Tip for later.

445
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:36,016
Be careful who you
invite in the house.

446
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,783
I'm starting to remember things...

447
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,701
What he is, what he said.

448
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:05,319
I remember you. The hospital,

449
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:07,860
the rooftop, it's all coming back.

450
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:09,135
I'm so sorry.

451
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,867
Damon had no right
to do this to you.

452
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:18,262
He said that I need to feed.

453
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,953
What will happen if I don't?

454
00:36:23,594 --> 00:36:25,194
You'll fade quickly...

455
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,453
and then it'll all just...

456
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:29,578
be over.

457
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,399
I'll be dead.

458
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:44,409
I don't want this.

459
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,577
I know.

460
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:48,002
It'll be okay. You're gonna be okay.

461
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:49,978
I can help you.

462
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:54,878
Is it better?

463
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,330
Is it better? Will I be better?

464
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,351
I wanna go home.

465
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,871
Will you take me home?

466
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,987
It's wood.

467
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:04,098
They know.

468
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:09,536
If anyone's gonna kill you,
it's gonna be me.

469
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,121
My ring.

470
00:38:30,548 --> 00:38:31,558
I'm sorry.

471
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:05,189
The watch.

472
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:06,744
Find the watch.

473
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:21,292
- You're bleeding.
- No, it's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

474
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,820
I couldn't stop her.

475
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:28,945
I tried.

476
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:31,952
What does that mean?

477
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,667
She fed,

478
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:35,789
and then I lost her.

479
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:39,016
Oh, my God.

480
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,200
I'll take care of it.
I'll find her, and I will show her

481
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:44,810
that she can live like I do.
I will make sure that she does

482
00:39:44,935 --> 00:39:46,585
not hurt anybody. I promise you.

483
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,831
What do I tell my brother and...
and Matt?

484
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:52,249
- We'll come up with a story.
- You mean we'll come up with a lie.

485
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:58,297
I'm so...

486
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:00,016
sorry.

487
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,020
I gave you today
just like you asked.

488
00:40:09,185 --> 00:40:11,117
And I understand that you would

489
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,993
never do anything to hurt me,

490
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,961
and I promise I will
keep your secret, but...

491
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,585
I can't be with you, Stefan.

492
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:30,031
I'm sorry. I...

493
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:31,978
I just can't.

494
