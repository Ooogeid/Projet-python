<i>Previously on The Vampire Diaries...</i>

2
00:00:01,997 --> 00:00:04,462
<i>For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.</i>

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,643
<i>I know the risk,
but I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:08,438
<i>She's a dead ringer for Katherine.</i>

5
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:11,010
You have no idea of the
future I have planned for us.

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,962
You, me, and Damon.

7
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:15,046
Our love for Katherine wasn't real.

8
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:17,590
Katherine never compelled
me. I knew everything.

9
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:19,810
It was real for me.
I'm going to bring her back.

10
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,160
- Tell me how to get into the tomb.
- The grimoire.

11
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:24,716
- Where is it?
- Check the journal, Jonathan Gilbert's.

12
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:27,943
- Can I borrow your ancestor's journal?
- I gave it to my history teacher.

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,510
So the grimoire,
that as Emily's, right?

14
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:33,399
That's what you need to reverse
the spell? I'll help you.

15
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:36,077
I told Damon that I'd help
him get Katherine back.

16
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,287
But it was a lie.
I can't let him do it.

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,455
Then don't. And I'll help you.
Whatever it takes.

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,222
Please!

19
00:00:57,142 --> 00:00:58,442
Please, help us!

20
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,104
Please, my husband,
he's been hurt! Please help him!

21
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:09,492
What are you doing out here in
the middle of the night? It's not safe.

22
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:10,820
No, sir.

23
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,188
It's not safe.

24
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:33,226
And that's how it's done.

25
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,140
What happens to the bodies?

26
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:43,312
I'll take them into the woods and
the other animals will finish them off.

27
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:48,816
Are you sure you're ready for this?

28
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:53,946
I'm ready.
I want you to turn me.

29
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:56,157
When it's time.

30
00:01:58,602 --> 00:01:59,618
Kiss me.

31
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,949
You should get a taste.

32
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,349
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

33
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,547
Soon you won't be able
to get enough.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,030
Mystic Falls Team
1x13 - Children Of The Damned

35
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:32,902
Croutch, Dark_Chii, McFly,
MiniBen314, Paulp, Thirteen & WoLF971.

36
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:40,921
Good morning.

37
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:44,768
I could get used to this.

38
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,367
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

39
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:50,044
- Please!
- What are you doing?

40
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,671
- Stop being smutty.
- Seriously, get out of here!

41
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,217
If I see something I haven't seen before
I'll throw a dollar at it. Now listen,

42
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,427
we have some very important
business to discuss.

43
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,046
- And it has to be right now?
- We have lots to do,

44
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:04,725
now that we're all friends and
working toward a common goal.

45
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,394
So, in order to open the tomb,

46
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,271
we need to find the journal,

47
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,236
to get the grimoire
to undo the spells.

48
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:13,748
First things first,
since you are Elena Gilbert,

49
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:16,093
- you're on journal duty.
- Since when am I helping?

50
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:19,618
Well, Stefan's helping, and you've
taken up residence in Stefan's bed,

51
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:20,743
ergo...

52
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,135
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

53
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,079
- I'll look for it tonight.
- Good.

54
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,457
How do we know that this journal
will hold the location of the grimoire?

55
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,854
We're really going to take
the word of this vampire?

56
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,879
- He seemed like a bit of a dimwit.
- In lieu of any other options.

57
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,455
What exactly is a grimoire, anyway?

58
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,175
It's a witch's cookbook.

59
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:41,537
Every spell that a witch casts
is unique unto itself,

60
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,110
so every witch
would document their work.

61
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,392
- Cookbook.
- What about our mystery vampire?

62
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,213
Dimwit obviously
wasn't working alone, so,

63
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,314
whoever's out there
knows who we are.

64
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,936
And I don't like that
disadvantage, so...

65
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,111
chop, chop.

66
00:03:57,207 --> 00:04:00,810
You know, I really like this whole
ménage-threesome team thing.

67
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:02,985
It's got a bit of a kink to it.

68
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,119
Don't screw it up.

69
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,698
He does have...

70
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:12,215
Right, yeah.

71
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,206
No, come here.

72
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,719
We shouldn't...

73
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,975
What are you doing?
Stop it!

74
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Make me.

75
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:51,848
Yes?

76
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,296
Excuse me, miss Katherine.

77
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,464
Miss Pearl is here to see you.

78
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,676
I'll be down soon.
Please ask her to wait.

79
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,096
Thank you, Emily.

80
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,666
Fun's over.

81
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,081
Good to see you, Pearl.

82
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:21,445
Perhaps we could talk outside.

83
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:27,993
Would you please tell Mr. Salvatore
that I've stepped away?

84
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:29,370
Which one?

85
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Both.

86
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:40,139
How long do you plan on
staying with the Salvatores?

87
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:41,914
People talk, Katherine.

88
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:44,827
You, carrying on with both brothers,

89
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,470
doesn't help the situation.

90
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,973
The salvatores have been
kind to take me in.

91
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:53,041
As far as everyone here knows,
I'm a poor orphan girl from Atlanta,

92
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:55,095
lost her family in the fires.

93
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,020
A match you lit, no doubt.

94
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:00,344
Honey, please be careful.

95
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:07,594
Honorea Fell came by
the apothecary yesterday

96
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:10,026
with a case of this elixir.

97
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,997
She asked that it be
sold at a reduced rate.

98
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,790
- I don't follow.
- Try it.

99
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:21,672
What in hell?

100
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,790
- Vervain.
- Why is there...

101
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,410
They know.

102
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,716
They're trying to find us, and
they're getting crafty about it.

103
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:33,434
The townspeople ingesting vervain?
Well, that's inconvenient.

104
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,686
It might be time for us
to move on again.

105
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:39,857
I like it here.
I'm not interested in leaving just yet.

106
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:41,725
Can we go, mama?

107
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:46,423
Is something wrong?

108
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,215
It's me again.

109
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,493
Soccer chick and foosball champion.

110
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:56,497
I'll be at the grill
later, if you want,

111
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:58,333
you know, a rematch, or whatever.

112
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,680
Who are you calling?

113
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,051
You're not, like, into him, are you?

114
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,511
I need him for something.
Get over it.

115
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,808
- Damn it!
- Dude, you gotta stop doing that.

116
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,727
I know. I just... I keep forgetting.

117
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,353
You're new.

118
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:19,865
You'll get it.

119
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,008
You found the Gilbert journal?

120
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,683
Does that look like
the Gilbert journal?

121
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,726
Well, it's old and musty, and

122
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,075
how am I supposed
to know the difference?

123
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,181
I don't know, I figured
maybe, just maybe,

124
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:34,259
you've been paying a little
bit of attention since we met.

125
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:37,539
You know, you don't have
to talk down to me. I'm not stupid.

126
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,335
Here.

127
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:42,703
Drink.

128
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,007
I don't want you getting itchy around
the witch. She can sense if you're weak.

129
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:51,293
When can we go hunting again?

130
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,180
This tastes old.
I want fresh blood.

131
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,433
When we get that tomb open,
you can kill anyone you want.

132
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,835
For now, just stay focused on Bonnie

133
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,671
while I try to get the journal
back from Jeremy's teacher.

134
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,942
Why did you choose me?

135
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:08,475
I needed someone in a position
to be my eyes and ears.

136
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,197
Small town bartender fit the bill.

137
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,215
There are plenty of
bartenders to choose from.

138
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:14,409
Why me?

139
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,061
You were sad then.
You lacked purpose.

140
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,456
You needed me.

141
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,462
Do you think Damon
really believes us?

142
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,880
That we're both trying to help him?

143
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:31,009
I don't think Damon
knows what to believe.

144
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,513
Trust isn't something that
comes naturally to him.

145
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:36,905
You know...

146
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,040
I really think that Damon believes
that everything he's done,

147
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,271
every move that he's made,
he's done for love.

148
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,606
It's twisted, but...

149
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,816
kind of sad.

150
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:51,174
There are other ways
to get what you want.

151
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,365
You don't have to kill people.

152
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:56,373
Damon has no regard for human life.

153
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,079
He enjoys inflicting pain on others.

154
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:03,504
For 145 years,

155
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:08,535
every single time
that I have let my guard down

156
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:12,634
and let Damon back into my life, he's
done something to make me regret that.

157
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,311
I'm not gonna make
that mistake again.

158
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:16,972
So what do you think will happen

159
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,559
if the tomb gets opened
and Damon gets Katherine back?

160
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:25,314
I think that no matter what Damon
promises, a lot of people will die.

161
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:36,328
That's Jonathan Gilbert.

162
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,249
What's this?

163
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,745
What are you guys doing?

164
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,983
Just going through some stuff,
feeling sentimental.

165
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:56,166
Dad had this whole family journal from
years ago. I thought I'd dig it up.

166
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,874
Jonathan Gilbert's journal?

167
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:01,600
- Yeah, what do you know about it?
- I just did a history report on it.

168
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,893
So where is it now?

169
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,395
I gave it to Mr. Saltzman.
He wanted to see it.

170
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,980
<i>I met Barnett and
Giuseppe this evening.</i>

171
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:15,528
<i>I saw the skepticism in their eyes
when I showed them the compass.</i>

172
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,702
We're supposed to believe
that can track one of them?

173
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,952
What is it, magic?

174
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,412
- It's science.
- I'll believe it when I see it.

175
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,480
I've been thinking about this church
idea. I believe it could work.

176
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,160
Excuse me, father.

177
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:31,129
- I didn't know you had guests.
- We'll be done in a few minutes, son.

178
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,547
I'll come back. Forgive me,
Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Lockwood.

179
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:38,971
- Have you told them?
- Not yet.

180
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,889
We need all the men we can get.

181
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,580
I'll tell them.
You can count on both my boys.

182
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:06,461
Someone there?

183
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,449
You shouldn't have done that.

184
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:54,689
Have a seat.

185
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,947
What is this, compressed air?

186
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,158
Did you make it yourself?

187
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,302
Who are you?

188
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,394
I'm not going to hurt you...

189
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,125
unless you try that again.

190
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:22,903
Now...

191
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,114
Who are you?

192
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,391
I'm a teacher.

193
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:35,377
Are we going to have
to do this the hard way?

194
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:37,274
I'm also a historian.

195
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:40,346
And while researching Virginia, I...

196
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:43,530
made a few discoveries
about your town.

197
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,240
So you show up like Van Helsing.

198
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,780
Come on.

199
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,935
Tell me the truth.

200
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,789
My wife was a parapsychologist.

201
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,707
She spent her life researching
paranormal activity in this area.

202
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,296
- It was her work that led me here.
- Where's your wife?

203
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Dead.

204
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,158
A vampire killed her.

205
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,469
Where's the Gilbert journal?

206
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,552
- What do you want with it?
- Where is it?

207
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:09,681
- It's on my desk.
- No, it's not.

208
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:15,306
It was on my desk.

209
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,317
Anything?

210
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:23,195
Not yet.
Just a lot of gibberish.

211
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,906
Yeah, some people
just shouldn't journal.

212
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,617
I thought this Gilbert
was the brains.

213
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:31,774
Don't you have a date?

214
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:33,903
Wish me luck.

215
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:41,713
<i>I saw her again today.
The most beautiful woman in town,</i>

216
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:44,317
<i>with a name just as pretty, Pearl.</i>

217
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,177
Have you thought any more
of what I've said?

218
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,015
We'll leave soon, Pearl, I promise.

219
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,743
I need to take care
of a few things first.

220
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,892
You're going to turn
both of them, aren't you?

221
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:57,636
Katherine, please.

222
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,939
Be careful.

223
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,228
We'll all be safe, I promise.

224
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,986
Mr. Gilbert's coming.
Quick, your cheeks.

225
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:07,441
Perfectly rosie.

226
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:11,341
May I have a moment?

227
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,877
Yes Mr. Gilbert.

228
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:15,747
I'm still waiting for you to

229
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,915
explain that comet in the sky.

230
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:23,964
Your mother has an admirer.

231
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,174
As descendants of
the founding families,

232
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,390
they'll want to know that
they can count on you.

233
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:33,015
Of course they can.
Is there any doubt?

234
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,775
I'm not sure your bother Damon

235
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:38,756
understands the importance of duty.

236
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:40,681
Damon left the confederacy

237
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:43,024
on principle.
It was his choice and

238
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:44,902
should be respected.

239
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,535
You'll forgive me if I have
trouble respecting a deserter.

240
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,574
- I never asked for your respect.
- Good for you, Damon.

241
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,576
Because all I have
is disappointment.

242
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,582
You said the town is in trouble?

243
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,859
There's been too many deaths.

244
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,755
It is time for us to fight back,
stop these killers.

245
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,048
- Killers? What are you talking about?
- We live amongst demons.

246
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:12,512
You're being cryptic now, father.
Why don't you just say the word?

247
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,572
Vampires.

248
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,017
They exist.

249
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:19,599
And they live amongst us.

250
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,438
But we have a plan to kill them.

251
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:24,983
And you're going to help us.

252
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,489
My father never approved
of anyone I dated,

253
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,284
which only made me want them more.

254
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:35,913
Of course.

255
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:39,823
- What about you?
- There were a few guys.

256
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,916
Logan isn't the only
loser I've dated.

257
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,294
They ever find him?
Or is he still missing?

258
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,004
He's not missing.

259
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,048
He's in the Bahamas
working on his tan.

260
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,258
Very entitled, that one.

261
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,126
Marches to his own drum.

262
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:54,665
He's a Fell.

263
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,631
They're all snooty.

264
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,120
- Where have you been?
- We're cooking dinner.

265
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:11,780
Is Stefan with you?

266
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,323
He'll be here soon.

267
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,077
How long have you been aware of me?

268
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:20,578
I learned just recently.

269
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,958
- What about your brother?
- You met Damon.

270
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:26,711
Who do you think killed my wife?

271
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:30,215
You certain it was Damon?

272
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,549
I witnessed it.

273
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,486
If you're here for revenge,

274
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,885
this is going to end
very badly for you.

275
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,183
I just want to find out
what happened to my wife.

276
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,751
I thought you just said
that Damon...

277
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,350
I saw him

278
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,017
draining the life out of her.

279
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:52,714
He must have heard me coming.
He just...

280
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:53,974
disappeared.

281
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:56,205
So did her body.

282
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:58,702
They never found her

283
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,710
Damon can never know
why you're here.

284
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,312
He'll kill you without blinking.

285
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,660
I can take care of myself.

286
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:14,426
No, you can't.

287
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:16,651
I can help you.

288
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,033
If you let me.

289
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:30,048
Don't do that.

290
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:31,363
Do what?

291
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,965
You know what.
That move was deliberate.

292
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,890
I was deliberately trying
to get to the sink.

293
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:40,076
Speaking of Stefan, where is he?

294
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,080
He's missing family night,
which I am enjoying immensely.

295
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,044
Is it real?

296
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,213
- Is what real?
- This renewed sense of...

297
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:54,081
brotherhood.

298
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,041
Can I trust him?

299
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:01,481
Yes, you can trust him.

300
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,270
Can I trust him?

301
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,027
I'm wearing vervain, Damon.
It's not going to work.

302
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:16,988
I'm not compelling you.

303
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:20,553
I just want you to answer me.

304
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Honestly.

305
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,333
Of course you can.

306
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:36,633
You can trust me, Mr. Salvatore.
I would never cheat.

307
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,307
I'm losing over here.

308
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,475
Again!

309
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,569
She's good.

310
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,129
I almost believe
she genuinely likes him.

311
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:52,711
Perhaps she does.

312
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,034
She knows father would have
her killed if he knew the truth.

313
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:01,032
Not if we talk to him,
explained how we feel.

314
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,701
- He could help us keep her safe.
- Have you gone mad?

315
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:06,579
No, father would
drive the stake in her himself!

316
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,123
- That's not true. We can trust him.
- Not with this.

317
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,001
Please, promise me
you won't tell him, Stefan.

318
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:22,447
I promise.

319
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,269
There was a time when
I trusted him more than anyone.

320
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,522
Trust breeds trust.
You have to give it to get it.

321
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:35,003
Are you lecturing me?

322
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,720
Do you need to be lectured?

323
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,614
I just want her back.
I'm sure you can understand that.

324
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:47,219
I can understand that you
would do anything for her, yes.

325
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,267
Then you understand

326
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:53,942
what I will do
if anyone gets in my way.

327
00:21:02,188 --> 00:21:04,537
You said you never
played this thing before.

328
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:06,962
I'm a fast learner.
Quick reflexes.

329
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:16,017
Who are you dodging?

330
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,235
This girl Anna.
She can be... persistent.

331
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:21,112
Is she hot?

332
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,157
Yeah yeah, but she can be weird.

333
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,215
Hot trumps weird, trust me.

334
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,954
He is ridiculously hot!

335
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,167
He's an ass.

336
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:38,070
What are you doing
with all this stuff?

337
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:40,395
I thought there might be something

338
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,170
about my birth parents.

339
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,119
Have you told Jeremy?

340
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:46,593
I will.

341
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:48,368
When the time is right.

342
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,174
That's Stefan.

343
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,352
Dude!

344
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,439
Well?

345
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,946
Admit it.

346
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:04,487
I can't sing.

347
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:06,217
You were great.

348
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:09,023
Come on, totally trashed
a Metallica song.

349
00:22:09,148 --> 00:22:12,580
Well, first mistake,
Metallica karaoke?

350
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,707
Well, at least I could admit it.

351
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,747
The woman with
the tattoos loved you.

352
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:19,087
Next time,
I'm going to throw out my Pearl Jam.

353
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:20,797
Next time?

354
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:25,096
So...

355
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,471
- what are your friends up to tonight?
- They're all doing their own thing.

356
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:31,349
Caroline's at her dad's,
Elena's with her boyfriend.

357
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,819
Elena Gilbert, right?

358
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:36,229
- I remember. You guys used to hang out.
- She's my best friend.

359
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:41,067
Yeah, my friends, they all moved away
after graduation, and I didn't.

360
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,194
So we just kind of drifted apart.

361
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:46,361
Elena and I are bonded for life.

362
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:48,776
I can't imagine it either way.

363
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:51,428
- That tight, huh?
- She's my...

364
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:53,287
sister. I mean, I'd die for her.

365
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,627
- Who took it?
- I don't know.

366
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,717
You know what, it's that teacher.
There's something really off about him.

367
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:03,157
He doesn't know anything.

368
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:06,120
- Somebody got to him right before me.
- Who else knew it was there?

369
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:13,016
- Damon, leave him out of it!
- Why, what's the big deal?

370
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,184
So...

371
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:19,002
I heard you found a really
cool journal from back in the day.

372
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:20,883
- Who else did you show it to?
- Huh?

373
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:23,108
Don't ask questions, just spill.

374
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,664
- You're kidding me, right?
- Jer, did you tell anyone

375
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,510
other than Mr. Saltzman
about Jonathan Gilbert's journal?

376
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:30,677
Why is everybody
so obsessed with that thing?

377
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:32,118
Who else did you tell?

378
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,638
- Just that girl Anna.
- The hot weird one?

379
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:37,832
- Wait, who is Anna?
- That's what I want to find out.

380
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:39,885
How do you know her?

381
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:41,923
I just know her.

382
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,443
She wants me to meet her
at the Grill tonight.

383
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:45,568
Perfect.

384
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,550
I'll drive. Come on.

385
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,095
Okay, I'm alone.

386
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,736
<i>Give me all the deets,
Bonnie. I'm dying.</i>

387
00:23:53,861 --> 00:23:56,601
It's going great.
He's a perfect gentleman.

388
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,394
- Gentleman, huh?
- <i>I know!</i>

389
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,280
Boring, huh? I just want to
grab him and lay one on him.

390
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:03,441
- <i>So, why don't you?</i>
- 'cause I'm a chicken.

391
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:07,528
You're a powerful witch goddess.
Come on, seize the day, Broom Hilda.

392
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:10,740
I'm going to text you later
with more details.

393
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:11,958
You better.

394
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:15,497
Where's Damon?

395
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,748
He left to track down Jeremy's friend
Anna, see if there was anything there.

396
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,291
Aren't you gonna go with him?
If he gets to the journal

397
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,252
- before we do then...
- Doesn't matter.

398
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,770
- What is that?
- It's a copy of it.

399
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,965
How did you get it?

400
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:30,681
Well, Mr. Saltzman
made a copy and was

401
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:33,645
- kind enough to loan it to me.
- He did?

402
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:36,516
Not exactly, but I got it.

403
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,421
You just couldn't
live without me, huh?

404
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:46,484
I kinda miss my daily dose
of cute stalker chick.

405
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:47,652
Funny.

406
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:49,064
Let's play.

407
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:03,084
The sheriff was here earlier.

408
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:06,206
He bought large volumes
of the vervain elixir.

409
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,714
Did he try to put his hands
on you again?

410
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,102
Doesn't he always?

411
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:12,343
She's saving herself
for Jonathan Gilbert.

412
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,512
I'm beyond saving. We know that.

413
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,382
How can you be so calm?

414
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:19,725
They're getting closer
to you every day.

415
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,437
We are the respectable ladies
of Mystic Falls.

416
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,871
Thanks to Emily,
we walk the streets in daylight.

417
00:25:24,996 --> 00:25:28,696
- No one will ever suspect us.
- Not unless a human tells them.

418
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:30,815
I'd sooner die.

419
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:33,224
And soon enough, you will.

420
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:38,561
Mrs. Fell is approaching.

421
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:44,167
Thank you, Annabelle.

422
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,207
Here's a reference that
he wrote about Emily.

423
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:02,560
"The Fell family
believed it should be I,

424
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,080
"not them, who protected
the witch's spell book.

425
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:08,024
But I feared she would
haunt me from the hereafter.

426
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,642
They mocked my fear, but
it was Giuseppe Salvatore who..."

427
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,405
Is that your father?

428
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:22,231
"It was Giuseppe Salvatore
who removed my fear.

429
00:26:22,356 --> 00:26:25,632
He told me he would protect
the secret of the spell book.

430
00:26:25,757 --> 00:26:28,307
He said he would carry it
to his grave."

431
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,263
To what do I owe this pleasure?

432
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:41,849
Did I interrupt your writing?

433
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,435
These are the dull musings
of my troubled mind.

434
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:45,895
A great mind.

435
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:48,681
Still. I will carry
the real secrets with me...

436
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,149
To your grave.

437
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,109
And a full grave it will be.

438
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,979
Now, speaking of troubled minds,

439
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:06,249
what's on yours?

440
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:12,296
I have concerns about
your plan for the vampires.

441
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:15,325
And why is that?

442
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,018
We are making the assumption
that all vampires are

443
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:22,513
as evil as they've been characterized,
but what if that's not true?

444
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:25,238
Do you have any evidence
to the contrary?

445
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:27,853
Do you know of any vampires?

446
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,231
No, of course not.

447
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,441
But are we to take what others say

448
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,806
at face value?

449
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:36,112
You always taught us so differently.

450
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:43,757
These creatures
are of the darkest parts of hell.

451
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:46,289
They have the ability
to control your mind,

452
00:27:46,694 --> 00:27:48,144
seduce your spirit.

453
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,050
They are deadly.

454
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,285
They must be destroyed.

455
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:55,402
Those who stand with them,

456
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,384
those who bring shame to their
families will be destroyed as well.

457
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:10,146
I know where it is.

458
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,453
Okay, I give up.

459
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,916
Damn.

460
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,586
You're strong for a little thing.

461
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:37,365
I was wondering how long it
would take you to find me.

462
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,469
Why isn't your father
buried in your family's tomb?

463
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,679
It wasn't built
until well after he died.

464
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,687
Are you sure the grimoire's
in there with him?

465
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,412
As sure as I could be.

466
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,561
Great.

467
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,649
I can do this on my own.

468
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,949
And I said I would do
whatever I can to help.

469
00:28:58,074 --> 00:29:01,970
- I know, and I appreciate that, but...
- This town is my home, Stefan.

470
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:04,766
My friends and family
are here. You're here.

471
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:07,953
I don't want that tomb
opened any more than you do.

472
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:29,767
I'm sorry that you have to do this.

473
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:32,739
What is that?

474
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,313
A gift.

475
00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:35,878
From Damon?

476
00:29:36,837 --> 00:29:38,387
From Emily, actually.

477
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:41,983
And when will you stop
worrying about Damon?

478
00:29:42,752 --> 00:29:44,502
I want you all to myself.

479
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,528
Just as he wants me,

480
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:49,036
but I'm the one who gets
to make all the rules.

481
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,747
- And why is that?
- Because I'm spoiled.

482
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,065
Yes, you are.

483
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,750
And selfish.

484
00:29:56,622 --> 00:29:58,422
And because I can do this.

485
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:01,012
And this.

486
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:10,651
And this.

487
00:30:20,828 --> 00:30:21,828
What?

488
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,447
- What?
- Vervain.

489
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:26,533
What?

490
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,994
Go get the sheriff.
Tell him we have a vampire.

491
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,463
- What? No!
- Do as I say, son!

492
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,923
Nothing that you feel
for her is real.

493
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,593
She's a vampire, Stefan!
A monster!

494
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,887
I fed you vervain hoping
it would expose her.

495
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:51,056
- How did you know?
- Your sympathy for their plight.

496
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:54,215
I didn't raise my sons
to be so weak.

497
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,146
The sheriff, now.
Go, quickly!

498
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,815
Now, son!

499
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:15,255
How long have you been here?

500
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:17,693
I arrived around half-past comet,

501
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:21,086
watching you screw up every
chance you had to open that tomb.

502
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,566
How did you know about the spell?

503
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:25,356
I didn't say much back then,

504
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:27,343
which means I heard everything.

505
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,283
If you've been here the whole time

506
00:31:29,408 --> 00:31:31,661
then why are we just
crossing paths right now?

507
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:34,386
I like to use others
to do my dirty work.

508
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:37,137
Like Logan Fell?

509
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:40,156
Thanks for that, by the way.

510
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:41,857
Little bastard shot me.

511
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,234
Logan was an idiot.

512
00:31:43,554 --> 00:31:45,668
We slipped him some blood
when he started getting

513
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:47,534
all poser slayer with that compas.

514
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:50,032
I needed his family's journal.
I couldn't let him die.

515
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,370
- What'd you want with the Fell journal?
- I thought it contained the location

516
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,842
of the witch's spell book.
I was wrong.

517
00:31:56,373 --> 00:32:00,313
According to her journal, Honorea gave
the grimoire to Jonathan Gilbert.

518
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,586
And, according to this...

519
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,759
He gave it to your father. So now
you're gonna help me find it.

520
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,011
Why would I help you?

521
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,472
'cause you and I both
want that tomb open.

522
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:31,028
Sorry.

523
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,465
I work alone.

524
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:37,449
Well the check's paid.

525
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:40,250
I'm all yours tonight.
What do you want to do?

526
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,375
This.

527
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,965
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Sorry.

528
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:51,302
I just should have waited until
the end of the night to do that.

529
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,511
I didn't mind.

530
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:56,432
- You know, I'm starting to get tired.
- Do you wanna go?

531
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,906
I was going to say let's
have some more coffee,

532
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:01,053
get a caffeine buzz,
and, I don't know,

533
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:03,689
- go out, do something crazy.
- Like what?

534
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,057
Like anything.

535
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:09,078
I'm gonna run to the restroom.

536
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:10,203
All right.

537
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:34,781
What?

538
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:37,431
Not many girls
can say they've done this.

539
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:06,662
Is that it?

540
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,792
Well, what do you know?

541
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:53,132
This is an interesting
turn of events.

542
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,386
I can't let you bring her back.

543
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,511
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:58,025 --> 00:34:59,054
So am I.

545
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:02,808
For thinking for even a second
that I can trust you.

546
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,395
You're not capable of trust.

547
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,936
The fact that you're here
means that you read the journal

548
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,064
and you were planning on
doing this yourself.

549
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:13,052
Of course I was going
to do it by myself,

550
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,070
because the only one
I can count on is me!

551
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,491
You made sure of that
many years ago, Stefan.

552
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:23,528
But you...

553
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:29,248
You had me fooled.

554
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:41,176
So what are you gonna do now?

555
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,265
Because if you try and destroy that,

556
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,333
- I'll rip her heart out.
- You won't kill her.

557
00:35:50,873 --> 00:35:52,373
I can do one better.

558
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:58,155
Give me the book, Stefan.

559
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:00,488
Or I'm snapping her neck.

560
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:03,413
And you and I will have
a vampire girlfriend.

561
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,220
Let her go first.

562
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
The Book.

563
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,376
I'm not going to give this to you
until she is standing next to me.

564
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,033
The problem is, I no longer trust
that you'll give it back!

565
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:17,308
You just did the one thing
that ensures that I will.

566
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,761
No don't take her!

567
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:23,615
Do you know what they'll do to you
if you're branded a sympathizer?

568
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,326
You'll be killed along with them!

569
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,953
Then let me be killed!

570
00:37:40,816 --> 00:37:43,770
Aspirin must be donwstairs.
Is my head supposed to hurt like this?

571
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,646
You'll be fine. That was just a
small amount of blood.

572
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:49,621
It should pass out of
your system by tomorrow.

573
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:54,021
Are you okay?

574
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:57,671
Damon was right. This is...

575
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,640
This is my fault.

576
00:38:12,756 --> 00:38:14,579
I'll help you. We'll get her back.

577
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:17,395
Help me?!
Don't you think you've done enough?

578
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,308
You promised you wouldn't tell him!

579
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:21,583
I didn't think this would happen.

580
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,233
You did this.

581
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:33,286
This is your fault.

582
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,348
I put my faith in my father,

583
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,383
but Damon
put his faith in me, and...

584
00:38:42,356 --> 00:38:43,706
I destroyed that.

585
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,007
This is my fault.

586
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,826
You didn't do anything wrong.

587
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:52,496
Don't forget that.

588
00:38:57,896 --> 00:38:59,946
I'm gonna get you that aspirin.

589
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:13,350
You know you're not
staying the night, right?

590
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:18,204
We're just going to hang out
for a little while.

591
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,274
You're lucky I like you.
Keep the door open.

592
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:22,818
You got it.

593
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,105
Do you have any aspirin?

594
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,287
- Where'd she go?
- She went to the bathroom.

595
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,182
- Where'd who go?
- He has a friend over.

596
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:50,894
What's happening?

597
00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:52,617
Get Emily.

598
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:54,404
And stay hidden.

599
00:39:54,656 --> 00:39:55,934
I'll get us out of here.

600
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,658
Do you see all this? The town's
gone mad running after the demons.

601
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:27,876
You!?

602
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,306
Please.

603
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:39,047
I beg you!

604
00:40:41,212 --> 00:40:43,065
I've got another one over here!

605
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,376
This way!

606
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,507
It'll be all right.
You're going to see her again.

607
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:14,763
I already know how protect them.
I'm going to protect them

608
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,351
<i>There's gotta be more!</i>

609
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,001
