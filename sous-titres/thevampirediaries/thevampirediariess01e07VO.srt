00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,217
<i>Previously on The Vampire Diaries...</i>

2
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:05,671
<i>For over a century,
I have lived in secret until now.</i>

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,716
<i>I know the risk
but I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:10,765
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,638
- You said you don't kill to survive.
- Animal blood keeps me alive

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:16,057
- but not strong as Damon.
- Hello, brother.

7
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,392
Stefan finally fessed up.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,960
Stay away from me.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,438
That necklace contains
an herb called vervain.

10
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,339
It protects you
from being compelled.

11
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:27,464
I will keep your secret,
but I can't be with you.

12
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,946
- What is that?
- It's a very important crystal.

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,158
- Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
- Technically, gran says I'm a witch.

14
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,786
There was a time when this town was

15
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,704
very much aware of vampires.

16
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,374
- Five bodies all drained of blood.
- They've come back.

17
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:46,366
- You just don't wanna die, do you?
- She's transitioning.

18
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:48,005
- Into what?
- A vampire.

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,806
- I don't know what's wrong with her.
- She'll be fine.

20
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,843
It'll all be fine.

21
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,204
I'll make sure that she doesn't hurt
anybody. I promise you.

22
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,224
- Later, man.
- See you, bro.

23
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:40,599
- Everyone's looking for you.
- I know.

24
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:43,170
- What's wrong, Vic?
- I'm so cold.

25
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:45,730
Are you on drugs? Everyone thinks
you're off on a bender.

26
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:46,898
I wish.

27
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:50,151
What happened in those woods?
Those kids that were killed,

28
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,669
what did you see?

29
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:58,274
- I'm so scared.
- Come here.

30
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,571
It's okay. I'll take you home.

31
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,954
- I can't control it.
- Control what?

32
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,079
I am so...

33
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,109
hungry, Ty.

34
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,031
And it won't go away.

35
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:13,697
What are you on?
What drugs did you take?

36
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,277
I want it. I'm so hungry, Ty.

37
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,395
Okay, look,
I'll get you something to eat.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,479
Just sit back.
Let's just get you home.

39
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:24,852
What is wrong with you?

40
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:32,434
Let go of me!

41
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,323
What's going on here?
What's wrong with her?

42
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:40,301
- You don't talk.
- Screw you, dude.

43
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,453
"Dude"? Really? "Dude"?

44
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,623
- Damon, don't.
- Come on. Who's gonna miss this idiot?

45
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,700
Don't you hurt him.

46
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:54,215
Forget what you saw here tonight.
None of us were here.

00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,658
- Sorry.
- No, it's cool, I'm done.

56
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,615
You're up early.
Where are you going?

57
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,513
Police station. They're organizing
the search party for Vicki so...

58
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:52,624
Wait.
Shouldn't you be going to school?

59
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,499
You're kidding me, right?

60
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,246
You shouldn't skip school.

61
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:59,044
If they find her, we'll know.
That's what phones are for.

62
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,719
Your lips keep movin'.
I don't know why.

63
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:23,095
Vicki, where are you?
Are you okay?

64
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,439
Yeah. I'm okay.

65
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,364
<i>Tell me where you are,</i>
and I'll come get you.

66
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,810
I just need some time to
figure things out.

67
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,689
Just know that I'm okay.
Please don't worry about me.

68
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,548
I don't understand
why I gotta stay cooped up here.

69
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,959
- Why can't I just go home?
- Because you're changing.

70
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,034
And you don't wanna it alone.

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,250
There's nothin' about that
Logan guy I killed in here, not a word.

72
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:55,461
- Someone's covering it up.
- What is that?

73
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:58,176
This is a very special,
very old compass.

74
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,678
What was Logan Fell doing with it?.
Aren't you curious?

75
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:02,963
If you're so worried
that somebody's onto you,

76
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:05,754
- why don't you just leave town?
- We should all be worried.

77
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,099
I'm hungry.
Do you have anything to eat?

78
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,970
Here.

79
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,809
- What is it?
- It's what you're craving.

80
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,358
Don't lie to her.

81
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:23,322
It's so not what you're craving,
but it'll do in a pinch, right?

82
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:25,991
- What is it?
- Yeah, what is it? Is it skunk?

83
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,870
Saint Bernard? Bambi?

84
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,175
Go on. Give it a try.

85
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,409
She's new. She needs people blood.

86
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:33,115
She can't sustain on that stuff.

87
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,105
Why can't I have people blood?

88
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,080
Because it's wrong
to prey on innocent people.

89
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,933
You don't have to kill to feed.
Just find someone really tasty

90
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,092
and erase their memory
afterwards. So easy.

91
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,974
There's no guarantee
that you can control yourself, okay?

92
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,595
It takes years to learn that.
You could easily kill somebody

93
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,374
and you'll have to carry that with you
for the rest of your life,

94
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,455
which if I haven't made clear,
is eternity.

95
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,235
Don't listen to him. He walks on
a moral plane way out of our eye line.

96
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:01,336
I say snatch, eat, erase.

97
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,820
Look at me.

98
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,463
We choose our own path.

99
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:08,155
Our values and our actions,
they define who we are.

100
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,869
Okay, Count Deepak.

101
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,430
I am outta here.

102
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:18,878
Can I have some more?

103
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:39,773
Is Stefan here?

104
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,167
Where is he?

105
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,609
And good morning to you,
little miss "I'm on a mission."

106
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:50,200
How can you be so arrogant and glib
after everything that you've done?

107
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,164
And how can you be
so brave and stupid

108
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,164
to call a vampire arrogant and glib?

109
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,916
- If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
- Yes, you would.

110
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,684
- But I'm not.
- Yet.

111
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:03,839
- Where is Stefan?
- He's upstairs

112
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:07,448
Singing "the rain in spain."
Knock yourself out.

113
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:30,365
Where is Vicki?

114
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,327
She's upstairs.

115
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:38,156
What happens now?
Because my brother is out there

116
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:40,242
searching for her
with the rest of the town.

117
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,417
- What I tell him?
- I'm working with her but

118
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,754
it's gonna take time.

119
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,156
She's a very volatile
and impulsive personality.

120
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:49,885
She's a drug user. All that's gonna play
a part in how she responds to this.

121
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,175
So she's a vampire with issues?

122
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:55,072
What am I supposed to do?
Because I am lying

123
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:57,851
to everyone that I care about.
What's gonna happen to her?

124
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,952
I'm gonna keep her here with
me until I know that she's safe.

125
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,427
How long is that?

126
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,560
We can talk about that later.

127
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,513
- How are you?
- How am I?

128
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:14,243
You're kidding?

129
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:23,119
Was our family burned
in the witch trials?

130
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:28,136
No, the girls that were persecuted
in Salem were entirely innocent.

131
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,431
You have to have more than
ignorance to trap a real witch.

132
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:34,654
How did we end up in Mystic Falls?

133
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:37,996
Our family fled Salem in 1692

134
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:39,571
and relocated here.

135
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:44,301
Our ancestors lived in secrecy
for over a hundred years.

136
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,692
It's important that we still do.

137
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,027
Gran, everybody knows
you're a witch.

138
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:52,194
They also know it's absurd,
it can't be true.

139
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:56,451
I'm just a kooky lady
that teaches occult at the university.

140
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,739
No one really believes.

141
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,740
They just poke fun.

142
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:02,156
And let 'em.

143
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,168
Don't let 'em know the truth.

144
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:07,259
Where's the witchcraft?

145
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:10,477
I mean, you've been
talking history for two days.

146
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:12,636
I wanna get to the fun part.

147
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,547
It's not meant to be fun.

148
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,722
It's real, and it's serious,

149
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:20,124
and you must understand
it before you practice it.

150
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,496
Aren't you late for school?

151
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,065
We shouldn't have
trusted that Logan.

152
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,196
- Weasel with the watch.
- How many are we dealing with?

153
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:53,517
The coroner thinks one. Something about
the wound radius and the jaw pattern.

154
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,655
Are we in danger?
If it found the watch

155
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,028
then it knows we know,
and could it come after us?

156
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:01,431
And should I even be saying, "it"?
Or is it a he or a she?

157
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:05,145
If it has historical town's knowledge
then it'll know where the watch is from.

158
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,205
So, yes,
we could very much be in danger.

159
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,690
So what do we do?

160
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,601
Just keep it quiet. We can't have
the entire town aware of this.

161
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:14,129
We need to find him
before he finds us.

162
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:28,666
I heard they're putting together
a search party for Vicki.

163
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,650
She just called. She's okay.

164
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,684
Good. It's great.
I figured you must have been

165
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:35,884
- going out of your mind.
- Little bit, yeah.

166
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:38,107
I was just gonna offer.

167
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:40,185
You know,
if there's anything I could do.

168
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,610
I appreciate it.

169
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,934
I have got your costume.
It's all here.

170
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,476
- Seriously?
- Come on.

171
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,376
Can someone please be
excited that it's Halloween?

172
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,676
I just wanna have fun,
you know, just some

173
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,156
silly, fluffy,

174
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,616
Damon-free fun.

175
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:02,494
Isn't this the one
you got from Damon?

176
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,122
Wear it. Toss it. I don't care.
I just want it gone.

177
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,499
Have you seen Elena?
Do we know what she's wearing?

178
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,952
I was with grams all weekend.
I haven't talked to her.

179
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:12,777
Maybe she's with Stefan.

180
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:15,549
Riding to his castle
on his white horse.

181
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,168
Don't be bitter.
It provokes wrinkles.

182
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,481
Coffee is our friend.

183
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:25,027
It's the caffeine.
It circulates through our veins

184
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,502
and it warms our body so
we're not so cold to the touch.

185
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:31,177
What if I wanna drink human blood?

186
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:33,682
You're gonna have to learn
to live with that urge

187
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:36,550
and fight it on a daily
basis one day at a time.

188
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,691
Don't start with that
whole 12 steps thing.

189
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:41,184
School counselor has
been down that road,

190
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,243
- and it doesn't work for me.
- It can work. It's your choice.

191
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,288
So you've never tasted human blood?

192
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,046
- Not in a long time.
- How long?

193
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:56,422
Years and years.

194
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:00,272
I'm not proud of my past behavior.

195
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:03,262
Does this sketchy feeling
ever go away?

196
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:07,059
It's like I have a massive hangover.
This daylight thing is a bitch.

197
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:10,980
I need more blood.
Where's your bathroom? I have to pee.

198
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,805
Why do I have to pee?
I thought I was dead.

199
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,599
I'm going to...

200
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,364
I'm gonna get her some more.

201
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,366
All right.

202
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,736
I'll be quick.

203
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,634
False alarm.
My body's feeling really funky.

204
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:43,615
It's a good funk, but it's weird.

205
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:47,972
Who are you calling?

206
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,670
- You can't see Jeremy anymore.
- Come on. Don't you start.

207
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:55,649
- I'm gonna see whoever I wanna see.
- Even though you could hurt him?

208
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,847
- I would never hurt Jeremy.
- I know you think that

209
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:02,405
but I can't take that risk.
You're gonna have to let Jeremy go now.

210
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:03,609
Really?

211
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,081
And how long have you been preparing
a "you're not good enough" speech?

212
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:09,328
I'm assuming it predates
the whole vampire thing.

213
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,805
All I'm saying is

214
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,733
Jeremy is not getting
involved in any of this.

215
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,167
I mean it, Vicki.

216
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:17,336
Or what?

217
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:23,592
Let's get one thing straight,
you perky little bitch.

218
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,985
You had my brother whipped
for 15 years,

219
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,609
15 years, and then you dumped him.

220
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,431
When I look at you,
that is all I see,

221
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,138
just so you know.

222
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:36,106
And I'm gonna see Jeremy whenever
I wanna see Jeremy, because

223
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,034
I have some fun
new toys to play with

224
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,901
and I won't think twice
about ripping your little head off.

225
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:44,542
You got it?

226
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:56,735
- She threatened me.
- She's on edge.

227
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,008
Imagine every sense in your
body operating at super speed.

228
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,368
She's uncomfortable
in her own skin and then

229
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,342
- when you throw in her other issues...
- How long before it settles?

230
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:07,857
- Hours? Days? Weeks?
- There's no rule book.

231
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,931
How long before
you learned to control it?

232
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,018
A while, but I didn't have anybody
helping me. I had to do it on my own.

233
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:17,042
The thing is it's hard
to resist certain people,

234
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:20,376
especially when you're new. It's
difficult to separate your feelings.

235
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:24,401
Love, lust, anger, desire...
it can all blur into one urge, hunger.

236
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,699
- What does that mean?
- It means that Jeremy can't see her,

237
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,119
not now. She might not be able
to resist him and she could hurt him.

238
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,288
Or worse.

239
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:36,625
I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.

240
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:39,096
I need to get going.

241
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,831
Please, Stefan.
There's only so much I can take.

242
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,241
What are you doing?

243
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,816
Just contemplating
the next hundred years.

244
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,848
Why did you do it?

245
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,409
I was...

246
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:11,617
bored.

247
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:16,642
You did this to me out of boredom?

248
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:19,412
It's one of the pitfalls
of eternity.

249
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,623
Now I'm bored.
And all I can think about is blood.

250
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:28,167
I just want some blood.
I can't think about anything else.

251
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,842
- What is that about?
- That'll ease up.

252
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,055
You've just been cooped up all day.

253
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:34,764
Let's go.

254
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:36,379
Where?

255
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:39,688
Your life was pathetic.
Your afterlife doesn't have to be.

256
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:46,970
What are you doing?

257
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:50,073
She's been cooped up in your room
all day. She's not Anne Frank.

258
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:53,216
Now's not the time for this.

259
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:56,072
If you're gonna teach her, teach her.
Show her what it's all about.

260
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,442
She could hurt someone.

261
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,367
I'm not takin' her to Disneyland.
We're goin' in the front yard.

262
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:02,558
Come on.

263
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,350
Bad idea, Damon.

264
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:12,559
She's a vampire, Stefan.
She should know the perks.

265
00:16:12,684 --> 00:16:13,684
Like what?

266
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:16,383
Like...

267
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,354
How did you do that?

268
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:29,321
Come on, Vicki. Live a little.

269
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,156
No pun intended.

270
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:50,414
My bad.

271
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:20,830
Is that you?

272
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,376
Get in here.

273
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,881
In a minute. I...

274
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,535
Please come inside.
I've been worried.

275
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,926
Thank God you're okay.

276
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:50,396
Where were you, Vic?

277
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,696
It's no big deal. Drop it already.

278
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,137
Three people
were murdered in the woods.

279
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:58,339
The cops were lookin' for you.
They wanna question you.

280
00:17:58,464 --> 00:18:01,538
- They know where I live.
- Everyone was worried about you.

281
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,289
I'm back now. Just let it go.

282
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:07,045
Are you kidding?
I had a freakin' search party out

283
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,587
lookin' for you while you were off
on your crazy drug trip

284
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,380
and you want me to let it go?

285
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,178
- My head hurts.
- You think?

286
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,271
- What are you doing here?
- Is Vicki home?

287
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,006
- Yeah.
- Can I see her, please?

288
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,053
Don't let him in.
I don't want him in here.

289
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:32,719
- Did he do something to you?
- I just don't want him in here.

290
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,808
Just let me come in so
I can explain myself.

291
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,490
I don't know what's going on
but I think you should leave now.

292
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,992
Please, now, Stefan.

293
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:48,648
You gotta call me, Vic. I don't get it.
What's going on with you?

294
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:50,587
Just call me, please.

295
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,940
So... do you wanna hang out tonight?

296
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:01,112
We could go to
the Halloween thing at school.

297
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:02,265
Could be fun.

298
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,227
Cool. Sure. Sounds... sounds fun.

299
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,445
Can't wait.

300
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,846
I know you're upset about Vicki.
I heard she called Matt.

301
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:13,509
But you can't be with her.
She needs to get better.

302
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:15,737
The best thing you can
do for her is let her go.

303
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,969
What does that even mean,
"Let her go"?

304
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:21,659
Okay, sure. Since we're such experts
on letting people go, right?

305
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:23,625
I know you may not see it

306
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,955
but trust me, Jer.
It's for the best.

307
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:32,929
For months after mom and dad died,
I felt like crap, like,

308
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:35,048
"nothing really even mattered" crap.

309
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,498
Now all of a sudden, I get these
moments and things started to feel

310
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,721
just a little bit better and Vicki
was in every single one of 'em.

311
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,929
So you may not see it but trust me.

312
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,269
Keeping me away from
her is not for the best.

313
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,450
Cider for the ladies?
It's a Lockwood special.

314
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,090
No way. Last year,
I was hung over until Thanksgiving.

315
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:49,163
Lightweight. I am going to drink

316
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,583
until someone is hot enough
to make out with.

317
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,668
Sounds like a plan.

318
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,366
- How many martinis have you had?
- Don't start with me.

319
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,467
Can we go now? We're late
for the Halloween party. Let's go.

320
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,735
So go ahead.

321
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,923
I'd like to finish my drink.

322
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:28,543
Let me guess.

323
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,705
Daisy Buchanan.

324
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,458
I love a good "Gatsby" look.

325
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,440
I've met you before.

326
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:37,508
Aren't you
Caroline Forbes' boyfriend?

327
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,772
She had
a schoolgirl crush on me but...

328
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:42,967
it was cute
but I had to let her down easy.

329
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:44,636
It's Damon, right?

330
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,095
You remember.

331
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,711
Well, you have a face
that's hard to forget.

332
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,440
What's your last name, Damon?

333
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:57,690
- Are you any relation to Zach?
- Zach's my uncle.

334
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:01,626
How do you know Zach?

335
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,383
Are you okay?

336
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:10,302
I think there's something in my eye.

337
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,580
I know Zach from
the Founder's council.

338
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,525
You know, the Salvatores were
one of this town's original settlers.

339
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:20,342
Yes, they were.

340
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:24,676
I wasn't aware that Zach was a member.
I just recently moved back home

341
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,929
and haven't really had a chance
to meet many of his friends.

342
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,002
Will you tell him to return my calls?
I've left several messages.

343
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:33,177
Zach went out of tow for a bit.

344
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,523
But if it's about the vervain...

345
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:40,733
You know about the vervain?

346
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,201
I'm a Salvatore.

347
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:44,862
- Of course I do.
- Of course.

348
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:47,787
Cheers.

349
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,297
You went
with last year's costume too.

350
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:14,559
I didn't know that I was coming
till an hour ago.

351
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,777
Me neither.

352
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:23,542
And you're going as...

353
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,533
you?

354
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,852
He's not talking to me right
now. We got into a fight.

355
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,537
I got into it with Vic too
when she got home.

356
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,268
I'm trying not to smother her
tonight but part of me

357
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:39,642
- didn't wanna let her out of my sight.
- She's here?

358
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,067
You can't miss her. She's a vampire.

359
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,046
Where did Jeremy go?

360
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,549
- What's the matter?
- I've gotta find him.

361
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,165
What, you're following me now?

362
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,033
You didn't really give me
much of a choice.

363
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:26,214
- Let me out of here.
- You shouldn't be here.

364
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,634
Crowds like this it makes it even harder
for you to keep yourself under control.

365
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,402
- I'm fine.
- Really?

366
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,125
No headache?
Your stomach's not screamin' at you?

367
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,723
You're not feeling lightheaded

368
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,527
or anxious or cranky, like if
someone looks at you the wrong way

369
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,499
you could just rip their head off?

370
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:43,439
Do you wanna know what that's called?
It's called hunger

371
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:46,028
and it's only gonna get
worse and worse

372
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:49,703
every minute that you pretend
like it's not controlling you.

373
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,574
So you need vervain?

374
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,472
My husband and I only have left
what his parents left him

375
00:24:57,597 --> 00:25:01,221
and Zach had promised
that he could supply us with more.

376
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:05,253
Well, I talk to him all the time
so why don't I just ask him?

377
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:13,419
How much do you need?
I mean, how many people, you think?

378
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,388
Well, there's our children

379
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,356
- of course.
- Of course.

380
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:19,935
And... friends, family,

381
00:25:20,277 --> 00:25:22,177
and everyone on the council.

382
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:25,989
The council?

383
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,840
Zach knows how many.

384
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:31,475
But, you know what, I am so late.

385
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,560
My husband is not going
to be happy with me.

386
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:38,954
Well, are you happy
with your husband?

387
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:43,708
- You're flirting with me.
- You flirted with me first.

388
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,876
True.

389
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:50,164
Let me escort you to the school.
It's not safe out there alone.

390
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:52,689
I mean,
I've seen ten vampires tonight.

391
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:55,776
Well, if only the real ones
were as easy to find.

392
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,601
How's that search goin'?

393
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,434
We had the Founder's party and
anyone who arrived during the day

394
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,745
was eliminated as a suspect.

395
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:07,985
And all the rest were
just dead ends, so...

396
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:11,189
I gotta go.

397
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,008
- Thank God.
- What's the matter?

398
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,205
I lost track of Jeremy.
I was worried.

399
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,673
What's goin' on?

400
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,249
Everything's fine.

401
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:27,460
I told you to quit bothering me.

402
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,421
- No. Vicki, don't do this.
- He won't leave me alone.

403
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:32,965
- You need to back off, man.
- Matt, it's okay.

404
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,468
It's not okay.
What the hell is your problem?

405
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,772
She's gone.

406
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:45,603
I'm trying to help her.

407
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,915
- You scared the hell out of me.
- I'm sorry.

408
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,586
Come on. Come on.

409
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,559
So...

410
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,686
Where'd Caroline run off to?

411
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,361
Do yourself a favor, Damon,
and don't ask me about Caroline.

412
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,400
- So loyal.
- Just stay away from her.

413
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,704
Where'd you get that?

414
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,106
From a friend.

415
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,785
- You know that's mine, don't you?
- Not anymore.

416
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,117
Funny.

417
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,623
- I'd like it back, please.
- I'm not giving it to you.

418
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,978
I'll give it to Caroline
and she can give it to you

419
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:52,753
- if she feels like it.
- Or I could just take it right now.

420
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,129
I was so worried about you.

421
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:46,754
I'm fine now, but...

422
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,592
I gotta leave.

423
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:50,647
What? Where?

424
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,459
I gotta get out of here, Jer.
I can't live at home with Matt.

425
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:57,142
He just doesn't get it.

426
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:59,567
No, you can't. You can't just leave.

427
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:02,531
Come with me.

428
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:12,542
If you come with me, we
can be together forever.

429
00:29:35,462 --> 00:29:38,212
You're taking that
costume a little too far.

430
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:47,493
What? What is it?

431
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:04,403
What the hell?!

432
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:40,313
Go.

433
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,555
Get inside.

434
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:42,811
Go!

435
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:45,595
Get him out of here.

436
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,244
What?

437
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,762
<i>I need your help.</i>

438
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,185
- What happened to you?
- I did something. I don't know.

439
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,105
It came from my necklace.

440
00:32:21,592 --> 00:32:23,142
Where'd you get that?

441
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:26,374
It's part of my costume.
It's a piece of junk.

442
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:31,567
That piece of junk belonged to one of
the most powerful witches of our family.

443
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,395
Let me show you.

444
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:41,574
There she is.

445
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:43,189
Emily Bennett,

446
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:47,006
your
great-great-great-great-grandmother.

447
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,894
And there's your necklace.

448
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:03,732
You should go. I got this.

449
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:07,748
You did this.

450
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,658
This is your fault.

451
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,810
You confuse me
for someone with remorse.

452
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:20,396
None of this matters to me,

453
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,749
none of it.

454
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:26,086
People die around you.
How could it not matter?

455
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,154
It matters, and you know it.

456
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,088
You need to leave.

457
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,840
Your wounds are bleeding

458
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,647
and you need to leave.

459
00:34:16,278 --> 00:34:17,578
Have you seen...

460
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:19,180
What happened?

461
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,349
Nothing.

462
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:24,103
Some idiot with some fake blood
got me. I'm gonna go home and shower.

463
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,561
I can't find Vicki.

464
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:27,905
She totally bailed on me.

465
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,750
I don't know where she is.

466
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,990
Is this what I'm in for,

467
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,308
a lifetime of worrying about her?

468
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:44,622
You're a good brother, Matt.

469
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,040
Maybe she went home.

470
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:51,865
Maybe.

471
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,139
Where is he?

472
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,383
Inside.

473
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:01,434
Do you understand
what happened tonight?

474
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:06,522
I don't understand.

475
00:36:06,808 --> 00:36:09,080
I mean, I know what I saw but...

476
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,685
I don't understand.

477
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,600
She was going to kill me...

478
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:17,966
Now she's dead. Vicki's dead.

479
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,456
I'm so sorry, Jer.

480
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:23,889
Make it stop. It hurts.

481
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:26,489
It's okay. It's okay.

482
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:30,097
Why does everybody
have to die on me?

483
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,984
Oh, my God. Come here.

484
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,790
Are you okay?

485
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,132
I wanted to help her.

486
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,600
But instead...

487
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,895
How's he doin'?

488
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:54,653
He's a mess.

489
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,984
I don't want him going
through this again. He's just a kid.

490
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:03,989
Elena, what can I do? What can I do
to help? I'll do anything.

491
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,825
Can you make him forget?

492
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,121
Please.

493
00:38:12,053 --> 00:38:14,452
I don't know how he'll
ever get past this.

494
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:17,080
I just want him to forget
everything that happened.

495
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:20,329
If I did it, there's no
guarantee that it would work...

496
00:38:20,454 --> 00:38:21,954
because of who I am,

497
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:23,825
because of how I live.

498
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:27,322
I don't have the ability
to do it right.

499
00:38:27,663 --> 00:38:28,763
I can do it.

500
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,868
If this is what you want...

501
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:39,572
I'll do it.

502
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,200
It's what I want.

503
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,129
What do you want him to know?

504
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:01,913
I want you to tell him

505
00:39:03,128 --> 00:39:04,628
that Vicki left town

506
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:07,552
and she's not coming back,

507
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:11,446
that he shouldn't look for her
or worry about her.

508
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:16,092
He's gonna miss her, but
he knows it's for the best.

509
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:39,017
Part of me wishes that
I could forget, too...

510
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:41,918
forget meeting you,

511
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:46,667
finding out what you are and
everything that's happened since.

512
00:39:48,216 --> 00:39:49,916
If that's what you want.

513
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,490
Yes...

514
00:39:54,002 --> 00:39:55,006
it is.

515
00:39:58,248 --> 00:39:59,248
Because...

516
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:02,151
I don't want it to be like this.

517
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:06,108
I don't wanna feel like this.

518
00:40:11,088 --> 00:40:12,188
But I can't.

519
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:16,731
With everything that's happened...

520
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,751
I can't lose the way
I feel about you.

521
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:34,984
It's done.
