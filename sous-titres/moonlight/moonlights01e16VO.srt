1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,510
<i>Previously on "moonlight"...</i>

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,550
You ever think about becoming
a civilian investigator?

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,830
I did some investigating at
"buzz wire," but I'm not a cop.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,370
<i>You don't have to be,but you would
have to work for me. Mick,Beth...</i>

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,450
This is Sara--Sara Whitley.
(Beth) what happened to her?

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,140
He tried to turn her. I fed her
my blood, but it didn't work.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,680
All these years,Josef,
you ranting about how

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,340
It could never work
between us and humans.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,120
You gonna try and make
your thing with Beth work?

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,980
Children are a part of most
normal human relationships.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,350
Our relationship being
neither normal nor human.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,790
But Josef was right.
Vampires can't have kids.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,980
I just didn't know how
much I wanted a family

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,090
Until I almost had one.
Family's not only about d.N.A.

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,770
Tonight hearst college
honors Josef Kostan,

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,140
Whose generous donation
has made possible

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,610
The Sara Whitley memorial sports arena,

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,000
The new home of the hearst college
Rough riders basketball team!

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,160
To commemorate this event,
we're retiring the jersey

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,580
Of the young man who led our team

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,490
To the national championship last year.

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,260
He may have gone to the pros,

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,480
but he'll always be Hearst's
favorite son. (Laughter)

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,330
Ladies and gentlemen--
Number 24--Dominic michaels!

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>(Mick) Josef Kostan celebrated
as a civic-Minded entrepreneur?</i>

26
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,030
<i>Definitely worth putting
on the monkey suit for.</i>

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,030
<i>And of course, there
are the fringe benefits.</i>

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,360
<i>Like spending the evening with Beth.</i>

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,480
This is great. I feel like I'm
back at my high school prom.

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,580
You know,prom wasn't really
big back in the 1700s...

31
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,740
High school,either. The
plague--The plague was big.

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,960
So what's your connection to hearst?

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,920
Did you attend the college?
No,no. I founded it.

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,940
(Chuckles) lost a bet
with william randolph.

35
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,340
I like the dress. Oh,thank you.

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,830
Is it valentino? Civil service
doesn't pay quite that well.

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,880
Right. Thank you.

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,650
So how's the whole civilian
investigator thing going?

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,320
I don't think Mick likes your new boss.

40
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,120
He's still trying to
decide if Talbot has

41
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,200
Romantic intentions towards me. Oh,nice.
Mick's not usually the jealous type.

42
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,640
Speaking of jealous... ooh,don't
worry. Mick isn't suicidal enough

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,840
<i>To hit on my date. Your
date? Let me guess--</i>

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,890
She was born to hungarian
aristocracy in 1715,

45
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,390
Danced "swan lake"
with the bolshoi ballet

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,620
Before you turned her?

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,680
Actually,Simone was born in reseda,1980,

48
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,860
And nobody turned her.

49
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,940
Your girlfriend's a human?

50
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,700
She's not my girlfriend.
She's one of my lawyers--

51
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,930
Quite an up-And-Comer,
and a very willing source

52
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,430
Of liquid refreshment.
You drink her blood?

53
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,170
Usually only on tuesdays and fridays,

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,530
But she wanted to come to the
party. Simone,this is Beth Turner.

55
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,440
Hi. Mick was just telling me
about you--All good things. Hi.

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,970
Josef's just told me about you,too. Oh!

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,440
Well,if you'll excuse
us, time for a drink,

58
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,690
And,uh,the champagne
just ain't cuttin' it.

59
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,570
And we'll be right back.

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,050
(Lowers voice) she just
lets him drink her blood?

61
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,420
Yeah,it's not uncommon.

62
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,700
A lot of vampires have,
uh,human... donors.

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,700
We call them "freshies."

64
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,740
Is it like a paid arrangement,
or friends with benefits?

65
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,860
Well,it depends on the circumstances.
So I s--I suppose you've had freshies.

66
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,390
I've been a vampire
for over 50 years now.

67
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,640
I take that as a yes. How many? I don't
know off the top of my head. Not many.

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,070
Rough guesstimate? (Man) back off,Hank!

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,070
Dominic,don't!

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,050
Cool off,Hank,or get out.

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,470
All right?

72
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,110
Who are those two?

73
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,430
It's Dominic's managers--
Emma and Jackson monaghan.

74
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,280
They've got Josef courtside
seats to every laker game

75
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,880
Since wilt chamberlain played for them.

76
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,310
Dominic's managers are vampires?

77
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,290
Yeah. They've been married for
something like 150 years. 150 years?

78
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,230
That gives a whole new meaning
to "till death do us part."

79
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,640
You want to dance?

80
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,510
Yeah.

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,920
(Gavin Rossdale - Love Remains The Same)

82
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,500
150 years with one person?

83
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,760
That seems like a long time.

84
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,760
Well, it depends who you're with.

85
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,710
How long were you and coraline married?

86
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,490
Technically,33 years,

87
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,260
And that did feel like
a really long time.

88
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,400
But here you are,dipping your
toe in the dating pool again. Ah.

89
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,120
Do you realize this is
our fourth official date?

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,210
Define "official."

91
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,010
Any outing that doesn't
involve dead bodies.

92
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,750
You are such a romantic.

93
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,450
You know that?

94
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,150

95
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,520

<i>* everything will change</i>

97
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,350
It's Dominic.

98
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,370
Simone!

99
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,040
(Simone) I didn't do it.

100

Simone?

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,120
Hi.

106
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,860
Hey. D.A. Talbot asked
me to speak to you.

107
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,400
That's right.

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,670
And Mick told me that you
work for the d.A.'S office.

109
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,680
And you used to be a reporter? Mm-Hmm.

110
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,750
I think we can both agree that
I've got a pretty lame story.

111
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,100
I wouldn't want any of my
clients going to court with it.

112
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,070
But I didn't kill Dominic.

113
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,890
You told Talbot that he
was already in the tank

114
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,050
When you found him. I
was trying to get him out.

115
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,030
I mean,it was... stupid
and--And too late,anyway.

116
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,450
So why didn't you tell
Talbot you were with Josef?

117
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,700
Because we were,uh...

118
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,490
And then afterward,I...

119
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,520
I went to the bathroom
to get cleaned up.

120
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,610
But at least if you were with Josef,

121
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,240
It gives you some kind of alibi.

122
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,040
But then that would
give the police a reason

123
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,820
To look at Josef more
closely. I can't risk that.

124
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,950
I mean, you know what it's like.

125
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,090
Keeping their secret is the number one rule. 
it's weird talking about them with someone else.

126
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,030
We're members of a very
exclusive club,you and I.

127
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,730
I know it's none of my business,

128
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,660
But your arrangement with Josef...

129
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,990
Are you ever afraid
that he'll go too far,

130
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,550
That he'll accidentally turn you?

131
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,810
Josef's careful,

132
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,280
Although,yeah, sometimes I...

133
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,800
I do wonder.

134
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,570
You'd want him to turn you?

135
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,650
No. (Chuckles)

136
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,300
I mean,no,of--Of...
of course not.

137
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,820
Beth,can I talk to you
for a minute? Thank you.

138
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,090
Did she tell you anything new?

139
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,090
No.

140
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,090
Look,if there was some kind of
kinky gone wrong in the hot tub,

141
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,020
She should just say so.

142
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,710
Why do you think there was something
going on between Simone and Dominic?

143
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,700
Dominic's coach said she
came to all his games.

144
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,360
She even left with him a few times.

145
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,810
Sounds like something to me.

146
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,750
Have you interviewed Hank bishop yet?

147
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,230
He and Dominic got into it at the party.

148
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,620
No,he was gone by the
time the cops got there.

149
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,890
They're still looking for him.
How long are you gonna keep her?

150
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,460
Till I figure out what she's hiding.

151
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,230
$100 million worth of architecture,

152
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,000
And all the papers talk
about is Dominic's death.

153
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,540
At least I get a write-Off.

154
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,440
Hey.

155
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,910
Where's Simone? Talbot's
still holding her.

156
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,000
He's not sure if Dominic's
death was an accident or not.

157
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,930
He said Simone knew Dominic.

158
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,190
Well,she never said anything to me.

159
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,050
Talbot thinks they
were sleeping together.

160
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,920
Well,we're not exclusive.

161
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,550
And anyway,what Simone does when
she's not with me is her business.

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,250
How very egalitarian of you.

163
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,490
Wow,that's a big word.
Look,forget Simone.

164
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,920
Okay,there's too many
vampires mixed up in this.

165
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,210
Look,don't worry. We'll find
out what happened to Dominic

166
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,350
Before the cops start
asking the wrong questions.

167
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,570
We'll start with Emma and
Jackson,Dominic's managers.

168
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,370
Good. I'm going home.

169
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,400
It's past my bedtime.

170
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,380
Josef's upset. I think he's jealous,

171
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,420
And that blood isn't the only bodily
fluid that he and Simone are exchanging.

172
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,250
It's hard to believe
he'd get that involved.

173
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,490
With a freshie?

174
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,910
Especially with a freshie.

175
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,860
Josef has his rules.

176
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,540
(Chuckles) Josef said you'd be coming by

177
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,270
And that you're--
How shall we say--

178
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,240
Friend of the family. I guess I am,yeah.

179
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,660
(Chuckles) so I saw you
with Jackson at the party.

180
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,830
How did you two meet?

181
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,370
Oh,I came over from
ireland during the famine,

182
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,490
Buried my family there.

183
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,980
I was turned on the ship,
never even saw who did it.

184
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,250
How horrible.

185
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,610
Yes,well, my brother was a boxer.

186
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,220
So when I landed in new
york, I went to the fights,

187
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,770
Searching for something familiar,

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,020
And Jackson was there.

189
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,650
The moment I saw him,

190
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,880
He felt like home.

191
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,850
He made you feel safe.

192
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,610
You know, he didn't care what I was.

193
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,300
That's how I knew he was the one.

194
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,550
So he let you turn him? Mm-Hmm.

195
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,040
He wanted to be with me... forever.

196
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,970
Just wish I'd known
about the snoring first.

197
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,900
So... after all this time,

198
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,780
No regrets?

199
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,170
No,not one.

200
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,800
150 years later,

201
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,760
I can still remember exactly
what Jackson was wearing

202
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,870
The night we first met.

203
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,200
So what were Dominic and Hank
fighting about at the party?

204
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,860
Hank was on the hearst
team with Dominic.

205
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,470
They would compete for
everything--Playing time,

206
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,440
Girls,you name it. Any particular girls?

207
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,750
Dominic was sowing his wild oats.

208
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,520
Do they still say that? I...

209
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,950
He wasn't mature enough
for anything serious.

210
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,880
Do you think Hank is capable of murder?

211
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,380
Dominic made the big time.

212
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,400
Hank thought it should be him.

213
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,260
There was a lot of bad blood there.

214
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,750
That's beautiful.

215
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,350
Gettin' soft after all these years?

216
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,810
Hearst was in my march madness bracket.

217
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,640
This guy helped me win the office pool.

218
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,510
Can't a man grieve?

219
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,670
C.O.D.?

220
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,520
Neck snapped. Accident or murder?

221
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,440
<i>Not sure,but I was wondering
about all the vamp smell on him.</i>

222
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,500
Well,he was around a lot
of vampires last night.

223
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,130
Dominic had sex right before he died.

224
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,320
Yup. Crime scene guys
found blood on him--

225
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,950
Pretty degraded from the chlorine
and other chemicals in the water,

226
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,730
but the type was
b-Positive--Not Dominic's.

227
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,220
So it could be his partner's.

228
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,930
Can you get ahold of that blood sample?

229
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,190
Gary the forensic hematologist

230
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,480
Owes me serious for march madness.

231
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,250
Make yourself at home. I always do.

232
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,820
What are we celebrating?
Simone's release.

233
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,230
The d.A. Can only keep someone in
for 24 hours without probable cause.

234
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,100
But they haven't cleared you yet.

235
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,760
And that's your job. I really
appreciate you and Beth's help.

236
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,900
Right.

237
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,560
Simone...

238
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,350
What exactly was your
relationship with Dominic?

239
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,130
I did some work for his family and

240
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,240
ended up following his
career pretty closely

241
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,820
Yeah? You never told me that.

242
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,110
Well,I didn't want you to get the
wrong idea. What? Did he hit on you?

243
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,420
Occasionally. Really?

244
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,760
But then again,Dominic hit
on every woman he ever met.

245
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,450
I always turned him down. Mm.

246
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,590
Yeah,well,the police found
blood on Dominic's body...

247
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,170
B-Positive. You see? There
you go. Simone's cleared.

248
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,900
I'm b-Negative. Ah. Still,I think
we should give the police a sample.

249
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,930
Look,there's a much
easier way to settle this.

250
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,750
Josef,don't. (Snarls)

251
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,150
Here.

252
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,830
For professional
purposes only,of course.

253
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,910
Hi,Beth.

254
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,580
We were just having drinks.

255
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,110
I can see that.

256
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,450
Um... we should go.

257
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,070
But this is so awkward.

258
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,030
I love awkward.
- I know.

259
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,070
The police found blood
on Dominic's body.

260
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,930
I was just making sure
it wasn't Simone's.

261
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,450
They have laboratories
for that. Beth--

262
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,450
No. Stop.

263
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,000
I have a lead on Hank bishop.

264
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,570
He's the guy Dominic was
fighting with at the party.

265
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,840
Are you coming with me or what?

266
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,470
So the police already
checked this place out,

267
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,730
But I thought you might pick
up on something they missed.

268
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,350
I assume you don't want to
talk about what happened.

269
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,500
Why would you assume that?

270
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Because you haven't said a word
to me since we left my apartment.

271
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,700
Well, what do you
expect me to say?

272
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,100
I wasn't feeding on simone,
okay? It wasn't a big deal.

273
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,900
Then why do i feel like i
walked in on you two making out?

274
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,558
We were not making out.

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,800
I only want
to make out with you.

276
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,500
Yeah, but you don't want
to drink you blood

277
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,047
Whoa, you want me
to drink your blood?

278
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:20,100
Where is this coming from?

279
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,700
No, i don't...

280
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,583
it's just that when
you were dying in the desert

281
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:29,200
And you fed on me, you made it
seem like it was a big deal,

282
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
And now you're saying it's not,
so please forgive me

283
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,400
For being a little confused.

284
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,469
Oh, god, i should've
worn my hazmat suit.

285
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Unh-Unh!
Hey, don't touch that.

286
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,213
It's sacred. Members only.

287
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,900
- We're looking for hank bishop.
- And you are?

288
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm Beth turner
from the d.A.'S office.

289
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,700
Well, then you already know
i've told the police

290
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,200
Hank hasn't been
around here in a while.

291
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,400
I wish i could help you, really.
The guy owes me, like, 50 bucks.

292
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,000
How long since you last saw him?

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
Not since last semester.

294
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,100
He got a place
of his own in palms.

295
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,300
Maybe you should check
over there.

296
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,075
You're lying. Where is he?

297
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,800
Hank, the cops are here!

298
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,600
Go! Go! Go, hank! Go!

299
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:42,500
Hey! Stop!

300
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,472
Hey.

301
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,700
Play nice.

302
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,200
Are you okay?

303
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,800
Yeah, well,i got hit in the face
with a sacred ass paddle.

304
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
Karma.

305
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,800
- Hey, i got your text.
- Hey, i scored that blood sample

306
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,500
From whomever Dominic was with
before he was killed.

307
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,200
- Great.
- It turns out,

308
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,400
It's not contaminated
after all.

309
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,400
The coroner just doesn't know
vampire blood when he sees it.

310
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,200
Humans getting busy with vamps,
always trouble.

311
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,700
That it is.

312
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,700
Trouble with Beth?

313
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Well, she thinks
i fed on Josef's freshie.

314
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,700
So? It's not like
she's volunteering.

315
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,057
I don't want her to volunteer.

316
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,000
Why not?

317
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,500
- Well, 'cause i don't.
- I'm just saying

318
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,000
Vampires got needs.

319
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Why do i even talk to you
about this stuff?

320
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,700
You've obviously blocked out

321
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
All memories of what
human women are like.

322
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Yeah, well, i need
all available brainpower

323
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,872
To figure out vampire women.

324
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,700
It's a shame about Dominic.

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,900
Yeah. Emma and i have been
managing him since he graduated.

326
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,800
He would have been great in the pros.
Everyone loved Dominic.

327
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,340
I saw Dominic with a blonde
cheerleader at the party.

328
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,804
Lisa?

329
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,100
Yeah, Dominic was, uh,

330
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,200
Lisa's boy du jour.

331
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,300
It wasn't serious.

332
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,400
You know her?

333
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Met her in new york
back in 1923, i think.

334
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
- She was a flapper then.
- She's a vampire?

335
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,400
And loving every minute of it,
let me tell ya.

336
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,600
I didn't get close enough
to her at the party to tell.

337
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,700
Did Dominic know?

338
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,200
No, no, of course not.
He didn't know about any of us.

339
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,156
All right, guys,
good practice.

340
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:14,400
Lisa

341
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
You must be Mick.

342
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,100
How have we not met before?

343
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,182
It's a cruel world.

344
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,800
I heard you're looking
into Dominic's death,

345
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,900
That maybe it was murder?

346
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,415
Yeah, or an accident.
Somebody get a little rough?

347
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,900
They found vamp blood
on the body.

348
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,000
Not mine...
not that night.

349
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
You were sleeping
with him, though?

350
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
We hooked up once or twice.

351
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,021
I'm into jocks this semester.

352
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:40,700
Oh. So how long
you been in college?

353
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,500
40 years or so.

354
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,300
It's the perfect life
for a vamp.

355
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,400
Nobody notices
when you sleep all day,

356
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,929
And there's a constant rotation
of frat boys too drunk to know

357
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:51,400
When a hickey isn't a hickey.

358
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,700
No one notices
the puncture marks in the neck?

359
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,000
That's not the artery
i go for.

360
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh.

361
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,300
Okay, hank,
let's go over this again.

362
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
- I didn't kill Dominic.
- Then why'd you run?

363
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,000
It's not safe here.
You gotta protect me.

364
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,800
Sure, but listen, who exactly
are we protecting you from?

365
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,837
From her. She killed Dominic--

366
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,300
Threw him around the room
like a rag doll,

367
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,800
Snapped his neck
like it was nothing.

368
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,200
So you weren't
feeding on Dominic?

369
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,200
No way. He took our team
to the tournament three years in a row.

370
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,000
He needed his strength.

371
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,653
Emma was careful, too. At least,
i never noticed anything.

372
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:31,700
Wait a minute.
Emma? Emma monaghan?

373
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,500
Dominic was sleeping
with his manager?

374
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,900
Yeah,
for the past few months.

375
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,000
Did Jackson know?

376
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,400
Not from me. No way i'd get
in the middle of that.

377
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,800
And then i saw her face--
Her eyes.

378
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,200
Well, who is it?
Who--Who'd you see?

379
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,189
It was Dominic's manager, Emma.

380
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,584
Hey, listen,

381
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:54,200
Hank says he saw Emma monaghan
kill Dominic during rough sex.

382
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,100
We're gonna go pick her up.

383
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,073
- Hey.
- Mick.

384
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:03,600
I think Dominic may have been
with Emma in the locker room.

385
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,400
And hank saw her kill him.

386
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,500
Talbot's on his way
to her office now.

387
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Stop him.

388
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,700
How?
What am i supposed to say?

389
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,300
I don't know. Anything.
Just stop him.

390
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, he's just bringing
her in for questioning.

391
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,300
What's she gonna do?
Well, i don't know,

392
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,100
But i don't think Talbot
wants to find out.

393
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,600
Then you have to get there first.

394
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,900
I'm on my way.

395
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,300
No! No!

396
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,000
- Emma, stop!
- No, i will not go to jail!

397
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,900
Emma, Emma,
put the chair down, okay?

398
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,600
Are you here
to help me or them?

399
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,193
-You okay?
- Yeah

400
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:49,193
Emma, stop it. Stop!

401
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,900
Stop!

402
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,300
This is not how
this goes. You know that.

403
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,000
I will not go to jail.

404
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,100
Okay, we'll figure that out,

405
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,500
But think about
what you're doing.

406
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,600
You're endangering
all of us.

407
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,916
Think about Jackson.

408
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:11,000
I guess we know
whose side you're on.

409
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,000
How did she do all this?

410
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,500
Psychotic break, maybe?

411
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,779
Definitely psychotic.

412
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:34,151
Yeah, but i just...
i thought hank was exaggerating.

413
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:41,221
Well, that wasn't so bad.

414
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,300
A homicidal, desperate vampire
is in custody,

415
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,100
And she's gonna need
to feed soon.

416
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
It's very bad.

417
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,800
So this is what 150 years
of marriage looks like.

418
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,300
Check out
these wedding licenses.

419
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,800
They've got a new pair of names
every 20 years or so.

420
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,900
Yeah, one thing
about being a vampire--

421
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,500
You get to reinvent yourself
over and over again.

422
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,061
But no matter who they were
or what they did,

423
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:17,100
They always stayed together.
It's so romantic.

424
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,154
They probably have
a double-Wide freezer as well.

425
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,400
Emma said Jackson
asked her to turn him,

426
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,000
That he knew it was the only way
they could really be together.

427
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,100
Well, at least Jackson
had a choice.

428
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
What about you?

429
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,504
Have you ever turned
anyone into a vampire?

430
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,100
Sorry, uh,
all we got is tap.

431
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,400
We don't have many humans
over to the house.

432
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,200
That's fine. Thank you.

433
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,807
Thank you.

434
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,100
So you didn't know
about Emma and Dominic?

435
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,200
Never suspected a thing.

436
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,411
But like they say,

437
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,800
No matter
how long you know someone,

438
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,300
You never really know 'em.

439
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,400
I thought we were happy.

440
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
How long can Emma
go without feeding?

441
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,100
She wouldn't
do anything stupid.

442
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,600
You sure about that?

443
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,855
She just needs to know
that she's not alone,

444
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,100
That we'll figure this out.

445
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Let me talk to her.

446
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,042
Can you get him in
to see her?

447
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Yeah.

448
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Jackson.

449
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:33,900
I'm so sorry.

450
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,300
I love you.

451
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Why can't we hear them?

452
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,300
They don't want their
conversation to be overheard.

453
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,045
They're speaking below
audible hearing levels.

454
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,400
You can hear them, right?

455
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,324
Yeah.

456
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,500
<i>I never meant to hurt you.</i>

457
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,700
What'd she say?

458
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,092
She's telling him
she's sorry.

459
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,046
<i>He was sleeping with Lisa.</i>

460
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,300
<i>I got angry.</i>

461
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,349
<i>I forgot my strength.</i>

462
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:10,800
Then when Dominic told her
he was seeing Lisa,she lost control.

463
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,279
He was dead before she even
realized what she'd done.

464
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:18,000
<i>Did you love him?</i>

465
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,500
<i>Of course not.</i>

466
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,800
<i>It was nothing.</i>

467
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,420
<i>So you threw away
everything we built together,</i>

468
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:25,400
<i>Everything we were
to each other--</i>

469
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,838
<i>Y-You betrayed me for--
For nothing?</i>

470
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,200
<i>It wasn't about us...</i>

471
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
<i>or you.</i>

472
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,400
<i>It was about me.</i>

473
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,932
<i>Being with Dominic,
it made me feel young...</i>

474
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:43,500
<i>until he dumped me
for a younger model.</i>

475
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,026
<i>If only he knew the truth.</i>

476
00:25:55,282 --> 00:25:56,004
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

477
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:58,679
<i>I know i screwed up,
but it was an accident.</i>

478
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,800
<i>This is first-Degree murder.</i>

479
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,000
<i>That is life in prison.
I will never survive that.</i>

480
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,934
<i>Josef already has a lawyer
working on your bail.</i>

481
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:09,000
<i>It won't come to that.</i>

482
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,842
<i>No, it won't.</i>

483
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,700
<i>St. John sided
with the humans.</i>

484
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,052
<i>He's the one that
let them put me in here.</i>

485
00:26:16,098 --> 00:26:20,000
<i>- What's wrong?
- He will get me out.</i>

486
00:26:20,424 --> 00:26:24,200
<i>You go out there, and you
tell him if he doesn't...</i>

487
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,960
<i>not only will i tell the cops
exactly what i am,</i>

488
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,169
<i>But i'll tell 'em
i'm not the only one.</i>

489
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:33,100
<i>- Emma, that's crazy.
- You tell him that i will do it.</i>

490
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,800
<i>I will give up his name,
all of his friends,</i>

491
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,007
<i>Every vampire in los angeles.</i>

492
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:43,914
<i>You have 24 hours.</i>

493
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,700
What's wrong?
What did she say?

494
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:58,500
But how could the judge
deny Emma bail, hmm?

495
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,600
Whatever happened to
innocent till proven guilty?

496
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,900
- Emma is guilty.
- I know,

497
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,497
But simone
made her sound innocent.

498
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:05,600
And halfway through her speech,
even i was buying it.

499
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,498
Doesn't matter.We're gonna work this out.

500
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,777
Oh, yeah.

501
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:13,312
You know, simone looked a little
green when she left court today,

502
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:16,000
Like, uh, she might be afraid

503
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,200
You would blame her
for the judgment,

504
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,011
And by blame i mean...

505
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,900
kill her.

506
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,800
No. I told her it wasn't
her fault. I'm not mad.

507
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,600
She likes you, you know.

508
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,900
Who doesn't like me?
She tell you that?

509
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,988
She didn't need to, and i think
the feeling's mutual.

510
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:36,453
Now doesn't that violate
one of your rules?

511
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:38,244
Yeah, several.

512
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,895
- Hi.
- Simone

513
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:45,800
I-I'm so sorry. I know
i should have called first.

514
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,338
No, that's okay. Come in.

515
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,500
You know...

516
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,100
about the other night,
i just...

517
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
- i just feel like
i should apologize.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

518
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,400
I was just upset. It...

519
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,100
just looked kind of, uh...

520
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,200
intimate?

521
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Yeah.
Feeding them blood?

522
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,386
I mean...
i think it's intimate,

523
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:13,500
But to them it's just...

524
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,000
vampires don't care
about humans like that.

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,085
We're just a blip
in their life span.

526
00:28:19,294 --> 00:28:22,900
To love us is to...
watch us die.

527
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:26,666
So... when are you
gonna break it off?

528
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,574
I don't know yet.

529
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,900
Oh, you really care
about this person...

530
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,807
even though
she's a... human.

531
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,100
We were out one night.

532
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,552
Simone might've been
a few martinis in, but...

533
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,203
well, she implied
she might be interested in not being human anymore.

534
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,100
Wait a minute. You're actually
considering this?

535
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,065
Look, i haven't tried to turn
anyone since sara Whitley,

536
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,900
And we all know
how that worked out.

537
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,000
So you're--You're worried
you'll kill her.

538
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't know.
Maybe i'm worried i won't.

539
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,460
Forever's a long time, Mick.

540
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:07,000
I mean...
and i've got commitment issues.

541
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,507
Yeah, me, too.

542
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,694
Do you think
it would be different

543
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,300
Between you and Josef
if he turned you,

544
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,200
If you were both vampires?

545
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
I mean, it didn't work
for Emma and Jackson.

546
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,182
But at least they had
150 years to try.

547
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Wouldn't you want that
with Mick?

548
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,500
Mick would never turn me.

549
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,392
He's a kind of
anti-Vampire vampire.

550
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,231
Well, i mean, i don't--I don't
know how he feels about it now,

551
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,100
But if you're with him
long enough,

552
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:40,500
I guarantee
the topic's going to come up.

553
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Hey.

554
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,700
Hey. Can we talk?

555
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,800
Right now?

556
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,900
it's not a good time.

557
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
What's going on?

558
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,500
Oh, let me guess--
vampire business.

559
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,700
You can't be involved.

560
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,600
No, i guess i can't.

561
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,300
What was that about?

562
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Nothing.

563
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,500
You should never have allowed
the police To take Emma into custody.

564
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,800
what was i supposed to do--

565
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,900
Let Emma kill a couple of cops,
Maybe a d.a.?

566
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,300
collateral damage.

567
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,100
No. Not to me.

568
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,800
Uh, Emma's pretty well-connected.

569
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,200
Gotta have the names of at least
300 vampires in the area.

570
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,600
Anything she says,
the cops'll think it's just nuts.

571
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,000
Until she turns vamp and starts
slicing Through guards like butter.

572
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,900
i've sent out the coded e-mails,
But there's--

573
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,300
there's not enough time.

574
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,000
A lot of vamps aren't gonna be
able to get out of town.

575
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,300
which means when the cops come,
??

576
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Exposing even more of us.

577
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,400
It's gonna be a freakin'
vampire apocalypse.

578
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,200
no.

579
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,100
Emma's not gonna
say anything to anyone.

580
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,000
You're gonna do it?
you're gonna break her out?

581
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,000
No.

582
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,000
<i>we are.</i>

583
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Emma is being held here
At the district processing facility.

584
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,000
She gets transferred from the
processing facility To the county lockup.

585
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,900
The transport van is scheduled
to pick up at 8:00 p.m.

586
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,700
For the approximately 18 minutes
that she's in transit,

587
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
She will be under
minimal protection.

588
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,000
That means one guard,
one driver.

589
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,600
The transport van's route
will take it up main street,

590
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,100
By which time, logan will have hacked
the city's Traffic control mainframe.

591
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,500
- i will?
- Yeah.

592
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,000
You're gonna make sure
the lights at 3rd

593
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,800
and main Stay green
as the van approaches.

594
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,900
Guillermo, i'm gonna need
an ambulance, A stretcher, the works.

595
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
no problem.

596
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,100
<i>and bring
a couple pints of blood.</i>

597
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,900
<i>road snacks?</i>

598
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,900
<i>Jackson said Emma hasn't fed
in over 72 hours.</i>

599
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,900
<i>- she's gonna be in bad shape.
- got it.</i>

600
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,600
<i>hello, ladies.</i>

601
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,900
What do you want us to do?

602
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,000
you clean up accidents every day.

603
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,800
Now i need you
to create one.

604
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,000
<i>as the van passes through
the 3rd street intersection,</i>

605
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,900
<i>you guys are gonna be
waiting for it.</i>

606
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,100
Main street is
a one-way street.

607
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,800
<i>the van will have to stop
where we want it to stop.</i>

608
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,800
Josef and i will be
waiting to extract them.

609
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,200
We pack her in the ambulance
and take off.

610
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,000
Questions?

611
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,600
Can my code name be
lando calrissian?

612
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,500
Let's go.

613
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,900
All right.

614
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,700
I am in.

615
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay, do it.

616
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,100
Green lights all the way.

617
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,800
Excuse me.

618
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
What is it?

619
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,400
The restraints--

620
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,900
they're too tight,

621
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,700
And i feel sick.

622
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
Please.

623
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,200
Fine.

624
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,100
Let me check 'em.

625
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Right on time.

626
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,200
you're really cold.

627
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,700
I'm very thirsty.

628
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,900
i hit a secondary firewall.

629
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,300
The city must've
upgraded their system.

630
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,200
- I need time to pop it.
- you've got ten seconds.

631
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,600
Oh, that's helpful. That's
definitely gonna make me go faster!

632
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,700
- Thanks!
- hey, logan--

633
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,300
calrissian out.

634
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
logan, get that light green.

635
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,300
They've gotta make it
through the intersection.

636
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,600
??How much longer?
she doesn't look too good.

637
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,800
I think there's
some kind of accident up ahead.

638
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,800
Flip the lights
and take us around.

639
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
We need to get her
to a doctor fast.

640
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,500
What's he doing?

641
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
- What's plan "b"?
- there is no plan "b."

642
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,200
Hey, calrissian!
stop that van!

643
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,700
Leeroy jenkins!

644
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
yes!

645
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,700
<i>i am the man! Did you see that?
that was awesome!</i>

646
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,800
Quite the plan "b."
i'll say.

647
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,600
Get up.

648
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,500
Emma monaghan,

649
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,500
For threatening to expose
your brothers and sisters,

650
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,400
You have endangered the safety
and security Of the entire community.

651
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Wait!

652
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
You can't do this.
it was an accident.

653
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,900
This isn't about the human.

654
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,600
Our secrecy...

655
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,400
Is all we have.

656
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,800
It's all that keeps us alive.

657
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,700
The crime is treason.
the penalty is death.

658
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,600
Continue.

659
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,800
Stop.

660
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
Back away now.

661
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,000
Give them a minute.

662
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,300
Don't do anything foolish,
mr. Monaghan.

663
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,000
I am so sorry.

664
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,300
I-i wanted to start over...

665
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,100
With you.

666
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,300
I love you.

667
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
always have and always will.

668
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,000
We're ready.

669
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
- Go, Jackson.
- no, no, no.

670
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,800
No, we do this like
we've done everything else--

671
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
- Together.
- no! No! No!

672
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,000
- I don't want you to die, too.
- mr. Monaghan?

673
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,200
Please.

674
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,300
Together.

675
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,700
We're ready.

676
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,700
No.

677
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,900
We don't have to watch this.

678
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,500
Yeah...

679
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,400
We do.

680
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,600
No, sir, we don't know
how she escaped.

681
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,500
We're investigating that
as we speak.

682
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,600
??I'm sorry, sir.

683
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,400
Okay, bye.

684
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,900
Talbot.

685
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,100
File's for your eyes only.
we'll be in touch.

686
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,200
Who is this?

687
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,400
I assume your "vampire business"
Meant getting Emma out of jail.

688
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,300
Where is she?

689
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
She's dead.

690
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,300
She was a liability
to our community.

691
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,100
Vampires dispensing
vampire justice.

692
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,900
There have to be rules,
Beth.

693
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,100
And Jackson?

694
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,300
He didn't want
to live without her.

695
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,900
So they were both
just executed?

696
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,500
I know that this isn't easy
for you to understand.

697
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,600
Look...

698
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,400
You've been saying for months now
That things can't work between us,

699
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
That we live
in different worlds.

700
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,900
And i didn't want to hear you,
but maybe you're right.

701
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,800
You can't come back
to my world...

702
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
And i'm not ready
to join yours.

703
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,500
Wait. You think that
that's what this is about?

704
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,600
You think i'm gonna
want to turn you?

705
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,700
Wouldn't you?

706
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,300
Eventually?

707
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,600
And what happens
when i start to get old?

708
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,800
Maybe then
i'd want it, too.

709
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,600
I don't ever want to have
to make that decision.

710
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,800
Emma and Jackson made me
realize that you were right.

711
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
I don't...

712
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,200
Think i can do this anymore.

713
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,600
??

714
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,100
???

715
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,900
??

716
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,700
You want to know what Emma
and Jackson made me realize?

717
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,300
<i>that you were right.</i>

718
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,500
You were right all along.

719
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,300
This isn't about
being a vampire or a human.

720
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,400
<i>this is about us</i>

721
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,400
And how we feel about
one another Right here, right now.

722
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,500
The night that we first met--
or met again, whatever--

723
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,500
What was i wearing?

724
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,800
Blue jeans, white striped shirt,
cream jacket.

725
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,100
What about my shoes?

726
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,400
You were barefoot.

727
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,300
How can you remember that?

728
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,000
Because i love you.

729
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:12,600
