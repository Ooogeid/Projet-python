1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,020
Previously on "moonlight"...

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,160
I saw coraline last night.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,810
You look just like
someone I used to know.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,970
Ex-girlfriend, maybe?

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,810
Ex-wife.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,690
She's been lying to us.

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,850
No! She's not a vampire.

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,180
She's human. She has a cure.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,590
I came back for you.

10
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:21,090
You have to tell me how.

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,201
So why did you take
coraline's blood?

12
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:27,597
Vampires like me might see this as a
cure, but others might see it as
a threat.

13
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:30,401
You really hate being a vampire,
don't you?

14
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:34,901
You're bleeding.

15
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:36,212
You got hit.

16
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:39,343
It's not my blood.

17
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:05,522
*********

18
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:06,221
Yes*******

19
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:08,741
**********

20
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,793
Josh

21
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:31,071
Josh

22
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:32,013
I'm OK

23
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,403
You're okay.

24
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:45,661
He has no pulse.
He's not breathing. Clear.

25
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:50,860
I'm sorry. He's gone.

26
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,731
I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am.

27
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:04,603
You all right, miss turner?

28
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,642
Yeah.

29
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:08,111
Thanks for coming in.

30
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:11,551
As I told you on the phone, we need
signed statements from all
the witnesses.

31
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,743
I understand.

32
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,973
If it's accurate,
you can sign it.

33
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:20,181
The paramedic said mick st. John took
some really heroic steps in trying to
save Mr. Lindsey's life.

34
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:21,851
You can save him.

35
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:25,210
- No,I can't do that.
- Yes,you can.

36
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:26,651
Turn him. He'll live.

37
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:27,721
It's not living.

38
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:31,913
Save him.
Please, for me. Please!

39
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:36,211
Beth.

40
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,582
Beth.

41
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,142
Come on, beth.

42
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:44,862
This is ridiculous.

43
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:47,262
I did everything
possible to save him.

44
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:50,431
You did everything
humanly possible.

45
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:56,751
I live every day
regretting what I am.

46
00:02:57,108 --> 00:03:01,353
I'm not about to subject josh or
anyone else to that fate, okay?

47
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,773
I'm trying really hard
to understand, okay?

48
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:09,523
Beth.

49
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,961
I'll see you, okay?

50
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:43,381
As vampires age, their scent
becomes more potent from decay.

51
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:54,790
I'm picking up on
a lot of decay.

52
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:17,030
Mick st. John.

53
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,120
I don't think we
know each other.

54
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,481
That's true.

55
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,191
We've never met before.

56
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,920
I'm sure by now you've
detected we're...

57
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:29,041
Kindred souls.

58
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:31,551
What's this about?

59
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,610
We're hoping you'd
help us find someone.

60
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:34,782
Who might that be?

61
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:38,182
We're looking for a
vampire named coraline.

62
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,902
I don't know anyone
named coraline.

63
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:46,630
Tall, dark hair,
mysterious, incredibly sexy.

64
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,990
She turned you.

65
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:54,242
That was 50 years ago.

66
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,721
We haven't been together
for a long time.

67
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:57,742
Why do you need her?

68
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:00,443
She took something from me.

69
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:03,281
And why should I help you?

70
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,482
We'll be seeing you.

71
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,510
Hey, your money's
always good here.

72
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:33,100
Newly turned vampires--
no matter how good they are,

73
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:37,222
when you've been playing 200 years,
it's hard to lose.

74
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:42,202
Exclusive club membership-- each of
them a pillar of vampire society.

75
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:43,570
I didn't come here to play.

76
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:45,192
Eight ball?

77
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:46,072
Nine ball?

78
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:50,231
Listen, a couple of medieval vampires
showed up on my roof looking
for coraline--

79
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,533
something she took from them.

80
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:57,800
The main guy--he seemed to
know everything about me.

81
00:05:57,818 --> 00:05:58,692
And the other one?

82
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:01,251
He just stood there like
his indentured servant.

83
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,413
There was something
about these guys.

84
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,473
It was like they were
from a different time.

85
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:05,480
And what did they look like?

86
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,760
The talker was big.
6'1", 200 pounds, dark hair.

87
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:10,383
I don't know.
Strong, confident.

88
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:12,641
Sounds like someone's
got a crush, huh?

89
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:15,971
Anything else?

90
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:20,161
One of his eyes--
it was jet black.

91
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:22,581
He had this stone-cold stare.

92
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,263
- Lance.
- Lance?

93
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:26,401
You know this guy?

94
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,902
Yeah, of him.

95
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:29,870
He's somewhat legendary.

96
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:31,891
He's not like other vampires.

97
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:33,041
How come I never heard of him?

98
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:35,773
Because he doesn't need
to blend in with society.

99
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,282
He makes me look like a pauper.

100
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,931
He lives under his own rules.

101
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:42,322
That's the first time I've
heard of him in decades.

102
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:43,652
He never leaves europe.

103
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:44,952
What do you think
coraline took?

104
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:47,492
I don't know,
but who cares, mick?

105
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,681
You look after yourself, huh?

106
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:54,570
I'm telling you,
you don't mess around with this guy.

107
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:18,603
I figured the best place to start
looking for coraline was where she
disappeared as morgan vincent.

108
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,143
I'm mick st. John.
We spoke on the phone.

109
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:22,743
Yeah. Come on in.

110
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:29,711
I need to see the security footage
pertaining to the disappearance of
morgan vincent.

111
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:32,440
Like I said, the footage has been
reviewed. There's no sign of her.

112
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:35,092
We got no idea how
she got out, so...

113
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:39,270
Maybe you could, uh,
just humor me on this one.

114
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,740
So what time she disappear?

115
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,140
Last time the nurse checked,
it was 10:25.

116
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:48,252
10:47, she was gone.

117
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:51,671
The doctor.

118
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,902
Two nurses.

119
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,322
Nurse with a male patient.

120
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:58,282
I mean, like I said, there's no sign
of miss vincent in any of this, so...

121
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:00,242
Freeze it there.

122
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:03,561
It's just a nurse
with an empty bed.

123
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:07,063
Zoom in.

124
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,442
No, further.

125
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,162
Rd can you zoom in
on that right there?

126
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,742
Are those fingers?

127
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,081
Yeah, they are.

128
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,032
Was she kidnapped?

129
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,670
Or somebody helped her escape.

130
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:23,722
- Can you give me the camera angle from the other end of the hall?
- Oh,yeah.

131
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:29,430
Stop it there.

132
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,080
Zoom in on her.

133
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,313
Cynthia davis.

134
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:39,190
She was at our wedding-- closest
thing to family coraline said she had.

135
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:43,502
She hated america,
particularly despised L. A.

136
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,782
But she loved coraline.

137
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:17,501
********

138
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:19,681
*********

139
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:23,723
All******

140
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:31,940
logan is the vampire
version of a slob.

141
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,101
You ever leave here?

142
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:35,537
Why leave when the milkman
delivers to your doorstep?

143
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,311
Check this out. Expert level.

144
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:40,692
I'm playing my new coffin guitar,
and I just activated...

145
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,742
Star power.

146
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,232
- That's excellent.
- This game has a pretty decent collection of music tracks,

147
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:46,312
But, uh,
these solos are a bitch to play.

148
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:47,730
Logan, I have a job for you.

149
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:49,652
Would you like it?

150
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:52,620
What do you need?

151
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,500
I need you to locate
a vampire for me.

152
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:56,233
Her name is cynthia
xavier davis.

153
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:58,260
She was in town a
couple of days ago.

154
00:09:58,278 --> 00:09:59,553
I want to know if
she's still here.

155
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:02,490
If so, where is she,
and anything else you can find.

156
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:05,541
And she's not local,
so look into hotels.

157
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,343
What? I'll pay you.

158
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:10,422
I accept cash or blood.

159
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,960
Cash it is.

160
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,792
While you're waiting,
you can play if you want.

161
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:19,003
No, I'm, uh, I'm good.

162
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:23,652
Mick, you know I can't work
with you hovering over me.

163
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:39,032
Hello. Miss turner?

164
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,841
Clarence brown from the D.
A. 'S office.

165
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,492
Oh, please, call me "beth. "

166
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:45,323
I'm--I'm so sorry I
couldn't come down myself.

167
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:47,892
Uh, where would you like this?

168
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:50,443
Uh, just put it there.

169
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,501
What is this?

170
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:56,252
It's a government
insurance policy.

171
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:59,002
Josh named you his beneficiary.

172
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,502
I know it's not a lot.

173
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:03,793
The big bucks aren't
in public service.

174
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:07,801
It, uh... means a lot to me.

175
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:11,470
You know,
all of us admired him.

176
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:14,580
I-I should go now.

177
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:17,423
Let us know if you
need anything else.

178
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,352
This is celeste.

179
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:16,841
Hello? Hello?

180
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,030
Who is the man

181
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:27,150
that was fast. What do you got?

182
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:29,041
Your girl's been busy
the last few years.

183
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:31,673
Master's and phd,
both in biochemistry.

184
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:33,970
I hacked in and ran
her credit cards.

185
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,903
She's been flying back and forth between
L.A. And paris every couple weeks,

186
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:40,792
and she's been importing some kind of
agricultural products from france.

187
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,802
The cure.

188
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:45,210
And when she stays in town,
she stays at the hardwick hotel.

189
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,093
And is she in town?

190
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,521
Perfect. Give me
her room number.

191
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,390
- Oh,no go.
- Okay.

192
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,101
Keep digging.

193
00:12:54,117 --> 00:12:56,693
I need to know where those
imports are being delivered.

194
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:05,663
And everything
else she's up to.

195
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:41,670
The metro. Can I help you?

196
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,122
Yes, um, hi.
I'm joshua lindsey's assistant.

197
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:47,701
I would like to confirm his
reservation for two tonight at 8:00.

198
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:48,823
Confirmed for two.

199
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,650
- Thank you.
- You*******

200
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,583
This is guest services.

201
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:04,923
Uh, our system is down, and I have these
spare towels that cynthia
davis requested.

202
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:05,513
- davis
- Yeah.

203
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:07,200
Could you tell me what
room she's in, please?

204
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:08,760
Yes*******

205
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,740
mick. What a pleasant surprise.

206
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,272
Cynthia.

207
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:46,252
It's been a long time.

208
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:49,083
Can I come in?

209
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,730
Sure. Why not?

210
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:53,142
I'd love to catch up.

211
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,432
Taking a nap?

212
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:04,922
Oh, you know,
hotels don't come with freezers.

213
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,780
Where's coraline?

214
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,582
I saw the tapes.

215
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:15,420
I know you took her out of the hospital,
but why?

216
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:18,233
You make it sound
like I kidnapped her.

217
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,870
I was helping her.

218
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,440
Really?

219
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,730
Come on, mick.

220
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,012
A vamp in the hospital?

221
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,803
Yeah, but she wasn't a vamp.

222
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:27,682
She was human.

223
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:30,822
So where is she now?

224
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:33,731
Europe.

225
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,692
She left the day after she
got out of the hospital.

226
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,370
Some things never change,
do they?

227
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:41,021
You're still lying for her?

228
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,320
So she's in europe.
Why are you still in town?

229
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:44,632
I'm running a business.

230
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:47,653
That requires agricultural
products from france?

231
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:50,033
I supply restaurants.

232
00:15:51,756 --> 00:15:54,500
What do you know
about this cure?

233
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:56,051
Cure for what?

234
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:58,190
For what we are.

235
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:01,781
Don't tell you're still
fighting who you are.

236
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:04,482
As helpful as ever.

237
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:05,820
Oh, I do try.

238
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,933
Thanks, cynthia.

239
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:09,773
Anytime.

240
00:16:11,776 --> 00:16:13,952
I could tell she was lying.

241
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:17,111
Cynthia wouldn't be in
L.A.Without coraline.

242
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:21,900
Logan, what do you got for me?

243
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:24,853
Well, I found out where cynthia
is having the imports delivered.

244
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:27,160
Great. Text me the information.

245
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:59,780
This must be about the cure.

246
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:03,270
Why isn't it working?

247
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:05,233
I'm not sure.

248
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,790
I extracted a cell
from the compound.

249
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:10,913
I cloned it, then injected it into
the cell structure of a plant

250
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,071
from the same phylum as
the extinct species.

251
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,373
You said it would work.

252
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:16,532
Well, theoretically,
it still should.

253
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:18,313
I'm gonna have to try again.

254
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:21,451
Every time we try,
we use up some of the compound.

255
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,141
She's a vampire again.

256
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:44,363
Don't even think about it.

257
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:46,540
It will compromise the testing.

258
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,071
Did you really think you'd
get away with all this?

259
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,741
Lance.

260
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:15,731
We've tried all this already.

261
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:16,881
We're getting close.

262
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,782
No, it's not that simple.

263
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:22,423
Let's be rational about this.

264
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:35,530
Clearly, lance wasn't
interested in being rational.

265
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,690
You're so irresponsible.

266
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:40,221
What if there's another
reign of terror, hmm?

267
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:45,482
I want the compound, coraline.

268
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:51,502
Where is it?

269
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:11,823
Who is this guy?

270
00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:23,003
Looks like once again, coraline has
pulled you into all her trouble.

271
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:26,083
You really should have
stayed out of this.

272
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,032
I couldn't resist.

273
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,772
Cleaner. Location, please?

274
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:16,393
It's a lab...

275
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:18,220
In a warehouse on figueroa.

276
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,381
919 figueroa?

277
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:21,333
How did you know that?

278
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:23,210
It's a hot spot.

279
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,713
Hey, buddy.

280
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:37,433
What's going on here?

281
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,230
Mick.

282
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:45,872
I thought that was
you on the phone.

283
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,902
You do this?

284
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:49,723
No.

285
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:53,493
But I, uh, thought I should be
responsible and get a cleanup.

286
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:54,853
You said this was a hot spot.

287
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,562
Yat canwhou tell me?

288
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:58,100
Come on, mick.

289
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:01,381
You know the system works
because calls are anonymous.

290
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,913
I didn't ask about who called.

291
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:08,132
I asked about the cleanups.

292
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,180
Well, they're not like this.

293
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:11,733
They were newly turned vamps...

294
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:13,433
Bagged and left in
the alley out back.

295
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:14,683
Not accidents?

296
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:16,030
No.

297
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:16,963
Okay.

298
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:18,552
I gotta go. Thanks.

299
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,110
It was good to see you, mick.

300
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,371
You know, there doesn't need to be
a cleanup for you to give me a call.

301
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,131
Reservation for lindsey?

302
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:43,230
Oh, yes.
Your party's right over there.

303
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,361
Right this way.

304
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,011
Celeste?

305
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:56,481
Yes?

306
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,191
You were meeting josh
lindsey here, right?

307
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:05,153
Is--is josh coming?

308
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:07,682
No, he's not coming.

309
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,921
How long has this
been going on?

310
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:12,870
How long has what
been going on?

311
00:22:12,885 --> 00:22:14,393
You and josh.

312
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:17,072
Oh, you're the
girlfriend. Beth?

313
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,410
He told you about me?

314
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:20,173
- Listen,beth-
- no.

315
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:22,471
No, you listen.

316
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:26,691
Josh is dead.

317
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,261
Oh, my god.

318
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:31,060
Oh, my god. I... I...

319
00:22:31,076 --> 00:22:32,541
Beth, it isn't what you think.

320
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,583
I've been meeting with josh because I
was resetting his grandmother's
stone. I...

321
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:40,522
He was planning on proposing.

322
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,982
I'm a jeweler.
I was helping him.

323
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:50,780
He loved you so much.

324
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:54,603
He was so excited about proposing.
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,913
No, I'M... I'm sorry.

326
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:59,731
I was looking at his calendar,
and I--

327
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:01,942
it's okay.

328
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:05,782
Here.

329
00:23:33,885 --> 00:23:35,350
I don't believe this.

330
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,391
You call me down here to talk.

331
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:39,450
I get here,
you're gettin' a massage.

332
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,170
Well, you seem stressed.

333
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,552
What better way to loosen up?

334
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:47,261
Yeah, well, very tempting,
but we need to talk in private.

335
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:49,582
Easy there, babe.

336
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,102
Okay.

337
00:23:51,117 --> 00:23:53,831
We're gonna have to finish
this when I'm done talking.

338
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:00,753
What did I tell you?

339
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:02,920
You leave this guy alone.

340
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:05,603
It's like he has
superior genes.

341
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:09,671
His hand caught on fire,
then immediately healed.

342
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:10,711
How is that possible?

343
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,131
I don't know.

344
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,300
Maybe you were hallucinating.

345
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:15,083
- You said you were getting your ass kicked.
- No.

346
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:16,890
I saw it. He regenerated.

347
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:19,592
What I want to know is,
why now?

348
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:23,592
Coraline turns up to me in human form
dangling this cure in front of me.

349
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:25,871
Now all of a sudden,
she's a vampire again--

350
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:29,630
she's always messed with your head, and
I've told you to stay out of it. Okay?

351
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:32,153
You let the old
vamps duke this out.

352
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:34,983
It's just like coraline to fall in
quicksand and bring you down with her.

353
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,900
This is not just
about coraline.

354
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:42,331
There is some kind of cure, josef,
and coraline is my only link to it.

355
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:43,622
I have to find her.

356
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:46,200
I have to talk to her.

357
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:01,070
Here we go again.

358
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:02,893
I'm not alone.

359
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:08,642
Second time today I've returned home
to find someone waiting for me...

360
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:14,632
Except this time,
it's not a vampire.

361
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:23,233
Look, I know I said
I needed space.

362
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:25,531
- I-I just, um--
it's okay. - it's okay.

363
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:27,843
Come here.

364
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:33,852
- You okay?
- Yeah.

365
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:37,281
Want to come in?

366
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:43,081
But it turns out she was helping him
reset his grandmother's stone for me.

367
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:50,673
Josh was gonna propose to you?

368
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:52,343
I'm so confused.

369
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:56,260
I don't know if it makes this
whole thing easier or harder.

370
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:04,022
I think the thing I'm
struggling with is that

371
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:06,940
I don't know what my
answer would have been.

372
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:10,273
When you proposed,
how did you know it was right?

373
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:17,513
At the time, it just--
it just felt right. But--

374
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:22,911
go ahead.

375
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:51,381
I'm so glad you're okay.

376
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:55,360
Coraline, where did you go?

377
00:26:57,786 --> 00:27:00,080
- I had to get away.
- Excuse me.

378
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:04,442
Beth? Beth!

379
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,083
I-it's okay. I understand.

380
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:21,133
I think beth is
starting to like me.

381
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,713
She didn't stab me this time.

382
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:31,611
You saved me back there.

383
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:36,271
Yeah, well, I also burned you alive,
so I guess that makes us even.

384
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:38,902
I think it's about time you
tell me what's going on.

385
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,951
That man lance is after me,
and I need to get out of town.

386
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:42,740
Come with me.

387
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:44,190
I'm not going anywhere.

388
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,501
I want you to tell me about
lance and what you took from him.

389
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,440
Lance is from a very powerful,
noble bloodline.

390
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:54,561
So what does he want with you?

391
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:56,960
Is this about the cure?

392
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:02,901
Coraline, you're a vampire again,
but you were human.

393
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:04,930
I saw you.

394
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:06,523
I smelled you. You ate food.

395
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:08,683
I was human.

396
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:12,390
So there is no real cure?

397
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:14,981
The cure is mortal itself.
It's only temporary.

398
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:18,301
Well, what is it?
Wh-where does it come from?

399
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:29,852
It's an organic compound developed by a
noble bloodline in the 18th century from
local plants.

400
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:34,282
In this noble bloodline,
there were seven brothers,

401
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:39,701
all turned by the same sire--
a cousin of king louis xvi.

402
00:28:39,715 --> 00:28:41,811
MY BROTHERS

403
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:44,493
A TOAST TO OUR SIRE...

404
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:46,320
... AND TO OUR BLOODLINE...

405
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,393
You're telling me--

406
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:57,811
king louis xvi and various members
of his extended bloodline--

407
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:01,311
all vampires.

408
00:29:01,327 --> 00:29:05,312
There's much more to the french
revolution than is written in
history books.

409
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:09,071
The existence of
vampires was uncovered.

410
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:11,722
They tried to execute
us by hanging...

411
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:18,543
But eventually realized that burning or
decapitating was the only way to do it.

412
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:23,072
Ultimately, the guillotine was the
method of choice during the reign
of terror.

413
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:27,272
So the reign of terror was
partially a mass purge of vampires.

414
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:29,590
A vampire genocide.

415
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:34,732
A suspected vampire's finger was burned,
and if the finger blistered, he
was mortal...

416
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:44,792
But if the finger immediately
turned to ash, they were staked...

417
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:47,891
And then sent to
the guillotine.

418
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:08,463
The compound temporarily masked
the characteristics of vampirism.

419
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,801
It allowed those who took
it to pass the test.

420
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:14,290
TO IMMORTALITY

421
00:30:14,307 --> 00:30:16,931
and lance is a member
of this bloodline?

422
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,503
He is.

423
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,912
So that's how you got the cure?

424
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:24,172
Where is it? I wanna see it.

425
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:26,711
Here.

426
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:36,190
I took it from
lance a year ago.

427
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:45,210
How do I use it?
How does it work?

428
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:49,223
You put it into an open wound
and let your body absorb it.

429
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:52,593
Is there any chance that this cure could
be intensified to be made permanent?

430
00:30:52,606 --> 00:30:56,123
That's what I've been trying to do,
but I haven't been successful.

431
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:57,542
What, you've been
testing on vampires?

432
00:30:57,577 --> 00:30:58,581
Just rogues.

433
00:30:58,596 --> 00:31:01,702
It helps with the research,
and they need to be put down anyway,

434
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:05,512
so I'm just killing two bats
with one stone, really.

435
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,380
Don't leave me! Josh!

436
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,613
I took your life.

437
00:32:16,946 --> 00:32:18,282
Let me...

438
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:20,750
Let me give back what I can.

439
00:32:24,897 --> 00:32:27,181
I'll need a sharp
knife and some gauze.

440
00:32:27,198 --> 00:32:29,273
And take off your jacket.

441
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:31,133
Is this all that's left?

442
00:32:31,146 --> 00:32:34,481
No, there's more, but not much.
It's hidden.

443
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,881
- Here?
- Yeah.

444
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:48,910
That's good.

445
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:13,381
It's not healing.

446
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:16,192
This is how it works.

447
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,142
It starts from the wound, and then it
just spreads throughout your whole body.

448
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:24,772
You could start over with
your research, right?

449
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:26,602
We could.

450
00:33:26,615 --> 00:33:29,860
You once told me you were giving me
the greatest gift by turning me.

451
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:31,551
That was a long time ago, mick.

452
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:32,880
Yeah, but what's happened?

453
00:33:32,897 --> 00:33:35,281
Why this sudden interest
in becoming mortal?

454
00:33:35,297 --> 00:33:38,242
I wanted to feel life again.

455
00:33:39,556 --> 00:33:40,713
And maybe...

456
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:44,011
Love can't exist
without mortality.

457
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:59,683
Mick, I really need
to get out of here.

458
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,751
I can feel it.

459
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,111
Coraline, I feel warm.

460
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,350
What?

461
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:29,401
I don't smell anything.

462
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,813
Hello, sister.

463
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:41,200
There were seven siblings
in this noble bloodline,

464
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:43,662
but it wasn't seven brothers.

465
00:34:43,676 --> 00:34:45,730
It was six brothers...

466
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:50,641
And one sister.

467
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:06,992
You gave him the compound.

468
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:10,341
You set me up?

469
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:12,240
- Didn't you?
- No.

470
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:14,782
You did this to take away my
powers and get me killed?

471
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:16,351
No, no.

472
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:17,891
Don't flatter yourself.

473
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,623
I could've killed you
when you were a vampire.

474
00:35:19,655 --> 00:35:20,701
This isn't about you.

475
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:23,921
This is between
me and my sister.

476
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:37,282
You wanted to feel human again.

477
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:40,041
Well, here you are.

478
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:42,450
How does it feel, mick?

479
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:47,072
Ah, blood doesn't taste the same now,
does it?

480
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:51,422
Wait.

481
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:59,113
I'll go with you.

482
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:07,671
And I'll give you the rest.

483
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:14,290
But you have to leave
him out of this.

484
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:31,652
Kneel.

485
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:35,402
Kneel down.

486
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:52,043
If you take me to him,
you know what will happen.

487
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,712
You've made your
choices, sister.

488
00:37:57,398 --> 00:38:02,620
You chose to bring this ungrateful
mortal into our bloodline without
his consent

489
00:38:02,636 --> 00:38:04,992
and without our blessing,

490
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:09,412
and now you've chosen to
betray us with this compound.

491
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:13,330
There will be consequences.

492
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:20,551
Stabbing a vampire with a wooden stake
is the equivalent of putting a human
in shackles.

493
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:24,122
I can see the
terror in her eyes.

494
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:31,140
It's not the fear of the stake but
the fear of where lance is taking her.

495
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:41,112
Welcome to the family.

496
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:07,171
I've waited to feel human for a long
time, but I forgot how painful it
can be.

497
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:23,101
With coraline and what's
left of the cure gone,

498
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:26,873
my blood is the only
link I have left.

499
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:55,090
First time in many years
I could sleep in a bed.

500
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:00,590
Too bad I don't have one.

501
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,432
Still human.

502
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,720
Still human.

503
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:31,123
No matter how close we start to get,
there's always been this eternal wall
between us--

504
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:36,652
she, a mortal,
and me, a vampire,

505
00:41:37,137 --> 00:41:38,941
but with everything
that's happened,

506
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,561
maybe there's hope that
things could be different.

507
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:44,231
Oh, my god. What--
what happened to your face?

508
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:49,762
It's a long story that
ended in a big fight.

509
00:41:51,096 --> 00:41:52,971
Coraline's gone.

510
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:55,902
It's not meant to be.

511
00:41:55,915 --> 00:41:57,913
It never was.

512
00:41:59,276 --> 00:42:01,851
Yeah, I, uh...

513
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,602
I kind of know how that feels.

514
00:42:08,538 --> 00:42:10,800
Wait a second.

515
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,073
Are you human?

516
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:16,900
For now, yeah.

517
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:20,063
How does it feel?

518
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:24,153
The pain...

519
00:42:25,706 --> 00:42:28,060
The sun...

520
00:42:28,077 --> 00:42:30,621
The mortality...

521
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:34,621
It feels amazing.

522
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:42,142
We're gathered to celebrate
the life of josh lindsey,

523
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:45,431
whose journey's come to an end.

524
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:50,383
While the event that brought us all here
together is nothing less than tragic,

525
00:42:51,376 --> 00:42:55,903
part of what makes life so
invigorating is its finite nature.

526
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:57,753
We're all mortal.

527
00:42:57,765 --> 00:42:59,603
Our time is limited.

528
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:05,302
It's part of what allows us to--to
love and hurt, and in the end,

529
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:11,451
inspires us to--to make the
most of the time we're given.
