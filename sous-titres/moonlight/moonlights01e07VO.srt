00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,810
Previously on moonlight...

By******

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,240
Yeah*******

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,610
Okey

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,210
*********

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,430
I'm glad******

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,930
I*******everything

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,470

00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,910
You*******

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,770
One*******

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,790
Because******

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,200
Just********Your way,and maybe you're
even patting yourself on the back,

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,250
that's when it happens.

14
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,400
Thanks

15
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,460
********

16
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,390
It's sad,isn't it?

17
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,410
Think they're gonna be able to save it?

18
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,470
The,uh,the warden said they might be
able to save a couple of the top floors,

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,400
but most of the interior is wood.

20
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,640
It was built in the '20s.

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,310
My parents used to bring me here
for brunch after church on sundays.

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,440
I keep forgetting how old you are.

23
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,960
It must be really
frustrating having the power

24
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,460
to help people but not
being able to do anything.

25
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,200
If only you knew.

26
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,510
At the oddest time,you might
find yourself feeling lucky,

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,910
like maybe you found somebody...

28
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,760
Then bam! That's exactly
when the ex-wife shows up.

29
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,810
Coraline-- The woman who
turned me into a vampire.

30
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,870
She's something else,isn't she?

31
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,140
Yeah,I wouldn't kick her out
of bed for eating crackers.

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,820
What I would give to go home with that.

33
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,260
Forget it.

34
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,210
She drops more in a day at
saks than you make in a year.

35
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,040
Coraline.

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,080
No,sorry.

37
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,840
I'm sorry. You look just
like someone I used to know.

38
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,430
Ex-girlfriend,maybe?

39
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,870
Ex-wife.

40
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,440
Does this usually work for you?

41
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,170
This isn't a pickup.
You look just like her.

42
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,870
Just so you know,it's not a big
turn-on when you tell somebody

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,610
that they look like your ex.

44
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,530
- What's your name? - Do
you guys know each other?-

45
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,760
No.

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,790
No,we just met.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,540
So you don't know each other?

48
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,370
no.

49
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,620
I thought we did,but I guess we don't.

50
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,070
I'm mick.

51
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,260
Morgan.

52
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,010
Now we know each other.

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,650
How do you two know each other?

54
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,740
I buy a lot of her photos for"buzzwire."

55
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,230
How long have you two worked together?

56
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,130
A couple months?

57
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,330
She just moved here from chicago.

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,530
What's with the interrogation?

59
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,210
He's a private
investigator. Can you tell?

60
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,110
Oh,okay. Yeah.

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,360
Well,I'm gonna get back to
it. It was nice meeting you.

62
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,280
So the,uh,the fire inspector
says he found lighter fluid

63
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,310
and dirty rags in the
dumpster over there.

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,750
- Hey,did you hear me?
- What?

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,300
They think it's arson.

66
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,470
Uh,I'm gonna wrangle some
quotes. I'll catch you later.

67
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,680
There is a good reason I never
expected to see coraline again.

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,040
I killed her.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,430
I gotta talk to you,man.

73
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,810
Well,this better be good.

74
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,230
Dawn is in 15 minutes,and I'm
about to go home and hit the icebox.

75
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,700
I saw coraline last night.

76
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,960
Coraline,what-- You
meancoralinecoraline?

77
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,570
Yeah,that coraline.

78
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,050
Was she dead?

79
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,000
no.

80
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,150
Well,then it can't be coraline.

81
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,570
You killed her,remember?

82
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,380
Yeah,i'm aware of that.

83
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,970
It was at the franklin fire downtown.

84
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,810
There was this photographer there.

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,510
She was a dead ringer for coraline.

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
Well,everybody's got a twin somewhere.

87
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,370
She wasn't a twin.

88
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,200
Josef,it was her.

89
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,230
She-- she
moved the same.

90
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,520
She talked the same.

91
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,540
Oh,you talked to this person?

92
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,620
Yeah. Her name's morgan.

93
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,040
She works with beth.

94
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,370
And did,uh,beth
recognize her as coraline?

95
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,070
no.

96
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,960
Well,if it really was the woman
who kidnapped her as a child,

97
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,610
I would think that beth would
have a few opinions about it.

98
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,190
Beth doesn't rember me from back
then,and I'm the one who rescued her.

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,880
What do you remember
from when you were 4?

100
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,850
Well,it was 1603,mick,it's
reasonable to be a little hazy.

101
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,330
Look,beth has suppressed
the whole trauma,okay?

102
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,970
Josef...

103
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,230
I know this sounds
crazy,but you got to see her.

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,140
Well,did this morgan person have
a long history of drinking blood?

105
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,590
no.

106
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,200
She's not a vampire.

107
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,950
I was close enough to tell.

108
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,430
Well,mick,if she's not a
vampire,then she can't be coraline.

109
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,210
I was thinking I could take
these reaction shots to the fire

110
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,560
and write a piece about what this landmark
hotel has meant to people over the years.

111
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,130
What is this,ladies,n.p.r.?

112
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,850
I mean,I need a celebrity
angle,a dead body,something...

113
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,080
Sex it up a bit and get back to me.

114
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,430
Maureen always goes for the
lowest common denominator.

115
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,850
Don't worry. I'll wear her down.

116
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,540
Thank you so much for your support.

117
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,300
Oh,please.

118
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,720
Anything to keep me away from
restaurants and fashion shows.

119
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,500
Yeah.

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,930
Oh,my god,what happened?
Did you get burned?

121
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,640
Oh,no. It's just...

122
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,590
A little incident.

123
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,720
A little incident? Look at your arm.

124
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,680
It's just a couple stitches.

125
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,180
What happened?

126
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,620
Well,believe it or not,some guy broke
into my house last night,and we scuffled.

127
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,640
You fought him?

128
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,260
Well,you bet I did. He
was taking my cameras.

129
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,240
Did you tell the police?

130
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,170
Of course,but you know
how the police are.

131
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,320
They just acted like they had all
this more important stuff to do than,

132
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,950
you know,help me track
down my stolen equipment.

133
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,710
You did tell them he attacked you?

134
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,440
Oh,what I would give to just
get my hands on that little punk.

135
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,980
Not to mention getting
your cameras back.

136
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,770
What about that p.i.Friend of yours?

137
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,840
Do you think he could help?

138
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,930
- Mick?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,150
I thought you weren't
very impressed by him.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,330
Well,I mean,he seemed persistent.

141
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,960
Hey,I'm sorry to stop
by without calling,

142
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,390
but since I know you're a night person,

143
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,040
I thought you might be up.

144
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,040
Well,you know me too well.

145
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,170
Hey,mick.

146
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,870
Hey,morgan.

147
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,500
Morgan has a problem I thought
you might be able to help her with.

148
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,300
I had jewelry out in plain
sight that he ignored completely.

149
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,960
So it's just the cameras?

150
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,460
Which is why I attacked him.

151
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,220
You wouldn't believe what a
digital nikon costs these days.

152
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,430
You attacked the thief?

153
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,940
Well,I had mace,which,turns out,

154
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,560
pissed him off just enough for him to
then gouge me with my own letter opener.

155
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,250
Look,she needs her cameras back,mick.

156
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,140
It's her livelihood.

157
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,130
Beth said that you were the best.

158
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,140
Oh,she did,huh?

159
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,880
Yeah,several times,actually.

160
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,640
Maybe you could go by her apartment,

161
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,990
check it out,see if
there's anything to go by.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,950
And also,if it helps,

163
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,990
I would absolutely recognize
the thief if I saw him again.

164
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,420
I never forget a face.

165
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,420
Can't you guys play something
that'll get this snore on its feet?

166
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,550
Like what?

167
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,880
I don't know,like wynonie
harris or little willie john

168
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,110
or just something with
a little bit more rhythm.

169
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,540
Well,gee,I don't know if this
crowd would like the devil's music.

170
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,830
That's why I want you to play it.

171
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,690
How about "good rockin' tonight"?

172
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,120
How about "ain't that
just like a woman"?

173
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,740
I think that that would be
much more shocking,don't you?

174
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,710
On one condition.

175
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,440
My name's coraline.

176
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,340
Well,I didn't say
what the condition was.

177
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,620
That's always the condition.

178
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,180
I love your place. It's really cool.

179
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,720
Thank you.

180
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,990
I have this,like,'50s
thing i'm trying to shake.

181
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,870
So what can I tell you?

182
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,350
Why don't you start with what happened?

183
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,350
Okay.

184
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,770
I was in my bedroom,and it
was about 3:00 in the morning.

185
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,300
I was asleep,and then that's when I
heard a rattling at the front door.

186
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,010
Were you alone?

187
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,900
Now is that part of
your investigation or--

188
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,440
Potentially.

189
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,200
Yes,I was alone.

190
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,660
Okay,I think we've
established you were alone.

191
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,340
What next?

192
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,590
Well,then I leave the
bedroom and come out here,

193
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,430
and I see that there's
this man at my desk.

194
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,840
Like I said,he left
jewelry,keys to my b.m.w.,cash...

195
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,810
He wasn't after cash.

196
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,750
I mean,my cameras are
worth at least 8 grand.

197
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,930
He took those.

198
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,520
Maybe he was interested in
what was inside the cameras.

199
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,410
Pictures.

200
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,290
They said it was arson,right?

201
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,530
Well,maybe your thief was
the one who set the fire.

202
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,470
Maybe he thought you
took a picture of him.

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,180
Yeah,those arsonists-- They really
stick around to watch the burn.

204
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,680
Well,if he's after photos
then he's out of luck,

205
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,130
because I don't let anybody
see these until I sell them.

206
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,570
What is that?

207
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,830
It's a fire.

208
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,620
No,inthe fire.

209
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,960
Nothing,I don't think.

210
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,720
No,look,there is something...

211
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,070
Right there.

212
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,000
You know,I think I have some shots
where I racked to the building.

213
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,620
Hold on one second.

214
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,720
That's him. That's the thief.

215
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,570
He's killing her.

216
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,540
Seeing the photo was like looking
into the past,reliving a nightmare.

217
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,630
I love you.

218
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,510
******** I freed you from death.

219
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,510
******

220
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,130
That must be why he wanted the photos.

221
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,760
You caught a murder on camera.

222
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,300
You wouldn't believe
these photographs,josef.

223
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,530
It was like outtakes from the night.

224
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,740
The night you killed your wife.

225
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,190
You know what?

226
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,220
It's like somebody staged
this whole thing for me.

227
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,250
Can you hear yourself right now?

228
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,700
No,it's like...

229
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,010
It's like coraline is
baiting me with these photos.

230
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,040
Coraline is dead!

231
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,270
You saw her die with your own eyes.

232
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,810
I never saw the ashes.

233
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,010
In the 22 years since she
died,you never told me that.

234
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,560
I never told anybody that.

235
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,790
I never thought she
could possibly survive.

236
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,180
I left coraline trapped in
an inferno that night,man...

237
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,620
Just like the woman in these photos.

238
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,430
Mick,look at me.

239
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,710
Coraline did not come back from
the undead to exact revenge on you.

240
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,850
- You know how dangerous she was.
- Yeah.

241
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,470
I've known her for a century more
than you,and she's capable of anything,

242
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,410
- but not even she could pull off a resurrection.
- no?

243
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,230
Coraline drove you crazy
the whole time you knew her.

244
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,770
Now she's dead,and she's
still driving you crazy.

245
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,010
Now you need to let her go.

246
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,540
So tell me more about morgan.

247
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,630
Like who'd she work for in chicago?

248
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,920
Uh,everybody.

249
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,950
She was a stringer.

250
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,820
But legit stuff.

251
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,730
She has shot for the
"tribune," news corp...

252
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,790
I don't know. She's got a reputation for
being a kind of gritty crime photographer.

253
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
We've been running her
pictures for a couple years.

254
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,230
And you met where?

255
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,940
At a crime scene,kinda
like how I met you,actually.

256
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,960
Why are you so interested in morgan?

257
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,010
Just standard due diligence.

258
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,370
On a client?

259
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,650
Yeah,know your client.

260
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,230
It's private eye 101.

261
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,380
Oh,okay.

262
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,020
I'm just not used to being grilled
about a girl that you're after,so...

263
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,420
I'm not after her.

264
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,160
I wouldn't have pegged her as your type.

265
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,530
This isn't about types.

266
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Even if it is,it's
fine. It's your business.

267
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,130
You're jealous.

268
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,390
Don't flatter yourself.

269
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,960
Okay.

270
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,660
Look,I just need some info
on her time in chicago.

271
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,980
- Can you look into it and get back to me?
- Sure.

272
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,770
Are you gonna turn her
photos in to the police?

273
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,590
Not yet.

274
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,660
I'm gonna wait and see if I
find a body at the hotel first.

275
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,130
Mick st.John,california fidelity.

276
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,730
I'm one of their investigators.

277
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,200
Everybody get out okay?

278
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,210
No casualties so far.

279
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,160
Still a lot of debris
to get through,though.

280
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,320
What do you think about
these arson rumors?

281
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,690
I can't say anything about
an ongoing investigation.

282
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,910
Sorry.

283
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,550
My supervisor's kind of a hard-ass.

284
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,760
Hey,I work for an
insurance company. I get it.

285
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,950
Okay,I'm gonna take a
couple of happy snaps,

286
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,360
then I'll get out of your way.

287
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,580
Don't touch anything.

288
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,510
I found a woman's body at the hotel,

289
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,060
right where you took your pictures.

290
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,220
You're kidding.

291
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,000
I also forwarded your
photographs to the police.

292
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,660
Okay.

293
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,620
I'm just gonna dust for prints
before homicide gets here.

294
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,020
Please.

295
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,510
Now that--
you know what?

296
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,680
The police didn't do
that the first time.

297
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,410
Yeah,they usually don't for
a break-in,but they will now,

298
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,310
That's one of my favorite songs.

299
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,190
How could you know that?

300
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,840
You know how you feel like
you really know somebody

301
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,670
even if you haven't
known them that long?

302
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,410
How does that happen?

303
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,970
It's just one of those great mysteries.

304
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,170
I don't know.

305
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,470
Past life,maybe.

306
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,600
Yeah,maybe.

307
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,570
Any luck?

308
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,230
Yeah,I got a few clean prints,

309
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,840
but it'll only help if
your thief's in the system.

310
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,770
Right.

311
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,740
It's hard to believe
you caught it on camera.

312
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Were they able to identify the woman?

313
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,790
Not yet.

314
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,790
There wasn't much left.

315
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,060
Just ashes,huh?

316
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,370
Yeah,they just got a couple of bits
of pelvis and a few molars to go by.

317
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,540
That has got to be the worst way to die.

318
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,040
Can you imagine the pain
before you actually died?

319
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,580
What you'd
have to endure--

320
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,790
Your hair singed
off,your skin blistering.

321
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,800
It's a bad way to go,no doubt.

322
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,430
Bad? It's horrific.

323
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,940
There's something on her back.

324
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,190
What is it?

325
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,480
It's a tattoo.

326
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,260
You wanna get wet?

327
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,760
You don't even know my name.

328
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,660
Do I need to?

329
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,500
Maybe you should come
to one of my real gigs.

330
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,960
This was one of your real gigs.

331
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,200
Will you give me a hand?

332
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,550
This is good. It could be a
lead to identify her,right?

333
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,350
You sure that's a tattoo?

334
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,770
Yeah.

335
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,150
It's a
fleur-de-lis.

336
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,990
So I spoke to her editor of three
years at reuter's in chicago.

337
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,220
He said she was the
best thing he ever had.

338
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,520
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for.

339
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,470
That morgan is who she says she is.

340
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,440
Well,I've found nothing to say that she
isn't morgan vincent from highland park,

341
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,210
southwestern class of 2000,daughter
of bob,sister of jennifer--

342
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,890
You spoke to her family?

343
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,030
Yeah,you should've heard how ridiculous I
sounded talking to her father on the phone

344
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,820
pretending to be from
the wildcat alumni board.

345
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,440
Okay,so she's legit.

346
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,930
Unless she's doing
areallygood job of faking it.

347
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,350
What is going on,mick?

348
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,550
You're absolutely sure that you never
met morgan before a few months ago?

349
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,040
Yes.

350
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,990
My ears were burning.

351
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,940
Did you hear any feedback
on the fingerprints yet?

352
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,280
There's fingerprints now?

353
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,380
Yeah,mick picked 'em up
at my place last night.

354
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,520
Speaking of which,i'd
better get back to it.

355
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,070
You should have
something this afternoon.

356
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,540
Was that...

357
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,360
Was that a little look?

358
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,730
Are you guys an item?

359
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,120
Me and mick? No.

360
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,550
Could've fooled me,or
anybody else for that matter.

361
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,880
We work together,that's all.

362
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,760
So it'sjustprofessional?

363
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,270
Yes,it's just professional.

364
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,290
I'm a photographer. I see things.

365
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,690
And I have a boyfriend,remember?

366
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,080
Like that ever stopped anybody.

367
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,380
I gotta tell you,man. These
fingerprints are suspiciously perfect.

368
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,970
A little too perfect,right?

369
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,970
Take a look at that tattoo.

370
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,320
It's a
fleur-de-lis.

371
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,110
Well,it looks like a
dog smoking a cigar.

372
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,930
Coraline had exactly the same
tattoo on the same shoulder.

373
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,240
Well,I think it's all in your head,mick.

374
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,980
It's not all in my head.

375
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,620
All right. We've found our thief.

376
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,540
Hank mottola.

377
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,230
Racketeering,trafficking
in stolen goods.

378
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,870
Mm,standard issue crook.

379
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,370
Not standard issue,josef.

380
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,500
This guy's dead.

381
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,100
Hank mottola died three weeks
ago from acute pancreatis.

382
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,150
so?

383
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,740
So he died before
any of this happened--

384
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,190
The fire,the
murder,the-- the break-in.

385
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,060
I sense a conspiracy theory coming on.

386
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,700
When crimes are
committed by dead people,

387
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,880
this doesn't suggest to you
any kind of vampire involvement?

388
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,270
Our break-in was
committed by a dead man.

389
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,160
This can only mean one thing.

390
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,070
A minimum wage peon
made a clerical error.

391
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,410
No.

392
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,640
Hank mattola is a vampire working with
coraline to stage this whole thing.

393
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,930
Seems a little,uh,elaborate,don't
you think?

394
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,520
What's elaborate?

395
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,230
- Dump a body,fake a few photos.
- Come on.

396
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,210
You're talking about
staging a murder and a fire--

397
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,630
That exactly parallels
the way coraline died.

398
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,280
Don't you see?

399
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,390
This is just the kind of mind
game that reeks of coraline.

400
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,780
Or not.

401
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,760
You need to take the
tinfoil hat off,boyo.

402
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,490
Step back,get some perspective.

403
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,130
Maybe you could help.

404
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,410
I don't do perspective.

405
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,330
You could help me look
through our thief's house.

406
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,790
I could use another set of eyes...

407
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,700
And teeth.

408
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,060
Where are we again?

409
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,140
City of palmdale?

410
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,280
Next time,I'll try to
find a beverly hills thief.

411
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,780
Thanks.

412
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,400
You sure this is mottola's
house?The suspected killer,

413
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,150
who's in league with coraline.

414
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,350
Yeah,I'm sure.

415
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,620
So now mattola'sin league with coraline.

416
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,490
Yeah,that's right.

417
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,300
Come on.

418
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,040
Well,why don't you
just let me in the door?

419
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,980
Look,can't we hire someone to do this?

420
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,510
Oh,so this is how the
little people live,huh?

421
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,980
Oh,vinyl recliners...

422
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,320
Have "crazed killer" written
all over them,don't they?

423
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,000
Josef,if you're not gonna
help,can you at least be quiet?

424
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,130
I would love to help,mick.

425
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,650
I just don't know
what we're looking for.

426
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,180
Oh,that's weird.

427
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,330
That looks just like
coraline and you,only worse.

428
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,520
Must be the woman who died in the fire.

429
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,820
Maybe coraline staged
their relationship,too.

430
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,390
Morgan had a copy of
this on her bedside table.

431
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,330
Oh,a little french for
me. I couldn't finish it.

432
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,040
Yeah.

433
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,940
It was coraline's favorite book.

434
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,120
Hey,what do you got?

435
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,820
Her cameras...

436
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,210
Stolen by a guy who's
been dead for three weeks.

437
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,150
I gotta get eyes on
this girl for myself.

438
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,650
Yeah. You do.

439
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,580
Hey,morgan.

440
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,820
This is my associate,josef.

441
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,320
It's nice to meet you.

442
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,650
The suspense is just killing
me. What's the surprise?

443
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,560
Over here.

444
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,480
Go on. Open it.

445
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,320
My cameras.

446
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,280
How did you do it?

447
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,920
You recognize this guy?

448
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,520
Yeah,that's him. That's the thief.

449
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,950
You're amazing.

450
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,270
It was nothing special.

451
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,890
His prints were in the system.

452
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,510
The cameras were stashed
at a safe at his house.

453
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,260
And who's that in the photo?

454
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,720
I presume that's the woman who
burned to death in the fire.

455
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,580
Your thief was her
boyfriend. He killed her.

456
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,900
He set the fire to cover it up.

457
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,250
And he came after me because he thought
I had incriminating evidence. Right.

458
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,610
Well,we'll see when the police
get a match on her molars.

459
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,040
So that's that.

460
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,490
Not quite.

461
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,000
There's one little catch.

462
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,820
This is the death certificate of the man whose
fingerprints were found on your front door...

463
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,990
From three weeks prior.

464
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,530
This guy was dead when
you took his pictures.

465
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,240
He faked his own death?

466
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,880
Or he rose from the grave.

467
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,050
He must have faked it,right?

468
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,930
That's the only explanation.
Where is he buried?

469
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,060
He was cremated.

470
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,780
His ashes are now at hollywood forever.

471
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,540
Well,not if he faked his own death.

472
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,100
We need to go to the cemetery
and see if his remains are there--

473
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,490
Don't you think we should
let the police handle this?

474
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,250
Yeah,you got your cameras back.

475
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,610
This case is over.

476
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,260
Wait a second.

477
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,830
The thief is a dead guy,and you guys
aren't even just a little bit curious?

478
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,580
Come on. We can't stop now.

479
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,530
You were right.

480
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,830
Morgan is a perfect
doppelganger for coraline.

481
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,110
She moves like coraline.

482
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,620
She sounds like coraline.

483
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,580
She didn't flinch,even when I baited
her about coming back from the dead.

484
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,190
The nerve.

485
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,090
But,mick,it isn't coraline.

486
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,700
I could smell morgan in there.

487
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,690
She wasn't a vampire.

488
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,670
She's a human.

489
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,040
And there's no way to assimilate that fact into
any conspiracy theory about coraline coming back.

490
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,290
- I know,but- -
No,there is no "buts."

491
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,180
But what if it is
coraline,and she's reversed it?

492
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,350
Reversed what?

493
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,900
You don't even
get it,do you--

494
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,900
What this means?

495
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,280
It means that you're losing it.

496
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,440
- It means she's found a cure.
- A cure?

497
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,290
There is no cure for vampirism,mick.

498
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,520
If there was,I would know about
it,and not that I would care.

499
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,470
And personally,there's no way i'd
ever go back to the mortal coil.

500
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,600
That's you. I would.

501
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,110
You see that? Right there.

502
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,010
That's your entire problem.

503
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,640
There is no way to
un-become a vampire,mick.

504
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,610
I think this has to do with beth.

505
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,510
I think beth is why
coraline has come back now,

506
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,980
because she can't
stand to see me--

507
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,090
With a human.

508
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,940
Is that what you were gonna say?

509
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,910
She can't stand to see me happy.

510
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,040
Look,I appreciate,you know,

511
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,820
the unwritten rule that we
don't give each other advice,

512
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,120
that we don't nag.

513
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,350
What are you saying?

514
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,540
One of these days,you're gonna
have to stop hating what you are.

515
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,300
God,this whole story just
gets crazier and crazier.

516
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,860
No joke.

517
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,350
It's like one of those true stories
that sounds more like fiction.

518
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,290
Inadvertently catching
a murder on camera?

519
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,110
A horrific murder-- Burned alive,that I
happened to catch at that exact moment?

520
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,120
What are the chances?

521
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,650
Beth thinks it's the angle
we need with her editor.

522
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,120
She does,huh?

523
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,720
Yeah.

524
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,290
What's the deal with you two,anyway?

525
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,180
There is no deal.

526
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,510
She likes you.

527
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,700
She has a boyfriend.

528
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,450
Well,it's there if you want it,trust me.

529
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,410
What about you?

530
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,280
me?

531
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,710
Why don't I handle the guards?

532
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,010
What are you gonna do?

533
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,970
I'll think of something.

534
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,220
Why did you leave the other night?

535
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,810
We were just starting to have some fun.

536
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,600
What night?

537
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,910
I get it.

538
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,990
You fight pretty good
for a dead guy,mottola--

539
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,760
Just like a vampire.

540
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,070
Mick!

541
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,060
Your eyes.

542
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,380
come back here!

543
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,580
Come here!

544
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,490
You come here.

545
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,550
What's wrong with you?

546
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,760
You tried to kill me!

547
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,100
What are you talking about?

548
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,680
I kill you,then you kill me,and
we're even,huh? Is that it?

549
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,280
You're scaring me.

550
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,220
You set me up in there.

551
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,080
It was your idea to check those remains,

552
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,280
and then I get ambushed by hank mottola.

553
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,660
What is he,some friend of yours?

554
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,540
Get away from me!

555
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,730
Just tell me how you did it.

556
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,300
Just tell me how you turned human.

557
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,720
Show me that tattoo!

558
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,330
What tattoo?

559
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,080
Where's your tattoo?

560
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,980
There's no tattoo!

561
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,800
You're bleeding.

562
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,990
How are you bleeding?

563
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,650
How are you bleeding?

564
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,990
********

565
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,220
What did morgan say?

566
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,940
Nothing.

567
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,570
She refused to talk.

568
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,300
I think it's time you tell
me what's really going on.

569
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,280
The truth is morgan is the
spitting image of my ex-wife.

570
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,530
In fact,I was convinced
itwascoraline up until last night.

571
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,430
You know this murder
she's caught on camera?

572
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,170
Yeah.

573
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,540
Well,that's exactly how
coraline died-- exactly.

574
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,410
In a fire?

575
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,050
Yeah.

576
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,930
That woman was murdered.

577
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,830
So was coraline.

578
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,970
By who?

579
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,950
By me.

580
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,210
How did that happen?

581
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,550
You don't know,do you?

582
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,710
How would I know?

583
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,850
You ever had an intense affair?

584
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,790
Yeah,the first couple months of
josh and I were like a honeymoon.

585
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,670
No,not the first six
weeks,not a honeymoon--

586
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,510
An intense affair,like a fever.

587
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,690
I was kinda crazy about
this guy at college.

588
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,840
I don't know. It's a
subjective question.

589
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,880
You'd know if you'd had one.

590
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,950
It's like an infection.

591
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,250
It burns you up.

592
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,580
It makes you do things
you wouldn't normally do.

593
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,210
I know you're in there.

594
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,960
Send him out.

595
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,580
I got something for him.

596
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,850
Send who out? There's nobody here.

597
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,960
Then let me in.

598
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:19,030
I'm not in the habit of letting inebriated
men into my house at 2:00 in the morning.

599
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,710
You stood me up.

600
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,990
You stood me up three times.

601
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,090
I'm sorry. Okay?

602
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,470
We'll make it up.

603
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,230
I never thought i'd feel that way again.

604
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,230
What way?

605
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,990
Insane.

606
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,090
Then morgan showed up.

607
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,620
Yeah,and I went crazy,chasing
ghosts,nearly got killed.

608
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,670
I let a killer get away.

609
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,080
After all the parallels to the past,

610
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,780
I just didn't know what was
in my head and what wasn't.

611
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,140
So you tried to force her to
reveal herself at the cemetery.

612
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,090
Yeah.

613
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,300
But I was wrong.

614
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,940
Were you disappointed?

615
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,810
The longer you live,the
more surprises you get.

616
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,910
You think you'd come to
expect the unexpected.

617
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,660
But you don't.

618
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,890
Authorities now believe that
mottola faked his own death

619
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,080
in preparation for the first degree murder
of his girlfriend in the franklin hotel fire.

620
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,110
The girl has been
identified as diane apple,27.

621
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,880
As of now,mottola is still at large.

622
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,310
This is beth turner for "buzzwire."

623
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,540
Really great work,beth.

624
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,430
I knew you'd find a way in that sizzles.

625
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,420
Oh,thank morgan,not me.
