1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,165
Previously on
"moonlight"...

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:03,625
I wanna help people.

3
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:05,285
That's why I became a P.I.

4
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:08,805
22 years ago,I took a case
that changed my life forever.

5
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,525
someone took my daughter.

6
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,125
Everything's gonna be all right.

7
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:14,225
You're not gonna do this.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,485
over the years,I tried to stay
close,in case she needed me.

9
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:24,215
We make a good team.

10
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,775
Beth doesn't remember me from back
then,and I'm the one who rescued her.

11
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:28,995
were you married?

12
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,555
She's dead.

13
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,355
How did that happen?

14
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,455
You don't know,do you?

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,195
I get shot.

16
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:42,295
Occupational hazard.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,120
And even though I don't ha
tveo worry about lead poisoning,

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,840
there is maintenance to be done.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,610
Aside from silver buckshot,vampires
can actually just leave a bullet in.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,605
Bullets,shrapnel--
it doesn't matter.

21
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:59,850
But try getting through a
metal detector with that in you.

22
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,075
Our skin
reforms-- perfect.

23
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:04,725
Clean slate.

24
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:08,575
But those old wounds--
they still ache sometimes.

25
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:12,115
in an internet news exclusive,"buzzwire"
is one of only five...

26
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:15,885
you humans have your own coping
mechanisms when something goes wrong.

27
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:19,535
Some of you obsess,some
become vengeful...

28
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:24,505
charismatic cult leader and mass murderer
donovan shepherd's long stay on death row

29
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:26,775
comes to an end in
just 20 minutes...

30
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,530
and of course,some of you
block the whole thing out.

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,405
Officials had hoped that
staging the execution at midnight

32
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:41,415
would reduce the number of
clashing death penalty protestors--

33
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:45,990
more importantly,the number of
what shepherd calls his "family."

34
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,095
D.A.Quinlan,do you feel that
justice is being served tonight?

35
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:53,995
Absolutely.

36
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:55,855
This man ruined
a lot of lives.

37
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,265
Hopefully,his death will
provide some closure.

38
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:02,525
Why are none of the people shepherd calls
his "family" being admitted into the chamber?

39
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:06,005
The law doesn't recognize a bunch
of fanatics as family members.

40
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:10,555
Only relatives of the victims of shepherd's
rampage,including the lone survivor--

41
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,990
a brave young
woman named audrey pell.

42
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you.

43
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,665
It was ms.Pell's testimony
that sealed shepherd's fate.

44
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:23,795
She was only 10 years old when she hid in
a closet and watched him murder six people,

45
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,930
including her parents.

46
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,470
Ms.Pell?

47
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm beth turner.

48
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,985
I'm not giving
any interviews.

49
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:37,070
Oh,I just--I just wanted
to see if you were okay.

50
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,225
I don't even know if I can watch.

51
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:46,140
Does it feel like justice?
- Yes.

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,700
I want shepherd gone
from this earth for good.

53
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,155
Thank you all
for being here.

54
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:00,035
I know this is difficult,

55
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,880
but I just wanna lay out
what's going to happen now.

56
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,555
Mr.Shepherd should be done
with his last meal by now,

57
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:09,700
and he'll be given a chance to pray.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
it's time,my son.

59
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,190
excuse me.

60
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,610
hello,sweetheart.

61
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,190
I see you.

62
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,850
he can't hurt you anymore.

63
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,280
Mr.Shepherd will now be
allowed his final words.

64
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,570
Power can lead a man
down a dangerous path.

65
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,600
It can blind him to things
like reason,kindness,mercy.

66
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,090
I've had many years to
think about my actions,

67
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,860
my choices,things I've done.

68
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,190
I don't regret a bit of it.

69
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,250
I seek no
forgiveness--

70
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,590
just the blood of
those who crossed me.

71
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,160
And you know who you are.

72
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,330
I will live on,and you...

73
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,230
will die screaming my name.

74
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,215
donovan shepherd died by
lethal injection at 12:04 A.M.

75
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:31,720
His final words
were no benediction.

76
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,030
"I seek no forgiveness-- just the
blood of those who crossed me."

77
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,170
"I will live on,and you
will die screaming my name."

78
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,390
Oh,this is lovely.

79
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,345
Are you sure this is okay?

80
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:21,795
You barely know me,and I could
just call someone that I know.

81
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:23,295
At 5:00 in the morning?

82
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,395
Don't be silly.

83
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,790
You don't wanna be on your own tonight.
- Yeah.

84
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,195
So just make yourself at home,okay?

85
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,295
Thank you so much.

86
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,175
hello?

87
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:40,215
hello,sweetheart.

88
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:42,190
I see you.

89
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,290
Andrey, are you ok?

90
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,065
Shepherd.

91
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:54,620
Beth,I saw shepherd.

92
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,830
Honey,there's
no one there.

96
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,760
donovandhepher
s was out there.

97
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,445
You believe me,right?

98
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:19,920
Audrey,we saw him die.

99
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,795
Look,you got an untraceable phone call
from some idiot who freaked you out.

100
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:25,700
No.

101
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,680
He said the exact words
he used 14 years ago.

102
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,835
"Hello,sweetheart.I see you."

103
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:36,705
I never told anyone he said
that to me,not even at the trial.

104
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:38,975
That means it
had to be him,right?

105
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:40,125
Maybe not.

106
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:42,085
You've heard of
post-traumatic stress,right?

107
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:43,585
Oh,it's not my imagination.

108
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,885
No,I'm not saying it is,

109
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:51,115
but maybe seeing shepherd at the
execution brought back memories

110
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:53,155
and made you hear those things.

111
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:56,085
You sound like you
know something about it.

112
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:59,925
Well,we have more in
common than you think.

113
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,790
I was kidnapped when I was 4.

114
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,745
I don't remember much,not faces.

115
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,705
But I-I do have dreams...

116
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:11,030
and,uh,flashes.

117
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,985
Sometimes they
can seem very real.

118
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:18,085
So you keep reliving your past?

119
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:20,990
more like I block it out.

120
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,360
It's the only
way I can keep sane.

121
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,945
I just...

122
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:29,520
I wanna feel safe.

123
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
Come on in.

124
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,740
Well,it sounds like you guys
had a pretty rough night,huh?

125
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,995
What makes you
think I can help?

126
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:50,515
Well,I realized she might have
actually seen someone out there.

127
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,435
Shepherd has a
lot of followers.

128
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:54,655
If you'd have seen the
guys outside the prison...

129
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:56,315
I watched your report.

130
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:59,460
It certainly was a rainbow
coalition of psychos.

131
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,125
It's chaos here as police
escort witnesses inside...

132
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,245
see the guys with the infinity scars?
- Yeah

133
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:10,730
They call themselves
shepherd's "family."

134
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,665
So have any of these guys
bothered you in the past?

135
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:18,685
There are always crank
calls and letters,

136
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:23,080
online stuff,usually when
shepherd was up for parole,

137
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,835
but no one has ever
followed me home before.

138
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,935
Hey,it's okay.

139
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,615
I'm going to look into this,okay?

140
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,265
Thank you.

141
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,365
Okay.

142
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,620
it's my grandmother.

143
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,600
everyone's worried,like
I'm made of glass.

144
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,090
excuse me.
- Go ahead.

145
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,315
she's gonna stay with me tonight
until we know what's going on.

146
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:53,020
She's really gotten under
your skin,hasn't she?

147
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,830
Yeah.

148
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,815
There's something in her eyes.

149
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:00,590
It's like she hasn't had a
decent night's sleep for 14 years.

150
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,710
I could have been her,you
know,after the kidnapping.

151
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,950
You're a survivor,beth.

152
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,865
Yeah,but it's ironic.

153
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:15,365
Audrey's demon was in
prison,and she never felt safe.

154
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,375
The police never found
the woman who took me,

155
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:20,370
but somehow I
always felt safe.

156
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,625
So about tonight...

157
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,190
uh,I can park outside
your house,keep an eye out.

158
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,675
I am a night person,after all.

159
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,040
No,I'll be okay.
- Okay.

160
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm gonna start online,check
out shepherd's family.

161
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,260
so how do you know mick?

162
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,525
Um,we worked on a case
together a couple of months ago,

163
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,430
and,um,we kinda
stayed in touch.

164
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,350
And there's nothing going on there?

165
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,640
I only ask because I noticed the
extra toothbrush in the bathroom.

166
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,650
Oh,that's josh'S.

167
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,050
Who,your boyfriend?

168
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,650
Yeah.

169
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,615
Things are a little...

170
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:08,105
iffy right now.

171
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,575
He's out of town.

172
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:13,490
I've kind of been,uh,distracted.

173
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,710
oh,it's "buzzwire" again.

174
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,465
***********

175
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:23,195
beth,I don't wanna get you
in trouble with your work.

176
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:25,785
If you need to
go in,please go.

177
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:26,865
I'll be fine.

178
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:30,260
I'll veg out,watch
"pride & prejudice" again.

179
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,535
Okay,well,I just have to
post the execution follow-up,

180
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:36,355
pick up a couple of photos,and
I'll be back about 10:00.

181
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,455
Get out of here.

182
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,790
See ya.
- Bye.

183
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,420
Donovan shepherd
was big for a while.

184
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,070
He had the grunge charm of kurt cobain
and the media savvy of donald trump.

185
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,860
A lot of people thought he
was the voice of a generation.

186
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,760
It's too bad he
went manson in the end.

187
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,370
Irony is,even after being
executed for murdering six people,

188
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,050
he's more popular than ever.

189
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,730
lot of lost souls took shepherd's
call for blood seriously--

190
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,680
family values
at its worst.

191
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,625
1050 ventana was the
address of the '93 massacre.

192
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:44,710
It was also the user name of someone who
posted unlisted information on the D.A.

193
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,940
The judge,every jury member...

194
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
and beth's address.

195
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,470
where audrey staying

196
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,810
SCREAM MY NAME

197
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,010
I'm back.

198
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,260
no! You're dead!

199
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
who the hell are you?

200
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,085
That's not the
same guy I saw outside.

201
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,055
It's gotta be.

202
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,645
I'd pick him out of
a lineup for shepherd.

203
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:52,745
He's even got the scar.

204
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,550
Shouldn't we call the police?

205
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,970
I think mick wanted
to talk to him alone.

206
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,235
You can't do this. I have rights.

207
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:06,215
Yeah?

208
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:07,395
You broke into
a private home.

209
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:09,495
I have the right to shoot you.

210
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,245
I'm still considering that option.

211
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,325
you're not a cop.

212
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:18,210
That's right,so I don't have to fill out
paperwork in triplicate when I kick your ass again.

213
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,825
Did you follow them home after
the execution and call audrey?

214
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:30,885
No.

215
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:33,860
Do you know 1050ventana.Com?

216
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,455
Whose web site is that?

217
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:40,605
A prophet doing
shepherd's work.

218
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:42,855
Go ahead. Put me in jail.

219
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:46,830
Others will come,continue
the work,and she'll die.

220
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,635
You call your troops off.

221
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:52,075
I wouldn't know how.

222
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:55,805
You'll never know the love that
shepherd teaches-- the loyalty.

223
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:57,385
So enlighten me.

224
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:00,165
Soon you can see for yourself.

225
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:03,785
One of the biggest producers in
town is a friend of shepherd'S.

226
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:05,695
He's gonna make a movie!

227
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:08,350
Sometimes I hate
living in hollywood.

228
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,930
I thought about being an
actor back in the '70s,

229
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,650
but I think I really just
wanted to be steve mcqueen.

230
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
There is a difference.

231
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,270
producer's name
was jerry drake.

232
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,500
I guess he's a big deal,but I
don't really read the trades.

233
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,930
Hi.

234
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,285
Is mr.Drake here,please?

235
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:43,305
Maybe.

236
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,135
Do you have an appointment?

237
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:48,190
********To see him.

238
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
follow me.

239
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,870
Boy.

240
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,560
Too bad he couldn't afford
the place with a view,huh?

241
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,320
Do you want something to drink?

242
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,510
No,thank you.

243
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,550
horrible what
happened on ventana drive.

244
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,070
it's funny how one tragedy
can ruin a word forever.

245
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,530
"Ventana" just means
"window" in spanish.

246
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,840
And a "columbine" used
to just be a flower.

247
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,165
So,mr.St.John,my time is money.

248
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:45,305
I know a lot of
people say that,

249
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:47,920
but I actually had my
accountant run the numbers.

250
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,115
You're 10 grand in the hole.

251
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:53,075
Wow,and me without my checkbook.

252
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:56,005
I'm interested in your
donovan shepherd biopic.

253
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,865
"Variety" said that
you guys were friends,

254
00:17:57,965 --> 00:18:01,285
but I don't see those
pictures on the wall.

255
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:03,585
Oh,we used to
hang out in the '80s.

256
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:05,060
Donny was fun.

257
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,540
Then,uh,I got a movie
set up,and he got crazy.

258
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,940
So were you friends to the end?

259
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,915
Enough to get
him on the phone

260
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:19,960
when I heard he was recording
his memoirs from prison.

261
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,615
I thought killers couldn't
profit from selling their stories.

262
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:24,955
You don't wanna touch that.

263
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:26,715
This feels real.

264
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,545
Is this from that,uh,sword
and sandals thing that you did?

265
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:31,095
"Sparta."
- "Sparta."

266
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,270
That's it.
- Yeah.

267
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,780
Still the highest opening weekend for
a march non-sequel release. Look...

268
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,495
donny didn't profit from anything.

269
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,445
That $800,000 went
into a survivors' fund,

270
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:46,035
and buying his story
was just good business.

271
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:49,600
So is inciting people to murder
a part of that good business?

272
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,995
You didn't hide your I.P.Address
as well as you thought.

273
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,255
Guess I should've hired
the web guy from M.I.T.

274
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:04,395
No,you encouraged those
fanatics,and last night,

275
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:06,920
one of them attacked audrey pell.

276
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,195
Is she all right?

277
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:10,850
What do you care?

278
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,805
Her murder would make a better
ending to your biopic,right?

279
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:16,030
I did nothing illegal.

280
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,265
Maybe we could find a
part for you in the movie.

281
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:23,365
How about this?

282
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,810
Anything happens to audrey,

283
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,400
and your story is gonna have
a whole different ending.

284
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,680
And I don't think you'll like it.

285
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,275
jerry,here's les.

286
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,775
You must be something special.

287
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,905
He never has me hold calls.

288
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,065
Is that drink
still on offer?

289
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:49,565
It's always on
until it's off.

290
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,710
Wait right here.
- Okay.

291
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,270
damn.

292
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,055
Are you positive you're up for this?
- Yeah.

293
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:22,025
Shepherd's gone,but I still
feel like I'm losing it.

294
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,875
If one of these mug
shots is the guy I saw,

295
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:25,895
then maybe I can
finally get some closure.

296
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:27,095
Hey,beth.

297
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,665
How are you?
- Good.

298
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:30,735
I think I've got
everything we need.

299
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:32,105
Is the D.A.Ready for us?

300
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,560
I just got back. Let me check.

301
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,020
Oh,my god.

302
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,950
He's back.

303
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,375
Audrey's,he's not.
- No.

304
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:51,585
Shepherd loves
to set the scene.

305
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,135
This is how he would do it.

306
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,115
If he were alive,but he's not.

307
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,310
We just watched him die,remember?
- No!

308
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,970
if I have done my work wisely and
well,my story will have no final chapter.

309
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,200
Father garza has told me time and again
that it's never too late to change.

310
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,140
I say it's never too late to find
a way to finish the work I started.

311
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,115
Nobody saw or
heard anything.

312
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,425
But all this blood...

313
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:25,865
yeah,and there's
no sign of a body.

314
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:28,180
You know,I really think he's dead.

315
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,170
what do you think is going on?

316
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,330
I think that shepherd's family is
more loyal than we ever thought,

317
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,645
and they have a
sick sense of irony.

318
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:41,115
The D.A.Got special permission to keep
some trial mementos in his trophy case.

319
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:44,320
One of them was the knife
shepherd used in '93.

320
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,370
Yeah.

321
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,405
hey.

322
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:50,765
We got a real problem.

323
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,315
I know. The D.A.'S gone missing.

324
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:54,350
He's probably dead.

325
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,450
Well,he won't be the
last. Where are you?

326
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,285
I'm--I'm headed
for "buzzwire."

327
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,800
I'll see you there.

328
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,815
Shepherd's fingerprints
were on the bloody knife,

329
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:05,205
but the cops assumed they were
old,preserved from the original crime.

330
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:07,035
Yeah,I'm not so sure.

331
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:08,525
Listen to this.

332
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,055
Shepherd's memoirs were
mostly messianic ramblings,

333
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:14,105
but a couple of days before the
execution,everything changed.

334
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:18,915
like saul on the road to damascus,I've
seen the light and been given a choice.

335
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:23,480
Death is just a horizon,and
I will rise like the sun.

336
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,765
Blood is the key to
death's locked door.

337
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:28,695
blood is the key?
Is that about--

338
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:31,460
yeah,becoming a vampire.
I didn't even consider it.

339
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,545
I mean,a vamp couldn't
survive long in prison.

340
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,175
There's constant supervision,there's
no access to blood.

341
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:37,385
So it's not possible?

342
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:40,910
It is possible if it happened
right before the execution.

343
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,235
So how do you start a
manhunt for a dead man?

344
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:46,335
You verify the "dead" part.

345
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,160
An executed man's body is held
in the prison morgue for ten days.

346
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,890
If shepherd's gone vamp,I'll
find an empty drawer.

347
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,310
Okay. We've got a body.

348
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,310
Found the D.A.

349
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,780
Shepherd's risen,all
right,and he is pissed.

350
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,905
When most guys have
houseguests,the checklist is obvious.

351
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,735
Anything moldy
in the fridge?

352
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,780
Any private magazines left out?

353
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,905
For me,it's a
little more complicated.

354
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,965
The windows and doors
are all reinforced.

355
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:10,285
The locks are 10-inch
steel strike dead bolts.

356
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:13,980
There's electronic surveillance on
the front door,so you'll be safe.

357
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
You'll have to
excuse the mess.

358
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,590
I wasn't expecting company.

359
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
this is really nice of you.

360
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,250
Ah,mi casa es su casa.

361
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,400
That's spanish,by the way...

362
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,880
for "keep her
out of my stuff."

363
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,665
don't you think she'd be
okay with police protection?

364
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,765
I wouldn't be
okay with it.

365
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,825
Shepherd's a vampire.
He knows what he's doing.

366
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:41,885
Finding the D.A.'S dead body at the
morgue has made carl convinced that

367
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:43,795
shepherd's family
is on the rampage.

368
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:45,365
Good. Let him think that.

369
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:46,245
Why?

370
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:48,835
So long as the cops are
going after family members,

371
00:24:48,935 --> 00:24:51,090
I can hunt shepherd in peace.

372
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,790
In peace.

373
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,890
Yeah.

374
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,250
I have to go,but I'll be back.

375
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
Beth is gonna
stay here with you.

376
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,530
Now,um...

377
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,015
if you guys
get hungry--

378
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:21,115
we'll order in.

379
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,005
I would recommend not
going into the office.

380
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:34,105
Okay.

381
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,250
Okay.

382
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,370
Or upstairs...

383
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,775
or through the gray door.

384
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,205
Wow,this all sounds so
"alice in wonderland."

385
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:48,260
Beware the bottles that
say,"drink me," okay?

386
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,380
Has last couple days,shepherd was
on display like a lion at the zoo.

387
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,990
It's not the easiest place
to turn a guy into a vamp.

388
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,020
Had to be someone
hiding in plain sight.

389
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,380
Officer...

390
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,360
mick st.John.

391
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,255
A P.I.?

392
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:19,845
Yeah. The L.A.P.D.'S stretched
pretty thin at the moment,

393
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,075
bringing in a couple independents
to help with the grunt work.

394
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:24,650
We already have guys
looking at the crowd footage.

395
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,465
All I know is I'm supposed to
watch shepherd's surveillance,

396
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:29,515
look for any unusual activities.

397
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:32,280
It's probably gonna take a couple
of hours,so if you could,uh...

398
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,565
thank you very much.

399
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:40,655
Vampire visual comprehension
is off the chart,

400
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:43,680
so it won't exactly take hours.

401
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,205
the priest converted him,all right.

402
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,440
Drained him at confession...

403
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,540
and turned him
at final prayers.

404
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,810
So the priest turned him.

405
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,125
All those hours spent praying
were prepping him for vamp life,

406
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:40,235
explaining the bloodlust,how to get
through the execution,escape the morgue.

407
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:42,275
That explains why he
didn't eat his last meal.

408
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,810
Yeah,well,it wasn't
what he was hungry for.

409
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,220
anhing good on?

410
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,520
Every news channel's
got mr.Quinlan's murder.

411
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm sorry. I know
you guys were friends.

412
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,325
We weren't friends,exactly.

413
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:05,245
He was just kind to me after
shepherd killed my parents.

414
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,715
You were so brave to testify.

415
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:10,015
Yeah,I testified.

416
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:12,105
It still didn't get
shepherd out of my head.

417
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:14,895
Even now,it's
like--

418
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:18,070
it's like I have some
horrible connection with him.

419
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,250
You need to break that
tie,or he'll never go away.

420
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,255
Is that what you did
when you said you learned

421
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:28,590
how to block out
what happened to you?

422
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,490
Um,sort of,but I...

423
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,140
I also had something to grab onto.

424
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,020
someone-- the man who
rescued me,he was fearless.

425
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
It was terrifying.

426
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,525
But as long as I was in
his arms,I knew I was safe.

427
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:50,955
Who was it?

428
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:54,775
Well... when I was little,I
would call him my guardian angel.

429
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:58,755
When I was a teenager,I used to
picture whoever I had a crush on.

430
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:01,665
You know,johnny
depp,robert downey jr.

431
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:05,770
And all I got was a 60-year-old
balding therapist named bob.

432
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,790
doesn't quite seem fair.

433
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,380
Well,now you have
mick on your side.

434
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,210
I feel safe with him.

435
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,595
Given the complex history
of religion and vampires,

436
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,500
a church is not where you'd
expect a vamp to find sanctuary.

437
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,990
Bless you,my child.

438
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,475
Forgive me,father,for I have sinned.

439
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:38,605
It's been about 36 years
since my last confession.

440
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:42,235
Well,I'm glad you understand
it's never too late.

441
00:29:42,335 --> 00:29:44,335
Let's hope not.

442
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,970
well,let's see.

443
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,970
I cursed and lied to
somebody I care about.

444
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,415
I'm pretty sure I broke
a guy's forearm,too--

445
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:57,735
the radius,the
ulna,one of those two.

446
00:29:57,835 --> 00:30:01,330
Physical violence is
a sin to be wary of.

447
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,955
It's a dangerous
stepping-stone to darker deeds.

448
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:09,480
In the past week,I've drunk
about 6 pints of human blood.

449
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,225
Who are you?

450
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:14,770
I'm the one who
wants a confession.

451
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,665
If this is about donovan shepherd,I
didn't know what he was going to do.

452
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:27,390
When you turn a serial
killer,it's not too hard to guess.

453
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,610
Where is he now?

454
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Where is he now?

455
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,860
I can make you talk.

456
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,730
I'll answer your
questions if you let me go.

457
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,150
Why did you do it?

458
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,350
Money.

459
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,505
For all their faults,humans
got one thing right.

460
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:58,860
The $800,000 drake
paid for the memoirs.

461
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,845
So the survivors' fund is actually
a swiss bank account in your name.

462
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,980
Cayman islands,but yes.

463
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,165
So shepherd and
drake are still friends?

464
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:14,170
Actually,shepherd hates
drake-- really hates him.

465
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,080
He was always complaining how
drake abused their relationship,

466
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,850
screwed him over in the press.

467
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,865
oh,jerry.

468
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:55,965
Was that for me?

469
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,475
How--how
are you here?

470
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:02,510
You wrote a check,and here I am.

471
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,850
Look,donny,I...

472
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,540
isn't that what you do-- write
checks and make people jump?

473
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,220
this time,your money
brought back the dead.

474
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,130
You--you
look good.

475
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
It's been 14 years.

476
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,480
Not like you visited or called.

477
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,650
Wait.You--you
did call,

478
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,090
as soon as you wanted
something-- my life story.

479
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,610
I thought I'd come in
person,give you some visual aids.

480
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,990
wh-what are you?

481
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,400
Don't be so naive.

482
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,730
You make horror movies.

483
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,490
Oh,your movie's gonna rock!

484
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:23,100
To humans blood just smells
coppery,like a jar of pennies.

485
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,120
But to a vamp,it's full of smells...

486
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,500
the fear felt
when it was shed.

487
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,360
And the joy of
the one who shed it.

488
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,750
Beth,what's wrong?

489
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,765
Nothing.

490
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:14,195
Is audrey all right?

491
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:15,755
Yeah,she's sleeping.

492
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:16,945
Where are you?

493
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:19,325
Jerry drake's
house. He's dead.

494
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:21,915
I think shepherd's
coming after audrey.

495
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,065
Do we need to leave?

496
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:25,760
No,it's safer there. I'll
be back in ten minutes.

497
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,975
Unfortunately,all that
fresh blood in the air

498
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:31,760
sometimes makes it
hard to distinguish

499
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,980
who's still here.

500
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,970
hello,sweetheart.

501
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,410
I see you.

502
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,655
sorry. What are you doing?

503
00:37:17,755 --> 00:37:20,085
Oh,uh,nothing.
I was just,uh...

504
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:22,070
Looking for something.

505
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,755
So you
and mick--

506
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:26,445
I know you say you've only
known him a few months,

507
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:29,890
but it seems like you've
known each other forever.

508
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,705
Why do you say that?

509
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:34,400
I don't know-- the
way he looks at you.

510
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,670
Can't explain it.

511
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,120
someone needs to.

512
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,490
Nothing.

513
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,660
Where is he? Have
you talked to him?

514
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Oh,man!

515
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,670
beth.

516
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,530
I'm trying him again.

517
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
sounds like he's back.

518
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,675
is it him?

519
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:43,775
stay there.

520
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,530
Audrey?

521
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,510
it's him,isn't it?

522
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,870
audrey!

523
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,760
Audrey!

524
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Did he go up or down?
- I don't know.

525
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,195
There's someone
trying to break in.

526
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,295
Go!

527
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,310
where's audrey?

528
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,770
Blood.

529
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,640
You don't seem surprised
to see me alive.

530
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,550
I know what you are.

531
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,530
if you know what I am,

532
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:15,130
why are you fighting when
you should be begging?

533
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,250
where is she?

534
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
get out.

535
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,205
I thought you were dead.

536
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,020
Looks like neither one
of us is dying easy.

537
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,460
Come on.

538
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,750
Two vampires and
two lovely ladies--

539
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,835
in my day,we called that a party.

540
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:47,290
Yeah,well,I outgrew that phase.

541
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,330
come on!

542
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
close!

543
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,210
hello,sweetheart.

544
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,890
I see you.

545
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,920
how is she?

546
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Sleeping.

547
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,305
What did you tell her?

548
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:48,980
As long as shepherd's gone for
good,she doesn't need an explanation.

549
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,360
But I do.

550
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,340
I know who saved me
when I was a little girl.

551
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,430
I think you've
known for a while.

552
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,870
Maybe I have.

553
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,780
What else do you know?

554
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,870
That he had to kill a
woman he cared about.

555
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,955
Maybe he would
have done that anyway.

556
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:25,055
Maybe.

557
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,740
But that night he
did it to save me.

558
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,070
How was I supposed to tell you?

559
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,390
Why did you hide it?

560
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,720
Made me think it
was my imagination?

561
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
you had every
right to be angry.

562
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,410
I'm not angry.

563
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,670
I found my guardian angel.

564
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,840
I just wished...

565
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,190
I just wish he'd talk to me.

566
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,715
First,I murder my
wife,and then I stalk you.

567
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:15,695
It just gets better and better,huh?

568
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:17,380
No.

569
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,890
I could've lived
my life in fear.

570
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,150
But somehow I
always felt safe.

571
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
And now I know why.

572
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,715
Now you know why
it can never work.

573
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,320
All I know is,ever since I met you,

574
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,870
I've stopped using the word "never."
