1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,525
Previously on
"moonlight"...

2
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:02,895
I saw coraline last night.

3
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,265
Coraline is dead.

4
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:05,925
You look just like
someone i used to know.

5
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:07,935
Ex-girlfriend, maybe?
- Ex-Wife.

6
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:08,995
She's found a cure.

7
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:10,715
There is no cure
for vampirism, mick.

8
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:14,735
One of these days you're gonna
have to stop hating what you are.

9
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:15,855
What could be
the downside?

10
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:18,215
Missing all of the things
that you once loved.

11
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:19,750
Turn me.

12
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,005
Turn me.

13
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,885
If she is back, what does she want?

14
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:25,075
She's back for mick.

15
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:28,180
She's been lying
to us, stalking us.

16
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,415
No!

17
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:33,145
She's not a vampire! She's human.

18
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:35,245
She has a cure.

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,725
The object missed her heart but punctured her
left lung and partially tore the pericardium.

20
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,155
Is she going to live?

21
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,925
It's a deep wound, and
infection has already set in.

22
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,935
That's our biggest
concern right now--

23
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,540
That and a buildup of
fluid around the heart.

24
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,795
You know, it's a
very unusual wound.

25
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:01,305
I understand she told the e.r.doctor
that it was some sort of accident.

26
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:02,445
Do either of you
know what happened?

27
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,545
No. We don't know what happened.

28
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,005
Well, all we can do
now is monitor her.

29
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:09,465
I'll let you know
if there's any change.

30
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:11,565
Thank you very much.

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,695
Why did she lie for me?

32
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:17,225
Why didn't she
tell them i did it?

33
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,400
She wouldn't want
the police involved.

34
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,735
I can't believe i
almost killed her.

35
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:25,255
I-i thought for
sure she was a vampire.

36
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:27,355
You couldn't have known.

37
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
I didn't even know.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,440
You still care
for her, don't you?

39
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,240
She was my wife.

40
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,035
You really think there's
some kind of cure?

41
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,690
Coraline was a
vampire for 500 years.

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,980
Now she's as human as you are.

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,670
Something changed her
back, and if she dies, 

44
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,290
I'll never know
what that was...

45
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,710
Or how she did it.

46
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,540
NEW YORK

47
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,320
Did you find him?

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,470
That's him.

49
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,595
Where is he?

50
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:40,905
He's living in los angeles
using the name josef kostan.

51
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:42,625
What do you want me to do?

52
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:46,865
What i hired you
to do-- kill him.

53
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:48,505
I'll take the
next flight out.

54
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:50,625
It has to be done with fire.

55
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:52,445
Fire's impractical.

56
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:56,110
Long-range single shot
to the head would-- . - no

57
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,445
It has to be fire.

58
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:00,485
Why fire?

59
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:02,930
Because i said so.

60
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,800
Burn him to death, and
you'll get your money.

61
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,810
Consider it done.

62
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,550
LOS ANGELES

63
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,215
Oh, trust me on
this one, fellas.

64
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:19,935
When you get mixed up with
mortal girls, it never ends well.

65
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:21,645
You can always
turn 'em******

66
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,205
Nah, it's too much commitment.
- Come on.

67
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:26,165
So you're sayin
never turn a girl ever?

68
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:27,945
All i'm saying is
forever is a long time.

69
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:29,055
I know what you're saying.

70
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:30,610
All right, bets.

71
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,330
I'm in with three a.b.-negs.

72
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,250
i'm out.

73
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,295
What do you got?

74
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,795
Two pa...

75
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,180
Two pair.That's it?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,395
My flush beats that.

77
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:47,200
Of fives.

78
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,430
I guess tonight's my night, boys.

82
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,690
Glad to see you're here, mr. St.john.

83
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,645
What happened, tom?

84
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:36,745
We're still putting
the pieces together.

85
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,135
There aren't many pieces left.

86
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:40,175
Josef?

87
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:43,870
Forensics haven't found
any remains yet, just ash.

88
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,840
Whoever did this brought an awful lot
of firepower to take out just one man.

89
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,480
How did they get in?

90
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,580
Hato be real pros.

91
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,265
I've been the head of security
for mr. Kostan for five years.

92
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:03,550
I'm tellg you, there's no way anyone should
have been able to get near this office.

93
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,865
Oh, great. You're still here.

94
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:13,015
That's why i love you.

95
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:15,335
I just have to
finish up some copy.

96
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,515
I spent the afternoon in the hospital.

97
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,775
Oh, yeah, morgan.
How is she doing?

98
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,595
She's in pretty bad shape.

99
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,255
Does anyone know
how she hurt herself?

100
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:27,550
No she's s-still unconscious.

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,090
Cheer up.

102
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,190
I've got something to
ta your mind off morgan.

103
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,155
Explosion in a downtown office
building took out the top floor.

104
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,735
Terrorists?
- No.

105
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:41,155
Apparently the
target was this, uh...

106
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,260
Big shot hedge fund trader.

107
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,755
Oh, my god. That's josef kostan.

108
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,495
He's a friend of mick's.

109
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,585
Okay, i take it back.
This is why i love you.

110
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,580
Was he there?

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,925
Afraid so.

112
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,310
No survivors.

113
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,325
Uh, have a cameraman
meet you down there.

114
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:57,945
I wanna know the
who, what and why.

115
00:05:58,045 --> 00:05:59,035
I can't cover this story.

116
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:00,715
This guy's a really
good friend of mick's.

117
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:01,555
Great.

118
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,935
Use that to show
some vulnerability.

119
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:07,820
Tracking says women 18 to
34 find you a little hars

120
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,380
it was poker night.

121
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,425
I was supposed to be here.

122
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,525
I'm so sorry.

123
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,820
Yeah. Me, too.

124
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,725
Who could have done this?

125
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:39,685
I mean, they used fire.

126
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:41,745
They must have
known he was a vampire.

127
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,920
Josef had enemies, but this...

128
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,360
Who could hate him this much?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,060
You brought your camera guy?

130
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,615
That's why you're
here? You're on a story?

131
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,445
Look, maureen
sent me-- just--

132
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,545
beth, just go away.

133
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,685
Listen, they were gonna send
someone here to cover this story.

134
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:06,315
Wouldn't you rather it was me?

135
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:07,645
My friend just died.

136
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:10,295
I dot really wanna
talk to you right now.

137
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:13,860
No, actually, you
stay and get your story.

138
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,630
You do your job. I'll do mine.

139
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,865
Josef had cameras
installed in every office?

140
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:25,005
Top of the line--
offices, hallways, elevators, 

141
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:28,095
Parking structure, the
basement, even the boiler room.

142
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,165
He even wanted infrared
cameras installed.

143
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:32,540
I don't know why, but he insisted.

144
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,145
I know why.

145
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,665
Vampires don't
give off body heat.

146
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:39,975
Josef wanted to know exactly
who his visitors were.

147
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,440
Here. This is him.

148
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,890
A heatignature.

149
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,805
Josef's killer is a human.

150
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:51,285
He must have come in with the
maintenance crew for the night shift.

151
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:56,025
As soon as i saw him go into mr. Kostan's
office,  i headed up there, but it was too late.

152
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,150
Wait. Stop.Stop right there.

153
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,820
Can you zoom in
on the incendiaries?

154
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Those look military grade.

155
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,175
I need a copy of this footage.
- Sure.

156
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:12,380
Anything i can do
to help get this guy.

157
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,945
Yeah.

158
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:17,985
Mr. St.john?
- Yes.

159
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,405
This is dr. Duffy.

160
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:22,590
You should come down to the
hospital. Miss vincent's awake.

161
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,835
How's she doing? Is she okay?

162
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,675
Her wound shows
some signs of healing.

163
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,775
She's been in and
out of consciousness.

164
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,645
Can i talk to her?

165
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,615
Just a few minutes. She needs to rest.

166
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:35,715
Okay. Thanks.

167
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,290
Hey, coraline.

168
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,830
U look like someone just died.

169
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,240
Someone did.

170
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,690
It's josef.

171
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,830
God.

172
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,050
I remember introducing you two.

173
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,300
You thout he was a pompous jerk, 

174
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,750
and he thought you weren't
cut out to be a vampire.

175
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
We were both probably right.

176
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,495
But you were best friends anyways.

177
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:31,000
Ye, we were, and
now he's gone.

178
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,790
But i'm back.

179
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,345
You have to tell me how.

180
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:44,190
How i survived the fire
thatou thought killed me?

181
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,955
How you became human.

182
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:50,020
It always comes back to this.

183
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,050
You're so desperate
to be mortal again...

184
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,780
To experience
death for yourself. Why?

185
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,030
It's beth, isn't it?

186
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,330
You think you love her.

187
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,885
This is not about beth okay?

188
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,430
I came back for you.

189
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,050
I became human for you.

190
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,665
Doesn't that mean anything?

191
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,195
How, coraline?

192
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,295
For you...

193
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,450
You have to tell me how.

194
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,455
Look, i know-- -
Look, i'm really sor--

195
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:16,345
I overreacted.

196
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,395
I shouldn't have brought a
camera into josef's office.

197
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:20,495
I'm so sorry.

198
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,060
This is just really
hard for me-- all of it.

199
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,125
Coraline's in the
hospital, josef's dead...

200
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:33,410
I know he meant a lot to you.

201
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,035
I've outlived so many
of my human friends, 

202
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:37,570
you'd think i'd be used
to losing people by now.

203
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,775
Yeah, but losing
josef's different.

204
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,690
He survived 400 years.

205
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,435
400 years.

206
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:51,235
He saw so ch, so much history.

207
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,695
He was history.

208
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:56,030
And now he's gone.

209
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,370
And that loss to me...

210
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,720
Is so enormous...

211
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,750
That i'm not even sure if
i know how to mourn him.

212
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,835
I need a drink.

213
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,935
Yeah, me, too.

214
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,085
Well, are you just gonna
stand there all day, 

215
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,310
Or are you gonna help me
find out who killed me?

216
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,115
Recognize that guy?

217
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,395
No, never seen him before.

218
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:50,595
Is he a vampire?

219
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:52,905
No, he showed up as
human on your infrareds.

220
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,975
Does he know josef's a vampire?

221
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,645
Well, he did use fire.

222
00:12:56,745 --> 00:13:00,640
The other people he killed-- your
friends-- were they vampires, too?

223
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,150
Well, remind me to donate a little
something to charity in theiname.

224
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,585
Oh, wait. I can't.

225
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,685
I have no money.

226
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,825
I have no office.

227
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:16,485
I have no anything, because some janitor
decided to whack me in a very public, 

228
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:21,105
Very-hard-to-explain how- i'm-still-alive
kind of y, so everyone thinks i'm dead.

229
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:23,285
Yeah, and it has
to stay that way.

230
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:27,555
This janitor of yours is a professional
assassin with access to military-grade weaponry.

231
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:32,375
Somebody hired him, and you're only gonna
be safe so long as he thinks he succeeded.

232
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:36,630
So find him and whack him so
i can carry on with business.

233
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,350
Ere are you going?

234
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,945
Well, your assassin
may be ex-military.

235
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:49,595
I'm gonna see if your hack buddy rider
england can get me into their files.

236
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,515
He can't.

237
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:51,785
Oh, he can't hack the military?

238
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:53,315
Oh, he can.

239
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,315
He did.

240
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:56,795
That's why he's on a sabbatical
in south america right now.

241
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:57,845
I know somebody.

242
00:13:57,945 --> 00:14:00,115
Sam does some computer
work at "buzzwire."

243
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,215
Okay, let's go.

244
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,410
You... Stay.

245
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,880
You do not leave this apartment.

246
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,970
is this the ly time we get
a clear look at his face?

247
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Uh, yeah.

248
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,355
Is there a problem?

249
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:30,955
No, i just-- when beth said she
knew a hacker named sam, i thought--

250
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,145
You thought
i was a guy--

251
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:37,150
Overweight, living in my parent's basement
wearing a t-shirt with yoda on it?

252
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,715
Yeah.

253
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:42,240
Mick's kinda old school.

254
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,485
Okay, if this guy was special
ops, he wenthrough basic training, 

255
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:50,325
Which means that he had his
picture taken for his military i.d.

256
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:55,355
I'm using facial recognition software to cross-reference
your image with the pentagon's i.d.database.

257
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:57,700
Hodo you have
atcess to th?

258
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,990
Don't ask, don't tell.

259
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,175
Ralf Martan

260
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,810
He was training at Fort Bragg.

261
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,575
Ex-military*** special ops

262
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,610
He has been in
Afghanistan and then went to Iraq

263
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,365
He was discharged when he back
to work in Darkwatch associates

264
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:21,915
He's a machine

265
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:24,390
looks like he got
some trouble over there

266
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,750
went solo and disappeared
from the radar about six month ago

267
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,080
Are you sure you
wanna find this guy?

268
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,230
hey, you're back.

269
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,315
sorry.

270
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:04,415
Party's over.

271
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Excuse me.

272
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,795
but they, uh...
They just got here.

273
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:09,835
What did i tell you?

274
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,525
Well, you told me not to
go out, so i ordered in.

275
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,055
What do you got, a death wish?

276
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:16,350
Get 'em out of here now.

277
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,735
I'm sorry, ladies.

278
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:20,125
Daddy's a little grumpy.

279
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,225
We're gonna have to
pick this up later.

280
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,150
Bye josef

281
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,250
I love your place

282
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,390
I love you

283
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,490
Bye

284
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I don't believe this.

285
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,465
What if they tell
someone you're alive?

286
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:50,115
You want this guy throwing a firebomb
in here, too-- wreck my place, huh?

287
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:52,425
Burn me up like
he did tim and dan?

288
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,525
What's the matter with you?

289
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,885
You didn't even
think about it, did you?

290
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:58,630
Did you even think
about it for one second?

291
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,545
You know what? You don't
care about yourself.

292
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,370
Can you at least care
about not getting me killed?

293
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,530
Listen, i wasn't like...

294
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,285
Look, i get lonely, man. You know that.

295
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:13,280
Yeah. I'm beginning to see why.

296
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,145
The hacker got
the assassin's name.

297
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:21,735
Ralf martan--
do you know him?

298
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:24,280
Martan, martan...
Oh--nope.

299
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,215
Apparently some born killer.

300
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:30,585
Special ops, darkwatch, afghanistan...

301
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:33,280
Oh, you know, last time i was
there, the british were inving

302
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,780
And i need to
go to my office.

303
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,485
Are you-- are
you kidding?

304
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:42,845
No. I have a fireproof
safe.I need to get some cash.

305
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,225
You--what do you want?
You don't needash.

306
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:45,325
No, i gotta get it.

307
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:46,825
Okay, i can't drink your
store-bought blood anymore.

308
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,535
I need some fresh a.b.-negative.

309
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:52,230
Your office is--your office
is not a safe place. This...

310
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
I'm going to bed.

311
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
And what am i
supposed to do?

312
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,260
Why don't you tidy up?

313
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,645
Are you sure these vitals are right?

314
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:09,235
I checked them myself.

315
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:12,765
So our patient has a raging
infection, but instead of spiking a fever, 

316
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,660
Her temperature's dropped 2
degrees in the past six hours?

317
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,495
I don't know what to tell you.

318
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,880
Try again. This
can't be right.

319
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,650
It's okay. I'm just
checking your vitals.

320
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm dying.

321
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Calm down now.

322
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,730
It's so strange.

323
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,720
I'm nosupposed to.

324
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,170
There you go.
Nice and comfy.

325
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,470
Stop right there.

326
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,370
Mr. Kostan?

327
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,300
Hi, tom.

328
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,505
I can't believe it.

329
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:46,795
Yeah, well, i thought
about calling first, 

330
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,715
But i didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

331
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:51,265
You're alive, but how?

332
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:52,965
It's a long story.

333
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:57,260
You're the only one who knows i'm still
alive, and we need to keep this between us.

334
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,830
Josef?

335
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,975
I called you as
soon as he showed.

336
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,685
Figured there might be a little
something extra in it for me.

337
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:17,785
There is.

338
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,180
You've already died once
this week. Isn't that enough?

339
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Who are you working for?

340
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,510
Answer me! Who hired you?

341
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,620
Now... I don't
like repeating myself.

342
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,435
Whitley.

343
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:06,845
Whitley?

344
00:22:06,945 --> 00:22:08,945
John whitley.

345
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,600
He's a real estate guy in new york.

346
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,240
You know that
name? Whitley?

347
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,915
I don't think so.

348
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,975
Don't lie to me, josef.

349
00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:32,500
He certainly seemed to know you.

350
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,210
Give me a hand
lifting this guy, will ya?

351
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,450
Josef!

352
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,215
What's your connection to all this, mick?

353
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:01,615
I'm investigating the
death of josef kostan.

354
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,495
You think this guy's the one
that firebombed the building?

355
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:04,730
I'm pretty sure.

356
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,395
He looks like the same guy i
saw in the surveillance tapes.

357
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:09,235
What did he come back for?
- I don't know.

358
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:11,685
Security guy's dead.
Maybe he was a loose end.

359
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:13,455
We'll look into it. Good job.

360
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:15,860
Listen, be careful with this guy.

361
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,385
He's dangerous.

362
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:19,485
Hey, we do this for a living.

363
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,170
So i checked out
that name you got.

364
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,565
I found a john
whitley in new york.

365
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:32,745
He's 93, a wealthy
real estate developer.

366
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,185
At one point, he owned
half the upper east side.

367
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:36,405
That must be our guy.

368
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:37,275
No family.

369
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,250
His wife died
two years ago.

370
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,790
He had a daughter who
disappeared in 1955.

371
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,975
You think josef's after him?

372
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:48,450
Josef's sense of justice is
pretty much an eyeor an eye.

373
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,965
Where are you going?

374
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:52,285
New york.

375
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:54,605
I have to stop josef before
he does something stupid.

376
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:56,455
I'm going with you.
- Why?

377
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:59,110
To stop you from
doing something stupid.

378
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,370
All********

379
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,350
josh.

380
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,165
Oh, god. I-i completely forgot.

381
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,845
It's movie night, isn't it?

382
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:38,645
We need to talk.

383
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,745
Come in.

384
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,180
Are you...

385
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,145
Are you going somewhere?

386
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,495
Yes, to new york.

387
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:52,555
You know, the, uh, the
josef kostan story.

388
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:54,655
I thought that was wrapped up.
- No.

389
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,830
So are you going alone?
- No.

390
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,050
You and mick, i bet, huh?

391
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,860
When were you
gonna tell me?

392
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,030
I was gonna call you
from the air... Airport.

393
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,410
Look...

394
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,385
This isn't working.

395
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:20,995
It's just a case.
- A case?

396
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:23,550
A story.Whatever. Work.It's...

397
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,840
Look me in the eye right now and tell
me you don't have feelings for him.

398
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,530
Look me in the eye...

399
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,000
And tell me that.

400
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,510
You ready?

401
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,105
Oh, i'll--i can--
i'll come back.

402
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:01,425
No.
- No.

403
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:03,120
I was just leaving.

404
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
You two have fun in new york.

405
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,585
If you need
to stay--

406
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:14,970
no, it's okay.Let's go.

407
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,890
How did you get in here?

408
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,430
I work for you, remember?

409
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,030
What are you doing?

410
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,425
Josef kostan--
tell me about him.

411
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:47,615
Is he dead?

412
00:26:47,715 --> 00:26:49,715
No, he's not.

413
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,565
He walked aw from an explosion no
one could possibly have survived.

414
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:56,715
His friend dangled me off
a balcony with only one arm.

415
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,035
Now you're gonna tell me
how any of this is possible, 

416
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,035
Or i'm gonna put an air
bubble into your bloodstream

417
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:04,640
and you're gonna stroke out
without having gotten your revenge.

418
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,560
He's aampire.

419
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,975
That's not funny, old man.

420
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:13,160
No, it's not.

421
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,500
Now tell me everything about them.

422
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,835
Tell me...

423
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:22,935
How to kill them.

424
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,510
Mr. Kostan, we've
been expecting you.

425
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Yes, sir, i will.

426
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,185
Sorry. Mr. Whitley
isn't receiving visitors.

427
00:27:58,285 --> 00:27:59,555
Oh, please, can
you ask him again?

428
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:00,725
He was very clear.

429
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:02,955
This is really important.
- I'm sure it is.

430
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:05,055
Now is there anything
else i can do for you?

431
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,700
Yes, can you tell him it's
regarding josef kostan?

432
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,555
No way.

433
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:32,330
Hey, we asked nicely.

434
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,650
They said no.

435
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,170
After you.

436
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,375
Mr. Whitley, there are people here.

437
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:52,305
I'm not sure how they got in.

438
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:53,405
Should i call the police?

439
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:56,310
Mr. Whitley, we think
you might be in danger.

440
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,490
No, leave us.

441
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,615
You hired a hit man
to kill sef kostan.

442
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:05,385
No...

443
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:06,465
Sir, we have
evidence--

444
00:29:06,565 --> 00:29:10,715
I hired him to kill
charles fitzgerald.

445
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:11,785
Who?

446
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:15,725
That was his name when he
took my daughter from me...

447
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:17,765
When he murdered her.

448
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:21,455
Sara was 21 when
that picture was taken.

449
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:24,025
That was 1955.

450
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,145
In a few months, she was gone.

451
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:29,075
You ink josef is responsible
for the death of your daughter?

452
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:31,375
I ow what he is.

453
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:32,815
He's a monster.

454
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:35,690
He took my daughter from me.

455
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,175
Well, you better
tell me all about josef, 

456
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:43,230
so i can find him
before he finds you.

457
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,375
there...

458
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:49,475
In that drawer.

459
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,890
Bring me that diary.

460
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,195
This was my sara.

461
00:30:03,295 --> 00:30:07,430
My wife kept it from me
until she died two years ago.

462
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,770
My daughter was a
beautiful, innocent, trusting young woman.

463
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,935
Her only mistake was falling
in love with fitzgerald.

464
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:22,115
He exploited her love.

465
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:26,070
He seduced sara, and
then he killed her.

466
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,620
I couldn't protect her then...

467
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,675
But i can avenge her now.

468
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:38,360
So is that all in the diary?

469
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,770
Read for yourself.

470
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,955
So you hired someone to kill him.

471
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:51,450
It took me two
years to find fitzgerald.

472
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:58,070
I can't die knowing that
monster still walks this earth.

473
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,750
You're gonna have to leave now.

474
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,130
Thank you.

475
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,795
Listen
to this--

476
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:29,030
"it doesn't matter to me
what he is.I love him."

477
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,710
"i want to be with him, even though
he tells me it's impossible."

478
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,410
"i know our love can
overcome any obstacle."

479
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,830
"i want him to turn
me into what he is."

480
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,900
"he says it's
dangerous, but i don't care."

481
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,135
"i'm not afraid."

482
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:49,380
"it's the ly way we can
be together forever."

483
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,930
"I'm ready."

484
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,640
That was the last entry.

485
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,775
So josef never
mentioned any of this?

486
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,360
Never told you about sara?
- No.

487
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,165
I knew he lived here in new york
before he moved to los angeles.

488
00:32:07,265 --> 00:32:09,985
Vamps tend to move around. We
can't stay in one spot for too long.

489
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:12,390
You have. You
stayed in l.a.

490
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,850
I like the weather.

491
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
Really?

492
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,610
It's sam.

493
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,640
Hey, what did you find out?

494
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,165
Josef was picked up at the
terminal by an h & g limo.

495
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:30,805
I'll text you the
drop-off address.

496
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:32,905
Okay, thanks.

497
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
301 Waverly Place

498
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,055
Can i help you?

499
00:33:02,155 --> 00:33:04,005
Yes, we're looking
for josef kostan.

500
00:33:04,105 --> 00:33:05,495
No one by that name is here.

501
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:06,715
Are you sure?

502
00:33:06,815 --> 00:33:09,335
A limo service just dropped
him off at this address.

503
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:10,875
I don't know what to tell you.

504
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:14,120
What about charles
fitzgerald? Do you know him?

505
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,610
It's okay, paula.
You can let 'em in.

506
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,125
Well, you can run, but you can't hide, huh?

507
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:24,020
Not from me... Charles.

508
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,840
So we had a pretty interesting
talk with john whitley.

509
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,050
You wanna tell
me what's going on?

510
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,550
Mick, beth...

511
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,760
This is sara...********

512
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,545
You can take your dinner break.

513
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:01,645
I'll watch her.

514
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
What's wrong with her?

515
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,180
Uh, she's been in a
coma... Since 1955.

516
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,460
Oh, my god. She hasn't aged.

517
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:23,210
You know, i met her at grand central
station, and we were both waiting for a train.

518
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,975
She asked me for a light, and the
moment i looked into her eyes, 

519
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:30,710
i knew that she
was somethin' special.

520
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,205
I knew better than to
get involved with a human.

521
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:38,005
I knew it was a
mistake, but i did it anyway.

522
00:34:38,105 --> 00:34:41,370
And for months, i thought i
was keeping my secret from her, 

523
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,370
but then i discovered that she knew.

524
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,025
She knew...

525
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,310
And she didn't care.

526
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,480
That was the happiest day of my life.

527
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,475
So you were in
love with her.

528
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:01,190
I wasn't looking
for it, believe me.

529
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,075
The longer we were together, the
more i began to think that

530
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:07,190
The whole reason that
i became a vampire was...

531
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,140
You know, so i could live
long enough to meet her.

532
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,890
You know, it took me over
350 years to find her.

533
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,620
And only a year to lose her...

534
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,675
Forever.

535
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:26,025
So what happened to her?

536
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,125
He tried to turn her.

537
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,495
Ye.

538
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,075
And she'd been begging
me to do it for months.

539
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:37,690
I didn't want to, but
she wouldn't let it go.

540
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,240
You know, she knew that was the
only way we could be together.

541
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,670
So i tried.

542
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,840
I drained her, and i...

543
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,625
Fed her my blood, but it didn't work.

544
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:51,715
She never came out of it.

545
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:54,110
She got lost somewhe in between.

546
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
Josef...

547
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,870
This... L this...

548
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,155
It's not your fault.

549
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:05,425
I know, but
it--it is.

550
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:07,820
I'm the one who
did this to her.

551
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,175
You've been looking
after her ever since.

552
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,380
I couldn't let her go.

553
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,480
Oh, maybe someday medicine or...

554
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,370
A miracle or something
will bring her back.

555
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,285
Stay down, okay?

556
00:36:35,385 --> 00:36:37,385
Die, vampire.

557
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Why won't you die?

558
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,920
It doesn't always work like that.

559
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,570
Thanks.

560
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,060
You're welcome.

561
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,285
What are you using back
there, barbecue tongs?

562
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:30,195
Will you hold still?

563
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,295
I'm trying to get
the second bullet.

564
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,785
You know, for a 400-year old vampire, you
sure have a low threshold for pain.

565
00:37:36,885 --> 00:37:39,430
Well, giving is
different than receiving.

566
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,860
Done.

567
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,175
How's your stake wound?

568
00:37:43,275 --> 00:37:45,490
Well, nothing a little
blood wouldn't help.

569
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:53,080
All these years, you ranting about how it
could never work between us and humans.

570
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,295
Well, what happened to sara
is proof that i'm right.

571
00:37:58,395 --> 00:38:00,565
Josef kostan in love?

572
00:38:00,665 --> 00:38:03,155
That's proof that
anything is possible.

573
00:38:03,255 --> 00:38:06,115
Love can show you a part of
yourself you never knew existed.

574
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:09,195
Or a part that you
thought you lost forever.

575
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:11,375
And then this happened.

576
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:14,410
I guess the universe had
a different plan for me.

577
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,410
I guess who i am is
who i'm supposed to be.

578
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,250
You gonna try to make
your thing with beth work?

579
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,590
I hope the universe is on your side.

580
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,910
Are you okay?

581
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,390
I will be.

582
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,755
That bastard staked me.

583
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:42,465
Are you coming
back to l.a. With us?

584
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:45,040
I'm gonna stay
here a few more days.

585
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,160
You should have this.

586
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,360
She really loved you.

587
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,340
You all right?

588
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Yeah.

589
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,510
I just can't stop
thinking about sara.

590
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,770
She was so in
love with him.

591
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Yeah, it's terrible.

592
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,230
Do you really
think there's a cure?

593
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,950
Coraline made
herself human.

594
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,070
Is that a cure? I don't know.

595
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,320
I can't say.

596
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Taxi!

597
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,590
Come on. Let's
go do something.

598
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,000
Like what?

599
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,175
I don't know.
Something fun.

600
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:31,820
Something quintessentially new york.

601
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,935
We'll catch a set at
the village vanguard.

602
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:36,005
We'll... A couple of martinis.

603
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:37,795
A steak for the lady.

604
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,735
Just you and me on
the town. Come on.

605
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:42,760
I don't know, but our flight
leaves in a couple hours.

606
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,250
So we'll take
a later flight.

607
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,900
Look, i-i don't know. I...

608
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,595
I didn't leave things
very well with josh.

609
00:40:52,695 --> 00:40:54,860
I do think i need to get home.

610
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,630
Yeah, of course.

611
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,415
But i'll drop you.

612
00:41:00,515 --> 00:41:02,690
No, it's okay. I'll walk.

613
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,820
It's a good town for it.

614
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Okay.

615
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,690
Mick?

616
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,170
Code blue.
