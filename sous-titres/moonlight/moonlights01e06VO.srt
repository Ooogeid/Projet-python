1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,911
previously on "moonlight"...

2
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:04,960
being on the hunt with you is kind of fun.

3
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:07,938
It's a giant thrill ride that never ends.

4
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:11,171
silver's like poison to you.

5
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:13,682
You've been avoiding me ever since...

6
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:19,881
so how does it work anyway--the sex thing?

7
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:21,463
You parents never told you?

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,945
They skipped the part involving vampires.

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,427
I saw the way you two looked at each other.

10
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:30,187
what we want doesn't always matter,

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:35,201
but then again,sometimes it's all that does.

12
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:46,689
gorgeous, renee. Yes!

13
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,478
We're here with photographer nigel hart,

14
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:04,021
shooting a sneak peek of the exciting new collection of hot young designer

15
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,635
ghislaine tavares...

16
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:09,331
outfits only a broomstick would wear.

17
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,495
???

18
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:17,054
Watch the platter hand.

19
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,806
????

20
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:21,536
show me sexy, babe. Let's go.

21
00:01:22,554 --> 00:01:24,173
Steve, hello.

22
00:01:24,782 --> 00:01:25,317
I'm over here.

23
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:26,136
Can I say something?

24
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:29,149
I think you got the wrong attitude about this assignment.

25
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:30,439
Well, I'm a crime reporter.

26
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,793
We should be covering a trial

27
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:33,377
or a riot, not this fluff.

28
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:35,242
Beats corpses in an alley, right?

29
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,038
I mean, at least everyone here is alive.

30
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:38,146
Barely.

31
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:43,875
(Muffled) get up!

32
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,300
Up!

33
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,051
(Muffled) okay! Okay!

34
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,561
oh, god.

35
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:54,067
Tell me it's not 12:00.
No.

36
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,390
I'm looking for somebody.

37
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,684
What, do you think they're in here?

38
00:01:58,105 --> 00:01:58,915
I need your help.

39
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,282
You need my help.

40
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,316
Don't make me say it again.

41
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:12,373
Dolores maxford whitaker.

42
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:13,658
"Lola" to her friends.

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,317
Nice.

44
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:16,364
Is she a vampire?

45
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,171
Of course she's a vampire.

46
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,436
She's the vampire--

47
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:20,561
oldest one I've ever met.

48
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:23,638
And we've had this on again/off again thing for a hundred years or so,

49
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,380
but she came back into town a couple weeks ago, so it's on again,

50
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,257
until she disappears.

51
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,608
(Laughs) that's what you get for dating older women.

52
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:33,258
Well, it's better than dating a human.

53
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,361
Beth and I are not--

54
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:35,808
what's this about?

55
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,280
I told you. She's vanished,

56
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:40,182
okay, and I haven't found her in any of her usual haunts.

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,650
And believe me,I've been looking.

58
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:43,105
You got a phone number?

59
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:44,535
No, she usually calls me.

60
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:45,878
So you guys are, uh,

61
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:46,829
really close, huh?

62
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:48,442
Yeah, in our own way.

63
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:51,239
She's always been sort of unpredictable, exciting.

64
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,567
You know, traits you'll come to value when you hit the 400-year mark.

65
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,263
Yeah, yeah,

66
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:56,774
so she's been calling you.

67
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:57,446
Yeah.

68
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:58,275
Cell phone.

69
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:00,879
So let me get this straight.

70
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:04,112
Oh. She stood you up.

71
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:05,540
So instead of moving on,

72
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:07,286
you became so worried

73
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:09,894
that you immediately came over here and woke me up.

74
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,104
How much does she owe you?

75
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:15,859
Just see what you can find out.

76
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,678
Thanks.

77
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,180
Hey.

78
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:32,208
The theme for ghislaine's collection is celestial bodies,and this outfit is the focal point,

79
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,723
the linchpin that holds it all together.

80
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:37,172
Was that better?

81
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:40,193
Uh, there was just a tinge of condescension, just a tinge.

82
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:41,036
beautiful.

83
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,527
?????

84
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,558
No so high fashion, sweetheart.

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,498
(Man) renee!

86
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,931
(Woman) aah! Help! Help!

87
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:54,694
Someone get an ambulance.
(Man) come on. Just breathe.

88
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:55,111
Come on.

89
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,853
(Man) go call 9-1-1. Go.

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,896
no!

91
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:02,601
????

92
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:03,176
(Whispers) did you get that?

93
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,301
yeah. Yeah, I got it all.

94
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:07,121
I wouldn't call that fluff.

95

97
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:38,526
no heartbeat. She's dead.

98
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,269
Excuse me.

99
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,494
You're with the camera guy.

100
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:51,719
Go away.

101
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,785
You were her friend,obviously.

102
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:55,865
Don't pretend you're all concerned.

103
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:57,043
You don't even know her name.

104
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:59,166
Renee. Renee beresford.

105
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,433
Moved here from shreveport last year.

106
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,281
I didn't know her,but I do know her name.

107
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,636
I've done my homework.

108
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,648
I really should go call her mom.

109
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:09,934
So you were friends.

110
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,479
Do you have any idea what just happened?

111
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:13,849
Not really.

112
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,621
We went out last night to two clubs.

113
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,208
then around 11:00,

114
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:20,720
she wants to go to this other place,

115
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,967
but I really needed to go home.

116
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:23,993
Where did she go?

117
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,643
Club valis. It just opened.

118
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:28,938
She never came back home...

119
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,921
just showed up today wearing what she had on last night.

120
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:35,957
She said none of this mattered anymore and that she was gonna quit.

121
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:37,532
(Voice breaks) I r--

122
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:39,814
I really should go find out if someone called her mom.

123
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,889
Okay.

124
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:47,589
beth.

125
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:49,321
What are you doing here?

126
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,701
Covering a story that just got way more interesting.

127
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:54,103
You get any video of what happened here?

128
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:55,492
Yeah.

129
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,743
I'm gonna need that tape.

130
00:05:57,251 --> 00:05:58,262
I'm gonna need it back.

131
00:05:58,673 --> 00:05:59,411
Yeah, I'm sorry.

132
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:01,030
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the crime scene.

133
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,511
(Scoffs) a girl just convulsed and died.

134
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:04,927
Since when did this become a crime scene?

135
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,305
I'm not gonna discuss an ongoing investigation with you.

136
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:09,022
Ongoing? Since when?

137
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:10,776
What's going on?

138
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,845
I'm gonna have to ask you not to follow the story.

139
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,265
You're not gonna give me anything?

140
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:18,622
This is our third O.D.In two weeks from a drug we can't even identify.

141
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:23,338
How about I owe you dinner?

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,589
You owe me dinner anyway.

143
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,834
Um, ahem.

144
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,209
Yeah, give him the tape.

145
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,811
All right.

146
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:32,352
Here you go, big guy.

147
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:32,886
Thank you.

148
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,446
Hey, josh.

149
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:35,581
I'll call you later.

150
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:38,449
What was that all about?

151
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,296
Do you know of club valis?

152
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:41,945
Mnh-mnh.

153
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:46,084
I love the way the camera cut the light on her cheekbones.

154
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,138
You could dance on those.

155
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:53,668
Digital photography--what a boon for the tribe, huh?

156
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:56,109
Remember the old film days--no image?

157
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,298
It was like you didn't even exist.
Okay, okay,

158
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,233
so did you find her?

159
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:01,547
Before I tell you that,

160
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,438
I just have to know.

161
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:09,828
Is there any chance that you hired me to find beautiful lola
so you could cut off her very photogenic head?

162
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,145
Why would I want to do that?

163
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:13,559
You tell me.

164
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:19,527
I tracked the cell that she called you from.

165
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,223
I wanted to see who else she was talking to.

166
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:21,799
And?

167
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:25,097
She bought a metric ton of silver from a place called allied metals.

168
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,043
A ton of silver?

169
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:27,592
Yeah, quite an arsenal.

170
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,600
She got a vampire problem that you know about?

171
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,809
I can't think of any vamp who'd want to go up against her.

172
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:35,660
All those centuries she's lived--with that kind of age comes power.

173
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:39,836
I'm beginning to see why you're so attracted to her.

174
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:41,497
You know, when I met her,

175
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,948
she was building a pirate army.

176
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:46,605
Pirate army?

177
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,572
You know, back in the day,you could do that kind of thing.

178
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,317
Okay, so what aren't you telling me?

179
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,683
Oh, your vamp sense must be off.

180
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:53,913
I'm telling you all I know.

181
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,945
No, it's actually my detective sense at work here, josef.

182
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:58,401
What's going on?

183
00:07:58,751 --> 00:07:59,833
it's embarrassing, okay?

184
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:00,758
Mm.

185
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,093
She stole money from me.

186
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:04,572
I knew it. How much?

187
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:05,487
A million bucks.

188
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,026
Siphoned it from one of my accounts right before she disappeared.

189
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:10,964
What, did you give her your password or something?

190
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,555
You gave her your pardsswo?
Not on purpose.

191
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:17,314
I don't even want to know.

192
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:18,455
And I can't let this happen.

193
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:21,622
On principle alone, I can't let her cheat me like this.

194
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,347
It'll ruin my reputation.

195
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,128
So what, this is just about money?

196
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:27,599
There's no hurt feelings about being stood up?

197
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:30,089
No, of course not.

198
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:31,761
No, of course not.

199
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:35,295
I got the address of where they shipped the silver.

200
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,270
It's a storage facility downtown.

201
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:38,291
Well, don't forget.

202
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,148
She's powerful,

203
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,924
and you can't just confront her.

204
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:43,801
Thanks to your once-a-decade booty call,

205
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,706
a dangerous vampire now possesses a large quantity of a lethal substance.

206
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:49,137
I kind of have to check it out.

207
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,345
hi.

208
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,159
Right hand.
thank you

209
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,662
you're gonna hate that.

210
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,725
The drinks suck here.

211
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:29,787
Oh, I'm not here for the drinks.

212
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,127
That's what I'm talking about.

213
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,703
I'm not here for that either.

214
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:34,282
Right.

215
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,228
Ah, the upstairs V.I.P. Room.

216
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:41,596
You can forget about that

217
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:42,853
unless you've been preapproved.

218
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,780
What do you mean?

219
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:45,643
it's qualified buyers only.

220
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,110
How do you get to be one?

221
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,740
No offense, but if I knew, would I be out here talking to you?

222
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:54,083
???

223
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:07,237
sorry.

224
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:08,932
What? I got a stamp.

225
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:10,872
A stamp doesn't get you into the V.I.P. Room.

226
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,799
What will?

227
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:14,200
Being a V.I.P.

228
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,601
There's a list.

229
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,948
How do I get on it?

230
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,161
You talk to the owner.

231
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:20,142
Who is where?

232
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:21,305
In the V.I.P. Room.

233
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:29,589
sorry.

234
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:33,711
I'm a friend of renee's, and she said it wouldn't be a problem,me getting upstairs.

235
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:37,867
Well, it's not a problem if you know how, but you don't, so...

236
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:52,497
If you're human,

237
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,317
a metric ton of silver is

238
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,462
maybe a good inflation hedge...

239
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,407
or a lot of jewelry.

240
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:01,102
If you're a vampire,

241
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,530
it has a different meaning.

242
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:06,291
Lola had bought enough silver to paralyze every vamp in L.A.

243
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,708
it kind of made me wonder what she was planning.

244
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,062
Silver.

245
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,215
Terrance.

246
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,262
Where's guillermo?

247
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,733
A straight flush won me a week's worth of his night shifts.

248
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,652
Please tell me that's just lunch in there.

249
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:20,931
Not this time.

250
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,201
Oh!

251
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:24,878
This is L.A. County morgue,

252
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:26,773
not help-u-autopsy.

253
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,267
You can't just bring in your own bodies.

254
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:29,619
I need to know what killed him.

255
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:33,676
I'm thinking fire.

256
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:34,907
Well, not just.

257
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,201
Silver?

258
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:37,597
Yeah, a lot of it.

259
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:40,314
Silver should show up in the blood.

260
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:47,618
Blood should show up in the blood.

261
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:48,339
What do you mean?

262
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,664
This vamp's been drained.

263
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,846
Someone soaked him in silver and drained his blood?

264
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:53,682
Then set him on fire.

265
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,474
It's kind of excessive.

266
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:57,031
The silver would paralyze the vamp.

267
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:58,338
So would a simple stake.

268
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,579
Yeah, but with a stake,

269
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:01,560
there'd be blood loss, right?

270
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:04,273
With silver, you can paralyze e vathmp with no leakage.

271
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,499
Whoever did this wanted the vampire's blood.

272
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:07,567
But why?

273
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:11,398
I got a list three pages long of vamps who want human blood.

274
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:13,587
I've never heard of anyone wanting vampire blood.

275
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,250
You think some freak is out there feeding on his own kind?

276
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:18,295
Actually, her own kind.

277
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,306
I'll let you know when I find out.

278
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,555
Can--

279
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,984
I could so lose my job over this.

280
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,420
You're happy to risk it,though.

281
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:32,636
What am I buying you this time anyway? An iphone?
Iphone.

282
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,656
Okay,I just want to see her hand.

283
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:35,879
What is she?Some friend of yours?

284
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:36,938
No, she's a model.

285
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,048
That explains it.

286
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:38,785
What?

287
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:40,227
She is really hot.

288
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:41,901
(Scoffs) do you mind?

289
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:42,943
Knock yourself out.

290
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:43,957
Just make it quick.

291
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,953
what's the "v"?

292
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:49,671
Oh, nothing.It's what I have.

293
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,097
That's not what got her in.

294
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,076
Got her in where?

295
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,500
The V.I.P room at a club.

296
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,405
There was a bouncer checking people's hands and letting 'em in.

297
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,448
What's that incision?

298
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,944
There was something under her skin. We removed it.

299
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:03,650
What?

300
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,728
A microchip.

301
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:05,883
A microchip?

302
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,846
What, like james bond?

303
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,076
Uh... no.

304
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,856
Uh, like "find my lost cat."

305
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,109
People get 'em put in their pets.

306
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,192
Any vet can do it.

307
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:15,831
Do you read those with a scanner?

308
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,942
Shyeah, elters do,

309
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:19,585
but I've never seen one in a human before.

310
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:24,043
Wow. So club valis uses a microchip and a scanner.

311
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,233
How 21st century.

312
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:27,134
This V.I.P. Room--

313
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,643
do they serve silver there?

314
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:29,849
Silver? What do you mean?

315
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:33,611
The other weird thing about your pal here is that she had silver in her blood.

316
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:35,930
What? How much?

317
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:38,784
Oh, more than you'd get if you used it as an herbal supplement.

318
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,898
The silver was pure. My guess--

319
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:42,411
it's what did her in.

320
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:44,800
you really gotta go.

321
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:50,922
hey. What you got for me?

322
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:02,486
hey.

323
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,301
Hey.

324
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,027
So, uh, this isn't awkward or anything,

325
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,833
running into each other in the middle of the night in a morgue.

326
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:09,961
Again.

327
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:14,252
Look, I didn't want to invade your privacy,

328
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,588
uh, whatever you do here.

329
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:16,812
Oh, no, I'm--

330
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:18,100
I'm working on a case. It's--

331
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,542
oh, me, too. A-a story.

332
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,470
Oh, how's it going?

333
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:21,237
Great.

334
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,453
Good. That's--that's good.

335
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:29,000
Listen, I'm trying to get into this club.

336
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:30,833
You don't know a good vet,do you?

337
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:32,170
Me? No.

338
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,811
Uh, vampires can't really be trusted with pets. It'S...

339
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,250
of course. (Chuckles)

340
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:40,974
exactly what kind of club is it that you're going to that you need to go to a vet?

341
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,355
I, uh...

342
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:47,152
I need this microchip inserted in my hand.

343
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,657
Well, of course you do.

344
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:50,713
They scan them.

345
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,999
Can't you just hold it?

346
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,297
No,they check pretty carefully.

347
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,767
Okay.

348
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,613
They found it in this model who collapsed.

349
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:59,953
The morgue guy thinks it's from traces of silver found in her blood.

350
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,328
Silver?

351
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,883
Any more than trace amounts,and you got yourself an overdose.

352
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,171
Any idea how it got in there?

353
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:09,175
No idea, but she was fine before she went to club valis.

354
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,577
Uh, I don't have a vet,

355
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,496
but, um, I have something else.

356
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:14,558
Come on.

357
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,201
Don't worry. It's sterile.

358
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:21,247
Honestly, I was more worried about the size.

359
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:25,578
Why do you even have that anyway?

360
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,588
Oh, right.

361
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,878
Stupid question.

362
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:31,593
Okay.

363
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:33,789
This may hurt a little bit.

364
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,284
Okay, but I'll be fine, right?

365
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,780
Won't I?

366
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:38,442
Let's hope.

367
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:48,149
By the way, the, uh,the whole kiss thing?

368
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,093
Yeah, the kiss.

369
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:55,513
I was thinking that maybe that was like an accident.

370
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:56,984
Oh, okay.

371
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:00,753
Tell me when.

372
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:02,225
All done.

373
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:05,976
Hold your finger there.

374
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,503
So I want to go with you...

375
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:11,138
to club valis.

376
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,492
Oh, I'll be okay.

377
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:15,286
I'm actually looking for someone.

378
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,639
The silver makes me think that maybe she's there.

379
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:20,423
she?

380
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:22,775
Yeah.

381
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,034
I'll see you there in two hours.

382
00:17:46,902 --> 00:17:48,735
I can't believe this double standard.

383
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:51,761
I had to spend two hours getting myself up to club admissionability,

384
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:54,281
and you're just wearing the same thing you always wear.

385
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:58,177
Yes, well, perpetual coolness is the vampire's curse.

386
00:17:59,716 --> 00:18:02,047
by the way, how do you get away with silver?

387
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,105
I thought it was poison for vampires.

388
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,967
It's gold. And where's this V.I.P. Room?

389
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,527
Upstairs in the back.

390
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:09,914
Good.

391
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:16,349
you're gonna do that vampire jumping thing, aren't you?

392
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:18,280
I don't have a chip.

393
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:20,566
Just being human is so lame.

394
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:22,689
I know,but you wear it well.

395
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:24,024
I'll see you inside.

396
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:51,749
???

397
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:02,773
thank you.

398
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:06,733
Don't let anybody else in.

399
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,784
???

400
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:51,669
that girl that just came up?

401
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,860
The scanner said renee beresford.

402
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,572
Your model friend.

403
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:57,974
You want me to pull her out?

404
00:19:58,535 --> 00:19:59,672
I'll handle it.

405
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,193
black crystal?

406
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:17,903
Thank you.

407
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:23,185
thank you.

408
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:29,939
We prefer you consume it on the premises.

409
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,988
Uh, I was just waiting for a friend.We were gonna share.

410
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,629
Why are you wasting your time?

411
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,484
She's not even supposed to be here.

412
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,864
Calvin, go get me a drink.

413
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,843
You're not renee beresford.

414
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,081
How did you get her chip?

415
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:47,085
Oh, renee gave it to me.

416
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,177
I just wanted to try whatever it was she was doing.

417
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,173
Then try iT.

418
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,043
It's all for you.

419
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:55,537
I'm gonna wait for my friend.

420
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,670
Sorry I'm late.

421
00:20:57,747 --> 00:20:59,491
I knew I should've closed the window.

422
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:02,387
You must be lola.

423
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,183
And you are?

424
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:05,847
We have a mutual friend.

425
00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:09,159
He's been worried about you.

426
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:12,106
If it's the friend I'm thinking of, he's not worried.

427
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:15,550
Trust me. This little thing here helping you track me down?

428
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:16,794
She's got nothing to do with this.

429
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:18,758
Oh, I think she does.

430
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:21,492
Your friend and I have
something in common.

431
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:23,705
But you can see that,can't you?

432
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,266
And you two--don't tell me.

433
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:27,709
Just friends?

434
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:28,709
Leave her alone.

435
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:30,869
He lets you know what we are

436
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,402
and then leads you on the edge of our world, looking in.

437
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:38,018
Don't you want to do more then just look?

438
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:38,882
What is that?

439
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:40,487
It's what she came here for.

440
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:42,494
It's, uh, black crystal.

441
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:43,889
Well, you found it.You should go.

442
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:47,708
He cares about you,but he hasn't turned you.

443
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:49,017
Nobody's turning anyone.

444
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:50,033
I don't want that.

445
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:52,031
You say that now.

446
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:56,786
You're young,but in a year or two,

447
00:21:57,323 --> 00:21:58,708
when he stops coming around,

448
00:21:58,761 --> 00:21:59,809
and you look in the mirror,

449
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:02,284
I knowlo've  youoked at him and wondered,

450
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,666
what does it feel like to move

451
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:07,861
through the night so powerful,

452
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:09,658
nothing can touch you?

453
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,134
I can give you that...

454
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:13,244
I said leave her alone.

455
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:14,875
Without turning you.

456
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:17,105
Taste it.

457
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,905
Just once, and you'll see.

458
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:21,847
(man) this is the police.

459
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:25,761
We need everybody to move against the far wall.

460
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:26,770
Cops!

461
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,876
Get rid of everything!

462
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:38,125
Remember, darling,

463
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:40,362
half the world is night.

464
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:47,272
Bag that.

465
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,046
You've got to be kidding me.

466
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,021
???

467
00:22:55,928 --> 00:22:56,286
Josh--

468
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:56,921
don'T.

469
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:00,350
Pat everyone down,

470
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:02,112
starting with him.

471
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:04,787
Hey.
????

472
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:06,813
???

473
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:10,292
come on

474
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:22,141
Thanks for taking me home.

475
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,377
Look...

476
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:26,294
I asked you not to follow that story.

477
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:27,271
Fine.

478
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:28,430
Be angry if you want to.

479
00:23:28,486 --> 00:23:29,486
I don't want to,

480
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,978
but what do you expect when I walk into a club we're raiding

481
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:35,243
and see you there with mick st. John?

482
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:36,709
Oh,that's what this is about.

483
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:37,999
How do you think that looks?

484
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:38,683
I think it looks like

485
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,003
I'm a good reporter who got to a drug source

486
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:42,506
before the D.A.'S office,

487
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:44,576
and I wasn't there with mick.

488
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:46,722
Not really.

489
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:47,774
Look, I'm--I'm gonna go.

490
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:49,466
I'll call you later, okay?

491
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:51,045
Okay.

492
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,447
(josef) so?

493
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:15,988
Got somethin' for you.

494
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:16,657
Yeah?

495
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,861
Black crystal.

496
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:24,612
Oh, so I'm financing a drug operation?

497
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:25,361
Not just.

498
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,471
This is vampire blood.

499
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:33,899
Yes,apparently the high... is us.

500
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,311
Where's she getting the blood?

501
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,938
I found one vamp drained.

502
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:37,594
I'll bet there's more.

503
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,855
Preying on her own kind.

504
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:40,226
I should have known.

505
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:42,088
She stole a million bucks from you.

506
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:43,335
How could you know?

507
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:44,368
She didn't steal it.

508
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,583
She didn't steal it?

509
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,209
She asked,and I gave it to her.

510
00:24:48,235 --> 00:24:49,447
I can't help myself,

511
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:52,798
but I thought she had,you know, uh, limits.

512
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:57,188
The vampire used to make this survived maybe for hundreds of years.

513
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:58,625
This used to be someone,

514
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,232
and lola exterminated him,

515
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:04,226
reduced him down to a vial of party drugs,fed him to humans.

516
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:05,624
Yeah,some of those are dying, too.

517
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,345
Look, I know this isn't what you signed up for,

518
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,286
but you can't let the cops solve this case.

519
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:12,673
Lola won't hide what she is.

520
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:14,356
The cops find her--

521
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:15,218
they find us.

522
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:15,709
Yeah.

523
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:16,607
Don't worry about that.

524
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:19,585
I'm not gonna let that happen.

525
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:24,263
P.C.P.--Bitter chemical taste.

526
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:26,466
Heroin's bitter, too.

527
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:30,864
what does it feel like?

528
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:33,342
Just once, and you'll see.

529
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:34,082
Okay.

530
00:25:54,062 --> 00:25:55,124
Ooh.

531
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:56,830
Oh, my god.

532
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:13,674
Hey.

533
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:19,977
(Carl) we got no drug.

534
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,755
What do you mean we have no drug? We have 5 ounces.

535
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:24,348
Toxicology ran it four times.

536
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:26,599
I mean, they can't identify anything illegal in it.

537
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:27,590
It's just filler.

538
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:32,066
Traces of silver.

539
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,989
Take too much of that,and it'll kill you.

540
00:26:34,055 --> 00:26:35,764
People are paying a lot for this stuff.

541
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:37,835
We must be missing something.

542
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,105
Well, we got one guy that might talk.

543
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:41,323
You just gotta ask him.

544
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:46,012
Look, I'm a damn doorman is all, okay?

545
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:46,654
I just--

546
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,079
I create a cool factor.

547
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:51,389
Let's think how a jury will see it.

548
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:53,929
First...

549
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:57,383
they'll see three people...

550
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,671
dead from a drug bought in your club.

551
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:03,730
Three innocents who bought your marketing--

552
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,300
the best high ever.

553
00:27:06,037 --> 00:27:07,385
They'd hear all about your--

554
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:08,944
your cool factor,

555
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,490
where kids line up outside,

556
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,745
just so you can tell them

557
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:14,029
they're not good-looking enough to get in.

558
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,362
You see how this looks?

559
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,983
You're a predator.

560
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:19,853
These kids are your victims.

561
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:21,225
I want a deal.

562
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,066
Immunity,and I'll give you lola.

563
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:28,996
She makes the drugs.

564
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:30,995
I can tell you where she is.

565
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,397
How about this?

566
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:39,467
You wear a wire and say exactly what we tell you to.

567
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,476
You're not worried about the cops, right?

568
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,534
They've got nothing.

569
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,163
We're gonna have to distribute somewhere else.

570
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:52,679
The new location will be even better.

571
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:55,499
And we'll have a fresh supply of vamps to choose from.

572
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:57,004
If we take any more from here,

573
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,400
someone's gonna start noticing,

574
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:01,427
and we've already drawn enough attention...

575
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:06,971
thanks to you and your human girlfriend renee.

576
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:07,990
Lola-- (chokes)

577
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:15,763
did you forget something?

578
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:18,669
Hey.

579
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,183
Can I come in?

580
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:22,827
Yeah, of course.

581
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:27,940
Is everything okay?

582
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:29,862
Everything's great.

583
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:32,408
I feel fine.

584
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,676
I walked all the way here.

585
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:36,684
Why?

586
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,267
I wanted to feel the night.

587
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,322
Did you take some of that drug?

588
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:45,778
It was research for my story.

589
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,868
It tasted really weird.

590
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,845
Yeah, that's because it's vampire blood.

591
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:52,219
Do you feel like this all the time?

592
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:55,690
I don't know.

593
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,906
I doubt it.

594
00:28:57,982 --> 00:28:59,216
I feel everything.

595
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:08,505
When I was walking,the breeze felt like individual molecules brushing against my skin.

596
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:12,222
I felt people in their houses.

597
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:15,275
I could feel their lives.

598
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,137
Can you do that?

599
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,058
Do you feel me?

600
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:24,156
Or is it more of a-a scent?

601
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:26,901
You have no idea what you're doing.

602
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:30,293
I feel close to everything.

603
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:32,042
Do you?

604
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:34,510
There's no space between us.

605
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:37,372
Okay, there's space.

606
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:38,198
There's space.

607
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,314
You saved me twice.

608
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:43,096
There are no barriers
between us.

609
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,267
You just think there aren'T.

610
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:46,807
This is the drug. It's not you.
No, no, no. Shh.

611
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:48,717
This is me.

612
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:52,687
I just didn't know it,and I like it...

613
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:56,212
(whispers) and I wanna be close to you.

614
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:01,186
Come on, mick.

615
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:04,674
Join me.

616
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:33,697
???

617
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:38,599
Turn me. Turn me.

618
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:40,415
Do it!

619
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:41,499
No, beth.

620
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:44,102
do it

621
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:46,739
It's just the drug.

622
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,202
what time is it?

623
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:13,542
It's early.

624
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:23,938
Is this yours?

625
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:25,342
Yeah. Your clothes were wet,

626
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:26,479
but they're dry now.

627
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:29,714
So do you remember much?

628
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:30,836
No.

629
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:33,353
Yes.

630
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:38,695
The drug made me feel
invincible,

631
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:42,012
like I was more than human.

632
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:45,221
I felt like the hottest thing on the planet,

633
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,690
like no one could resist me.

634
00:31:48,444 --> 00:31:51,274
Wow. It sounds like this drug really gives you

635
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:53,661
all the highs of being a vampire without the lows.

636
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,825
What could be the downside of feeling like that

637
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:56,813
and living forever?

638
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,481
The scrounging, the hiding,

639
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:03,397
missing all of the things that you once loved,

640
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:05,899
like sunbathing, food.

641
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:09,166
I used to love that prime rib at musso'S.

642
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:11,911
Now I can't even remember what it tastes like.

643
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,250
And they say it gets easier the longer you live,

644
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,581
but I hope that's not true.

645
00:32:19,023 --> 00:32:21,003
Really? I'd think you'd hope for the opposite.

646
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,657
To forget what it's like to be human?

647
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,655
No way.

648
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:25,536
Never.

649
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:30,710
I was wearing that?

650
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:32,731
Yeah.

651
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:35,369
That is not like me at all.

652
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:37,229
Actually, you said it was the real you.

653
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,354
oh. I better get going.

654
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,369
I have some apologies to make.

655
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,492
rough night?

656
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:05,768
You could say that.

657
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:08,510
I'm, uh...

658
00:33:10,512 --> 00:33:11,704
I'm glad you're here.

659
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,183
Look, I'm sorry if I was insensitive about your case.

660
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,805
I know it's important to you.

661
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:16,705
I don't know what I was thinking,

662
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,001
trying to order you off a story.

663
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,649
The fact that I was in the club--

664
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:23,220
it was just work. I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

665
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,488
I shouldn't have made such a big deal out of it.

666
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:28,685
It's just...

667
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,239
this case is driving me crazy.

668
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,573
I really messed it up.

669
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,442
The drug evidence vanished.

670
00:33:35,502 --> 00:33:36,362
It's gone?

671
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,350
We seized the drug,but there's--there's nothing illegal about it.

672
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:41,272
Toxicology couldn't even get a read on it.

673
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,202
The guy we got from the club is giving us the manufacturer.

674
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:46,046
It's some woman named lola.

675
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:52,858
hey. He's wired.

676
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:53,580
Is he okay?

677
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:54,708
Yeah, he's a little scared,

678
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:55,995
but, uh, he'll do it.

679
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,386
Uh, warehouse is at 5th and alameda.

680
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:01,983
Hey. Uh, I got the officers ready.

681
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:02,802
Okay.

682
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:03,256
All right.

683
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,694
hey, look, I'd better go.

684
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,129
Okay.Good luck.

685
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:22,369
mick, it's beth.

686
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:26,970
Listen, the police are about to raid lola's warehouse at 5th and alameda.

687
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,251
If there's anything there you don't want them to find,

688
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:30,282
you should get there first.

689
00:34:32,798 --> 00:34:33,308
Okay.

690
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:26,483
Where's lola?

691
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:27,882
I don't know. Oh!

692
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:29,001
Where's lola?

693
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:30,635
She's in the back.

694
00:35:33,535 --> 00:35:34,397
Get out.

695
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,248
It finally made sense--

696
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:58,194
the silver, the vampire blood.

697
00:35:59,713 --> 00:36:01,021
Oh, my god.

698
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:03,793
Lola had made her own little factory--

699
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:12,040
immobilize, extract and eventually dispose.

700
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:13,817
(Lola) I wouldn't do that.

701
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:17,340
It'll kill him.

702
00:36:27,427 --> 00:36:28,686
They're vampires.

703
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,410
You're preying on your own kind.

704
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:33,621
(Lola) don't get all sanctimonious on me.

705
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:39,372
Humans kill each other every day. No one even blinks.

706
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:41,225
It's evil.

707
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,586
"Evil" is a word that gets tossed around a lot,

708
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:47,011
like "great" or "awesome."

709
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:51,821
you're actually enjoying this.

710
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,436
Everyone should enjoy their work, don't you think?

711
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:57,247
You're done here.

712
00:36:57,822 --> 00:36:58,735
You're done everywhere.

713
00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:00,398
So self-righteous,

714
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,090
like josef.

715
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:04,578
Both of you with your rules and laws.

716
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,751
We're above all that.

717
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:12,458
But you...

718
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,634
still trying to be human,

719
00:37:14,707 --> 00:37:17,007
hanging on to your little freshie friend,

720
00:37:17,084 --> 00:37:19,511
being all tragic and dark.

721
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,033
You can't go through eternity that way.

722
00:37:22,903 --> 00:37:24,574
You'll understand when you're older.

723
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:06,268
I don't need to be old.

724
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,380
ErI understand now.

725
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:20,741
There's nothing I could do for the others.

726
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,884
With that much silver in their bodies, they're dead already.

727
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:24,833
I need you three.

728
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:26,036
Go around that side.

729
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,162
Come in the back entrance.

730
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:29,011
You three, take the east door.

731
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,166
You two, come with me.

732
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:31,066
Believe me,

733
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:33,113
I'm ding them a favor.

734
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,321
(beth) the explosion happened just after midnight.

735
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:57,175
Police believe this is the site of the drug manufacturing facility

736
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:00,522
that's responsible for the black crystal overdoses.

737
00:39:00,586 --> 00:39:04,227
They currently have no leads as to the whereabouts of the people involved.

738
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:06,103
This is beth turner for "buzzwire."

739
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,210
So you got your story.

740
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:08,446
Yeah.

741
00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:11,885
this fire...

742
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,432
anybody can see how convenient it is.

743
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,079
It's lola covering her tracks.

744
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:21,889
I would think that somebody obsessed with mysteries,

745
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:23,396
like you...

746
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:25,602
would seize on that.

747
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:28,134
And get in the middle of your investigation?

748
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:29,650
No, thanks.

749
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:31,714
Investigation's over.

750
00:39:32,532 --> 00:39:35,231
The D.A.'S just happy black crystal's disappeared from the scene.

751
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,443
So has lola.

752
00:39:38,032 --> 00:39:39,274
She won't be back.

753
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,085
I don't want to know.

754
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,309
The warehouse is tedorch.

755
00:39:51,395 --> 00:39:52,991
Everything's taken care of.

756
00:39:54,844 --> 00:39:56,287
What about, uh...

757
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:58,456
she's dead.

758
00:40:05,926 --> 00:40:08,735
well, you know, lola never told me exactly how old she was,

759
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:10,618
but you know how women are.

760
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:11,277
Yeah.

761
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:13,362
She was at least 500 years old.

762
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:16,199
500?

763
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:16,841
Yeah.

764
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:18,282
Wow.

765
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,942
Imagine everything she must have seen.

766
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:23,747
Yeah.

767
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:24,891
All the history.

768
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:29,006
Lola said she thought you and I were alike.

769
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:30,034
(Scoffs) alike?

770
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,881
You and me?

771
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:32,682
Yeah. 

772
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:40,790
Self-righteous,following human rules and laws,moral principles,that kind of thing.

773
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,512
But don't worry.

774
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,526
She was wrong.

775
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,869
You're 100% vampire.

776
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:50,343
Only, you know,when you live as long as lola,

777
00:40:51,941 --> 00:40:54,666
it tricks you into thinking you're above it all,

778
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:58,065
that you really are immortal.

779
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:02,376
Yeah.

780
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,601
Then it ends.

781
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,702
beth, dinner's ready.

782
00:41:41,852 --> 00:41:43,178
Okay, I'll be just a minute.

783
00:41:45,093 --> 00:42:00,564
