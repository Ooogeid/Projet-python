1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,100
Previously on moonlight...

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,400
I wanna help people.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,200
It's why I became a P.I.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,700
I heard what you said.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,900
That I'm a vampire.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,900
after last time, what with the incinerating...
And the stakes in the heart,

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,900
I wasn't sure if I was gonna see you again.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,600
It was a lot to process.

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,000
Some people just aren't meant to be together.

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,000
Beth has a very real boyfriend,

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,000
and after my ex-wife coraline,
it's hard for me to trust someone again.

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,500
I know we didn't exactly
get off on the right foot,

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,700
but I've heard good things from beth.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,300
I'm glad the buzz is good.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,000
she also said it's never boring around you.

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,400
Vampires can be in the daylight,
but too much of it will kill us,

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
and our survival instincts are simple.
If you're dying, you need blood.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,400
No, not yours! Not like this!

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,900
At some point, you have to stop me.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,300
There. If dr. Rosin says it's okay, it's okay.

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,400
- Feel better now?
- I felt fine before.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
Well, I feel better.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,400
That is one weird cut.
I mean, two.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,700
It was pretty crazy out there in the desert,
wasn't it?

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Yeah, a little.

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,300
It's strange that mick hasn't even stopped
by since,at least to see how you are.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm fine.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,900
It's just, for a while,it was like he was there
every time we opened the door,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
and now he sort of disappeared.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,500
It wasn't something i said, was it?

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
sorry. What?

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,600
If I've learned anything in 89 years,
it's that what you want...

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,300
watch it.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,100
doesn't always matter.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Sorry.

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,000
You can want to get from here to there.

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,500
You can want to be on time.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,300
You can want to avoid someone
for their own good because say,

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,900
you drank their blood out in the desert.

40
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,900
But if the universe wants something different...
well, you can run,

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,900
but you can't hide.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
Mick.

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,100
Hi.

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
- We were just talking about you.
- Yeah, we were.

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,400
- What are you doing here?
- So what are you doing--

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,600
oh. We're, uh,here for a blood test.

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,400
A blood test? Are--are you two--

48
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,800
getting married? No, no.

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,200
Uh,for this.Josh thought I might have tetanus.
You know, from the chain-link fence?

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,400
- So what are you doing here?
- Same. Blood... work.

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,300
I-I-I have to get some blood work done.

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,100
You know, I left you a message.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Actually, she left four.

54
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,600
I must have missed that somehow.

55
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,900
Well, you know now,
so call when you get a chance.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,800
- Yeah.
- Or better yet,come by tomorrow night.

57
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,700
We're having a few friends
over to celebrate one year together.

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,700
Oh, I don't think-- mick doesn't wanna...

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,200
no I would, want to, uh, but I can'T.

60
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,700
I'm sorry. But congratulations.

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,300
That's, you know, one year,
that's, uh,that's really something.

62
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,500
Thanks.

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,200
See ya.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,300
There's what we want...

65
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,900
then there are the million coincidences
we have no control over.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The events that put us in a certain place
at a certain time

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,500
and change our lives forever.

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,100
who controls these coincidences?

69
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,300
All I know... it's not us.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
oh, no, honey. I just can'T.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Not with you.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
So run along, and we'll call it even.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,900
You know, your picture was a lot prettier.

77
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,800
hey, wake up, girl.We got a live one.

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Recipes?

79
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,700
Oh, josh and I are having
some friends over tonight.

80
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,100
"Coq in a reduction sauce"?

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,500
- It's french for "chicken."
- Still.

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,700
You said you had a live one?

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,300
Oh. Dead, actually. You're gonna like this.

84
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,300
- An escort?
- Mm-hmm. Juicy stuff, too.

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,000
My source said, "a very distinctive M.O."

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,300
- You think this is...
- like the san francisco guy, yeah.

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,300
The way this has been in the news
brings out all the perverts.

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,500
Look for a copycat angle.

89
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm all over it.

90
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,900
You know, the degree you like this stuff
almost makes me uncomfortable.

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,500
Mick St.John
Private Investigations

92
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,800
she came out here to be an actress.

93
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
She was in "our town" in tenth grade.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,800
She was the main one.
You know, the one that does all the talking.

95
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,000
Suddenly we couldn't reach her.

96
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,800
All her letters came back,
and her phone was disconnected.

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
I'd heard the same story for decades.

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Small-town beauty leaves home
looking for excitement and gets it.

99
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,300
Used to be it ended with her dancing
in a cage on sunset

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,500
or if she was lucky,living in some apartment
paid for by a gentleman three times her age,

101
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,600
but lately, I'd been hearing something else.

102
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,900
People all over town knew,
but...nobody told us.

103
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,600
we were the last ones to know.

104
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,300
That she was on the internet as an escort?

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,800
We tried that number, but she never called us back.

106
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,900
And they review them on the internet,
like sows at auction.

107
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm gonna find her for you.

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,900
I promise.

109
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,700
Thanks.

110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,700
hey, everyone, back.

111
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
hey,no pictures.

112
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,100
Cameras off.

113
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,100
come on, guys.
we need to keep everybody back.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Take a little private jobs.

115
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,700
Hey. ****

116
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,500
hey, I said everyone back.
Beth, come on.You know the drill.

117
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,600
Who are those guys in suits?

118
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,900
Oh, they heard the apartment's available.
Thought they might take it.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,100
- Are they F.B.I.?
- No comment.

120
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Can I quote you on that?

121
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,100
Look, we're dealing with a serious situation here.

122
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I need you to back off, okay?
Please. For once.

123
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,700
Is it like san francisco--
the escort killer there?

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,300
A copycat or did he come to L.A.?

125
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
all right, everyone back. Coming out.

126
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,900
Is that why the F.B.I.'S here?
He's come to L.A.?

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
Beth, you know what you need?

128
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,300
You need an "off" switch.

129
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,200
so your reporter friend.
Uh, what's her name?

130
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,000
- You know her name.
- Yeah**

131
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,800
So how's it going since, uh, happy hour?

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Fine.

133
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,900
Oh, knowing you, it means you're avoiding her.

134
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,500
You're a romantic in the abstract, my friend,

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
but the reality of fang on flesh...

136
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,500
look,
you said you could help me find the missing girl.

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,300
- Did I?
- Yes.

138
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,400
What do you think rider's here for?

139
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,800
- Your new valet?
- No,

140
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,900
maestro of all things telephonic--
rider england.

141
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
Mick st. John.

142
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,600
I hear you're looking for someone.

143
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,400
Right.

144
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
"A perfect 10."

145
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,700
What'd she do? She break your heart?

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
No, her parents'.

147
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,100
Well, she requires references. You know that.

148
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,900
Yeah, I'm not looking to hook up.
I-I just need the address.

149
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
No problem.

150
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,200
- You hear that? No problem.
- No problem.

151
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,200
Boy, a lot's changed in 400 years.

152
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,100
Yeah, there's no regular cathouses anymore.

153
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,800
Yeah, another casualty of the digital age.
Now it's categories.

154
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,500
Blondes, asians, busty, mature.

155
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,300
equestrian.

156
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,100
Choice, choice, choice.
It's very efficient, very american.

157
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,300
You sound almost nostalgic.

158
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,100
Whatever happened to the good old days of four
girls on a street corner undercutting each other?

159
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Okay. Here we go.

160
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,200
Wilshire corridor.

161
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,500
God, these pros do love their high-rises.

162
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,900
Thank you, gentlemen.

163
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
all right, listen up.

164
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,200
- To you both, together a year now.
- cheers.

165
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,500
Hey, wait. I'm not through.

166
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Is anyone else dying of thirst here?

167
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,900
To you and to that moment you first met.

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay, don't even--

169
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,800
the only two cars in a parking
lot the size of rhode island collide.

170
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,600
You said let an insurance adjuster
call it an accident.I call it fate.

171
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,200
- So... to, um...
- insurance adjusters.

172
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,600
- Fate.
- To fate.

173
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,500
Cheers.

174
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,800
oh, I'm sorry.
I'm kind of expecting a call right now.

175
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,500
hey.

176
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah, I'm good.

177
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,100
Uh, yeah. I c--I can tonight.

178
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,400
Um, maybe in, like, two or three hours?

179
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,400
Right now?
No, I-I'm--I'm kind of in the middle of something.

180
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,400
No, no, I want to. Okay.

181
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm sorry about that.
I've got this weird case I'm working on.

182
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,800
I've got a window to get into the morgue tonight.

183
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,400
You'd rather be at the morgue?

184
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,600
No, not "rather." It's just...

185
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,000
you know, I can--
I can probably get in tomorrow morning.

186
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,600
No, it's okay.

187
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,500
If you have to, you have to.

188
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,200
Thank you for being so understanding.

189
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,900
Yeah, I'm so understanding.

190
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,200
- Okay, you're mad.
- I'm not mad.

191
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Well, you're something.

192
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,100
Look, you have to admit, it's pretty rude.

193
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,100
Those are your friends in there.

194
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
Now you invite them here,
and then he calls, and you bail.

195
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,700
- Who calls?
- Mick st. John.

196
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,600
That wasn't mick st. John.
That was a contact I have at the morgue.

197
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Well, what would you have thought?

198
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,700
I saw the way you two looked at each other
when we bumped into him.

199
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,400
- Oh, for goodness sakes.
- Honestly,

200
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
I couldn't miss it.

201
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Now is not the right time
to have this conversation.

202
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,000
Not the right time?
It's our anniversary.

203
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,600
One year together,and I cooked the
chicken for you. Your friends are here.

204
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,100
I said I'll be back as soon as I can.

205
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,700
you know what? Take your time.

206
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,300
normally, vampires don't have
to frequent women in the trade.

207
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,200
Between willing freshies
and your basic vamp appeal,

208
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,800
there's just no need, but this was different.

209
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,600
A vampire had been here.

210
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,400
Even through the door, I could smell it.

211
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,000
struggle, resistance and ultimately, defeat.

212
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,700
And it wasn't just the victim.

213
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,800
It was the vampire who did it to her.

214
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,400
You gotta hurry.
My boss will be back any minute.

215
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,200
It won't take long.

216
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,700
- What are you looking for?
- I'll know when I see it.

217
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,500
Why haven't they identified her?

218
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,800
- Mm. They have, kind of.
- Not according to this.

219
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,200
Well, she had one of those stripper names, you know.

220
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,000
We give her e"ane do"j
until we find out who she really is.

221
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,800
Oh, my god. He did this?

222
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
You think it's funny?

223
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,100
Hey, you pay me 50 bucks to see a dead girl naked.

224
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,100
I assume you're up for anything.

225
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
You're sick. Do you know that?

226
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
shh. It's my boss.

227
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,100
good evening,sir

228
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,500
You sure you want to do this?

229
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
We have to know.

230
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,200
Okay.

231
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,500
it's not her. It's not her.

233
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,700
freedom.

234
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,500
Everybody's gone now. You can get up.

235
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you doing here?

236
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

237
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,100
No, the person hiding around the corner
in the other room gets to go first.

238
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,700
There is a sexual predator on the loose.

239
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't know if "sexual" is the right word,

240
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,300
but there was rumors about an odd M.O.

241
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,200
- A biter?
- That's an understatement.

242
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,100
I don't mean to cast aspersions,
but I think it might be a, uh...

243
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
it's a vampire--

244
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,500
an extremely frustrated and dangerous one.

245
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,000
So your turn.

246
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,900
- What?
- What are you doing here?

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,600
- You tracking the same guy?
- No, I'm looking for a missing girl--

248
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,500
the daughter of that couple I was with.
She's working as an escort.

249
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,700
Not this escort?

250
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,200
No. They said that this is the girl that their
daughter came to L.A. With after high school.

251
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,600
They were roommates, I guess.

252
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,400
So wait a second. You brought those people here,

253
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,300
thinking they were gonna see their dead daughter?

254
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,200
First, I went to a condo,
thinking I'd find their live daughter,

255
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,000
but that happened to be a crime scene.

256
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,300
- Which crime scene?
- Wilshire corridor, 87--

257
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,900
- 18?
- Yeah.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,200
That's how I ended up here, too.

259
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,300
I'm freezing. Let's get out of here.

260
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,100
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

261
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,300
Don't you think it's a little weird,
us running into each other here?

262
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,500
Not really. What do you mean?

263
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,800
I mean, you've been avoiding me.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,900
- No, I haven'T.
- Yes, you have.

265
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,300
Ever since... you know, the desert,

266
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,600
you've been dodging my calls, avoiding me,

267
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,600
and then we run into each other twice,
first downtown and now here.

268
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,800
Following two completely different paths,
we end up in the same place.

269
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,300
Don't you think that's a little strange?

270
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,900
You know what? I'm not big
on categorizing things into strange and not.

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
wow. Vampires make really bad liars.

272
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,700
Go on. Admit it.

273
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,800
I just don't think we need
to make this into a big deal.

274
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,400
It is a big deal. I fed you.

275
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,600
You were dying out there,
and I brought you back to life with my blood.

276
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,100
With my blood. Mick, now we're here, together.

277
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,100
What do you want me to say? Huh?

278
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,300
What--what do you want me to say?

279
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,000
I want you to admit that
something happened between us.

280
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,300
Okay.

281
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,700
okay, something happened.

282
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
If you're gonna say it like that...

283
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,700
so what if I called you back, huh? What then?

284
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
- What do you mean?
- You understand that I'm a vampire, right?

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

286
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,500
And don't you have some dinner that you're giving?

287
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,900
All I'm saying is that I'm here, and so are you,

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,200
and there must be a reason.

289
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,400
Help me track the killer,
and i think you'll find the girl.

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,100
- yeah?
- hi, cherish.

291
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,800
Who is this?

292
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm a friend of your old roommate.

293
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,500
- Huh. How is she?
- Good. Never better.

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,900
- She says hi.
- Really?

295
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,600
'Cause we kinda had a falling out
after she swiped my old web site.

296
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,200
Yeah, she's sorry about that.

297
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,800
She said I should give you a call.

298
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,900
Look, I'm private now.
Not really into expanding my circle of friends.

299
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,400
I could offer a substantial donation.

300
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,000
- 500 roses?
- Okay.

301
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,800
- Per hour?
- Fine.

302
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,700
And you're sure natalie
won't get all skeezy about this?

303
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I promise you, she won't say anything.

304
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
You'd think by now you'd know
how to spell "predator."

305
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,000
- Marissa.
- So was the morgue exciting?

306
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,400
- I'm sorry I had to bail.
- Don't apologize to me.

307
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Apologize to the man who burned the coq.

308
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,100
- Is he mad?
- No, not really.

309
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,500
That's kind of the point.

310
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
What's going on with you two, anyway?

311
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,900
What do you mean?

312
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,600
You've been together for a year,
and yet you're not even living together.

313
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,000
- We have sleepovers.
- Exactly.

314
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,200
Don't you think it's time to get serious?

315
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,000
- I am serious.
- About stiffs in the morgue.

316
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,900
- Is there someone else?
- No.

317
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
- Really?
- No.

318
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,500
No. Where--where is this coming from anyway?

319
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
I thought you said josh and I were fated.

320
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
Fate's fine, but at some point,
the human's gotta step in and make it happen.

321
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,600
Fate's not gonna get the extra keys made
and move your stuff into his apartment.

322
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,200
I mean, if that's what you want.

323
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,400
The universe sends you a sign,
and you just...

324
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,600
you see? That's a sign,

325
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,773
but you gotta answer the call.

326
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,500
it's not josh.

327
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,800
the dead escort's name was natalie hall.
Professional name jazzmyn, two z's and a "Y."

328
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,500
Voted "most likely to succeed"
by her high school class.

329
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,700
Not sure how the others fared,
but that's seeming unlikely at this point.

330
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,100
Favorite quote--
"have fun in the sun, get laid in the shade."

331
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,500
Careful what you wish for, right?

332
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
***

333
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,100
Josef, rider,meet beth turner.

334
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Beth turner, "buzzwire."

335
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Oh, such beautiful women on the internet.

336
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Thank you...

337
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,500
I guess.

338
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,200
So are you gonna tell me what I'm doing here?

339
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,700
Mick said you had a great voice.

340
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,600
Rider here has got a list
of all of the incoming calls

341
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,800
to the dead escort's web site
during the last 24 hours of her life.

342
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
One of them is probably the killer.

343
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,900
- So you want me to call the numbers?
- Quick study.

344
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,200
- And what, talk to him?
- If we're lucky, yeah.

345
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,600
What am I supposed to say?
I've never spoken to a serial killer before.

346
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,200
Oh, you know, be polite.
You know, "please," "thank you."

347
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,500
- Just do whatever--
- whatever escorts do?

348
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

349
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,500
whatever you want.

350
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,300
- hello?
- hey.

351
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,600
- Who is this?
- It's me--jazzmyn.

352
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, you.

353
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,400
- So, uh, I was thinking...
- what? What were you thinking?

354
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
You know.

355
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,500
No, I don't know, you idiot whorebag.
I told you never to call me here.

356
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,900
- I messed up.
- No, you didn'T.

357
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
I ruined it.

358
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,000
You didn'T. It's fine. It's not him.

359
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,700
he thinks she's alive.
He's not who we're looking for, really.

360
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,500
You were, uh, I mean, she was...

361
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,100
- very impressive.
- hot. Very, very hot.

362
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,100
Next?

363
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,400
- hello?
- hey.

364
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,000
Cherish?

365
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,700
- cherish?
- Is that--is that you?

366
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,100
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

367
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Where else would I be?

368
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,700
- Still on for today, right?
- Can't wait.

369
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,300
- That's why I'm calling you.
- Good.

370
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm really glad. You seem really nice.

371
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,000
We're gonna have a blast.

372
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,800
- So...
- yeah?

373
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,700
See you at greenies.

374
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,900
Wait. W--he hung up.

375
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,900
That's weird.

376
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,100
Kind of reminded me of high school.

377
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,100
Sounds like he wants a girlfriend, not a hooker.

378
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
Does anyone know where greenies is?

379
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,600
I've never heard of it.

380
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,100
I'll poke around.

381
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,100
Meanwhile, call was traced to a landline.
1730 los feliz.

382
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,200
If the plan is for today, you might wanna hurry.

383
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,300
Let's go.

384
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,300
- So your friends-- are they, um...
- what?

385
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,300
- You know.
- Vampires?

386
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,300
Can't tell, can you?

387
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,900
scary.

388
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,400
1730 los feliz

389
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,400
It doesn't sound like--

390
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,500
get your hands up!
Turn around. Turn around.

391
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Let them go!

392
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,200
Put your hands on your head. Now!

393
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,900
all right, all right.

394
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,600
cherish?

395
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,600
sure. Why not?

396
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,000
Finally, it's you. I saw your picture.

397
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,900
Just sit down, okay?

398
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
Uh, you know what?

399
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,000
Can you get me a double?

400
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,100
Mick st. John.

401
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,800
Do you have any idea how close
you came to getting shot?

402
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,200
Do you have any idea how close you came
to getting your face ripped off?

403
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,800
I never understood
what it is about humans and yelling.

404
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,200
Not that I don't appreciate that flushed,
blood-in-the-face look more than I used to,

405
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,800
back before I became a vampire.

406
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,900
It's just that whatever relief elevating
your blood pressure brings

407
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,000
causes you to miss things-- important things.

408
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
you got that?

409
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,900
what's that?

410
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I don't know. Looks like some old photo.

411
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,200
Looks like old hookers or something.

412
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Could we just stick to the case here,
not waste time on some stupid-ass picture?

413
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,100
The feds have this guy nailed.

414
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,200
He's a loner, 38 to 45 years old,

415
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,200
tortured animals as a child, wet his bed.

416
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,100
That freezer?
It's a place to keep trophies of his victims.

417
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,700
- 38, huh?
- It's 38 to 45.

418
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,700
- Profiling's not an exact science.
- I'll say.

419
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,900
They said we can go.

420
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,200
- He's a kid, maybe 16 years old.
- 16?

421
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,500
Well, going on 200. I saw a picture.

422
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,800
- Ugh, awkward age.
- You're not kidding.

423
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,400
You know, boys that age
think about sex 20 times a minute,

424
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,200
and that's a scientific fact?

425
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,500
Times two centuries, that's gotta take a toll.

426
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,700
Shouldn't we tell the police?

427
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,600
Well, he's a vampire.
It's probably healthier all around if we don'T.

428
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,600
Oh, my god. Natalie hall.

429
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,600
This belonged to the dead escort.

430
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,300
Just keep it hidden until we're in the car.
They're still watching us.

431
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,800
look.

432
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,100
That's her. That's the girl I'm looking for.

433
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,100
- You think he's with her?
- There's a good chance.

434
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,000
***Greenie's?

435
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,200
- There's a number on the back.
- Call it.

436
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,600
So what's the deal? You a virgin?

437
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,700
Depends on what you mean.

438
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,800
- I mean, would I be your first?
- My first?

439
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
Not really.

440
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,100
How old are you?

441
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,500
I said.

442
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,200
21, sure. I mean, really.

443
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,900
Really?

444
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,700
197 1/2.

445
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Look, you seem like a nice kid.

446
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
are you sure that...

447
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
hey. Don't answer it.

448
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,200
Okay, okay. Just...ugh.

449
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
It went to voice mail.

450
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,500
It's a public place at a crowded pier.
She should be okay until we get there.

451
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,000
How far is it anyway?

452
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,000
It's just at the beach. We're almost there.

453
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,300
So we can go on the rides, play some games.

454
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,300
- Rides?
- Yeah,the roller coaster's killer.You'll love it.

455
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,400
I don't have time for all that.

456
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,600
- Come here.
- You can wait.

457
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,200
I want you closer.

458
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,100
- So how does it work, anyway?
- What?

459
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,300
Just, you know, the sex thing.

460
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,800
Your parents never told you?

461
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,700
They somehow skipped the part involving vampires.

462
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,600
Vampires and humans, I mean.

463
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,400
Oh, I'm talking totally hypothetically, believe me.

464
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,300
Kiss me.

465
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,700
Like you mean it.

466
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,800
You wanna know how it works?

467
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,800
It doesn't, okay? It doesn't work.

468
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,000
So it's impossible?

469
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,700
It's not impossible. It's inadvisable.
It never ends well.

470
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,800
Never?

471
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
We're almost there.
You should check that number again.

472
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,500
Okay.

473
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,000
Maybe you should just calm down.

474
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,600
You know what?
Maybe you should just do what you're paid for.

475
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,900
- I'm out of here.
- Do not answer that.

476
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,300
Yeah?

477
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,300
****

478
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,300
do you have her? what's going on?

479
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,900
I can't tell. Listen.

480
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,400
hello? cerish

481
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,200
now give me the phone.

482
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,600
cerish?

483
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,100
- anybody there?
- you come with me!

484
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,100
this way.

485
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,100
i can hear you. I know what you are.

486
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,700
I know why you're doing this.

487
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,800
The bordello. Is that it?

488
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,400
Who turned you? What did they do?

489
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,600
Are you there? Let her go.
I know you want to.

490
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,900
Who are you?

491
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,000
Who are you?

492
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,100
My name is mick st. John.
I know you're a vampire...

493
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,400
where did you get this number?

494
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,000
***Like me.

495
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,200
Oh, like you, huh?

496
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,100
- I know what you're going through.
- Oh, you know?

497
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,700
Is that right?

498
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,800
I know that you feel cursed,
like fate has played a cruel trick on you,

499
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,100
like you're gonna wake up one day
and realize this was all a mistake,

500
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,900
but you don't wake up,
not as the years roll by, the decades--

501
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,600
centuries, mick. 200 years.

502
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,600
I didn't choose any of this.
It was done to me.

503
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,300
You can always choose.

504
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,500
sure.

505
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,600
let go of me. Let me go!

506
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,300
you don't have to do this.

507
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
wait, wait, wait, wait.

508
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,400
Leave me alone.

509
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,800
- that guy was gonna kill me.
- It's all right.

510
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,700
it doesn't have to be this way.

511
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,900
I know what you're going through.

512
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,700
***like

513
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,300
You think so? You think you know?

514
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,500
Couldn't possibly.

515
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,100
I mean, you were turned at what, 30?

516
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,700
I'm stuck.

517
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,800
All I've ever wanted is to grow out of this,
and I won'T... ever.

518
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,400
Someone betrayed you.

519
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,600
Oh, you think?

520
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,200
You're not the only one.

521
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Have you ever loved someone completely?

522
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,400
So that she was your whole world?

523
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,000
You'd do anything she asked, anything at all.

524
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,700
Have you ever loved someone that way?

525
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,300
So you forgot about yourself
and all you thought about was her?

526
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
I love you forever.

527
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Forever.forever,

528
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,100
yes.

529
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,600
see, I never have.

530
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,400
if I've learned anything in 89 years,

531
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,500
it's that what we want doesn't always matter.

532
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,100
You can want to get from here to there.

533
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,600
You can want to survive,

534
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,700
but if the universe wants something different,
you can run,

535
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,800
but you can't hide.

536
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,200
hi.

537
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Where are the cameras?
You're missing the moment.

538
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,000
they don't want this public.

539
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,200
"Beautiful escort nearly killed,
reunited with parents"--

540
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,500
that's just about the
juiciest story we've ever had.

541
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,300
She doesn't want to be on the internet.

542
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Since when?

543
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,300
I gotta go.

544
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,800
maybe it's the sum of a million coincidences

545
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:25,500
we don't quite control that brings us to
a particular place at a particular time.

546
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,100
or maybe it's the choices we make,

547
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,500
the actions we take.

548
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,900
If there's one thing I've learned in 89 years,

549
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,800
it's that what we want--
it doesn't always matter.

550
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,700
you just took off.

551
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Oh, uh, you were kind of tied up with your editor.

552
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,900
You could at least have said good-bye.

553
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,200
good...

554
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,100
bye.

555
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,500
What we want doesn't always matter.

556
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
but then again...

557
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,400
sometimes it's all that does.
