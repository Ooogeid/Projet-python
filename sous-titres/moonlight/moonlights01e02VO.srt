1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,400
Previously on "Moonlight"...

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,665
<i>I wanna help people.</i>

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,400
<i>That's why I became a P.I.</i>

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,065
<i>and might make up
for what I am.</i>

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,775
<i>Whatever you've heard
about vampires,</i>

6
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,450
<i>you don't know
the whole story.</i>

7
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,300
<i>I have boundaries, rules.</i>

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,100
<i>My friend Josef
has a different philosophy.</i>

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
I know you have morals
and scruples, and that's fine...

10
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:22,500
<i>22 years ago, I took a case
that changed my life forever.</i>

11
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:26,008
Please help me.
Someone took my daughter.

12
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:27,602
Everything's gonna be
all right.

13
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:29,201
You're not gonna do this.

14
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:36,102
<i>Over the years,
I tried to stay close,</i>

15
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,361
<i>in case she needed me...</i>

16
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,052
This is Beth Turner
for "Buzzwire. "

17
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:40,703
<i>Though she can never know
what I am.</i>

18
00:00:40,737 --> 00:00:41,863
What do you like better?

19
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:43,853
"Vampire slaying rocks L.A."...

20
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:45,803
There's no such thing
as vampires.

21
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:49,700
<i>Holding her in my arms,
it almost feels</i>

22
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:51,603
<i>like it could work
between us,</i>

23
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:55,001
<i>but monsters don't get
"happily ever after. "</i>

24
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:08,163
Well, he's finally
getting out, isn't he?

25
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:10,901
Yes, a lot of us have worked
a long time for this moment.

26
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:13,661
I'm talking to my good friend
Julia Stephens,

27
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:17,502
newspaper reporter and author of
the upcoming book "Wronged Man. "

28
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,462
It's about Lee Jay Spalding,

29
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:21,902
a man who spent 25 years
in prison.

30
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:23,563
For a crime
he didn't commit.

31
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:26,603
<i>- And he's just won his parole, is that right?
- Yes, thank god.</i>

32
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,362
<i>- Talk about dedication...
- Have you seen this?</i>

33
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:31,003
<i>- You not only chronicled...
- They're letting him out.</i>

34
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:32,561
Yeah, I knew you'd be
on the warpath,

35
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:34,101
so I brought you
some fresh blood.

36
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:38,001
Never underestimate the stupidity
of what humans will do.

37
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,500
Hey, cut 'em some slack.

38
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,503
I believe you used to be one
before you became a vampire.

39
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:45,800
<i>You seem pretty convinced by this guy.
I mean, he was...</i>

40
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:47,700
Oh, is that your friend-
The blonde?

41
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,302
I'd like
to meet her someday.

42
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:52,760
What?
I'm just saying.

43
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:55,402
<i>During the last two years
researching this book,</i>

44
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:57,102
<i>I really got to know
Lee Jay.</i>

45
00:01:57,507 --> 00:02:00,200
<i>He is
an amazing individual...</i>

46
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,303
<i>Really a lesson to us all.</i>

47
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:08,103
<i>Think of it-25 years, and he
holds absolutely no grudge</i>

48
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:09,560
<i>against the man
who wrongly convicted him.</i>

49
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,401
Please. I should get her
to write a book about me...

50
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,601
Make me sound all innocent
and suffering.

51
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:15,700
- She's involved with him.
- Oh, you think?

52
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:18,313
Look, humans don't know
how to properly deal

53
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,571
with their bad guys.
I mean, what else is new?

54
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,800
And you want to take matters
into your own hands.

55
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:24,901
Now come on.
I got a few hours to kill.

56
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:29,603
Look, otherwise,
just let the guilt go, okay?

57
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,201
Now what this guy Lee Jay did-
That wasn't your fault.

58
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,500
Yes, it was.
You weren't there.

59
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,901
A woman's dead
because of me.

60
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry to bust up
your evening, Mick,

61
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:46,803
but your card was
in the dead girl's pocket.

62
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:47,962
You know her?

63
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,903
Yeah,
she was my client.

64
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,801
She hired me
to protect her.

65
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:01,401
Looks like suicide-
Gun in hand,

66
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:02,702
shot through mouth.

67
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,803
This isn't suicide.

68
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:07,803
This is murder.

69
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,500
Yeah?

70
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:12,801
I know who did this.

71
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:15,802
You want to share
with the rest of us?

72
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,402
<i>When I finally
caught up with Lee Jay...</i>

73
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,802
<i>I was gonna kill him.</i>

74
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,203
<i>No question.</i>

75
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,102
<i>He was a dead man.</i>

76
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:37,400
<i>But I messed up.</i>

77
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:45,803
You killed her.

78
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:57,303
You made it look
like suicide.

79
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,403
Who are you?

80
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:20,503
Oh, my God!

81
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:21,602
What are you?

82
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:33,303
<i>This cop comes
out of nowhere...</i>

83
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,203
And I... I didn't get
to finish the job.

84
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,003
Lee Jay knows what I am.

85
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:43,403
Wow.
You really did mess up.

86
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,600
Well, you absolutely
better waste this guy.

87
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:51,801
It's not that simple.

88
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:52,801
Yeah, it is.

89
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:57,503
Now what if he decides to go
all Van Helsing and come after you?

90
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:12,003
So...
Welcome back, bro.

91
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:12,761
How you doing, bro?

92
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:14,300
Good, man.
Good to see you.

93
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,002
- How you feeling, man?
- Pretty good.

94
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:22,903
Looks like you got
a lot of readin' done.

95
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,302
Oh, not reading-
Research.

96
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,203
We're goin' huntin'.

97
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:35,802
www. forom. com

98
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:43,002
1 x 02:
Out of the Past

99
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,000
<i>Don't you hurt her.</i>

100
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:58,900
Mick...

101
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:07,900
I think you're having
a bad dream.

102
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:10,303
I'll say.

103
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:13,701
You were talking,
muttering something.

104
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:15,200
What did I say?

105
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:18,201
"Mick. "

106
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:20,762
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,700
He was in the dream.

108
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,211
You almost died last week.

109
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,100
He saved you.

110
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:29,200
I understand.

111
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:36,301
I was dreaming about what
happened when I was little,

112
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:38,300
when I was taken.

113
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,602
I was in the room
with a scary woman,

114
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,302
only this time
Mick was there.

115
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,401
Well, that's your subconscious
trying to process everything,

116
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:49,500
You know?

117
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:53,100
Think you should talk
to someone about it?

118
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,801
I think...
I should go to work.

119
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:09,300
Do you know where
I could find Beth Turner?

120
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:10,210
Right over there.

121
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,100
Great, thanks.

122
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:13,203
All right, man.

123
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:16,260
Oh, look who's slummin' again.

124
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:17,601
Ah, thought you might want
to be reminded

125
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,202
what a real reporter
looks like.

126
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,703
Please. By the time you put out
your little early edition,

127
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,800
we've covered overnight plus
video follow-ups, okay?

128
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:25,200
Please.
People want news,

129
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,362
they read the paper.

130
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:28,400
They want to find out what
latest celebrity train wreck

131
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:29,900
passed out in their own vomit,

132
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:31,060
they read you.

133
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:34,200
2 million visitors
so far today and counting.

134
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:35,602
Oh, boy.

135
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:39,900
Here. For you. It's not even
in the stores yet.

136
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:41,763
I finally get to read it.

137
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,702
Yes, and here is an invitation
to the release party.

138
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:46,503
- Steve and I are on it.
- Can't wait.

139
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:48,161
We'll get plenty of B-roll,

140
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:49,762
make sure we capture
the whole vibe.

141
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,601
Oh, I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

142
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:53,163
Oh, forget it.
You're helping me.

143
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,300
Lee Jay is a great
human interest story.

144
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:56,918
I can't wait for you
to meet him.

145
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,502
He's so not what
you would expect.

146
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:00,601
He became a sculptor
when he was in prison,

147
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:04,503
Got involved with a program
to bring at-risk kids to art.

148
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,802
There's one thing I didn't
quite understand yesterday.

149
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,800
Why were the cops
so convinced

150
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,702
that Lee Jay was guilty
of Eileen's murder?

151
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:13,861
He had some priors.

152
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:16,801
He was an easy mark, even with
the contaminated evidence.

153
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:18,563
The police contaminated
the evidence?

154
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:22,001
It was a P.I., actually.
He almost beat Lee Jay to death.

155
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,401
Mick St. John.

156
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,663
Mick St. John?
Are you sure?

157
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,600
Of course I'm sure.
I wrote the book.

158
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:29,403
Here.

159
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:34,502
Oh, my gosh.

160
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:36,302
Do you know him?

161
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:38,903
He never returned my calls.

162
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:42,902
Yeah, I mean, the Mick St. John
I know is, like, 30.

163
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:44,900
This happened 25 years ago.

164
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,202
This can't be
the same guy.

165
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:58,553
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

166
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:01,002
to come up with a gift
that says,

167
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,401
"Thanks for saving me
from a psycho serial killer"?

168
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,201
Miss Manners
doesn't cover that?

169
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:08,301
Surprisingly, no.
So...

170
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:14,003
25-year-old.
Thank you.

171
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,200
I thought you might
want to see this.

172
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:21,700
A friend of mine wrote it.

173
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:26,100
There was a P. I.
involved in this case

174
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:28,202
called Mick St. John.

175
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:29,501
Really?

176
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:34,300
So?

177
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:38,300
<i>That picture was from 1950,
back before I became a vampire,</i>

178
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,703
<i>when film could still
capture my image.</i>

179
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:41,700
That's my father.

180
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:43,501
Looks more like your twin.

181
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:47,002
I inherited
some strong genes.

182
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:51,203
The book says your father had
a serious run-in with Lee Jay.

183
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:53,102
Did he ever
tell you about that?

184
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:54,801
Kind of.

185
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:58,351
He told me Lee Jay was one
of those broken individuals

186
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:01,403
who can't stop themselves,
that they have to kill.

187
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:03,903
So you might want to tell your
friend she's got it all wrong.

188
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,900
She's a really good reporter.

189
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,601
- She researched this very carefully.
- Tell her she got it wrong.

190
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:10,801
Okay.

191
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:12,903
And tell her to be careful.

192
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,200
I guess I should go.

193
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,301
Hey, Lee Jay.

194
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,200
Good to be free again,
huh?

195
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:50,702
Yeah, 25 years late,
but good to be out.

196
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:54,401
Now we got that stuff
you wanted.

197
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:56,702
Good.

198
00:10:58,107 --> 00:10:59,401
Wood stakes.

199
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:01,703
We going camping?

200
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:05,601
Yeah,
somethin' like that.

201
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,162
It's good to see you,
Bobby.

202
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,902
I had a feeling you'd drop by
after they paroled Lee Jay.

203
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:25,263
Yeah, I know.
I should have kept in touch.

204
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:27,600
But you're here now,
and get a load of this.

205
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,800
<i>Detective Desmond,
Lee Jay Spalding.</i>

206
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:35,402
<i>You arrested me,
helped put me behind bars.</i>

207
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,662
<i>I saw you
at all my parole hearings,</i>

208
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,203
<i>always telling the board
not to set me free.</i>

209
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:43,901
<i>Well, I want you to know
that I, uh, I forgive you.</i>

210
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,503
<i>It's all behind me now.</i>

211
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,662
Well,
when I want forgiveness,

212
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:51,483
I won't be applying to
Lee Jay Spalding.

213
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,103
It's my fault that he's out.

214
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:55,500
- It's the book's fault.
- He'll kill again, Bobby.

215
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:57,360
As soon as he finds
a woman to play.

216
00:11:57,407 --> 00:12:00,001
I think he may have already-
The author.

217
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,601
Well, that's gonna
be some honeymoon.

218
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,102
You still got
that case file?

219
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:07,062
The first wife?

220
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:09,200
Oh, yeah.
That other so-called suicide?

221
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:10,701
I got it out for you.

222
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:13,260
You know,
he wouldn't be getting out

223
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:15,600
if we'd been able
to admit that as evidence.

224
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:16,403
I know.

225
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:18,162
So what
are you planning now?

226
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,003
I've got a friend.
She's a reporter.

227
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,601
She doesn't know
the real story of Lee Jay,

228
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,502
only what happened
in the book.

229
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,902
Don't you go
doing nothing stupid.

230
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,900
We're senior citizens now.
Don't want to break a hip.

231
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:31,863
You be careful, too, okay?

232
00:12:31,905 --> 00:12:34,701
And you make sure you call me
if Lee Jay contacts you again.

233
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:37,900
God, Mick, it's good
to hear your voice.

234
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,301
Same as ever.

235
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:46,001
Hey, what's with these muscles?
How you staying so fit?

236
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:47,561
Oh, you know, diet.

237
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:49,103
Give me some of that.

238
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:51,262
Take care.

239
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:52,801
You take care, Bobby.

240
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:54,602
You take care.

241
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:02,760
<i>When you live forever,</i>

242
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:05,702
<i>it's disappointing
how little humans change.</i>

243
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:12,152
<i>Technology, though-
It always gets better.</i>

244
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,562
<i>If I hadn't become a vampire,</i>

245
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,703
<i>I would have missed out
on the Internet,</i>

246
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:17,061
<i>Tivo,</i>

247
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:18,702
<i>"World of Warcraft"...</i>

248
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:20,903
<i>and G.P.S.</i>

249
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:41,302
Get some stuff
of Lee Jay and Julia.

250
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:44,901
- Don't get in their faces...
- But get their faces. Roger that.

251
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,401
What are you doing here?

252
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,201
I wanted to talk to you...

253
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:00,863
Apologize.

254
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,002
That's fine.
You're entitled to your opinion.

255
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:04,501
It's a free country, right?

256
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,203
Right.
I brought you something.

257
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,503
It's the case file
from Lee Jay's arrest.

258
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:10,703
You need to read that.

259
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,703
You really think
this is the right place?

260
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,702
Open it, please.
You need to know the truth.

261
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:17,651
I'm kind of busy right now.

262
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:21,001
Beth, there you are.
I want you to meet Lee Jay.

263
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,103
Oh, my god.

264
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,401
Uh, this is Mick St. John.

265
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:30,900
You knew...
my father.

266
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:36,300
Yes. I tried to contact him
to interview him for my book.

267
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,302
- He passed away.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

268
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,400
Thanks.

269
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:47,401
Well, uh, Lee Jay,

270
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,701
it's time.
You're on.

271
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:51,800
Catch you later, Mick.

272
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:52,902
Yeah, you will.

273
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:59,002
Ladies and gentlemen,
please wellcome

274
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:01,601
Lee Jay Spalding.

275
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
the man of the hour,

276
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:14,801
Lee Jay Spalding.

277
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:24,203
I can't tell you
how great it is to be out,

278
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,402
and I really appreciate everything
all of you have done for me.

279
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:30,601
I see all these wonderful
young faces here tonight,

280
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,602
and I've worked
with some of you,

281
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,300
and others I'm meeting tonight,
I have a message for you,

282
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,001
because once, I was you.

283
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,903
Don't ever let anybody
hold you back.

284
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:46,962
I don't care
who they are

285
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:48,700
or how tough
they think they are.

286
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:52,303
You look them straight
in the eye, and you say,

287
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:54,002
"I'm better than you.

288
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:57,301
"I'm stronger than you,

289
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,400
"and I'm going to win. "

290
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,003
Thank you.

291
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:27,602
The scary one.

292
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:30,201
You might have
all these people fooled,

293
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:31,503
but I know what you are.

294
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,103
Oh, what am I?

295
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,760
You're not gonna get away
with it this time.

296
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, I know, I know. They say
they've gotten tough on crime.

297
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:39,703
They always say that.

298
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:40,602
No.

299
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,902
I meant, you're not gonna
be hurting any more women.

300
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,802
I won't let you.

301
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,901
You know, it's funny,

302
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,903
Because I know what you are...

303
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:52,903
Vampire.

304
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:55,902
You've probably killed more
people than I have, haven't you?

305
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:01,601
Now if I got this right,

306
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:04,703
a stake in your heart
will paralyze you.

307
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:06,503
I could put you
in an art display

308
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:08,103
for the whole world to see,

309
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:11,003
maybe put you in one
of my new sculptures.

310
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:18,701
Oh, Mick.

311
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,960
Aah! Back off!

312
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:30,203
You stay away from me!
You stay away from me!

313
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:32,402
- Lee Jay, what happened?
- Oh, that man's crazy.

314
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:34,500
- You all right?
- That man's crazy.

315
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:41,800
Somebody help!
Please, somebody help.

316
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:46,663
Lee Jay. Lee Jay, what-
What happened?

317
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:48,702
Oh, my god. We have
to get you to a hospital.

318
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:51,400
Please, I don't want
any more trouble.

319
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,002
Um, okay, your friend?

320
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:56,500
Not so good at parties.

321
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,802
Lee Jay,
we should call the police.

322
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,210
No, don't call the police.

323
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:06,960
I don't want to press charges.

324
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:08,903
All right,
he's obviously disturbed,

325
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,901
but jail is not
what he needs.

326
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:16,502
Very nice. Is that
your party personality?

327
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:17,360
I didn't do anything.

328
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:19,103
I'd hate to see
what you call "something. "

329
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:21,012
- I didn't touch him.
- Yeah, right.

330
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:22,702
He did that to himself.

331
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:24,403
That's ridiculous.

332
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:26,861
The pain and blood
is worth setting me up.

333
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,202
It's just the way he thinks.
Did you read the case file?

334
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:32,300
You know, with all the excitement,
I haven't had a chance yet.

335
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:34,162
This guy killed two women,
Beth,

336
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,902
and he pawned them both off
as suicides.

337
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:39,702
That guy romancing
your friend...

338
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:42,203
He's a killer.

339
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,500
Trust me.

340
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,601
<i>Eileen Hannigan came to me
in 1983,</i>

341
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:05,103
<i>an abused spouse.</i>

342
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,602
<i>I'd heard the story
a hundred times.</i>

343
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:11,001
<i>I went to the police.
I got a restraining order.</i>

344
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:14,201
Let me guess.
He ignored it.

345
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,202
He burned it
in front of me.

346
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:26,802
He do this?

347
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:34,102
He said that if I ever tried
to leave him, he would kill me.

348
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,160
So I bought this.

349
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:40,203
Are you ready to use that,
Eileen?

350
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:41,862
You don't want the gun.

351
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:45,000
You don't want to give him
the chance to use it on you.

352
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm gonna take care of this.

353
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:58,403
Now, Lee Jay...

354
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:01,803
I'm gonna say this once.

355
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,102
You ever hurt Eileen again,
you touch a hair on her head,

356
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,602
I'm gonna come back,
and I'm not gonna be so gentle.

357
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,301
You tell me
you understand me.

358
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:14,850
I understand.

359
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:15,900
Are you sure?

360
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,501
I understand!

361
00:20:19,306 --> 00:20:20,100
Good.

362
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,801
<i>I thought
I'd taken care of him,</i>

363
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:25,200
<i>but I was young and stupid
back then.</i>

364
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:29,103
<i>I thought
violence solved everything.</i>

365
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,201
Hmm?
Red or white?

366
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:45,802
I will take... the red.

367
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,403
I told you,
not while I'm eating.

368
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:15,701
It's your answering service.
Says it's important.

369
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:26,862
Yeah?

370
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:30,501
Mick? It's Bobby Desmond.
You'd better get down here.

371
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:38,661
<i>Looks like suicide-</i>

372
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,702
<i>Gun in hand,
shot through mouth.</i>

373
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:00,963
<i>Please, get help!</i>

374
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:03,603
<i>Lee Jay!
Lee Jay, what happened?</i>

375
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,203
Hey, you got a story
in the pipeline?

376
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:10,302
Yeah, why Mick is so riled up
about a 25-year-old case.

377
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,600
Yeah, that's not a story.
That's obvious.

378
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:14,601
It was his father, right?

379
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:16,261
That's the weird thing.

380
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:18,860
His father wasn't
a cop or a P.I.

381
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,101
In fact, there's no record
of him at all.

382
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,963
Maybe you have
the wrong name.

383
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,612
No, I think there's something
Mick isn't telling me.

384
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:30,142
Lee Jay's arresting officer-
Bobby Desmond.

385
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:34,033
Maybe he can tell me why
Mick's obsessed with this case.

386
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:40,350
Retired.
Still lives in L.A.

387
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:41,600
What do you think?

388
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:43,300
Go for it.

389
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:51,721
So you never thought Eileen's
shooting was a suicide either?

390
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:53,863
Why hire somebody
to protect you

391
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:56,400
if you planned on
killing yourself anyway?

392
00:22:56,506 --> 00:22:58,961
I heard Lee Jay got
beat up pretty badly.

393
00:22:59,007 --> 00:23:01,700
Yeah, Mick did a number
on him, that's for sure.

394
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:03,503
But Lee Jay
had it coming to him,

395
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:05,503
and everybody knew that.

396
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:08,001
- Like father, like son.
- Huh?

397
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:09,600
His son has a temper.

398
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:10,802
Who does?

399
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:14,563
His son Mick... Jr.,
I guess.

400
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:17,201
He's obsessed with Lee Jay,
just like his dad.

401
00:23:17,238 --> 00:23:19,802
No, no, no. Mick never had a son.
Never married.

402
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:21,800
Uh, Mick has a son.
I know him.

403
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:25,402
Darlin', I've known
Mick St. John for over 35 years,

404
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:27,260
and I'm telling you,
there is no son.

405
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:31,373
The man is one of a kind.
Ask him yourself.

406
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,153
He's alive?

407
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:34,202
And kickin'.

408
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:35,660
He was in here
just the other day

409
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,302
all riled up about
Lee Jay's getting out.

410
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:22,103
This is sad.

411
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:25,302
You have, uh, w-what's
the word, uh, food issues?

412
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:26,260
How'd you get in here?

413
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:29,103
25 years on the inside,
you get some skills.

414
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,903
- Put that down.
- Or what, you tear my head off?

415
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:34,300
- Yeah.
- But the thing is,

416
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:37,400
I told everybody I know I was
comin' over here to make peace.

417
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,200
Now how would that look,
huh?

418
00:24:42,705 --> 00:24:44,163
Oh, god.

419
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:47,003
That's disgusting. How
do you live like this?

420
00:24:47,305 --> 00:24:48,761
So what's the deal, Mick?

421
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:52,420
You're-what, you're stronger
than us? Smarter?

422
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,203
I gotta admit that you're
the only one who seems

423
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:56,302
to see through my B.S.

424
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:59,082
Or maybe it's just
because you, uh, get me.

425
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:00,700
We're not so different,
really.

426
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:02,663
- We're nothing alike.
- No?

427
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:05,000
Well, what's it feel like
when you kill somebody?

428
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,860
Because I know what
it feels like when I do.

429
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,501
Hey, easy, Mick.

430
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:10,961
This is your gun, Mick-

431
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,503
The one you keep hidden
behind the desk.

432
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,900
That's gotta be pretty
annoying for you using this

433
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:18,101
when you could tear somebody
apart with your teeth.

434
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:20,540
Another fake suicide, huh?

435
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:22,643
Is that the plan?

436
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:24,780
You're so smart.
You tell me.

437
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:28,150
Well, you better have
the right ammunition.

438
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:30,691
Oh, I do.

439
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:34,103
Damn!

440
00:25:35,505 --> 00:25:38,001
<i>9-1-1. What is the nature
of your emergency?</i>

441
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,702
I've been shot.

442
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,371
A Mick St. John.

443
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:53,803
You know what?
I see it now.

444
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:55,800
It's like your own
little prison, isn't it?

445
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,901
- This whole vampire thing.
- Shut up!

446
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:01,453
You can't have
anybody pokin' around--

447
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:04,202
A girlfriend,
anyone who cares--

448
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,551
You got a problem.

449
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:09,640
God, you're a bundle
of nerves.

450
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:12,360
Oh, yeah, the gun.

451
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:14,233
You leave it,
that looks bad.

452
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,951
You take it,
that looks even worse.

453
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:34,133
You made the news.

454
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:36,180
Great.

455
00:26:38,507 --> 00:26:40,060
Well, apparently,
attempted murder,

456
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:42,701
the charge against you,
carries a 25-year penalty.

457
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:45,353
The firearm enhancement
adds another 15.

458
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:47,400
That's what they called it-
An "enhancement. "

459
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:49,061
He's getting exactly
what he wants--

460
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,492
Me in prison as payback
and free rein

461
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:53,953
- with no one to stop him.
- And you get nothing.

462
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:57,300
A prison is not
the vampire's friend.

463
00:26:57,336 --> 00:26:58,510
No.
No.

464
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:00,703
But look on the positive side.
You know, in 25 years,

465
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,420
you could probably
get a book deal.

466
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,003
Oh, thank you.

467
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:08,300
You're way off
your game, pal.

468
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:09,851
What did you say?

469
00:27:09,888 --> 00:27:11,492
You heard me.

470
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,862
He had 25 years
to plan his next move.

471
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:16,331
- You wouldn't have seen it coming, either.
- That's not even what I meant.

472
00:27:16,408 --> 00:27:18,213
Why didn't you kill him,
Mick?

473
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:20,223
Why didn't you
take this guy out?

474
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:22,251
- Why didn't you end him?
- With Lee Jay alive,

475
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:24,301
there's a chance
the truth will come out.

476
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:25,460
- You think so?
- Yeah.

477
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:27,602
It's not that you're worried
about what some blonde reporter

478
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:30,022
might think of you if you'd given
that guy what he deserved?

479
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:37,101
This is a chance for me
to erase a regret.

480
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,041
You know,
I really don't see how.

481
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,210
You're gonna have to split.
You know that?

482
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,502
You know, a new town,
new identity.

483
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,520
I know a guy who does
relocations, you know?

484
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:52,912
He works with a lot of vamps.

485
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,500
I leave,
more people die.

486
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:58,721
No, man.

487
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:02,393
I'm not going anywhere.

488
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,901
<i>I just got word
they're releasing Lee Jay</i>

489
00:28:04,938 --> 00:28:07,730
<i>from the hospital in a couple of hours.
You've gotta get over there.</i>

490
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:09,381
Fine, boss.
On my way.

491
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:11,713
<i>Yeah, I wish I had a break like
this when I was starting out.</i>

492
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,790
What do you mean?

493
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:15,901
<i>Well, shooter on the lam,
personal friend of yours--</i>

494
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,903
<i>That's "lucky" gift wrapped, girl.
Go for it.</i>

495
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:19,803
Okay, bye.

496
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:28,771
Do you think he really
tried to kill Lee Jay?

497
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:30,001
What, you don't?

498
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:32,400
- No, not really.
- You're kidding, right?

499
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:41,530
He attacks the guy
in a public place.

500
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:44,200
The guy ends up shot in his
apartment, and then he flees.

501
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,933
Is there some part of that
that's not completely incriminating?

502
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:48,011
You don't know him.

503
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:49,360
You barely do, either.

504
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:53,632
I think there's something going
on that Mick's not telling me.

505
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:55,602
You know...

506
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:58,320
Since you met that guy...

507
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:03,101
"screwed up" has started
to seem normal.

508
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:14,953
You're Mick St. John.

509
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:16,120
Is Beth here?

510
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:18,900
No.

511
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:22,520
They're looking for you.

512
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:27,341
- I didn't shoot Lee Jay.
- Then why did you run?

513
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:30,370
Why didn't you stay there and
tell the police what happened?

514
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:35,263
<i>Because I'm a vampire.</i>

515
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:38,212
<i>Because I'm a vampire...</i>

516
00:29:38,805 --> 00:29:40,180
<i>Because I'm a--</i>

517
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,270
<i>There is no good way
to say it.</i>

518
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:47,150
I guess I panicked.

519
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,903
Look, he can't be here.
You know that.

520
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:50,510
I'm an attorney...
I know.

521
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:52,122
- In the D.A.'s office.
- I know.

522
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:53,663
I'm harboring
a fugitive here.

523
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,302
Listen, I understand
this looks bad--

524
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,882
I'll get disbarred
and jailed.

525
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:00,741
I didn't do anything, okay?
This guy comes to my place--

526
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:02,033
And what, shot himself?

527
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:03,302
Yes.

528
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,102
That's what Lee Jay does.

529
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:16,001
He's staged murders before.
It's all in the police file.

530
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:17,541
See for yourself, Josh.

531
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:27,501
I need to know that
you're telling the truth.

532
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,080
I am.
You know I am.

533
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:30,600
Because if you're not...

534
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:38,052
What do you need me to do?

535
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:43,060
<i>I know. I said my image
couldn't be captured,</i>

536
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,171
<i>but that was back in the days
of silver emulsion and film.</i>

537
00:30:46,216 --> 00:30:47,953
<i>Digital has changed all that.</i>

538
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:50,941
Okay, it's gonna be best if
you look straight into camera.

539
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:53,373
Okay, ready?
On my count.

540
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:56,293
<i>The truth is, I'm innocent.</i>

541
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:59,400
<i>I did not shoot
Lee Jay Spalding.</i>

542
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:02,920
<i>Spalding staged the scene
and shot himself.</i>

543
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:05,260
- I can't believe she's doing this.
<i>- Now I know it sounds improbable,</i>

544
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:06,901
<i>but this is
a very sick individual</i>

545
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:08,390
<i>who's done this
twice before.</i>

546
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:11,502
<i>The first time was in 1982,
when he faked the suicide death</i>

547
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,163
<i>of his first wife
Marie McCullough,</i>

548
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,001
<i>who had the nerve
to try to leave him.</i>

549
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:19,702
<i>The second time was when...</i>

550
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:22,662
<i>CDS-LA News has just obtained</i>

551
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:25,502
<i>this dramatic new video that
has surfaced on the Internet</i>

552
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,593
<i>...very suspicable circumstances...</i>

553
00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:31,102
<i>...a fact suppressed
from the trial</i>

554
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:32,893
<i>and omitted from the book.</i>

555
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:34,941
<i>The two case files are
available to the public...</i>

556
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:37,021
- How could she?
<i>- ...at buzzwirenews.com.</i>

557
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:38,923
<i>Please read them for yourselves.</i>

558
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,303
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy.</i>

559
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,560
- Hey, beautiful.
- You okay?

560
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:47,290
Let's get you out of here.

561
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:53,801
Are you feeling better, Lee Jay?

562
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:55,762
Yeah. Luckily, he missed
the major arteries.

563
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:58,490
Why does Mick St. John have
such a vendetta against you?

564
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,302
Don't ask me to understand
the workings of a criminal mind.

565
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:02,502
What about the report
on "buzzwire"

566
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:03,563
that you've murdered
two women

567
00:32:03,606 --> 00:32:06,143
and staged the shooting
that hospitalized you?

568
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:10,243
That report
would be incorrect.

569
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,212
Okay, let's go.

570
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,252
All right,
no more questions.

571
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:16,523
What about the shooting,
Lee Jay?

572
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:19,601
Would you like to make any comments
about the allegations of these murders?

573
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,100
That's all.

574
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:32,502
I can't believe how many media outlets
have picked this story up.

575
00:32:32,538 --> 00:32:35,500
"Buzzwire"'s got the biggest
syndicated feed on the net.

576
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,552
So what's next, though?

577
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:40,301
I think it's his move next.

578
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:53,801
It's Julia.

579
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:02,522
Okay, I know you must
be furious with me,

580
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:03,972
and I know you love him
and all that,

581
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:06,200
but it's true, Julia,
and you really had to know.

582
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,141
I know, Beth.

583
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:11,772
I know.

584
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:14,511
Put him on.

585
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:17,953
Put him on!

586
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,863
Put him on!

587
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:32,421
What do you want?

588
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:33,911
You watch your tone with me.

589
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:37,363
What do you want?

590
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:40,191
You do not talk to me
that way!

591
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,561
You forget
who you're talkin' to!

592
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:44,901
I know what you are, Mick.

593
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:53,203
Now here's what I want.

594
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,673
I want you to go down
to the nearest police station,

595
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,592
and I want you
to turn yourself in.

596
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:02,132
I didn't do anything.
I'm not gonna say I did.

597
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:04,301
You know what? If you feel
that way about it,

598
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:07,601
then Julia
ends up like Eileen.

599
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:13,731
How do I know
you won't kill her anyway?

600
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:16,492
You don't.
You got one hour.

601
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:19,870
Please.

602
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:21,201
Help me.

603
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:22,541
Please!

604
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:26,370
You hear that?

605
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:29,333
Hard to say no, isn't it?

606
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:41,442
Look, if you don't turn yourself in,
he's gonna kill her.

607
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:43,262
He's gonna kill her anyway.

608
00:34:43,296 --> 00:34:44,802
I think we should go to the police.
They can trace the call.

609
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:47,800
We only have one hour.
We need more time than that.

610
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,791
<i>You do not talk
to me that way!</i>

611
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:52,973
<i>You forget who
you're talkin' to.</i>

612
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:55,323
<i>I know what you are, Mick.</i>

613
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:00,900
I got a friend
in public affairs.

614
00:35:01,206 --> 00:35:03,452
Maybe I can get him to issue
some kind of statement that--

615
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,301
...that Mick's turned himself in,
that he's in custody.

616
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,101
- Okay. Okay.
- And what will you do?

617
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,523
All I need is some time.

618
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:15,393
Here, take this.
It'll help.

619
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:17,803
- Hurry.
- All right.

620
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:19,803
Hey, Josh...

621
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:23,312
Thank you.

622
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:32,331
You tried to warn me
Julia was in danger.

623
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:35,002
Yeah, well, none of us want
to believe that there's monsters

624
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:37,003
like Lee Jay right around us.

625
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:39,511
You did.

626
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:41,930
I think I have a way
of finding them.

627
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:44,921
I tagged Julia's car.

628
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:50,562
You want to navigate?

629
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,333
What did he mean,
"I know what you are"?

630
00:36:04,506 --> 00:36:05,993
Oh, right here.

631
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,203
Mick, what did he mean?

632
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:14,500
I don't know.

633
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,600
I don't believe you.

634
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,261
How about we get Julia first?

635
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:20,901
How about you finally
answer a question

636
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:23,192
without evading
or disappearing?

637
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,702
Hour's almost up.

638
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:25,871
Like that.

639
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:28,580
We all have secrets, Beth...

640
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:31,553
And that's not evading.

641
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,173
Right here.

642
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:42,513
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

643
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,242
All right, I'm goin' in.

644
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:52,852
Open the glove box.

645
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,412
Now do you know
how to use that?

646
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:04,203
You remember what I said?

647
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:06,323
Call the cops if you're
not out in ten minutes.

648
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,171
Don't come inside.
I got it, I got it.

649
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,600
Okay.

650
00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:16,841
Why does the girl always
have to wait in the car?

651
00:37:59,106 --> 00:38:01,600
<i>...confirmed reports
that fugitive Mick St. John,</i>

652
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:04,511
<i>wanted in connection with
the shooting of Lee Jay Spalding,</i>

653
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:08,403
<i>has turned himself in to authorities
at the Wilshire division.</i>

654
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:10,911
Well, our work here's done.

655
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:28,900
Run.

656
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:38,762
Don't believe everything
you see on tv.

657
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:43,341
Silver buckshot.

658
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,481
Had to special order it.

659
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:49,340
Now correct me if I'm wrong,

660
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:51,703
but, uh, silver's
like poison to you.

661
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:02,832
The only thing more deadly
to a vampire...

662
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:07,641
Fire.

663
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:19,303
Now I gotta admit
that part of me wonders

664
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:20,902
what it would be like...

665
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:22,802
to live forever...

666
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:25,032
Powerful.

667
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:31,463
The last thing this world needs
is an eternal you.

668
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:09,632
I thought I told you
to stay in the car.

669
00:40:15,806 --> 00:40:17,801
<i>Don't ever let
anybody hold you back.</i>

670
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:21,361
<i>I don't care who they are</i>

671
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:23,402
<i>or how tough
they think they are.</i>

672
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:26,153
<i>You look them
straight in the eye,</i>

673
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,301
<i>and you say,
"I'm better than you,</i>

674
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:30,402
<i>"I'm stronger than you,</i>

675
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,401
<i>and I'm going to win. "</i>

676
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:44,701
He-He kidnapped me.

677
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:45,860
He was gonna kill me.

678
00:40:45,908 --> 00:40:47,302
It's okay. It's okay.
Slow down.

679
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:49,602
Mick-Mick saved me.

680
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:51,801
Mick saved me.

681
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:55,100
I was so wrong.

682
00:40:54,905 --> 00:40:57,463
- Okay, so Mick shot Lee Jay?
- No.

683
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,860
No, I did.

684
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:02,292
Hey, hey, hey!
Beth!

685
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,103
Where you goin'?

686
00:41:04,307 --> 00:41:06,100
Beth, get back here.

687
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,600
Mick?

688
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,102
You ran off again.

689
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,973
One second you were there,
and then you were... gone.

690
00:42:10,008 --> 00:42:11,873
Are... are you okay?

691
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,472
Please leave.

692
00:42:18,305 --> 00:42:20,102
Not without answers.
