1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,180
previously on "moonlight"...

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,810
I was a medic back in world war ii.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,740
Multiple gunshot wounds were common.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,000
I know you must be older,
but you look about 30.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,030
I'm gonna be 85 this november.

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,920
It can't be all that
bad to live forever.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,860
Yeah, but it's not so fun
to experience things alone.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,070
I haven't been in a romantic relationship
with a human since I became a vampire.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,900
What happens when a vampire
thinks he's about to be exposed?

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,880
He moves on, starts all over.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,630
As long as you're involved with
mick and you work at "buzzwire,"

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,390
his secret will always be in nger.

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,730
I have something to tell you.

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,840
I quit "buzzwire."

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,940
If you hadn't been a vampire,
I'd have died 23 years ago.

16
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,310
Being a vampire isn't all you are.

17
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,600
I got your message.

18
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,310
Wow, look at you.

19
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,700
Thanks for coming by so
early. Get you a coffee?

20
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,090
- Yeah.
- All right.

21
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,540
- Hey, how's it going?
- Two coffees.

22
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,370
So how's unemployment treating you?

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,300
I know quitting "buzzwire" was the
right decision, but I don't know.

24
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,190
Being noble and unemployed isn't
everything you dreamed it would be? Thanks.

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,140
I have been baking... a lot.

26
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,600
I'm sure. Let's sit here.

27
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,120
So you, um...

28
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,000
you hear about the little boy
who was abducted last night?

29
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,850
I covered two similar kidnapping
cases for "buzzwire" last year.

30
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,050
Do you think it's the same guy?

31
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,820
I do. Yeah, so pulled your reports.

32
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,070
Very well researched.
They're really insightful.

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,150
Didn't help.

34
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,690
The boys were still found dead
within a week of their abductions,

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,210
and the cops never caught the guy.

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, that's why I want
you to come with me--

37
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,610
take a look at the crime scene.

38
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,820
Oh, I'm not a profiler.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,520
No, but you've already done the
legwork on the last two victims.

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,690
There's gotta be some
kind of connection.

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,620
Maybe you'll see
something we're missing.

42
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,890
How could you not know a
roche-bobois couch from a manutti?

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,590
You invite me to a night on the town.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm thinking jazz, cigars, maybe a
fresh-from-the-vein pitcher of sangria,

45
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,110
not window-shopping for couches.

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
so sue me.My new office is almost ready,

47
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,400
and I just fired my bonehead designers.

48
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,840
I mean, 4:00 A.M. Really
is the best time to browse.

49
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,540
So are we gonna find your designers
at the bottom of the tar pits?

50
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,710
Nick, please. I don't have the energy
to kill everyone who pisses me off.

51
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,630
I have to hire some people.

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,550
Oh, blood, juice, day, night--
you know, a few weeks as a human,

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,760
and my body still can't
work out what it wants.

54
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,020
Yeah, well, blood orange juice
must be particularly confusing.

55
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,140
Well, I'm sorry about your jet lag...

56
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,010
or maybe I should say human lag.

57
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,650
But I am feeling the
call of subzero oblivion.

58
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,630
********

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,100
this is my son jacob. He just turned 6.

60
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,260
He's 45 pounds, just under 4 feet...

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,570
you are positively pavlovian
where that girl is concerned.

62
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,470
Brown hair, brown eyes...

63
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,770
please, whoever you
are, bring my son back.

64
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,250
mick!

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,280
You're not here with "buzzwire"?

66
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,290
No, talbot asked me to come.

67
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,310
Why are you here?

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,040
I grew up in this neighborhood.

69
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,340
- You grew up here?
- Beth?

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,310
Go ahead.

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,410
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,090
Okay.

73
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,900
josef thought it was seeing beth
that drew me here, but it wasn'T.

74
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,850
It was the house and the
people who once lived in it--

75
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,280
my buddy ray, his wife lilah.

76
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,210
Mick? Keep an eye on him.

77
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,410
You know he trips
over his own shoelaces.

78
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,440
Well, if he does, I'll
be there to pick him up.

79
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,490
be safe, ray. I love you.

80
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,090
I'll be home soon, lilah.
You can count on that.

81
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,040
we'd been friends all our lives.

82
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,300
I loved them...

83
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,470
and then I betrayed them.

Uh, I'm actually A...

89
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,620
I'm a private
investigator. Mick st. John.

90
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,240
- Robert fordham.
- Good to meet you, sir.

91
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,490
I think there's a mistake.
Uh, I didn't call anyone.

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,920
No, I-I volunteered my help. I-I
grew up right down the street.

93
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,090
I can't believe this is
happening. I'm really very sorry.

94
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,470
These your parents?

95
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,790
Yeah. My folks passed
away a few years ago.

96
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,190
You know them?

97
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,920
Kind of. I-I didn't know
they had any children.

98
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,830
Just me. I was a baby boomer.

99
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,250
Mr. Fordham, why don't you
go have a seat with your wife?

100
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,830
- We still have some questions.
- Okay.

101
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,240
Mr. St.John, I don't
know who let you in here--

102
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,070
uh, detective, there's a child missing.
We can use all the help we can get.

103
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,610
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

104
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,970
- They'll, uh, finish the interview up in there.
- Okay.

105
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,560
Had anyone been bothering jacob
at school, on the playground?

106
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,620
no, he would have told us.

107
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,110
You said he was having
nightmares. Was he seeing a doctor?

108
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,540
No, no. It's nothing like that.
He's 6. He has a big imagination.

109
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,120
Every little creak he
heard was a monster.

110
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,030
he--he said he heard tapping
coming from the walls.

111
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,780
I checked the crawl spaces.
I put rattraps in the attic.

112
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,440
it's okay.

113
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,620
Detective?

114
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,080
Okay, you guys, take a minute.

115
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,070
Hey,ou mind if I, uh, take
a look in the boy's room?

116
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,760
Forensics are still working.

117
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,410
Come back in a couple hours.

118
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,130
Yeah, great.

119
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,760
Couple of hours so they
can trample anything useful.

120
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,560
The cops never found blood or
prints at the previous scenes.

121
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,960
Hey, do you know robert?

122
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,470
What? No, why?

123
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,220
I--you're--I don't know.
You're acting kind of odd.

124
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,750
No.

125
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,710
So you think it's the same
guy who took the other boys?

126
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,190
Well, the M.O.Is
exactly the same--

127
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,850
little boy taken from his
home while his parents slept.

128
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,120
No sign of forced
entry. Perp is a ghost.

129
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,210
Yeah, or a vampire.

130
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,840
Were any of the other
victims missing blood?

131
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,110
Do you have anyone in mind?

132
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,540
Yeah, somebody talbot won't know about.

133
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,570
My name didn't ring a bell with robert.

134
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,610
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
lilah and ray never mentioned me.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,490
Damn, this makes k rations seem gourmet.

136
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
File a complaint.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,170
oh, wait a minute.

138
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,960
We're in the middle of
nowhere fighting germans.

139
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,920
This isn't nowhere.

140
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,730
It's a forest... in italy.

141
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,550
ohh, what I wouldn't give for one
of lilah's sunday dinners right now.

142
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,840
I mean, not only does she have lana
turner's legs and garbo's laugh,

143
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,480
but my wife could cook a ham
so juicy, it'd tempt a rabbi.

144
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,860
ray, stop!

145
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,790
Ray saved my life several times,
and I sad his a time or two.

146
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,120
That's what happens when
you're fighting a war.

147
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,250
You know, when I, uh, asked you
here, it wasn't a group invitation.

148
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,860
Oh, I didn't call mick.

149
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,000
It just seems wherever one of you
goes, the other one isn't far behind.

150
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,710
What?

151
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,690
Look at the toys.

152
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Okay, so the kid's a little O.C.D.

153
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,680
No, it's a defensive line.

154
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,950
If a monster showed up, he'd have to break through
the perimeter and make enough noise to wake jacob.

155
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,580
Is that what you did after
you were taken as a child?

156
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,050
How do you know about that?

157
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,130
It's my business to know.

158
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,630
Come on. Tell me you didn't
google me after we first met, huh?

159
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,840
Every vamp knows children's blood
is more pure-- less free radicals.

160
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,370
But some crave it 'cause
they think it tastes better--

161
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,920
like something cooked in
butter instead of margarine.

162
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,970
Leo is one of those vamps.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,610
He's also the nervous type.

164
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,250
If jacob heard tapping on the
walls, I may have found the mouse.

165
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,110
Tell me you didn't take that kid
in west adams last night, leo.

166
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,050
Mick, you wound me.

167
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,670
I'm not some kind of pervert.

168
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,230
And I'm not the cops, leo, but I
will get the truth before I leave.

169
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,190
The only question is
easy way... hard way?

170
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,060
I didn't take him.

171
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,550
Children are a precious gift.

172
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,240
I just like their blood.

173
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,510
Where do you get it?

174
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,630
Runaways mostly.

175
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,640
I buy 'em booze and then tap a
vein while they're sleeping it off.

176
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,320
You kill them?

177
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,400
Hell, no.

178
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,880
I even leave 'em cash-- more
than they'd get at the blood bank.

179
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,750
Ask anybody.

180
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,090
Leave...

181
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,020
the runaways... alone, leo.

182
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,790
what kind of monster were
you and talbot talking about?

183
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,700
Oh, I was just wondering if there is any kind
of real-life explanation for jacob's fears.

184
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,270
You mean someone he knew?

185
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,410
Right, somebody who had a key, like a
housekeeper you fired or an angry ex-wife.

186
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,980
No. No, there's no one like that.

187
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,070
Is that photo from world war ii?

188
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,160
Yeah, that's my
dad-- ray fordham.

189
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,270
His squad was stationed in italy.

190
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,670
Robert was a child of
the baby boom, all right.

191
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,240
Thousands of reunited couples
celebrating life had thousands of babies,

192
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,630
but robert was only born seven
months after ray got home.

193
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,440
hey, so I saw a photo
of you at robert'S.

194
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,020
You were in the war with his father.

195
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,630
Why didn't you tell me you wanted
to help because you knew the family?

196
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Because they could be my family.

197
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,720
Your family? How?

198
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,030
years before I became a vampire, I was
just another soldier in world war ii.

199
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,760
Ray was my best friend.

200
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,370
In the late summer of 1944, we
were fighting together in italy.

201
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,010
where's that coming from?

202
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,220
That's the road to florence.

203
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,160
Okay, let's move out.

204
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,360
take cover!

205
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,760
Ray, are you in the open? Get over here!

206
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,370
ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

207
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,700
It's okay.

208
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,130
My legs feel funny.
Are they still there?

209
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,440
Yeah, of course.

210
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,280
Two good legs, and I
still gotta run to you.

211
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,800
You stay with me, ray, okay?

212
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,030
- take care of lilah, okay?
- Shut the hell up.

213
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,530
You're gonna take care of her yourself.

214
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,160
Tell her... that I love her.

215
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,390
tell her.

216
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,770
I'll tell her, ray. ray?

217
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,950
a week later, I woke up in a
field hospital, wounded but alive.

218
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,200
They told me I was the only one
who survived from that patrol,

219
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,590
and eight months later,
I was back in the states.

220
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,000
Of course lilah knew
that ray was gone, but...

221
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,880
I just-- I
needed to see her.

222
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,330
We were devastated.

223
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,810
And then a week later, the war in europe was
over, and there were parades in the streets.

224
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,410
There were picnics.

225
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,120
Everybody was starting over.

226
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,690
mick! Take a break.

227
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,380
I swear, you're gonna start fixing
things that aren't even broke.

228
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,110
I like to keep busy.

229
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,950
I know that feeling.

230
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,910
It works until I close my eyes at night.

231
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,440
You know, I can't believe a woman who built
airplanes for three years can't change a fuse.

232
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,260
it's not that I can'T.

233
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,470
Ray just always used to
take care of some things.

234
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,400
He wanted me to take care of you.

235
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,950
Well, you do, nick. You do.

236
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,630
So, uh, you started over with lilah.

237
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,430
I know h it sounds. But you...

238
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,200
it just... kind of happened.
It didn't-- it just happened.

239
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,230
So you think robert...

240
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,630
how could you not know you had a son?

241
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,340
When I left lilah, I had
no idea she was pregnant.

242
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,490
I checked robert's
birthday. It's possible.

243
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,130
Why did you leave her?

244
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,140
Because ray survived.

245
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,270
He was in a coma for
months. He lost his dog tags.

246
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,300
The army didn't know who he was.

247
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,100
When ray turned up,
I made myself scarce.

248
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,040
What else could I do?

249
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,790
I left my best friend for
dead, and then I stole his wife.

250
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,420
It was wrong.

251
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,110
It wasn't wrong if it was love.

252
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,270
Was it love?

253
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,250
Yeah. Yeah, I think it was.

254
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,460
It's getting late. Cops
should be done by now.

255
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,410
Yeah.

256
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,780
Listen, thanks for letting us
have a look around on our own.

257
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,940
Yeah, well, like I said, you know,
C.S.I.And police have combed every inch.

258
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,920
I-I don't care who finds
jacob, as long as he's found.

259
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,320
It's strange to have a son who
looks old enough to be your father.

260
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,380
You seem... familiar somehow.

261
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,700
Oh, he was all over tmz last week.

262
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,440
No.

263
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,260
Do--do I maybe
know your family?

264
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,260
No, I don't think so.

265
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,240
excuse me.

266
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,460
this was a human crime.

267
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,670
There's no scent of vampire in here.

268
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,400
hey, can't you smell
if robert's your son?

269
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,100
No. It's not that specific.

270
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,670
Can you get a D.N.A.Test?

271
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,420
Wouldn't work. My D.N.A.Was fundamentally
altered when I became a vampire.

272
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,150
What about pre-vamp D.N.A.?

273
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,690
I have a lot of skills. Time
travel is not one of them.

274
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,470
Now what about a lock of hair from
a family bible, something like that?

275
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,060
Maybe.

276
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,160
I didn't keep much from
when I was human, though.

277
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,450
Is that fingerprint powder?

278
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,960
No, it's--it's
powdered metal.

279
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,000
C.S.I.Has probably bagged a sample.

280
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,920
Lucky for us we have
the mobile vampire lab.

281
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,930
Let's take a look upstairs.

282
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,460
Jacob's room...

283
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,680
would be right under here.

284
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,760
He was here. This is
where he watched jacob.

285
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,990
And this is the door he came in.

286
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,440
Who's had physical access to the attic?

287
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,570
we renovated last year.

288
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,330
Other than the contractor,
there were dozens of workmen.

289
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,050
Okay. We're gonna need those names.

290
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,990
If he made a secret way into jacob's room,
maybe he made a secret way into the house.

291
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,860
Or found one that's already here.

292
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,500
A lot of these old
houses had coal chutes...

293
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,440
like this one.

294
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,190
And it's a way into the house.

295
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,380
It's been opened recently.

296
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,970
Once he was in the kitchen, he could take the
servants' stairs to the attic and take his time.

297
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,650
To take my son.

298
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,450
So jacob was right.

299
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,090
The monster was in the walls.

300
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,500
And in the floors and in the ceilings.

301
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,520
how did you know about the coal chute?

302
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,570
I grew up in a house like this.

303
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,350
Here in L.A.?

304
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,170
Yeah.

305
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,290
And what school did you go to?

306
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,560
You investigating me now?

307
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,880
Depends. You got something to hide?

308
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,980
No, not anymore.

309
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,320
The paparazzi exposed my deepest secrets--
shoe size 10 1/2, favorite color blue.

310
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,430
Boxers, not briefs.

311
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,710
How did we get on to
this delightful subject?

312
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,250
We digressed.

313
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,260
Look, I know the other two crime scenes
were in different parts of the city,

314
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,950
but they're all
turn-of-the-century victorians.

315
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,410
Maybe our guy worked on all of them.

316
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,200
You should check and see
if they have coal chutes.

317
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,920
That would explain how he got in.

318
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,430
I'll have our guys check it out.

319
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,270
This is, uh, every piece of paper
from the renovation last year--

320
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,780
every work
order, invoice--

321
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,230
every suspect.That's a lot of names.

322
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,110
Well, then we need to
get started. Thank you.

323
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,620
- Yeah.
- thanks.

324
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,100
I'll make some coffee.

325
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,000
It's after 3:00.

326
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,870
You know, why don't you,
uh, try to get some sleep?

327
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,430
Easier said than done.

328
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,590
Robert's D.N.A.One
sample down, one to go.

329
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,190
You should try to get some rest, too.

330
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,460
Yeah, it's hard to sleep knowing
jacob's out there with this nut.

331
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,480
We'll get him back.

332
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,290
We have to.

333
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,750
The D.A.'S office will narrow it down.

334
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,150
- Ben's got a good team.
- "Ben"?

335
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,960
- should I be jealous?
- Of course.

336
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,260
Even if I have no romantic interest in
him, your jealousy makes me feel desirable.

337
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,500
Maybe I can't time travel, and I definitely
don't have a lock of hair in the family bible.

338
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,320
But every soldier has to
fit his life into a box.

339
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,470
This I kept.

340
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,860
So robert's contractor's legit, but
he hired a lot of labor off the books.

341
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,540
So they could either be nice guys from the
home depot parking lot or convicted felons.

342
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,630
But I did have better luck
with the other crime scenes.

343
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,600
Both houses have been
renovated within the last year.

344
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,930
The first victim was taken from
a 1911 victorian in ocean park.

345
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,000
The second was taken from a
1903 victorian in pasadena.

346
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,730
Do they both have coal chutes?

347
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,020
No, but ocean park had a wine
cellar with an access door,

348
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,750
and pasadena had an in-floor heating system
riddled with a bunch of old steam tunnels.

349
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,530
Both had been sealed up for decades.

350
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,000
- Have they both been opened recently?
- Yep.

351
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,370
I bet you $100 even the owners
didn't know those entrances existed.

352
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,230
You'd win.

353
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,250
You ever think of becoming
a civilian investigator?

354
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,280
Uh, I did some investigating at
"buzzwire," but I'm not a cop.

355
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,700
You don't have to be, but, uh,
you would have to work for me.

356
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,860
Is that a job offer?

357
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,610
Yeah, it is.

358
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:07,060
I thought my human past was
dead, hidden away in storage.

359
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:12,390
But now I find out it might be alive and
well, living in a house in west adams.

360
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,740
But only my human
D.N.A.Will tell me for sure.

361
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,090
Nice footlocker.

362
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,190
Did you mug an army guy?

363
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,470
Josef. To what do i owe this pleasure?

364
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,270
I left my cell phone here yesterday.
I spent 400 years without one.

365
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,900
Now I can't go a day...

366
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,490
so, G.I.Mick, why the
trip down memory lane?

367
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,360
I need D.N.A.To confirm that I fathered a
child with my best friend's wife after the war.

368
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,770
Never a dull moment,
huh? I'll give you that.

369
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,870
Come on. Give me your best shot.

370
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
I know you're dying to.

371
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,710
You want the truth?

372
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,550
I'm jealous.

373
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,280
See, I've sired plenty of
vamps in my day, but, uh...

374
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,120
no rug rats... that I know of.

375
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,450
Guess they'd all be dust by now,
so it's kind of a moot point, but...

376
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,090
yeah, you know, it's
one of my only regrets...

377
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,890
and I don't believe in regrets.

378
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,940
That boy who was kidnapped...

379
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,950
he might be my grandson.

380
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,530
I know. I hope you get the kid back.

381
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,460
Your last contribution to
the human gene pool, huh?

382
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,040
Yeah. I guess he is.

383
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:44,720
Unless you and beth, uh, rewrite the rules of
vampire love and figure out how to procreate.

384
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,310
Hi, beth. beth's here.

385
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,480
What'd you find out?

386
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,570
Uh, I think the kidnapper saw the
original blueprints of the victims' houses.

387
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,650
Yould cou get those online?

388
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,930
No, all hard copies are filed
at the county assessor's office.

389
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,010
He would have had to
physically sign them out.

390
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,240
Okay. I'll drop you
at the hall of records.

391
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,170
Oh, you found it?

392
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,700
Yeah. Pre-vampire D.N.A.

393
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,700
- Well, we should take it to bionalysis.
- Okay.

394
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:26,070
oh, the lab promised to rush the
D.N.A.Results. We should know by tomorrow.

395
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,340
So about what josef said...

396
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,250
what, that we can't have a baby?

397
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,920
You want to have my baby?

398
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,750
What do you think of "elliot" for a boy?

399
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,570
I'm kidding. Relax.

400
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,670
But I mean, children are a part
of most normal human relationships.

401
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,560
Our relationship being
neither normal nor human.

402
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,380
But josef was right. Vampires
can't have kids. So...

403
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,620
I mean, if it's
a al breaker--

404
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,500
I think we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

405
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,140
I mean, we haven't even
slept with each other yet.

406
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,460
It may not be any good.

407
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,630
Look, let's just focus
on getting jacob back,

408
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,650
and we'll worry about our
children when the time comes.

409
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,270
Yeah.

410
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,270
Bye.

411
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,090
I already went through
all this with the police.

412
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,470
I understand it's a lot of names, but I
need you to try to remember faces, voices,

413
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,800
anyone who was off-kilter at all.

414
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,890
Hey, hey, it's okay.

415
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,590
- just--let's just
take a breath. - Okay.

416
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,860
Okay?

417
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,990
We--we had jacob
late in life.

418
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,950
He was our little miracle, you know?

419
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,900
Just like I was for my folks.

420
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,550
Why were you a miracle?

421
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,520
'Cause my father was partially
paralyzed when he came back from the war.

422
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,740
They didn't think that
he could have any kids...

423
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,570
and then I came along
seven months later.

424
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,040
I was the biggest preemie my--
my mother's doctor ever saw.

425
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,200
He was big because he wasn't premature.

426
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,910
He was mine.

427
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,290
Robert, I...

428
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,040
how do you tell a man twice
your age that you're his father?

429
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,760
You don'T.

430
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,270
I'm gonna get jacob back.

431
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,770
Thank you.

432
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,290
just, you know... I never thought
that I'd ever have a son, you know?

433
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,810
yeah, I know.

434
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,830
Okay, so listen, these workmen...

435
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,250
were any of them especially
interested in jacob?

436
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,400
Oh, it's chaos when you're
renovating, you know?

437
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,900
It's a lot of--aot of dust
and noise, people everywhere.

438
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,260
Wait a minute.

439
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,340
There was this one guy that,
well, he liked to work at night.

440
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,610
Did--did-- did he
ever speak to jacob?

441
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,920
Maybe once or twice.

442
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,110
I think he did the, uh,
the metalwork on the roof.

443
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:23,180
It was, uh, kevin...

444
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,240
it was ken...

445
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,340
verdolino. Ken verdolino?

446
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,740
That's him.

447
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,490
hello?

448
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,780
have you figured it out yet?

449
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,240
Verdolino?

450
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,680
Yeah, and you're mick st. John,
the P.I.Who drives the old mercedes.

451
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,080
You've been watching me?

452
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,200
It's what I do.

453
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,430
Where's jacob?

454
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,480
Jacob's mine now. Stay away.

455
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,400
We can talk about this
in person, ken. Come on.

456
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,820
How about I talk to your
blonde friend instead?

457
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,720
She's lonely all by herself among
the files and the bookshelves.

458
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,990
I always did like the smart girls.

459
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,460
hello?

460
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,840
Hey, I'm still in here. Can
you turn the lights on, please?

461
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,160
hello?

462
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,740
flashlight.

463
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,160
hello?

464
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,320
hello?

465
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,050
Beth! Beth! You okay?

466
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,580
mick, there's somebody in
there. He's watching me.

467
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,630
Listen to me. His name is ken verdolino.

468
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,210
He's the guy who took jacob,
okay? You have to stay here.

469
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,990
- Listen. Stay here.
- Okay.

470
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,430
okay, I got it. Thank you.

471
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,680
He's long gone.

472
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,840
If you keep sneaking up on me like that,
I am gonna mace you one of these days.

473
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,820
Well, it's only a matter
of time. Who was that?

474
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,280
It was ben. He's got verdolino's
adadess from the D.M.V.

475
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,200
It's 1532 hobart in west adams.
He's getting a search warrant.

476
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,070
Why don't we pull verdolino's
blueprints while we're here?

477
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,400
This is them? 1532 hobart?

478
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,600
That's right under the freeway.

479
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,400
And there's a basement.

480
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,110
That's gotta be where he's
holding jacob. Let's go.

481
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,260
Mick, wait. Mick. Mick!

482
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:34,510
I know this boy means a lot to you,
but we should wait for the warrant.

483
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,640
You want to play it by the book while
this guy could be moving jacob or worse?

484
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,300
I-I just don't want you to spook him.

485
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,770
He might do something desperate.

486
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,270
I know what I'm doing.

487
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:06,070
************

488
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,360
they tore houses down years ago
to make room for the freeway,

489
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,200
but they left scars
behind-- basements

490
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,410
for monsters to hide in.

491
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,740
Cops are on their way.

492
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,400
You let jacob go, you can
walk out of here alive.

493
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,140
Verdolino likes the dark.

494
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,360
Fine by me.

495
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,800
Ken verdolino! L.A.P.D.!
Open up! Break it down.

496
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,560
Clear!

497
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,900
Clear!

498
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,190
******

499
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,760
I know how you feel, ken--
always on the outside looking in,

500
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,990
always alone, always in the dark.

501
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,140
that's why I can't let him go.

502
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,340
We all have to learn there's
nothing to fear in the dark.

503
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,340
You think kidnapping him and
terrorizing him is therapy?

504
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,960
Clear!

505
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,740
- I thought st. John said verdolino was re.
- He did.

506
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,970
Yeah, but no sign of either of 'em.

507
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,410
No, I saw mick's car outside.

508
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,470
He's still here somewhere.

509
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,800
Once jacob gets over his
fear, he's free to go.

510
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:03,730
How can he get over his fear
when he's cold and alone?

511
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,620
Life's cold, mick.

512
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,250
It's a harsh lesson we all gotta learn.

513
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,460
Actually, you're pretty close.

514
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,780
Closer than you think.

515
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,180
Where's jacob?

516
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,120
You tell me where he is now!

517
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,380
- Oh, my god!
- He's got a gun!

518
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,570
Why aren't you scared?

519
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,170
- It's over.
- So it is.

520
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:35,120
And now jacob's gonna die
alone and scared because of you.

521
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,770
No!

522
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,380
- Come on!
- okay, come on, come on. Let's go.

523
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Jacob?

524
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,680
Jacob!

525
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,030
Jacob, if you can hear me,
you gotta make a noise, buddy.

526
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,370
Jacob?

527
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,760
Beth, hold on. There's nothing here.

528
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,030
You heard the gunshots.
He's here. I know he's here.

529
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,470
Yeah, all right.

530
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,010
Jacob, you gotta give me a sign!

531
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,610
Come on, kid.

532
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,470
jacob.

533
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,610
Wait. Beth, beth. Guys!
Guys, I found something!

534
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,840
jacob? Jacob!

535
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,600
jacob. Come on, jacob, breathe.

536
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,070
Breathe!

537
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,070
okay. Okay. Come on.

538
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,270
there's someone moving down there.

539
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,720
This is L.A.P.D.Come out
slowly with your hands up.

540
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,480
It's mick st.John. I have jacob.

541
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,870
It's st. John. Stand down.

542
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,850
- Clear me!
- You're clear.

543
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,400
- Where e ththparamedics?
- There.

544
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,910
- Where's verdolino?
- He killed himself.

545
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,390
You're okay.

546
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,790
he's gonna be okay.

547
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,840
the D.N.A.Test.

548
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,700
The lab sent it over this morning.

549
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,300
robert's not my son.

550
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,700
Good for you, ray.

551
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,070
- I'm sorry.
- No.

552
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,320
No, this is the way it's supposed to be.

553
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:41,630
I just didn't know how much I wanted a
family until I almost had one, you know?

554
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,430
Family's not only about D.N.A.

555
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,560
jacob.

556
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,020
Hey, buddy.

557
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,750
- look, it's mick.
- I know, I know.

558
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,940
I-I just saw him pull
up. We'll go say hi.

559
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,950
No, in the picture.
