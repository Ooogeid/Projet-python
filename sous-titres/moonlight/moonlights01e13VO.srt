1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:02,315
<I>Previously On "Moonlight"...

2
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:07,355
What Are You?
I'm A Vampire.

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,722
You Really Hate Being
A Vampire, Don't You?

4
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:12,887
Josh!

5
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:18,954
Turn Him. He'll Live.
That's Not Living, Beth.

6
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:20,887
He's Human.
This Is What Happens.

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,421
One Of These Days,

8
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:24,954
You're Gonna Have To Stop
Hating The Way You Are.

9
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,887
There Is Some Kind Of Cure.
I Have To Find It.

10
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:31,421
I've Waited To Feel
Human For A Long Time...

11
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,754
But I Forgot How Painful
It Can Be.

12
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:38,221
Are You Human?

13
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,921
For Now, Yeah.

14
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:41,787
How Does It Feel?

15
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:43,488
It Feels Amazing.

16
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,887
Shannon Noll's "Shine"

17
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:55,021
* Get Up,
Get Up, Get Up, Get Up *

18
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,054
It's Been 55 Years
Since I Slept In A Bed,

19
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:01,054
<I>Felt The Softness And Warmth
<I>Of Pillows And Blankets.

20
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,887
* Today Is The Day *

21
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:05,521
* You Hold The World *

22
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:08,622
Do I Miss Sleeping
In An Industrial Freezer?

23
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:11,221
<I>Would You?

24
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:14,655
<I>It's Been 6 Days,
<I>8 Hours And 42 Minutes

25
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:17,988
<I>Since I Took The Cure
<I>That Turned Me From A Vampire

26
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:19,488
<I>Back Into A Human,

27
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:21,688
<I>And I'm Enjoying
<I>Every Moment.

28
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:25,455
* Let Him Sing,
Let Him Be Heard *

29
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:28,455
<I>I Get To Trade In
<I>My Usual Breakfast Of Blood

30
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,154
<I>For Fresh-Squeezed Orange Juice
<I>And Most Importantly...

31
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:34,154
<I>Coffee.

32
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:36,762
<I>Coffee's A Lot Better
<I>Than It Was Half A Century Ago,

33
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:38,141
<I>Or Maybe These Days,

34
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,588
<I>I Just Think
<I>Everything Is Better.

35
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,121
* Watch You Shine *

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,288
* Hey Now, Hey Now,
Hey Now, Hey Now *

37
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,555
<I>Vampires Don't Eat Food.

38
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:56,455
<I>We Can't Taste It,
<I>And We Can't Digest It.

39
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,455
<I>Most People
<I>Would Be Worrying

40
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:00,555
<I>About Their Cholesterol
<I>Right Now

41
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,588
<I>Me? I'm Going For It.

42
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,896
<I>Sure, Nobody Knows
<I>What's In It,

43
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:08,787
<I>But I Used To Be A Vampire.
<I>You Think I Care?

44
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:11,821
<I>Carpe Diem, Right?

45
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:13,521
<I>Seize The Day...

46
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:16,954
<I>Especially When I've Spent
<I>So Long Sleeping Through Them.

47
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,321
<I>Today I Just Don't Feel
<I>Like I'm 85 Years Old...

48
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:25,234
* This Is The Time *

49
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,921
<I>But I Am. I'm An 85-Year-Old
<I>Former Vampire.

50
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:33,421
<I>Sure, I'm Living
<I>On Borrowed Time,

51
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,754
<I>But I'm Not Dwelling
<I>On That Part.

52
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,921
<I>How Can I When
<I>There's So Much Living To Do?

53
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:40,555
* This Is The Day *

54
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:43,988
* That We've Been
Waiting For *

55
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:48,054
* All The World
Will Stop To Watch You Shine *

56
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:50,689
Hi.

57
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:52,722
Quite A Spread.

58
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:54,358
Well, I Realized
I Have No Idea What You Like,

59
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:55,611
So I Got A Bit
Of Everything.

60
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:56,876
Looks Great.

61
00:02:58,867 --> 00:02:59,972
<I>You Look Great.

62
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,787
So Do You.
Mortality Suits You.

63
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:04,355
Well, Thank You.

64
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,121
I Forgot How Long
It Takes To Heal Up, Though.

65
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,622
Wow. Will They Scar?

66
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,754
I Hadn't Actually
Thought Of That.

67
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,821
I Might Need To Find Myself
A Good Plastic Surgeon.

68
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,521
Lucky We Live In L.A.,
Right?

69
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:20,988
It's Good
To See You So Happy.

70
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:23,121
It's Like
A Whole New You.

71
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:27,821
No. This Is The Old Me
From When I Was Still Human.

72
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:30,255
How Long Will It Last?

73
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:33,821
Until You Turn Back?

74
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:40,154
I Don't Know.

75
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,887
Six Months, Maybe.

76
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,154
Maybe Less.

77
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:46,388
But I'm Making
Every Day Count.

78
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:49,588
I Don't Want
To Have Any Regrets.

79
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:52,455
I'm Really Glad You Called.

80
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:55,255
I Wanted You To Know I Don't
Blame You For Josh's Death.

81
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:58,455
I Should Never Have Asked You
To Turn Him Into A Vampire.

82
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,787
He Wouldn't
Have Wanted That.

83
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:04,521
At The Funeral,
You Were Wearing His Ring.

84
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:07,388
Yes.

85
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,121
Yes, I Was,

86
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:12,488
But, Um, I Realized That
Even If He Had Proposed To Me,

87
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:15,622
I Wouldn't Have
Been Able To Say Yes.

88
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,988
Why Not?

89
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,021
There's Someone Else...

90
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,921
Has Been For A While...

91
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:28,421
And I Care
About Him A Lot.

92
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:29,988
And, Uh...

93
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:34,688
I Think It's Time He Figured Out
What He's Gonna Do About It.

94
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:54,722
I See Palm Springs,
Mid-Century, Rat Pack...

95
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:55,788
I've Been There.
I've Done That.

96
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:58,095
But We've Updated It
To Fit The 21st Century.

97
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,400
Think Clooney.
No

98
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:01,263
Think Kostan.
Mick!

99
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:04,162
Just Leave The Plans, Okay?
I'll Get Back To You.

100
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,012
Boy, No Matter How Much Money
You Throw Into This,

101
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:10,196
Remodeling's A Bitch.
Are You--Are You Tan?
Am I?

102
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:13,196
I Don't Know.
I Had Lunch
At The Beach With Beth.

103
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:16,263
Not Something You'll
Be Doing Any Time Soon.

104
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:20,029
Mm. And How Did That Go?
You Seal The Deal Yet?
It's Not That Simple.

105
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:23,363
Well, Sure It Is.
Boy Likes Girl, Girl Likes Boy.

106
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:25,596
Didn't Your Dad
Explain All Of This?
Okay, And When I Turn Back?

107
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:27,196
Well, Vampires And Humans
Can Have Sex, Mick.

108
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:30,363
This Isn't About Physiology.
And It Isn't About Sex.

109
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:31,935
Of Course It's About Sex.
Everything's About Sex.

110
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,820
I'm 58 Years Older
Than Her, Okay?

111
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,630
I Sleep In A Freezer.

112
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:38,199
I Drink Blood
I Buy From The Morgue,

113
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:41,018
And I Have This Tendency
To Bite Down When I--
Some Women Like That.

114
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:43,285
You Keep Coming Up
With All These Excuses.

115
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:45,174
You're Not Afraid
Beth's Gonna Get Hurt.

116
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:46,944
You're Afraid
You're Gonna Get Hurt.

117
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,578
I... Am In Love With Her.

118
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:56,145
Yeah.

119
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,245
Yeah, You Are.

120
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:03,011
Now Go Do Something About It
Before It's Too Late.

121
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:27,445
* That's When You Caught
Me With Your Eyes *

122
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,811
* You're Sending Shivers
Down My Spine *

123
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:35,111
* And Then You Whispered
In My Ear *

124
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:40,445
Hey, Maureen. What's Up?
Where Have You Been?

125
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,493
I've Been Trying
To Get Ahold Of You.

126
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:43,021
Oh, I Was--
I Was At The Beach.

127
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:46,211
I Guess I Get
Bad Reception There.
Yeah, Well, Playtime's Over.

128
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:47,936
I'm At "Buzzwire."
Get Yourself Down Here.

129
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:50,140
Now? C-Can It Wait
Till The Morning?

130
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,337
Oh, Come On. News Doesn't Care
What Time It Is.

131
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:54,203
I've Got
A Hot Lead On A Story.
Okay, Wait--

132
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,737
20 Minutes, My Office.

133
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:59,478
Okay, I Think I--

134
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,411
Maureen, If This Is Another
Brangelina Alien Baby Thing,

135
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:13,978
I Swear To--

136
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:21,044
Oh, My God.

137
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,911
Maureen?

138
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,044
No.

139
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,911
Maureen!

140
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:38,445
No! No! <I>No!

141
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:42,445
Maureen?

142
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,744
Help.

143
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:53,020
Somebody Help!

If You Think
Of Anything Else, Miss,

148
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,673
Don't Hesitate
To Call Me, Okay?

149
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,978
Thank You.

150
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:19,805
Ms. Turner?

151
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,171
Hi. Ben Talbot From
The District Attorney's Office.

152
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:25,171
It's A Pleasure.
You're A Reporter Here, Right?

153
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,371
Maureen Williams Was Your Editor?
Yeah, She Wanted To Meet Me Here,

154
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:31,438
Said She Had The Lead
On A Story She Was Working On.
Did She Say What Kind Of Story?

155
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:33,672
No, But She Wouldn't
Over The Phone.

156
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:35,672
She Always Liked To Keep

157
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:37,672
The Really Hot Stories
Under Wraps

158
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:40,071
Until She Had Enough
To Go Online.
Oh.

159
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:42,071
Uh, Has Anyone Found
Her Computer?

160
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:42,616
No. Not Yet.

161
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:45,691
She Never Went
Anywhere Without It.

162
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,658
I-If It's Not Here,I Think The Killer Took It.
So You Really Think A Picture
Of Britney Without Panties

163
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,192
Is Worth Murdering For?

164
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,725
This Isn't Just
A Trashy Tabloid.

165
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,357
No Offense,
But, Yeah, It Kind Of Is.

166
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:57,391
We Cover
Serious News Stories Here,

167
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,858
One Of Which Just Got Maureen Killed.
Beth. Beth, What Happened?

168
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:03,391
Maureen--She Was Murdered.
And You Are?

169
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,791
I'm Mick St. John.
I'm A Private Investigator.

170
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:09,891
Right. Yeah, Of Course.
I've Heard A Lot About You.

171
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,925
Good Things?
No. Not Really.

172
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:15,558
Excuse Me.

173
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:18,391
Are You All Right?

174
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,092
Not Really.

175
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,725
You Ready?

176
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,391
Yeah.

177
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:39,891
Single Gunshot Wound
To The Head, .38 Caliber.

178
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,092
Powder Burns
Around The Entry Wound.
She Was Shot At Close Range.

179
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:47,092
Maybe She Knew Her Killer.
Doubt It.You Really Can't Smell It?

180
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:49,958
Give Me A Hint.

181
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,324
Starts With A "V."
You Used To Be One?

182
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,925
Maureen Was Killed By A Vampire?
I Don't Know About That,

183
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:58,725
But She Was Definitely Around One.
Why Would A Vampire Use A Gun?

184
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,768
To Make It Look
Like A Human Crime.

185
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:02,657
What?

186
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:06,025
You're Creeping Me Out, Man.
You Being Human, It's Unnatural.

187
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:08,125
Well, Thanks.
That's, Uh, That's Nice.

188
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,524
Call 'Them Like I See 'Them.
Whatever.

189
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,458
Hey, What About That Gallon
Of A-Positive I Got Stocked Up?

190
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:17,324
Man, You're The Only One
That Drinks That Stuff.

191
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:30,658
Breaking
And Entering Was Much More Fun

192
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,691
When You Were A Vampire.
It's A Shame

193
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,224
You Can't Still Do
That Sexy Vampire Jumping Thing.

194
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,725
Yeah, Well,
The Jumping Was Kind Of Tied

195
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,725
With The Whole
Bloodsucking Thing.

196
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,691
The Killer May Have
Maureen's Laptop,

197
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,658
But She Was Obsessive
About Backing Things Up.

198
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:45,891
Trust Me, There's Gotta Be
A U.S.B. Drive

199
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,524
Stashed Here Somewhere.
Okay, Well,We Don't Have A Lot Of Time.

200
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:50,524
The Police Are Gonna
Be Here Soon.

201
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:52,125
Come On.

202
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,658
Nothing In The Kitchen.

203
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,424
We Gotta Narrow Down The Hiding Places.
It's All About Psychology,All Right?

204
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,424
People Hide Things
In The Last Place

205
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:12,324
They Think Anyone Else
Is Gonna Look.
Tampons.

206
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:13,758
Excuse Me?

207
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:16,691
I Always Hide My Nice Jewelry
In A Box Of Tampons.

208
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:18,092
Yeah, Okay.

209
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:20,591
I'll Admit That's
The Last Place I Would Look.

210
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,058
Uh, If My Jewelry
Goes Missing,

211
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,624
I'll Know Who Took It.

212
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:32,940
You Gotta Be Kidding.

213
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,506
Okay.

214
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,240
Travis.

215
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,506
Oh, Hi.

216
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,407
Hi. Hey.

217
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:51,414
Hey, Don't Worry.

218
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:52,931
We'll Find Someone To Look
After You.

219
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:56,829
God, First Josh,
And Now Maureen.

220
00:11:56,895 --> 00:11:59,728
You Once Told Me
That Everyone You Love Dies.

221
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:02,328
I'm Beginning To Understand
What That Feels Like.

222
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:05,361
No, Not A Good Idea. Animals
Are Naturally Afraid Of...

223
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:07,829
Of Vampires.

224
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,195
I Think He Likes You.

225
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,695
Okay.

226
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:17,695
It's All
Password-Protected.

227
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:19,662
I Can't Open The File.

228
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:25,862
Don't Worry About It.
I Know Somebody Who Can.

229
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:32,462
* They Call Me Drlove *

230
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:34,695
<I>* Call Me Dr. Love *

231
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,562
<I>* Dr. Love *

232
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,762
Just In Time
For My Solo, Man!

233
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:48,328
Is That All You Do?

234
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:51,195
No. Tuesdays And Thursdays
I Rule "World Of Warcraft."

235
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:53,895
<I>* They Call Me *
<I>* Dr. Love *

236
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:57,161
<I>* They Call Me Dr. Love *

237
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,728
<I>* Calling Dr. Love *

238
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:01,428
Hey, Can You--
Can You Turn It Down?

239
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:03,929
Oh. Yeah. Uh, Sorry.

240
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:05,361
Oh.

241
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:07,862
Didn't See
You... Brought Company.

242
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,028
Logan, This Is Beth.
Beth, Logan.

243
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:12,528
She Knows About Us.

244
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:14,528
Oh, Cool.

245
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,851
I Have Some
Password-Protected Files.

246
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:20,218
Well,
Since You Brought Lunch...

247
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,218
He's Not Lunch.

248
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:24,185
We're Paying Cash Today.

249
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:26,285
Your Call.

250
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:31,318
These Files Aren't
Just Password-Protected.

251
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:32,885
They're Encrypted,
And None Of

252
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:34,618
My Standard Algorithm Programs
Are Working.

253
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:36,519
Amateurs With
A Little Bit Of Know-How

254
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,485
Are Usually The Trickiest.

255
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,118
Did You Try Maureen's Birthday,
Her Mother's Maiden Name...

256
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:43,785
Yeah, And Her Phone Number,

257
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:46,152
Driver's License Number,
Social Security...

258
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:47,651
For All We Know,

259
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:50,352
She Used The Name
Of Her Favorite Tv Show.

260
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:52,885
Try Her Cat's Name.
Try Travis.

261
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,152
Nobody Really Uses...

262
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,419
It Worked. We're In.

263
00:13:57,485 --> 00:14:00,185
We Shall Never
Speak Of This Again.

264
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:03,218
"Jill Button,
Spokesmodel For The Donut Diet.

265
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,918
Recently Found Dead
Of A Heart Attack."

266
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:08,452
Maureen Thought The Diet
Could Be Responsible.

267
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,951
Killer Doughnuts. Who Knew?

268
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:13,018
Hey, There's Something
On Kent Morrow.

269
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:17,018
He's Running For Mayor.
I Hear He's Gonna Win.

270
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:19,519
Maureen Received
An E-Mail From Luis Perez.

271
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:22,684
He Claims Thathe Car Accident
That Killed Kent's Wife

272
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:25,519
Three Years Ago Wasn't An Accident.
Political Scandal.That's The One.

273
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:27,551
My Money's On Josef Kostan,

274
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,618
Running Some Sort
Of Charity Scam.

275
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:32,584
Josef Kostan?
Guillermo Said
He Smelled Vampire On Maureen.

276
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:34,152
Maybe It Was Josef.

277
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:35,751
You Know Kostan?

278
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:37,232
Yeah. Yeah, I Do.

279
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:38,828
He's The Richest Vampire
In Town.

280
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:41,805
H-How Come You Never Introduced Us?
Logan, You--You Never Leave Your Basement.

281
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:46,970
Josef Didn't Kill Maureen.
Like Josef's Not Capable Of Murder?

282
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:49,437
Josef Probably Murders
Every Day, But Maureen?

283
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,628
That's Not His Style.

284
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:52,676
Beth, One Of These Other People
Killed Maureen.

285
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,459
And I Am Not Gonna
Let Them Get Away With It.

286
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:01,855
Hey.

287
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,998
Oh, Look.
It's My Two Favorite Humans.

288
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:07,499
Did You Know That
My Editor Was Investigating

289
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:09,566
Your Involvement
In A Bogus Charity Scam?

290
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:12,898
Nice To See You, Beth.
Me? I'm Doing Great. Thanks.

291
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:13,829
Except For All The Drywall Dust.
It Getseverywhere.

292
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:16,462
Beth's Editor, Maureen Williams,
Was Killed A Few Hours Ago.

293
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:20,238
I'm Sorry.

294
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:22,971
Am I A Suspect?

295
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:25,004
Cool. It's Like Role-Playing
Without The Leather.

296
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,471
Your Name Came Up
In Connection

297
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,004
With The Story That Maureen Was Working On.
Well, Was Her Body Found In La Brea Tar Pits?

298
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:30,798
No.

299
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:32,806
That Was The Only Person
I Killed This Week.

300
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:35,804
Josef, This Is Serious.
No. This Is Stupid.

301
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:38,271
Yes, Maureen Called Me, And I'll
Tell You What I Told Her.

302
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,204
Look, I'm On The Board
Of Dozens Of Charities.

303
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,204
I Can't Keep Track.
My P.R. Man Sets It All Up.

304
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:46,371
I Had No Idea This Charity
Was Bogus Until She Told Me.

305
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:47,439
Okay.
We'll Talk To Your P.R. Man.

306
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:51,038
Remember The Tar Pits?

307
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:52,871
Look, Here's My Schedule--

308
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:55,705
I Was Supposed To Meet
Maureen Again This Tuesday

309
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:58,038
And Give Her An Exclusive
On A New Charity

310
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,438
That Kostan Industries Is
Setting Up To Help The Victims Of The Scam.

311
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,198
I Even Got Oprah
As The Honorary Chairwoman.

312
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,672
Now Why Would I Go
Through All That Trouble

313
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,505
If I Could Just Kill Her?

314
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:09,495
I Know It's Tempting
To Always Blame The Vampire,

315
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:10,696
But I Think This Time
You Guys Are Gonna Have

316
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:15,538
To Look For Your Killer
Someplace Else.

317
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,738
<I>I Asked Logan To Track Down
<I>Maureen's Mysterious Tipster

318
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:27,238
<I>While Beth Checks Out
<I>The Donut Diet.

319
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:30,371
<I>Me? I'm Gonna Have
<I>A Chat With Kent Morrow,

320
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:33,338
<I>See What Spin He's Putting
<I>On His Wife's Death.

321
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:38,004
Finally, This Is Not Just
A Race For The Mayor's Office.

322
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:41,837
This Is An Election About Hope,
About Family.

323
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:46,371
Politicians--
There's The Truth

324
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,171
And Then There's What They Want
You To Think Is The Truth.

325
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:52,705
Figuring Out The Difference?
That's The Tricky Part.

326
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:55,672
Public Service Is My Life.
It Gave Me A Reason For Living

327
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:58,290
After The Tragic Death
Of My Wife Three Years Ago

328
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:01,405
Left Me To Raise
My Daughter Bonnie...

329
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:05,238
Alone.

330
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:06,795
It Taught Me
The Importance Of Family,

331
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:12,304
The Pillar Upon Which
We Will Build Our Shining City.

332
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:15,941
Thank You.
Thank You Very Much.

333
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:19,480
Good Speech.

334
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,104
Heard It Like
A Million Times Before--

335
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:25,709
Always Sounds Exactly The Same.
Well, Maybe He's Lip-Synching.

336
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,238
Yeah,
That Could Explain It.

337
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,238
You Must Be Bonnie.

338
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,904
You Must Be Lost.

339
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:35,772
You Seem Too Cool To Be
Hanging Out With These Losers.

340
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:39,104
Well, Appearances
Can Be Deceiving.

341
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:43,804
Mr. Morrow. Mr. Morrow,Can I Have A Word With You?
Uh, I'm Sorry. The Candidate Has A Very Tight Schedule.

342
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:47,438
He Doesn't Have Time Right Now,Mister...
St. John. Mick St. John.

343
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,876
Where Are Your Credentials?
Are You Press?
No.I'm A Private Investigator.

344
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:52,505
You're Going
To Have To Leave.

345
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:57,171
Did You Know That
Maureen Williams From "Buzzwire"

346
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:59,505
Was Looking Into
Your Wife's Car Accident?

347
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:01,571
Who Are You?

348
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,738
Bonnie, Has This Man
Been Bothering You?
No.

349
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:06,004
Do You Know A Man Named Luis Perez?
No. I've Never Heard Of Him.

350
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:07,325
Well, He Claims
That Your Wife's Death

351
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,938
Was Not An Accident.

352
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:11,928
I Don't Know Where
You're Getting Your Information,

353
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:13,443
But You Are Way Out Of Line.

354
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:16,704
Mr. Morrow's Campaign Is Built
On Integrity And Honesty.

355
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:19,554
I Have Nothing To Hide.

356
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,187
Our Doughnuts
Have Been Rigorously Tested.

357
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,520
Every Ingredient
Is Perfectly Safe.

358
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:37,587
Yet Your Spokesmodel,
Jill Button, Is Perfectly Dead.
She Had A Heart Attack.

359
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:40,953
Tragic, But It Had Nothing To Do
With My Diet. Nothing At All.

360
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,520
I Understand You're In Talks
With A Major Conglomerate

361
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:46,520
To Sell This Company.
$50 Million Is A Lot Of Money.

362
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:49,086
You're Implying...
That They Might Not
Be So Interested

363
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:51,420
If They Found Out Your Doughnuts
Are Killing People.

364
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:53,053
This Interview's Over.

365
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,587
Any More Questions,
You Can Talk To My Lawyer.

366
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,453
Take A Box Of Doughnuts
On The Way Out.

367
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:05,786
They Tell The Story.

368
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,953
I Have Nothing To Hide.

369
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,620
Huh. The Offer
For Dee Dee's Company Is Legit.

370
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:23,886
They Filed With The F.T.C.
And The Board Of Directors.

371
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:25,886
So Dee Dee Had
50 Million Good Reasons

372
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:27,520
To Keep Maureen Quiet.

373
00:19:27,587 --> 00:19:29,986
Oh, I Checked Out The Doughnuts.
They're Nothing Special.

374
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:33,120
Mostly Fiber Bombs
Sprinkled With Some Vitamins.

375
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:34,554
No Bad Reactions, Though.

376
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:38,886
Okay, So I Talked
To Our Next Mayor.

377
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,453
Doughnuts.

378
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:45,986
It's Not Bad.

379
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:49,320
How Long Since
You've Had A Doughnut?
1952.

380
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:52,320
Two Words--Krispy Kreme.

381
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:55,320
I Spoke To Kent. I Didn't Have
To Hear His Heartbeat

382
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:58,437
To Tell He's Hiding Something.
I Pulled Up The Police Accident Report.

383
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,533
Kent's Wife Was Driving, And She
Smashed Into An Oncoming Car.

384
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:06,147
She And The Driver
Of The Other Car Were Killed.
Autopsy Come Up With Any Alcohol
Or Drugs In The System?

385
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:09,490
She Was Clean.
Anything On Maureen's Tipster,
Luis Perez?

386
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,956
Uh, Guy's A Ghost?
No Social Security Number,

387
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:14,557
No Address
Or Phone Number Listed...

388
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:17,457
The Only Thing
I Can Try To Do

389
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:20,257
Is Trace The I.P. Address
Of The Computer

390
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:22,789
That Sent The E-Mails
To Maureen,

391
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:26,023
But It's Gonna Take
A Little Time,O I'll Call You.

392
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,056
I Got Guillermo To Pull
Jill Button's Body For Us.

393
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:29,847
I Thought
He Was Mad At You.

394
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,907
I Bought Up All The A-Positive
He Couldn't Unload.

395
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:35,206
Hey, You Can't Drink
Blood Anymore.

396
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:37,240
I Sent It To Josef--

397
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:40,306
Kind Of A, Uh, "Sorry
You Were A Suspect" Present.

398
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,373
Jill Button,
Washed And Autopsied.

399
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,373
Coroner Lists C.O.D.
As A Heart Attack.

400
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:54,733
What Are These?

401
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:56,452
Looks Like
Surgical Incisions.

402
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:58,527
No, Those Are
Liposuction Scars.

403
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,328
What? I Have Friends.

404
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,090
Could These Have Been
A Factor In Her Death?

405
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,146
Well, The Danger In Liposuction
Is Internal Bleeding.

406
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:11,692
Blood Usually Pools
In The Back. See?
No Lividity.

407
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,193
So The Liposuction
Didn't Kill Her.

408
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,525
It's Weird The Coroner
Didn't Mention The Incisions

409
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:18,093
In The Autopsy Report.

410
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,525
Every Scar, Birthmark,
Even Moles Are Usually Noted.

411
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:27,792
Logan Tracked Luis Perez
To A Residence In Burbank.

412
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,659
I'll Head There.

413
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:32,226
You See What You Can Find Out
About This Coroner's Report.

414
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:35,624
Let's Go. Thanks, Man.

415
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:37,001
No Problem.

416
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:38,901
Thank You.

417
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,735
Hey.
Fancy Meeting You Here.

418
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:44,780
What A Coincidence.

419
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,852
Yeah. So What Brings You
To The Morgue?
Just Visiting A Friend.

420
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:52,067
Oh, And Here I Thought You Were
Investigating Maureen's Death

421
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,120
And Circumventing
Both The Police

422
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,298
And The D.A.'S Office To Do It.
We're Not Going Around You.

423
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:57,221
My Office Got A Call
From Kent Morrow

424
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,256
Regarding A Certain P.I.
That's Been Nosing Around.

425
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:02,266
Then I Find Out The Same P.I.
Put In A Request For

426
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:06,662
Jill Button's Coroner's Report.
Another Coincidence?
Mick And I  Are Just Following Up

427
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:10,375
On A Few Of
Maureen's Active Stories.
Ms. Turner, We Both
Want The Same Thing--

428
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:12,527
Find Maureen's Killer.

429
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:14,260
I Know That.

430
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:16,373
I Also Know That You Have
A Lot Of Cases To Worry About.

431
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,873
The D.A.'S Office Is Overworked
And Understaffed--

432
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,190
Okay, You Keep Doing This,

433
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:24,373
And You're Gonna Taint
Any Evidence You Do Uncover...
And Maureen Was My Friend.

434
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,340
Evidence I'm Still Gonna
Have To Take To A Jury.

435
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:30,240
Now Do You Really Want To Risk
Finding Maureen's Killer,

436
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,973
Only To Have Them Walk
On A Technicality?

437
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,706
* Here I Am *

438
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:40,873
* While Fighting This War,
I Stand *

439
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,706
* While Wearing These Scars
On My Hands *

440
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:50,207
* Everything's Going
As Planned *

441
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:52,840
* 'Cause Everyone But Me
Understands *

442
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:59,574
Mr. Perez?

443
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:04,340
<I>I'm Actually Gonna Have
<I>To Chase This Guy?

444
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:05,906
<I>Crap.

445
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:13,474
Hey!

446
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:18,140
Hey!

447
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,474
Hey!
* I Can't Take It *

448
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,207
* Anymore *

449
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:23,739
Hey!
* Be A Man, Go To War *

450
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:26,474
* Throw Away Any Doubts *

451
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,073
Hey!

452
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,873
<I>I Haven't Had To Run Like This
<I>For A Long Time.

453
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:33,840
Hey!

454
00:23:33,906 --> 00:23:36,407
<I>The First Few Minutes
<I>Were Fun,

455
00:23:36,474 --> 00:23:38,906
<I>But Now...
<I>Let's Just Say Right Now

456
00:23:38,973 --> 00:23:40,940
<I>I Do Feel
<I>Like I'm 85 Years Old.

457
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:43,940
<I>And I Really Am Gonna Have
<I>To Cut Back On The Hot Dogs.

458
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,485
I Thought You Were I.N.S.

459
00:23:57,551 --> 00:23:59,984
Two Immigration Officers
Came By This Morning

460
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:02,051
Asking
My Neighbors Questions.

461
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:03,626
Somebody Tipped Them Off
About Me.

462
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:07,418
Yeah. Kent Morrow.
He's Trying To Keep You Quiet.

463
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:09,264
Why? I Mean, What's
Your Connection To Kent Morrow?

464
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,951
I Was The Valet That Night

465
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,684
At The Restaurant
Where The Morrows Ate.
Okay, And...

466
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,751
I Mean, You Brought
The Car Around,

467
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:19,184
You Gave The Keys
To Mrs. Morrow...
No.

468
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,817
I Gave The Keys To Him...

469
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:23,485
Her Husband.

470
00:24:23,551 --> 00:24:25,784
I-I Know That
He Was Drunk, Okay?

471
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:27,784
But He Was Angry.
What Could I Do?

472
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:30,251
Kent Morrow
Was Driving That Night?

473
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:33,000
Why Didn't You Tell The Police This?
I-I Didn't Want To Get Involved, Okay?

474
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:36,451
I Was Working Illegally.
Why Are You Getting Involved Now?

475
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,375
Why Contact "Buzzwire"
Just As Morrow

476
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,375
Is About
To Be Elected Mayor?

477
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:42,308
Who's "Buzzwire"?
I Didn't Contact Anybody.

478
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,041
Let Me See Your Computer.

479
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,607
Logan.

480
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:51,607
Luis Perez Says He Didn't
Send The E-Mails To Maureen.

481
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:54,508
Send Me Something
From His Computer.

482
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:59,542
Son Of A Bitch.

483
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,075
The Configuration's All Wrong.

484
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:03,041
Someone Rerouted
The I.P. Address

485
00:25:03,108 --> 00:25:06,175
To Make It <I>Look Like The E-Mails
Were Coming From Perez.

486
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,341
Well, Who Sent The E-Mails?

487
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,373
No One From This Office
Would Be Talking To "Buzzwire."

488
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,339
Well, The E-Mails Were Sent
From A Computer In This Office--

489
00:25:21,406 --> 00:25:22,540
Your Computer.

490
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,139
Ellen?

491
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:26,939
Dozens Of Staffers
Use My Computer.

492
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:28,972
What Is Going On, Kent?

493
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,839
This Is Harassment,
All Right?

494
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:34,639
And I Will  Press Charges,
Believe Me.

495
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:36,206
Mick, Come Here.

496
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:44,872
What's Talbot Doing Here?

497
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:46,872
If Kent
Is Maureen's Killer,

498
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:48,872
There's Gonna Be
A Political Firestorm.

499
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:51,373
We're Gonna Need His Help.
Will Perez Testify?

500
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,006
He's Afraid
Of Getting Deported.

501
00:25:54,073 --> 00:25:56,440
Well, Look, Either Way, It's
Still His Word Against Kent's.

502
00:25:56,506 --> 00:25:58,440
There's Not A Judge In Town

503
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:01,073
That's Gonna Go
Anywhere Near This.

504
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:08,772
I'll Be Right Back.

505
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,373
No, Bonnie!

506
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,206
Don't Come Near Me!

507
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:23,906
Go Away!
No, Bonnie!

508
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:25,273
Bonnie, Stop.

509
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:27,073
Stay Away From Me!

510
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:29,273
You Don't Wanna Jump.
You Don't Wanna Jump.

511
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,540
You Gonna Give Me, The, Um,

512
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:34,206
"There's So Much To Live For"
Speech?

513
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:37,739
You Have No Frickin' Idea.
Well, Try Me. Come On.

514
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,406
So You Can Talk Me
Out Of It?

515
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,839
No, But People Are Gonna Ask
Why You Jumped,

516
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:45,306
And I Wanna Be Able
To Tell Them

517
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:48,872
That You Made
An Informed Decision, Okay?

518
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:53,939
What, So Now
You're Gonna Jump, Too?

519
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:55,506
I'd Rather Not.

520
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,206
I've Never Even Had
A Krispy Kreme Doughnut.

521
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:00,106
Are You Nuts?

522
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:01,872
Yeah.

523
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:05,039
No, You're Not.

524
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:08,106
But You Know What Is?

525
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:10,572
Living Every Day
With A Secret

526
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:13,106
That You Want
To Tell Someone--

527
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,339
Anyone--
About, But You Can't.

528
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:18,839
Listen To Me, Okay?
Secrets--They're Like A Disease.

529
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:21,239
And If We Don't Share Them,

530
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,605
They Can Eat Us Up
On The Inside

531
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:25,106
Until There's Nothing Left,

532
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:28,939
Until It Feels
Like We're Already Dead.

533
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,406
You Do Have A Secret,
Don't You?

534
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:32,906
Yeah, I Do.

535
00:27:32,972 --> 00:27:36,006
And It Ate Me Up,
Until I Finally Told Somebody.

536
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:39,440
Yeah?
And Did It Turn Out Okay?

537
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:42,239
You Know What?
I Think It Did.

538
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:43,506
Mick!

539
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:45,239
Bonnie!

540
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:47,106
Stay Back! Stay Back!

541
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:50,306
Honey, It's Okay. I'm Here.

542
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:53,006
Get Him Away.
I Don't Want Him Here!
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.

543
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:56,506
Get Him Away!
Hey, It's Just You And Me
Up Here.

544
00:27:56,572 --> 00:27:59,939
It's Just You And Me Up Here.
You Talk To Me, Okay?

545
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:03,639
I Woke Up In--In The Back
Of The Car...

546
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:05,339
And Mommy Was Dead.

547
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:07,006
Bonnie, Don't.
We're Family, Honey!

548
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:09,540
You're All I Got Left, Baby!
You're All I Got Left!

549
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,206
That's Because
You Killed My Mother!

550
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:16,705
It's Okay. It's Okay.

551
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:20,806
He Was Driving,
But He Said To Say That She Was,

552
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:23,540
And He Said That--
That If I Didn't, That--

553
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:28,073
That He Would Go To Jail,
A-And I Would Be All Alone.

554
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,039
You Wanted People
To Know The Truth, Right?

555
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:33,572
I Just Wanted Someone Else
To Know What Really Happened,

556
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:37,039
To Tell The World The Truth
About My Mother,

557
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:40,705
Because I Was Too Chicken To.

558
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:42,705
But I Screwed That Up, Too.

559
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:46,339
It Was All Just For Nothing!

560
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:47,339
Bonnie!
No!

561
00:28:47,406 --> 00:28:49,739
Aah!

562
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,639
Hey, It's Okay.

563
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:56,073
You're Okay.

564
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:59,672
Come On. It's All Right.

565
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:03,206
How About We Finish This
Back At My Office, Huh?
My Daughter. My Daughter!

566
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:05,206
If You Cared
About Your Daughter,

567
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:07,506
You Wouldn't Have
Had Her Lie For You.
Bonnie! Bonnie!

568
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:09,373
It's Okay, Baby.

569
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:12,206
Oh, God.

570
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:17,872
Are You Okay?
For A Second, I Thought You...

571
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:20,639
Yeah, I Just Remembered
I Don't Like Heights.

572
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:22,939
If You'd Have Fallen,
You'd Have Died.

573
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:24,906
Yeah, But I Didn't.

574
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,705
If You Had...

575
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:30,006
I-I'm Not Used To Worrying
About You Like This.

576
00:29:30,073 --> 00:29:33,139
Me Neither.
It's Kind Of Exhilarating.

577
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,572
Not Exactly The Word
I'd Use.

578
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:38,273
So What Now?

579
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:40,239
If Kent Didn't Kill Maureen,
Then That--

580
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:43,073
Well, I Guess We're Left
With The Donut Queen.

581
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:54,339
What Did The Coroner Say?
Well, It Took Some Doing,

582
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:55,644
But I Finally Got Him To Admit
He Was Paid Off

583
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:59,939
By Jill Button's Plastic Surgeon.
What's His Surgeon's Name?

584
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,206
Mm...

585
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:03,039
Oh, Come On, Talbot.
Quid Pro Quo.

586
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:05,540
We Gave You Kent Morrow
On A Silver Platter.

587
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:08,006
Dr. Pierce Anders.
He Already Has Two Complaints

588
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,006
Filed Against Him--
Patients Hospitalized

589
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:12,506
After Their Procedures
For Unexpected Blood Loss.

590
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:13,821
Well, Maybe He Figured
Three Strikes And He's Out.

591
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:17,164
What's The Address?
No, You're Not Talking To Him
Without Me.

592
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:18,592
I'll Text You The Address

593
00:30:18,602 --> 00:30:19,841
And Meet You There
In The Morning.

594
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:22,913
He's Starting To Grow On Me.
Hey.

595
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:29,314
You Wanna Come Over To My Place
For Dinner Tonight?

596
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:34,047
I've, Uh, Figured Out
How To Work The Oven.

597
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,402
You're Gonna Cook Me Dinner?

598
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,503
Yeah, I'm Gonna Try.

599
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:42,036
Are You Asking Me
Out On A Date?

600
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:44,668
Well, Isn't That
What Humans Do?

601
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:00,503
I Consider Myself An Artist.

602
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,503
My Clients Are My Canvas.

603
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:04,002
Their Fantasies,
My Inspiration.

604
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,336
What Was
Jill Button's Fantasy?

605
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:08,369
Ms. Button Had
Very Realistic Expectations.

606
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,935
She Was Having Difficulty
Maintaining Her Weight,

607
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,535
So She Came To Me
For Some Strategic Reshaping.

608
00:31:13,602 --> 00:31:15,369
Liposuction.

609
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:18,002
I Removed 500 C.C.S Of Fat
From Her Target Areas.

610
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:21,535
No Post-Op Complications?
None. Ms. Button Was Happy

611
00:31:21,602 --> 00:31:23,635
And Very Much Alive
When She Left.

612
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:26,002
And There Are Witnesses
That Can Verify This?

613
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,049
My Nurses And Office Staff
Will Be Happy

614
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,706
To Provide You
With Statements.
We'd Like To See Your Charts.

615
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,668
I'm Sure You Understand
That's An Impossibility.

616
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:36,469
Doctor-Patient
Confidentiality.

617
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:38,568
Yeah, Well, Look,
I Can Get A Warrant.

618
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:40,702
You Have No Grounds
For A Warrant.

619
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,735
I Know A Judge
Who Got A Bad Nose Job.

620
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:44,436
She's Bitter.

621
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:55,102
Beth, Get Up!

622
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:24,769
Type A-O-Negative.

623
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:26,202
Unusual.

624
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:27,802
Tasty.

625
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:38,964
Careful, Man.

626
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:41,398
I'm Sorry. Most Of My Customers
Don't Complain.

627
00:32:41,465 --> 00:32:43,897
Just Hurry Up.
I Gotta Get Outta Here.

628
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:46,665
I'm Doing The Best I Can Here.
You Should Be In The Hospital.

629
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:51,087
I Already Lost Two Hours When I Was Unconscious.
Look, Seriously, Man,You're A Mess.

630
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:55,514
No Wonder Anders
Thought You Were Dead.
Aah! Man.

631
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:57,485
I Can't Believe I Didn't Know
That Guy Was A Vampire.

632
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:01,841
I Should've Sensed It The Minute He Walked In The Room. Aah!
That's The Advantage Of Being A Human.

633
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:04,135
Yeah,
That And Getting My Ass Kicked.

634
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:05,183
When I Was A Vampire,

635
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:08,268
I Would've Wiped The Floor
With This Guy.

636
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:09,314
You Know, I Never Thought
I'd Say This, Man,

637
00:33:09,723 --> 00:33:13,024
But Right Now
Being Human Sucks.

638
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,057
Look, Uh,
I Made Some Phone Calls.

639
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:17,524
Anders'
Plastic Surgery Practice

640
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:19,723
Is Just A Front
For His Real Business--

641
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,257
Selling Blood To Vamps
Looking For Rare Blood Types.

642
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:26,257
So He Siphons
A Few Pints Of Blood

643
00:33:26,324 --> 00:33:29,491
From Each Of His Human Patients,
And Most Of Them Never Know?

644
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:31,491
Oh, Man,
That's Why He Took Beth.

645
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:34,391
She Has A Rare Blood Type.

646
00:33:34,457 --> 00:33:36,658
I Don't Know Why
He Took Talbot--

647
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,224
Maybe To Find Out
What He Knows.

648
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,324
Where Can I Find Anders Now?

649
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:41,823
No Way, Man.

650
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,790
This Vamp Is Seriously Badass,
And He Won't Be Alone.

651
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,024
Hey, The Address.

652
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:55,157
Ben, You All Right?

653
00:33:55,224 --> 00:33:58,191
Yeah. Yeah.
How Long Was I Out?

654
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:01,124
An Hour, Maybe.
You Probably Have A Concussion.

655
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:05,191
I Don't Think I'll Be Calling
For A Doctor.

656
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:06,558
I Tried.

657
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:09,057
It's Some Kind Of Surgical Tube.
It Won't Budge.

658
00:34:09,124 --> 00:34:12,024
What Kind Of Psycho Is This Guy?
Where The Hell Are We?

659
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,924
Mick Will Find Us.
He's Good. He's Really Good.

660
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,757
Yeah, And Most Likely,Really Dead.
Don't Say That.You Don't Know That.

661
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,327
Oh, Beth, Come On.
We Gotta Face The Facts.

662
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:22,144
No One Knows Where We Are,
And No One Is Coming To Save Us.

663
00:34:22,154 --> 00:34:23,464
We're On Our Own.

664
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:44,107
What Are You Doing?
Don't Do That!

665
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:46,383
What, Use
My Crafty Vampire Abilities

666
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:50,157
To Sneak Up On You?
Why Are You Here?

667
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:51,624
Guillermo Called Me.

668
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,031
Said You Were About To Do
Something Extremely Stupid.

669
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:57,502
I Said, "Wait. That Can't Be The Mick That I Know."
You Should Come.
You Love A Challenge.

670
00:34:57,602 --> 00:34:59,702
No, See, I'm A Lover.
I'm Not A Fighter.

671
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:02,325
Now Besides, I'd Just Get Dead
Trying To Protect You,

672
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:05,881
The Human Liability.
I Can Take Care Of Myself.

673
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:13,001
This Is How
You're Gonna Fight Them?

674
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:15,968
This Is How
You Want It To End?
Get Off Me.

675
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:18,735
Get Off Me!

676
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:29,502
I Hope I Made My Point.

677
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:34,335
Yeah.

678
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:36,101
You Did.

679
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:38,769
What?

680
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:41,168
You Were Right.

681
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:44,568
I Can't Save Beth
As A Human...

682
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:47,869
But I Can Save Her
As A Vampire.

683
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:50,535
You Have To Turn Me Back.

684
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:53,435
Whoa. You Hold On.
This Is Not--

685
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:55,534
You Have To Turn Me Back
Right Now.

686
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:58,201
Mick, You're Human Again.

687
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:00,019
After All You Went Through
To Get The Cure,

688
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:04,402
You're Gonna Give It Up This Easy?
You Think This Is Easy For Me?

689
00:36:04,468 --> 00:36:08,301
This Is Not Easy, Okay?
I Don't Have A Choice.

690
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:12,901
What You're Asking Me To Do--
Listen To Me! All Right?

691
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:14,602
He Has Beth.

692
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:17,568
He Has My Beth.

693
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:21,802
So Please, Please, Brother.

694
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:24,368
Mick...

695
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:26,235
Forgive Me.

696
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:35,735
Ohh!

697
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:07,502
Come On, Mick.

698
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:09,168
Rise And Shine.

699
00:38:00,268 --> 00:38:03,001
What's Going On?
You're A--

700
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:04,468
Oh, Yeah.

701
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,502
It Is So On.

702
00:38:34,135 --> 00:38:36,068
Beth, You Okay?

703
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:08,830
Whew! Very Dramatic.
I Like It.

704
00:39:12,112 --> 00:39:13,479
Who's There?

705
00:39:13,546 --> 00:39:15,179
I'm Here.
Mick.

706
00:39:15,245 --> 00:39:17,012
It's Okay.
Oh, God.

707
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:19,845
St. John? What's Going On?

708
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:29,778
Ur Face. What Happened?

709
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:32,212
Like They Say,
Life Is Short.

710
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:37,112
You Keep The Blindfold
On Him.

711
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:39,179
Hey, What The Hell
Is Going On?

712
00:39:39,245 --> 00:39:40,745
We're Saving Your Ass.

713
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:50,345
Talbot Took A Bunch Of Cops
Around To Anders'.

714
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:51,945
Place Was Immaculate.

715
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:54,845
Yeah, Well, The Cleaner
Is Very Good At What She Does.

716
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:57,345
No One Will Ever Find
Any Evidence

717
00:39:57,412 --> 00:39:58,912
Of What Happened There.

718
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:00,912
He Had A Lot Of Questions.

719
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:03,006
I Told Him I Was Unconscious
Most Of The Time

720
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:05,307
And I Don't Remember Much.
He Should Just Be Happy
He's Alive.

721
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:08,614
He Doesn't Strike Me As Someone
Who Likes Unanswered Questions.

722
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:13,867
How Is Everything?

723
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,598
Delicious.

724
00:40:15,698 --> 00:40:16,179
Good.

725
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:19,746
I Was Worried
About The Seasoning.

726
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:24,412
I Don't Know What To Say
About What You Did For Me,

727
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:27,612
What You Gave Up.
Part Of You Must Hate Me.

728
00:40:29,242 --> 00:40:31,230
I Could Never Hate You.

729
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,863
But You're Back
To Being A Vampire.

730
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,597
I Don't Have Any Regrets,
Okay?

731
00:40:37,663 --> 00:40:39,396
None?

732
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:45,097
Yeah, This Isn't Exactly How
I Pictured Our Date, Either.

733
00:40:45,163 --> 00:40:46,686
What Do You Mean?

734
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:49,397
You Know What I Mean.

735
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:50,273
I'm Human.
You're A Vampire.

736
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,273
We're Right Back
Where We Started.

737
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,538
I Just--I Don't Want You
To Get Hurt.

738
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:58,106
Maybe You're Afraid
Of Getting Hurt.

739
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:02,438
I Know What It's Like
To Lose People You Love.

740
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:05,568
But It's Part Of Life.

741
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:06,739
Relationships Between
Humans And Vampires--

742
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:08,739
Are Difficult, Dangerous
And Complicated.

743
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:12,373
I Know. You Told Me.

744
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:16,297
If You Hadn't Been A Vampire,
I'd Have Died Today.

745
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:18,277
I'd Have Died 23 Years Ago.

746
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,809
* Never Pay The Reaper... *

747
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:23,809
Being A Vampire
Isn't All You Are.

748
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:27,343
It's Not
What's Keeping Us Apart.

749
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,377
It's Just You.

750
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:31,410
* Except I Love You *

751
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:34,676
* And I'd Give My Life
For Yours *

752
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:37,310
* I Know We Are *

753
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:39,843
* We Are The Lucky Ones *

754
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,544
* I Know We Are *

755
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,577
* We Are The Lucky Ones *

756
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:49,343
* I Know We Are *

757
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,843
* We Are The Lucky Ones,
Dear *

758
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:01,709
Maybe You're Right.

759
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:04,110
I Don't Know.

760
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:07,043
But Just Give Me A Chance
To Figure It Out.

761
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,443
Okay?

762
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,743
Just Don't Take Too Long.

763
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:15,676
You May Have Forever,
But I Don't.

764
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:17,110
* I Love You *

765
00:42:17,177 --> 00:42:20,377
* And I'd Give My Life
For Yours *

766
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:23,010
* I Know We Are *

767
00:42:23,076 --> 00:42:26,410
* We Are The Lucky Ones *

768
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,910
* I Know We Are *

769
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:32,410
* We Are The Lucky Ones *

770
00:42:32,477 --> 00:42:34,943
* I Know We Are *

771
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,610
* We Are The Lucky Ones *

772
00:42:38,676 --> 00:42:42,544
* Dear *

773
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,100
