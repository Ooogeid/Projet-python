1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,060
Previously on "moonlight"...

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,570
She's been lying to us.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,000
She's coraline!

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,580
No! Shs s not vampire.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,990
She's human. She has a cure.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,770
Something changed her back,
and if she dies,

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,310
I'll never know what that
was or how she did it.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,130
I came back for you.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,730
You have to tell me how.

10
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:24,890
Im an attorney in
the DA s office

11
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:27,228
Pat everyone down,
starting with him.

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,632
I saw the way you two
looked at each other.

13
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:33,521
What's going on with
you two, anyway?

14
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,580
You've been together for a year,
and you're not even living together.

15
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:38,803
Don't you think it's
time to get serious?

16
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:41,183
I didn't leave thing
svery well with josh.

17
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:43,461
I do think I need to get home.

18
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:05,543
The rest of the city goes to sleep,
and I've just woken up--

19
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:10,961
one of the many attributes that attach
a vampire to a life of solitude.

20
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:15,902
There are questions I ask myself that
I just don't know how to answer.

21
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:20,150
All these questions
surround one uncertainty--

22
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:24,680
how does an immortal
handle mortal feelings?

23
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,661
See, right now we've got you pinned as
a member of the H. E. M. Brotherhood

24
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:42,331
and got enough on tape to
convict you of both trafficking

25
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:43,720
and money laundering.

26
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:46,962
You wear a wire,
I can ask for immunity.

27
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:50,510
You refuse to cooperate,
I file formal charges tomorrow.

28
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,303
You do what you gotta do.

29
00:01:55,686 --> 00:02:00,383
You're looking at getting out sometime
after your daughter's 35th birthday,
Mr. Tejada.

30
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:04,891
And you're looking at a miserable
future if you come after me.

31
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:06,183
This isn't el salvador--

32
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:08,591
my client has given
his answer, gentlemen.

33
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:22,003
Well, it went
exactly as expected,

34
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:25,132
and if I'm reading between the
lines about my "miserable future, "

35
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:27,340
I might need some protection.

36
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:30,612
- You heard about what happened in la palma.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:31,961
He went after a prosecutor.

38
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:35,183
No, not the prosecutor.
It was the prosecutor's wife.

39
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:40,502
That judge down there ended
up declaring a mistrial.

40
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:45,252
You know, I think you're doing the world
a favor by moving forward with this.

41
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:48,262
Listen, be careful.

42
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:50,662
They play rough in el salvador.

43
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,911
Your honor,
in assessing flight risk,

44
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:11,341
I ask that you consider Mr. Tejada is a
well-known ranking member of the
hermanos en muerte gang,

45
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:14,423
commonly referred to as H.
E. M.

46
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,501
Which, as you're well aware of,
your honor...

47
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,532
Thought to be one of the most
dangerous in the world...

48
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:37,303
Known for ruthless violence in
protecting an extremely well-organized
trafficking and money laundering network...

49
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,743
That extends to countries,
if not continents.

50
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:42,803
Mr. Tejada has
refused to cooperate,

51
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:47,093
which indicates he still has ties
to this complex network of...

52
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,121
Not good to accuse
innocent men, ese.

53
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:14,861
Remember that.

54
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,801
So why did you take
coraline's blood?

55
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:41,803
Answers.

56
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,360
I think it might be
the key to the cure.

57
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,763
You really hate being a vampire,
don't you?

58
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,450
Well, "hate" is a strong word,
so, yeah, that works.

59
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:51,700
It can't be all that
bad to live forever.

60
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,643
I mean,
you'll see things when I'm gone--

61
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,711
when everyone's gone--

62
00:04:55,726 --> 00:04:57,991
that we can't even imagine now.

63
00:04:58,008 --> 00:04:58,930
Like what?

64
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:03,273
Cars that can fly,
a diet soda that doesn't suck.

65
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:09,370
Yeah, but it's not so fun
to experience things alone.

66
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:12,121
So take a vampire wife, then.

67
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:13,992
Tried that one.

68
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:16,192
Didn't work out so well.

69
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,512
So are you gonna help
me with this or not?

70
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:23,061
Why don't you take that to guillermo
and get a toxicology report?

71
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:24,631
Not with this one.

72
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:28,571
I have a friend, dr.
Lin, at bio-nalysis.

73
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:30,401
Okay. Good.

74
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:34,100
I just think it's better we go
outside the vampire nation with this.

75
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,462
Yeah, why?

76
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:39,502
Well, vampires like me
might see this as a cure,

77
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:43,880
but others might
see it as a threat.

78
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:45,733
Okay.

79
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:49,001
Oh, my god.

80
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,973
What happened? Are you okay?

81
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:53,081
Do you mind if I talk
to beth for a moment?

82
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:55,423
Alone?

83
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,463
Yeah, sure. No problem.

84
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,593
I'll--I'm on my way out.

85
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:01,442
I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00.

86
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:03,392
Bio-nalysis, okay?

87
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:05,592
What happened?

88
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,473
I recused myself from
the tejada case.

89
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:10,621
But you--you're filing
charges against him tomorrow.

90
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:11,622
I was.

91
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,542
What is going on?

92
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:17,882
- You've been marked.
- What?

93
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:20,472
They'll come after you.

94
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:29,700

97
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:46,680
You can't recuse
yourself from the trial.

98
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,172
It gives out the message that the D.
A. 'S intimidated.

99
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,562
I know.

100
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:55,481
If I recuse, it emboldens the bad guys.
Noble idea.

101
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:58,230
This is reality.

102
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:03,312
Tejada mutilated a prosecutor's
wife in el salvador.

103
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,000
That kind of thing does
not happen in the U. S.

104
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:09,420
Tell that to the families of the three
D. E. A. Agents he supposedly killed in
el centro.

105
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:16,161
But believe me, if it were me that were
marked and not you, I'd never step down.

106
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,193
Never.

107
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,691
But it's not.

108
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,172
You've spent two years of
your life on this case.

109
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:26,703
I know that,
but I can't put you at risk.

110
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:31,070
It means a lot that you would
sacrifice this much for me.

111
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:36,552
Look, if you recuse
yourself and the case fails

112
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:40,481
and then tejada goes on to kill someone
else's brother or wife or daughter...

113
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:43,803
You have to stay on this case.
It's the right thing to do.

114
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,450
I forgot how cute you are
when you're crusading.

115
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:31,471
I missed you so much.

116
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:39,981
I can't help myself from entertaining
the idea of telling beth how I feel.

117
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:43,642
I know I haven't
been here for you.

118
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,102
You're here now.

119
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:47,592
That's all that matters.

120
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,420
I hope everything's okay.

121
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:57,302
I've got caught up in my work.

122
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:59,280
I love that about you.

123
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:03,301
I wouldn't want you
to be any different.

124
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,253
Bobby.

125
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,202
Yeah, thanks for getting
back to me so fast.

126
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:19,231
Listen, I want to set up a
security detail A. S. A. P.

127
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,351
Why don't you coordinate this
with lieutenant carl davis?

128
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:23,231
Hey, wait.
If you're gonna do that,

129
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:27,850
I don't want any academy cadets or
chain-smoking detectives following me
around, okay?

130
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:30,463
Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:52,030
What time is it?

132
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:55,051
It's an hour after you were
supposed to meet me at bio-nalysis.

133
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,390
I'm so sorry.
I completely lost track of time.

134
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:58,470
It's okay.

135
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:00,381
I dropped the sample
off with dr. Lin.

136
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:02,040
She said it's gonna
be ready in 24 hours.

137
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:04,802
No. No, no excuses, bobby.

138
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:05,971
I'm serving an arrest
warrant today,

139
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:09,182
and I need the tac-squad to have a
protection team in place by noon.

140
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:10,652
Tac-squad?

141
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:13,151
Somebody needs
police protection.

142
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,352
Yes. Me.

143
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:17,290
Come in.

144
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:27,368
To be honest, I'm not sure I'm doing the
right thing, but she keeps insisting.

145
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,442
Yeah, beth tends to do that.

146
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:32,921
Yes, she does.

147
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,180
But she's right.

148
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:36,010
You shouldn't step down.

149
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:40,821
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep an eye
on her until the tac-squad gets
in place.

150
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,041
I won't let anything
happen to her.

151
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:46,561
I know you won'T.
Just keep your eyes open.

152
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:49,313
- Tejada's ruthless.
- Okay.

153
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:51,672
Thanks, mick.

154
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:02,491
Ladies gentlemen your
attention please

155
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:06,402

00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:30,832
Nothing's too good
for you, mija.

159
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:32,680
I'm so proud of you, eh?

160
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:36,552

all right, let's go...

163
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:08,582
You guys go to the right.

164
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:14,313
Chemma tejada, I have a warrant for your
arrest on felony drug
trafficking charges.

165
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:15,061
Daddy, what's going on?

166
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:17,350
It's nothing.
Don't worry, baby.

167
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:19,143
Don't touch him!

168
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:22,962
Get away from him!

169
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:32,053
You shouldn't have
made this personal.

170
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,903
Don't you ever
threaten her again.

171
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,653
I won't forget this, amigo.

172
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,893
What do you --
what do you mean, "nothing"?

173
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:57,033
I mean, pharmaceutical drugs,
trace botanicals, additional hormones--

174
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:59,540
there's nothing in there
that's not supposed to be.

175
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:05,320
What about unknown substances?
Something you couldn't identify.

176
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:07,412
Nothing. Not even caffeine.

177
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:10,371
The sample was
essentially untainted.

178
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:12,733
I assume it came from a child?

179
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,821
No. Why?

180
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,210
That's surprising.

181
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:19,591
As we get older,
we tend to accumulate toxins.

182
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:23,991
That blood is pure-- almost like new,
and based on the levels of
free radicals,

183
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:27,412
I was positive that was
a child's blood sample.

184
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:29,023
No.

185
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,052
Well, thanks, alison.

186
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:33,950
Yeah, thank you.

187
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,540
Uh, one more thing.

188
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:38,531
I said there was nothing
unusual in the toxicology.

189
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,241
The blood type,
however, is rare.

190
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:41,972
How rare?

191
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,151
Extremely rare.

192
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:45,612
Less than one person
per million has it.

193
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,552
- Type- - a-o-negative.

194
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,022
How did you know?

195
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:51,221
That's my blood type.

196
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:59,562
Furthermore, Mr.
Tejada has refused to cooperate,

197
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:02,382
which indicates he still has
ties to hermanos en muerte--

198
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:03,970
these allegations are specious,
your honor.

199
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:06,452
The state has introduced no
definitive evidence that

200
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:10,111
my client is in any way associated
with hermanos en muerte.

201
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:13,501
He has never been charged with a
felony or violent crime of any nature.

202
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:18,472
Your honor, tejada has willfully flouted
the rule of law in this country by
intimidating the prosecution--

203
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:23,002
the state has provided no conclusive
evidence that such
intimidation occurred,

204
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:26,133
and furthermore,
if there was such intimidation,

205
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:27,773
there is no evidence that
links it to my client.

206
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,270
Depose me right now,
your honor.

207
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:33,013
I am happy to, but I didn't
want to delay the proceedings.

208
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:36,032
There is ample reason
to deny bail--

209
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:38,430
based on the conjecture
of the state?

210
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:44,031
What is not conjecture, your honor, is
that Mr. Tejada owns and operates a
local dry cleaning business.

211
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:48,833
He has significant family in the area
and is a highly respected individual in
his community.

212
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,060
He's willing to surrender his
passport and post a surety bond.

213
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,262
Your honor, he's a flight risk,
a proven threat to the--

214
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:57,160
okay. I get it.

215
00:14:57,825 --> 00:15:01,572
Gentlemen, I'm gonna set bail
at the amount of $5 million.

216
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:04,142
- Thank you,your honor.
- Thank you.

217
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:17,511
He'll be home for dinner.

218
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:22,631
Of all the girls coraline could
have kidnapped 22 years ago,

219
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:25,651
maybe there's a reason
why she singled me out.

220
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,863
Perhaps I have the
same blood type.

221
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,902
Maybe a-o-negative is
connected to the cure.

222
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:35,723
Well, I'm not sure about that,
but for a vampire,

223
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:39,732
the best possible blood to consume
is fresh human blood from a child

224
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,533
that matches the
vampire's blood type.

225
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:53,823
- So hang on a second.
That m-- - wait.

226
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:54,923
What?

227
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:57,123
I hear something.

228
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,313
Stay down.

229
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,802
Let's get out of here. Go.

230
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,702
You okay?

231
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:07,200
You're--you're bleeding.

232
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:08,431
You got hit.

233
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:17,023
It's not my blood.
Its coralines

234
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,261
I came as soon as I heard.

235
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:35,031
Are you okay?
Why didn't you call?

236
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:38,632
I-I wasn't badly hurt, and I knew
you were still in a hearing, so...

237
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:39,291
Are you okay?

238
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,292
I'm fine. Yeah, we both are.

239
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:42,533
Well, hopefully
you'll be safe now.

240
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,403
I brought the protection
team with me.

241
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:49,372
Beth, carl brought commander murphy and
officers robinson and clayton to protect
you, okay?

242
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:52,930
Thanks for looking out for her.

243
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,463
Sounds like it
was a close call.

244
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:56,672
Yeah, it was. Real close.

245
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:59,191
This close, actually.

246
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:01,321
I am so sorry, beth.

247
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:02,682
It must have been terrifying.

248
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,273
Yeah, it was.

249
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:12,591
Supersonic vampire hearing
can definitely help you...

250
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:14,732
Thank god you're all right.

251
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,451
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I love you.

252
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:24,193
But it can also hurt you.

253
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:26,891
I love you, too.

254
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,513
The D. A. Pinches me at my
daughter's birthday party.

255
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,423
He shows me no respect.

256
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:39,311
In san salvador,
the policÌa shows up like that, man...

257
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,052
They'd be muerto.

258
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:47,433
Mi hermana says it's only a party,
but you only turn 16 once.

259
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:57,222
I want you to bring that D.
A. To me...

260
00:18:58,146 --> 00:19:00,721
And bring him alive, eh?

261
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:03,782
Esta bien.

262
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:24,870
Oh, god.

263
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:27,521
- you scared me.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,023
There's nothing to worry about.

265
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:32,042
The tac-squad's
got you covered.

266
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:34,173
I'm so sorry about
the blood sample.

267
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,910
Well, we may still
have a chance.

268
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,711
The most important thing
is that you're safe.

269
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,091
Josh!

270
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:16,291
Josh!

271
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:18,443
Beth! what is it?

272
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:41,153
Beth, get back in the house.

273
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,282
Call an ambulance!

274
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,651
- get in.
- Go,go.

275
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:03,561
That wasn't the plan.

276
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,203
I had no choice.

277
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,350
You should call tejada.

278
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,231
We have to keep them in sight.

279
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,771
There.

280
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:26,342
Look out.

281
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:33,460
Damn it.

282
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,961
- oh,my god.
- It's okay.

283
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:40,910
Turn right.
come on lets get off the main road

284
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:51,553
where did they go?

285
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:52,301
Pull over.

286
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:53,752
No. We need to find them.

287
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:54,890
They could have gone
three different ways.

288
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,031
We don't want to drive
in the wrong direction.

289
00:21:57,046 --> 00:22:01,970
We have to pinpoint their location and
hope that josh has got his cell phone
with him and that it's turned on.

290
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,631
Beth, pull over.

291
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,543
Okay.

292
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:09,503
Okay, I'm calling him.

293
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:18,311
Okay, it's ringing, but it's not going
straight to voice mail, so it is
turned on.

294
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:19,811
That's good.

295
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:25,940
You've reached josh's mailbox.
Leave a message, and I'll call you back.

296
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:31,741
Logan griffen speaking.

297
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:33,651
Logan, mick st. John.
I have an emergency.

298
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:36,082
Yeah, well, I've got two
fried hard drives. Life sucks.

299
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:37,461
Logan, listen to me.

300
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:39,533
All right,
somebody has been kidnapped, okay?

301
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:42,343
He has his cell phone on him,
and it's got G. P. S.

302
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:44,121
I need you to
triangulate the location.

303
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:45,613
Okay. Jeez, okay.

304
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:47,111
What's the number?

305
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:48,923
- uh,3-1-0...
- 3-1-0...

306
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:50,802
- 5-5-5...
- 5-5-5...

307
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:53,472
- 0-1-1-9.
- 0-1-1-9.

308
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:58,053
Uh, about 45 seconds,
and I should have it.

309
00:22:58,065 --> 00:23:00,320
Come on, josh. Pick up.

310
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,080
Did you hear that?

311
00:23:14,117 --> 00:23:16,241
Hear what?

312
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:19,422
- Uh,30 seconds.
- come on.

313
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:28,401
Slow down, man. Slow down.

314
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:41,421
Please, josh. Pick up.

315
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:43,212
Josh!

316
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:46,922
Josh, it's beth. We're coming
to get you. Just hold on, okay?

317
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:51,442
We're coming to get you, okay?
Hold on.

318
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:53,733
The phone is...

319
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:58,601
It's not on a street. It's at griffith
park, close to the observatory.

320
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:02,142
Go, go, go,
and make a right up here.

321
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:04,132
They're in griffith park.

322
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:08,892
Josh, we're coming.
We're coming to get you, okay? Hold on.

323
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:19,101
J-just get carl on the phone and
tell him where we're going, okay?

324
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:21,860
Carl, mick.
They've taken him to griffith park.

325
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,542
I-I don't know.
Somewhere by the observatory.

326
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:41,200
Wait.

327
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,622
What's he doing?

328
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:56,250
I don't know.

329
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:00,123
Should we get outta here?

330
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:04,920
Give it a minute.

331
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:09,110
Now listen to me, beth.

332
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:12,672
When we find them,
we have to get up next to them, okay?

333
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:14,001
And then we have
to cut them off.

334
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:15,671
- Okay,we have to pin them in.
- Okay.

335
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:18,750
And as soon as we do it,
you have to get down and stay down.

336
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,841
- Tell me you understand.
- I understand.

337
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:22,601
Okay, let's go.

338
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,551
There, beth. There they are.

339
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:31,652
Oh, my god. Josh!

340
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:33,912
- You okay?
- Beth.

341
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,640
- You're okay.
- here,buddy.

342
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:38,731
You're okay.

343
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:10,570
- oh,my god.
- All right.

344
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:12,683
Call 9-1-1.

345
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:15,993
Beth, call 9-1-1 now.

346
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:22,630
9-1-1 operator.

347
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:24,330
We need an ambulance.
Somebody's been shot.

348
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,141
We're in griffith
park by the pond.

349
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,830
Yeah, by the pond. Okay.

350
00:27:31,845 --> 00:27:34,271
Come here.
Take your jacket off.

351
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:37,090
Take it off.
Take your jacket O.

352
00:27:37,108 --> 00:27:39,711
Now we have to
apply pressure here.

353
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,363
Put your hand here.
Keep the pressure on, okay?

354
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,543
We have to stop the bleeding in his
abdomen, while I stabilize the
other wounds,

355
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:47,170
so keep that pressure on him.

356
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,633
I was a medic back
in world war ii.

357
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:57,992
Multiple gunshot
wounds were common.

358
00:27:58,007 --> 00:28:01,150
You did the best you could with
what was available to you.

359
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,713
It's okay, buddy.

360
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,163
How is he?

361
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:16,980
We need to get him
to the hospital.

362
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:18,003
No, we can't move him.

363
00:28:18,017 --> 00:28:20,043
No, we need to move
him to the car now.

364
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:22,302
He's bleeding to death, okay?

365
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:23,612
I'm trying to
stabilize the wounds.

366
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:25,933
We got an ambulance on the way.
You got one guy here.

367
00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:28,780
The other guy's
in the car, okay?

368
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:37,652
Stay with us.

369
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,590
The artery in his
neck is severed.

370
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:41,982
I nene to make sure blood
is getting to his brain.

371
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:43,232
Give me your hand.

372
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:44,653
Hold your hand right there.

373
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,683
- Keep the pressure on,beth,okay?
- Okay.

374
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:49,163
Good work, buddy.
You're doing fine.

375
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:51,391
Stay with him, beth.

376
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,541
I'm so sorry.

377
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:59,380
Come on.

378
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:02,860
All right. We gotta make sure the
blood is getting to his brain.

379
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:06,482
- Hold him still.Hold him still,beth.
- Still.

380
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:10,600
That's good. That's good. Okay.

381
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:14,122
That's good.

382
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:15,751
I've got this area
mostly under control.

383
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:18,312
Now keep pressure on that abdomen there.
That's good.

384
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:19,701
You're doing a great job.

385
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:21,812
You're doing a great job,
okay? beth?

386
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:29,093
Tourniquet isn't working.

387
00:29:29,107 --> 00:29:32,021
I've got to stop the blood
flow to his femoral artery.

388
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,123
- Take your necklace off.
- What?

389
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:35,700
Just do it.

390
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,450
How do you know
what you're doing?

391
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:42,121
You learn a lot in war.
Just hold it.

392
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:46,253
You find out why some people
make it and others don'T.

393
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:49,480
This is gonna hurt him.
You hold him still.

394
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:51,651
- Be brave,buddy.
- Right.

395
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,831
Be brave.

396
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:02,620
If I can tie the necklace
around josh's artery,

397
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:04,912
I can stop the
bleeding in his leg.

398
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:07,163
You're okay. You're okay.

399
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:11,783
What... what--what day is it?

400
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:13,251
It's friday.

401
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,212
Oct-october?

402
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:18,373
No, sweetie, it's january.

403
00:30:19,437 --> 00:30:21,763
Our anniversary's in october.

404
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:23,303
I know.

405
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:27,352
You took me on our first
date on the 17th, remember?

406
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:31,532
You took me to your favorite dive bar,
the rustic inn?

407
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:34,882
Video golf.

408
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:39,353
We stayed up till
2:00 in the morning.

409
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:42,862
I've never had so much
fun my whole life.

410
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:46,732
I had to make sure you
were my kind of girl.

411
00:30:53,356 --> 00:30:55,282
The artery's clamped.

412
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:58,832
That should stop the
blood flow to the legs.

413
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,660
All this blood is taking
its toll on beth.

414
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:08,121
It's the sunlight that's
taking its toll on me.

415
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:14,483
How long on that ambulance?

416
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,353
Uh, two, maybe three minutes.

417
00:31:16,368 --> 00:31:18,490
He won't last three.

418
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:25,020
At the end of the day,
not a lot separates life and death.

419
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:25,981
He needs C. P. R.

420
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:27,062
You're gonna have
to breathe for him.

421
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,183
- Do you know how to do that?
- Yes.

422
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:29,641
Okay. Breathe now.

423
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:31,581
Two breaths. Come on.

424
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:34,343
- That's what makes it precious.
- Okay.

425
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:42,312
And breathe.

426
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:49,801
Come on, man!

427
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:52,531
Don't leave me! Josh!

428
00:31:55,536 --> 00:32:00,363
I don't hear anything--
no pulse, no circulation, nothing.

429
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:03,710
Stay with me.

430
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,931
Stay with me, josh.

431
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:09,980
You can save him.

432
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:14,573
No. I can't do that.

433
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:17,810
Yes, you can.
Turn him. He'll live.

434
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,461
That's not living, beth.

435
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:22,402
Save him, please, for me.

436
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:27,070
Please!

437
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:30,960
He's human, beth, okay?

438
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:33,083
This is what happens.

439
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:51,022
His heart stopped
45 seconds ago.

440
00:32:51,658 --> 00:32:54,022
Excuse me. Ready to ventilate.

441
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,143
Copy that. Ady y oentilate.

442
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:59,620
No pulse. He's not breathing.
I'm gonna do paddle check.

443
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:04,960
- clear.
- clear.

444
00:33:06,186 --> 00:33:07,501
Check for pulse.

445
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,230
- No pulse.
-

446
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:11,482
Defib.

447
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:19,843
I'm gonna check the pulse.
No pulse.

448
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:21,590
- Everybody clear.
- Clear.

449
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,352
Check for pulse.

450
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:27,721
Pulse... no pulse.

451
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:31,073
- Charging 360.Everybody clear?
- Clear.

452
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:40,123
I'm sorry. He's gone.

453
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:50,092
Beth.

454
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,821
Stay away from me.

455
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:30,642
Bustos ain't talking.

456
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:34,203
Huertos is in intensive care,
and tejada's probably long gone.

457
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:37,611
Give me five minutes
alone with bustos.

458
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,400
Come on, mick. I can't do that.

459
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:41,102
Risk letting this guy
walk on a technicality?

460
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:42,420
He's not gonna walk.

461
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:44,660
There's not gonna be a technicality.
I won't touch him.

462
00:34:44,678 --> 00:34:46,252
You can watch from here.

463
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:49,072
Just give me five minutes.

464
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:56,991
Alone.

465
00:34:57,877 --> 00:34:59,870
All right.
You got five minutes.

466
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:10,840
This is a waste of time.

467
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:16,310
I'm gonna ask you a question,
and you probably should answer it.

468
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:21,871
H. E. M. No canta.

469
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:48,110
Get him away! Get him away!

470
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,642
Get him away from me!

471
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:51,220
Get him away!

472
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:53,192
Tell me where to find tejada.

473
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,180
El diablo! Get him away!

474
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,163
El diablo! Get him away!

475
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:58,941
Get him away!

476
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,800
Where is Tejada

477
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:04,610
whatever he's doing,
it's working.

478
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:06,260
Last time.

479
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:09,931
Where is he?
answer my question.

480
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,660
He's at the--
he's at the hollenback bar...

481
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,643
Near chatsworth.

482
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:23,922
What happened?

483
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:28,942
He's holed up at the compos
bar in boyle heights.

484
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:31,872
Compos bar Boyle heights?

485
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:33,792
Good work.

486
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:39,313
I hated lying to
carl like that,

487
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:43,222
but tejada had eluded the legal system
enough, and I had a score to settle.

488
00:36:43,706 --> 00:36:45,711
Tejada made this personal.

489
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:50,933
When it comes to revenge and vampires,
blood is vengeance.

490
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,331
Where's tejada?

491
00:37:19,346 --> 00:37:20,992
No s?

492
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:38,503
And then there's the part in every bar
scene where the bartender pulls
out shotgun.

493
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,483
Right on cue.

494
00:37:43,498 --> 00:37:45,053
You missed me.

495
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:53,010
I see them staring at
me like I'm inhuman.

496
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:55,721
Those looks used to bother me.

497
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:57,301
Not now.

498
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,051
Where's tejada?

499
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:03,341
In his office

500
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,983
tejada.

501
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:20,292
What? You come to my place.

502
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:22,481
You come to my place
and spill blood.

503
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:25,983
Big mistake,
'cause now I'll have your blood.

504
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:17,492
Gonna answer that?

505
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:21,003
I don't wanna talk to anyone.

506
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:24,922
Please, could you just leave?

507
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:26,202
Just give me a minute.

508
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:29,433
I know you're angry that I didn't
turn josh, but I didn't kill him.

509
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:30,652
Huerta killed him.

510
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,522
Tejada killed him.

511
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,500
Beth...

512
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:37,952
His job killed him.

513
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:42,141
You can't blame me
for him being gone.

514
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:46,370
Turning someone into a vampire isn't
saving a life. It's taking one.

515
00:39:46,388 --> 00:39:48,540
Because it's such a curse.
I know.

516
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:49,703
You tell me all the time.

517
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:50,753
You don't know.

518
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,833
Beth, how could you know?

519
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:57,293
If you hate what you are so much,
then why do you go on living?

520
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,633
You make me want to.

521
00:40:05,828 --> 00:40:07,842
I'm not really sure.

522
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:10,500
I'm not really sure.

523
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:14,862
I did a lot of bad things
after I was turned, beth--

524
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:20,630
things that you could never imagine,
things I carry tremendous amounts of
guilt about.

525
00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:25,271
I wanna make up for them.

526
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,800
Beth?

527
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:33,893
I just can't stop
thinking about him.

528
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:38,610
If--if you'd have done it,
he'd still be here.

529
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:43,190
What if it were me lying there
instead of josh, seconds before death?

530
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:45,612
Would you have saved me?

531
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:50,720
Would you have saved me?

532
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:56,242
I would have done
the same thing.

533
00:41:04,655 --> 00:41:09,001
She asked me something I've
asked myself over and over again.

534
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:12,960
The truth is,
I don't know what I would do.

535
00:41:14,697 --> 00:41:19,130
What I do know is, at the end of the
day, not a lot separates life
and death--

536
00:41:20,215 --> 00:41:24,053
only one thing... Eternity.
