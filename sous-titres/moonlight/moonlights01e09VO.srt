1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,500
<i>Previously on "moonlight"...</i>

2
00:00:02,854 --> 00:00:04,512
I saw coraline
last night.

3
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:06,645
You look just like
someone i used to know.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,708
- Ex-Girlfriend, maybe?
- Ex-Wife.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,437
Coraline is dead.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,250
You saw her die with your own eyes.

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,395
I was kidnapped when i was 4.

8
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,770
I don't remember much.

9
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:19,388
But the man who rescued me--
He was fearless.

10
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,013
As long as i was in his arms,
i knew i was safe.

11
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:25,617
I know who saved me
when i was a little girl.

12
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:27,912
I found my guardian angel.

13
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:33,464
<i>Memories can be fragile...</i>

14
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:38,673
Mick!

15
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:42,589
Mick!

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,569
<i>Fleeting as a whisper
one moment,</i>

17
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,957
<i>Powerful as a scream the next.</i>

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,457
I got the proof.

19
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:52,103
She's been lying to us,
stalking us.

20
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,395
Morgan is coraline.

21
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,061
- I know she is.
- You know?

22
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,367
<i>I spent so long
hiding from my past...</i>

23
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:00,867
Hi, beth.

24
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:02,313
<i>Ignoring the whispers.</i>

25
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:05,033
How could you?

26
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:06,783
This is not what you think.

27
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:09,742
<i>But i remember everything now.</i>

28
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:12,992
<i>And the screams are
the only thing i can hear.</i>

29
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:29,123
Hey.

30
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,436
- I got your message.
- Get in.

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,102
You want to tell me
what you're doing here?

32
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:36,040
Get in.

33
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:50,595
Ok

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,679
Does it seem ?? To you?

35
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:56,359
Morgan is quite the exhibition here, isn't she?

36
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:02,338
See? I got your attention.

37
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:06,498
So tell me about her.

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,289
Who?

39
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,373
Your ex-Wife.

40
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:12,310
What do you want to know?

41
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:15,039
Well, we got time, so whdon'mo
n' you start from the beginning?

42
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:17,127
Hñt1 how did she
become a

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,143
Raline was turned
in the early 1700s in france.

44
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:22,789
- She was a courtesan.
- Oh, she was a hooker.

45
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:25,294
No, more like a friend
of the court.

46
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,720
- She's still got the moves.
- Beth, that's not her.

47
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,595
- Was the sex good?
- You understand that, right?

48
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:31,895
So you were on and off
for, like, 33 years.

49
00:02:31,962 --> 00:02:33,407
Was it the sex that
kept you coming back?

50
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:34,365
What is this?

51
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,379
She kidnapped me
when i was 4--

52
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,837
Took me from my bed,

53
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,067
Terrorized me,

54
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,233
Almost killed me.

55
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,379
<i>Yeah, coraline did that,</i>

56
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,862
Not the woman that you
are currently stalking.

57
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,025
You're sure, 100%?

58
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:49,046
No room for doubt?

59
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,205
Get down. Get down.

60
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,906
Look, if that's the same woman
who destroyed my childhood,

61
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,027
I've gotta know.

62
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:08,240
Are you telling me
you can't understand that?

63
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,344
All right.
What do you want me to do?

64
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,552
If coraline reinvented
herself as morgan,

65
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,677
There must be something
she forgot to cover up,

66
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:17,837
Some piece of evidence
left behind.

67
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:20,695
<i>You're the one who told me
that her story checked out.</i>

68
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,253
On the surface.

69
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:24,170
But now i want to dig deeper.

70
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,358
You've got
to keep her occupied.

71
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,962
How am i supposed to do that?

72
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:29,483
Just turn on
the mick st. John charm.

73
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:31,767
What girl could resist?

74
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:35,225
All right, listen to me.

75
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:37,475
<i>If morgan is coraline--</i>

76
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,642
<i>And i'm not saying she is--
If--</i>

77
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,127
And she realizes
that you suspect her,

78
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,996
I don't know what she'll do.

79
00:03:45,802 --> 00:03:46,962
I'll be careful.

80
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:49,510
But one way or another,

81
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:51,927
I will finally find out the truth.

82
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:53,781
We both will.

86
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:19,766
Pretty.

87
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,661
My wife tina.

88
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:24,996
I want you to follow her.

89
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:27,863
I want to know where she goes
and who she sees.

90
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,843
So what makes you think
she's cheating on you?

91
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:33,363
I didn't say she was.

92
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:35,634
I've been doing this job
for a while now, mr. Haggans.

93
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,197
A man wants his wife followed,

94
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,093
He thinks
she's having an affair.

95
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:41,044
Tina's my second wife,

96
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,898
Obviously much younger.

97
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:46,898
I've given her
financial stability,
social status,

98
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:49,815
And what i expect in return is fidelity.

99
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,981
Lately, she's been distant,
secretive.

100
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:54,641
If she were an employee,

101
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:57,557
I'd suspect that she was
interviewing for another job.

102
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:00,453
But she's not an employee.
She's your wife.

103
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,307
Principle's the same.

104
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:05,557
I'm the c.E.O.
Of a forbes 500 company.

105
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,425
If my trophy wife
is stepping out,

106
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,029
I want to know about it before
my board of directors does,

107
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:13,529
And i want someone
with no ties to me

108
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,592
To be looking into it.

109
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,571
$25,000 now,

110
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,606
Another $25,000
upon delivery

111
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:24,772
Of all audio
and photo surveillance.

112
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:27,564
I know a photographer who will
be perfect for this job.

113
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,522
I hope he knows how
to keep his mouth shut.

114
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:31,668
You're the only person
that knows about this.

115
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,772
<i>Anything shows up
on the internet,</i>

116
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:34,807
I'll know who leaked it,

117
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,932
And there will be
severe consequences.

118
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:38,598
Do i make myself clear?

119
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:42,411
Crystal.

120
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:45,026
She's leaving my office building
on bunker hill today

121
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:46,807
Around 1:00 p.M.

122
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,633
Just one more question,
mr. Haggans.

123
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:54,341
You obviously
don't trust your wife.

124
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,237
Do you love her?

125
00:05:58,404 --> 00:06:00,383
I own her, mr. St. John.

126
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,633
That's all you need to know.

127
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:18,160
I wasn't sure
that you'd show up.

128
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:19,556
Yeah, me either.

129
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,410
You'll notice i chose
a public place.

130
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:29,452
You're buying, right?

131
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,736
Yes, of course.

132
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:31,778
Ready to order?

133
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,549
I'm gonna have
the carpaccio plate

134
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:36,945
With some french fries
and, um,

135
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:40,292
This burgundy here--
The romanée-Conti richbourg.

136
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,299
Excellent choice.
And for you, sir?

137
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,813
Oh, nothing for me.

138
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,250
I'm on a special diet.

139
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,771
Yeah, you and everybody else
in this town.

140
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,542
Body image freaks.

141
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,118
Okay, so if you're not
here to break bread,

142
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,451
Then what's this about?

143
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:59,264
I want to apologize.

144
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:00,743
I would think so.

145
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:03,285
The other night,
i was completely out of line.

146
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:04,535
That's an understatement.

147
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:07,639
There's absolutely no excuse
for the way i acted.

148
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,139
Now are you talking about when
you ripped off my clothes

149
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,923
Or threw me to the ground

150
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,194
Or just generally
scaring the crap out of me--

151
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:15,152
Which one?

152
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,257
Pretty much all of the above.

153
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:20,626
It's just you look so much...

154
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:23,007
Like someone i know...

155
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:24,902
<i>Knew...
a long time ago.</i>

156
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,520
If that's the way that
you acted towards her, too,

157
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:29,249
I gather it didn't end
very well.

158
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,291
No. No, it didn't.

159
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,333
But i want
to make it up to you.

160
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:37,645
I have a surveillance case.
I need a photographer.

161
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:40,201
It's gonna be $10,000
for a couple of days' work.

162
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:41,451
$10,000?$1

163
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:42,826
Yeah.

164
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:44,992
The romanée-Conti richbourg.

165
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:46,680
Apology accepted.

166
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,443
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

167
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,318
French fry?

168
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:53,777
No, thanks.

169
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,964
You sure?

170
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:57,256
Why don't you
enjoy them for me?

171
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,027
So what's this case about?

172
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,464
Husband thinks his wife's
having an affair.

173
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:03,131
He wants proof
before he confronts her.

174
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,006
Sordid.

175
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,415
You can't always judge.

176
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,249
No, i meant that
in a good way.

177
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:15,853
About this, um, ex-Girlfriend
that i remind you so much of,

178
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,165
What happened?

179
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,804
Did she cheat on you or--

180
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,200
Ex-Wife, actually,

181
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:22,367
And, no, fidelity
wasn't our problem.

182
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:25,825
It was just
a very complicated relationship.

183
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:27,783
It's probably best
if we leave it there.

184
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,026
That sounds like a story.

185
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,380
So do you want
the job or not?

186
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:36,339
Let me see--
$10,000 to follow people around

187
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,276
And take picture
of them having sex?

188
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:40,922
I'm in.

189
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:54,956
<i>Digging into a person's
background these days d</i>

190
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:56,292
<i>Is pretty simple--</i>

191
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:58,859
<i>Google search here,
credit check there...</i>

192
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,637
Morgan took the job. She'll be
with me the rest of the day.

193
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:09,324
<i>But when
thground goes back</i>

194
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:11,283
<i>More than 300 years...</i>

195
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:16,150
<i>Journalism 101--
Begin at the beginning.</i>

196
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,255
<i>Go back
to where it all started.</i>

197
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:25,546
No!

198
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,859
No!

199
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,178
What's that?

200
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,171
Oh, um, a fleur-De-Lis.

201
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:58,879
Did you know
that french courtesans

202
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,066
Were branded with them
back in the 18th century?

203
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:03,150
It's like a permanent
scarlet letter.

204
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:06,004
Oh, does this have something
to do with paris hilton?

205
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:08,296
Uh... no.

206
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,163
Oh, then i don't care.

207
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,288
Do you have a story you're working on?

208
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,393
I do, actually. I'm off
to do some research now.

209
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:16,934
Bring me something sexy
that i can lead with.

210
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,955
Sex, betrayal, murder--

211
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:22,080
This one's got it all.

212
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:30,365
Oh, she's pretty.

213
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,212
But for 6 grand ?? A new model

214
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:36,274
There's a lot of people around,
h t of cell phones.

215
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:37,670
That means a lot
of interference.

216
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:40,878
I'm gonna have to stay close if
haggans wants all this on tape.

217
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:44,003
I'll keep moving
and try to get clean shots.

218
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,607
Okay. This is for you.
Keep the line open.

219
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,986
You let me know if you see
anything that i don't, okay?

220
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,579
This is so "bourne identity."
I love it.

221
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:54,267
Okay.

222
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,114
Target entering plaza
from northeast corner.

223
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:13,656
I'm on her.

224
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:27,898
I think we got something.

225
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,086
I see him.

226
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,162
... we take a walk

227
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:39,266
What are they saying?

228
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,391
There's too much interference.
I'm gonna have to get closer.

229
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,669
Ok. So i know you're going
to the office tonight,

230
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:07,023
Look don't worry. I've got it all worked out.

231
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:09,370
I don't know. Sometimes i feel
like we waited too long.

232
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:12,578
No, baby, i told you.
No one else knows. It's just us.

233
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,036
How can you be sure
that he doesn't kn?

234
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:19,411
What?

235
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,508
Move. She sees you.Mick!

236
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:28,446
What's matter?
What is it?

237
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:31,029
Nothing. I'm just being paranoid.

238
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:38,050
??

239
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,418
???

240
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:51,460
??

241
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,501
What are they saying?

242
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,057
The microphone's
not picking up anything.

243
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,140
That was the money shot.

244
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:06,008
<i>All right, you go.</i>

245
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:09,279
<i>Listen, when you go home,
act natural...</i>

246
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,508
<i>All right? If he finds out...
i know...</i>

247
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,029
<i>He'll kill us.</i>

248
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,237
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

249
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,612
Mick, i got it.

250
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:20,341
It's full frame,l he kiss.

251
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:22,188
I'm amazing.

252
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,896
What's your problem?We can go up to haggans
right now with this photo.

253
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,688
It'll be, like,
the easiest 10 grand ever.

254
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,105
Yeah, i don't think
we should do that.

255
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:28,834
Why?

256
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,230
I just heard tina say that haggen's gonna kill her.

257
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:42,098
<i>I know you're going
to the office tonight.</i>

258
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,473
<i>But what about me?
</i>

259
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:45,848
Look, don't worry.
I've got it all worked out.

260
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:48,715
You know, after the kiss i heard
what tina and owen were saying.

261
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:51,070
Wow, you were right
about the interference.

262
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,549
<i>-Cell phones,traffic noise...
- Don't worry. I've got it all worked out.</i>

263
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,549
- It's gonna take a while to sort this out.
- No one else knows.It's just us.

264
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,632
<i>How can you be sure
that he doesn't know?
</i>

265
00:13:58,674 --> 00:13:59,861
'Cause i know him.

266
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,070
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

267
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,708
<i>It was right around here.</i>

268
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:06,812
Talk to you later.

269
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,312
<i>When you go home,
act natural.</i>

270
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:17,534
<i>I heard it. I heard it.</i>

271
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:20,076
The man said,
"but if he finds out,"

272
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:22,576
And then tina responded,
"you know he'll kill us."

273
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,555
I swear to you i heard it.

274
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,451
I mean, it could be
a figure of speech, you know?

275
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,111
Like "i'd kill
for a burger right now."

276
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:29,276
You're not gonna really kill somebody for the hamburger.

277
00:14:29,277 --> 00:14:30,506
Well, it didn't sound
like that to me.

278
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,110
And you're sure
it was them talking?

279
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,111
I'm positive.

280
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:35,402
Maybe the mike missed it.

281
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:37,111
And you think your ears
can pick up something

282
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:41,006
- That a $5,000 digital unidirectional
microphone can't? - Look

283
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,374
What if haggans
isn't thinking about divorce?

284
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,395
What if he's actually
gonna use this evidence

285
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:47,999
As an excuse
to murder his wife?

286
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,645
Wouldn't divorce be easier?

287
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,603
Yeah, and it'd also
be more public.

288
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,437
Haggans doesn't strike me
as the kind of man

289
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,374
Who wants his personal life
on display.

290
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:57,763
Well, you met him.
Does he strike you
as the kind of man

291
00:14:57,805 --> 00:14:59,305
That would be capable
of murder?

292
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:01,263
Anybody is capable
of murder...

293
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,555
G-Given
the right circumstances.

294
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:15,506
Haggans hired you
to get information.

295
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,110
You're not responsible
for what he does with it, okay?

296
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,610
I'm not gonna get
those people killed.

297
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,152
No info, no paycheck.

298
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:23,547
Alright. I'll talk
to haggans again, okay?

299
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:25,769
Are you gonna ask him if he's
planning on murdering his wife?

300
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:26,769
You know what?

301
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:28,894
I might try something
a little more subtle than that.

302
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:34,519
Well, on the way we can
stop by "buzzwire."

303
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,436
I'm friendly with one
of the sound guys,

304
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:40,179
And maybe he can help us
clean up some of this audio.

305
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:44,262
<i>I had a boyfriend in college</i>

306
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,866
<i>Who taught me
how to pick locks.</i>

307
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:47,700
<i>Thought it was
a cool party trick.</i>

308
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:51,325
<i>He also taught me how
to chug a beer in one gulp.</i>

309
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:54,963
<i>Not really as useful
as an adult.</i>

310
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:59,109
<i>It's one thing to be
in someone's space</i>

311
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,463
<i>When they invite you in.</i>

312
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:03,025
<i>They make the bed,
clean the dishes,</i>

313
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,459
<i>Hide the bong.</i>

314
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,894
<i>! T when they're
not expecting company,</i>

315
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:11,060
<i>That's when you see
how someone really lives.</i>

316
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:18,081
<i>Let's w morgan
really lives.</i>

317
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:39,379
I need to see mr. Haggans.

318
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:41,004
Mr. Haggans isn't here.

319
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:43,775
I can see him.

320
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,692
Well, yes,
he's here technically,

321
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,435
But i've been given strict
orders not to disturb him.

322
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:49,685
Okay, why don't you just tell him
mick st. John is here to see him?

323
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:52,247
When mr. Haggans gives me an order,
i take it very seriously.

324
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:55,851
You tell him,
or i'm gonna tell him myself.

325
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:06,092
What is it about "i don't
want to be disturbed"...

326
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,462
Mr. Haggans wants to know

327
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,129
If you have the surveillance
he requested.

328
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,754
If so, i've been instructed
to give you your final payment.

329
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:27,976
I'm not giving the surveillance
to anybody but mr. Haggans...personally.

330
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,601
You tell your boss
when he's ready to see me,

331
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:39,726
He can have his surveillance--
Not before.

332
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:45,758
How'd that go?

333
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:47,031
Haggans wouldn't see me.

334
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:49,156
Okay. It doesn't mean
he's a murderer, though.

335
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,052
Doesn't mean he's not.

336
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:52,135
I'm gonna keep following tina
until we know for sure.

337
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:58,579
Biltmore hotel, room 713.
One hour.

338
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:01,516
We should follow them.

339
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,537
They're gonna be
at the biltmore in an hour.

340
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,530
Wait.
How did you know that?

341
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,030
Trust me.

342
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,696
<i>Don't know what
i was expecting to find.</i>

343
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,491
<i>Impressive shoes, though...</i>

344
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,524
<i>Prada, y3, manolos...</i>

345
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:21,439
<i>I'm in the wrong line of work.</i>

346
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:24,252
<i>Guess immortals
don't shop at shoe barn.</i>

347
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:33,328
On our way to morgan's loft? Where are you?

348
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:38,161
I know i know

349
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:39,640
It just only takes one minute

350
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,203
Or maybe just 2 minutes

351
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,786
I have one thing i ...

352
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,654
I have the perfect rig
for this...

353
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:53,946
And a long lens that'll
pick up a bead of sweat

354
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:55,217
From, like, a hundred yards.

355
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:57,092
You're enjoying this
way too much.

356
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:58,084
You know that, right?

357
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:02,325
Beth?

358
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,564
Hi.

359
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,022
Did you say something?

360
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:10,980
Yeah, i said,
come on, hurry up. Let's go!

361
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:12,439
Okay. I'm just...

362
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:15,890
Just making sure i...
have everything.

363
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:17,702
Always something...

364
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,327
Are you okay?

365
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:25,098
What you've got is good.
We don't have much time.

366
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,945
Come on, we don't want
to miss anything. Let's go.

367
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,903
Wow. Someone's sure
getting into the spirit.

368
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:57,035
I still don't know how you heard
them talking about this.

369
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,058
You must have ears
like a bat.

370
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:01,725
Uh, not like a bat,
exactly.

371
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,222
You know what? Be grateful.

372
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:06,424
I used to date a lot of musicians,
and after a few years on stage,

373
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,528
They're just, like,
deaf as doornails.

374
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:11,459
- Musicians, huh?
- Yeah.

375
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:17,591
Hey.

376
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:19,403
Hey, can you talk?

377
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:22,459
Not really. Where are you?

378
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:24,858
Still at morgan's.
That was close.

379
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,875
Yeah, it was way too close.

380
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:34,646
Oh, hurry up. The clothes are
starting to hit the floor.

381
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:37,292
<i>Where are you?</i>

382
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,409
I'm at a hotel.

383
00:21:38,451 --> 00:21:40,076
Whose clothes
are hitting the floor?

384
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:41,659
You know something?I -I uh

385
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,951
I can't really
get into this right now.

386
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,858
Oh!
My god, this is gonna be hot!

387
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:48,423
Seriously,
what are you guys doing?

388
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:49,819
We're working the case.

389
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,292
Sounds like you're
working something.

390
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,402
You have to hurry up or i'm
just gonna start without you,

391
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:55,215
- 'Cause this is hot.
- Mick!

392
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:59,569
I gotta go. I...
i gotta go.

393
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:25,138
Mick?

394
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:37,672
Are they saying anything?

395
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:41,691
Not unless they're using deep
breathing and moaning as code.

396
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:43,725
<i>Listen to this.</i>

397
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,700
<i>What would your father
think about this?</i>

398
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,179
<i>You're his wife.
Ask him yourself.</i>

399
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:14,058
Haggans' wife is having
an affair with his son--

400
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,758
Her stepson.

401
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:18,651
<i>Like that wouldn't be
the final nail in our coffin.</i>

402
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:20,151
That's kinky...

403
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:23,005
And a pretty good motive
for murder.

404
00:23:24,484 --> 00:23:25,624
Yeah.

405
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:27,414
Yeah.

406
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:40,303
Hey!

407
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,032
Hey!

408
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:46,991
Hey!

409
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:48,157
How's thcase going?

410
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:50,136
There's nothing like spending the
afternoon

411
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,442
Cuddled up in a hotel room
watching family members gettin' it on.

412
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:57,379
They're--They're not even actually
related biologically, so...

413
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:59,192
It was like pay-Per-View,
but more hair.

414
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:00,546
Do you want to see
their photos? They're so hot.

415
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:02,983
I think--No.
They're confidential.

416
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,060
You're not blushing right now,
but i think you're actually embarrassed.

417
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:08,580
You're so cute.
You're so old-Shioned.

418
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,039
No, i'm not.

419
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,747
You weren't so shy
when it was happening.

420
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:14,935
You weren't so shy
when it was happening.

421
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,789
Seems like you make
quite the team.

422
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:19,448
I was thinking maybe we could make this
a permanent arrangement.

423
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:20,615
I tend to work alone.

424
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,302
I mean, there's gotta be
something for beth to do, right?

425
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,094
We could make it
a threesome or something.

426
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:28,073
I would love that, but i've got
my own investigation going on--

427
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,490
Research on this new story.

428
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,469
You know maureen--Relentless.

429
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:35,337
But, um...
you two have fun.

430
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:37,295
Hey, listen, beth,

431
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:40,837
Morgan and i are gonna be
here for a couple of hours.

432
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,795
So, uh, maybe, uh, maybe i'll
see you when you get back.

433
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:44,857
Maybe.

434
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,663
I'll call you
when i'm wrapping up.

435
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:56,226
Hey.

436
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,283
About what happened
at the hotel...

437
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:00,392
Which part?

438
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:01,996
The kiss.

439
00:25:02,843 --> 00:25:04,177
That was nice, huh?

440
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,468
Well, sure, but...

441
00:25:07,177 --> 00:25:09,302
Don't be all weird.

442
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:11,343
It was--
Doesn't mean anything.

443
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,086
Unless you want it to.

444
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:15,940
No. Of course not. I mean...

445
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:19,149
Oh, i get it.
You don't want me to tell beth.

446
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:21,586
You've got it bad for her,
don't you?

447
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:24,420
Which i gotta say,
i don't think she's your type.

448
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,586
- Really?
- Uh-Huh.

449
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:27,329
Well, what do you
think my type is?

450
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:29,017
Well, that would be me...

451
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:32,454
Looking so much like
the ex and all.

452
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:43,739
Mick st. John.

453
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:45,676
This is mr. Haggans' assistant.

454
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:47,092
Mr. Haggans wants to know if you're ready

455
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:48,759
To hand over the materials he requested.

456
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:51,447
Well, that depends.
Is he ready to meet with me?

457
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,239
<i>Mr. Haggans will meet with you
if you have the surveillance.</i>

458
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:58,252
Okay, you tell him one hour,
the ca va restaurant.

459
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:01,606
We can discuss my terms of
handing over the surveillance.

460
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:05,231
You're meeting
with haggans?

461
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:09,606
Maybe i can find out if he suspects
that his son is the one involved with tina.

462
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,828
I'm taking everything back to my office
on my way to the restaurant.

463
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,599
I'm not giving haggans anything
until i know what he's up to.

464
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:18,203
Let me have your memory card.

465
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,842
Well, this is unexpected.

466
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:39,481
Thank you.

467
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:41,710
Sell that.

468
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,397
I need to talk to you
about mick.

469
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:50,585
I know you're his friend.

470
00:26:50,627 --> 00:26:51,744
Is he in trouble?

471
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:53,786
I don't know.
I think so.

472
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,953
It's his ex-Wife coraline.

473
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:06,466
Coraline died
a long time ago.

474
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:07,862
I don't think she did.

475
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:10,446
I think she survived
and became human

476
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:13,716
And is masquerading
as morgan vincent.

477
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,105
I don't know what mick
has told you about me.

478
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:23,918
Not much, but i know
you're a... vampire,

479
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:25,480
Vampire

480
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,897
And i know he trusts you.

481
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:30,813
And what do you want?

482
00:27:36,473 --> 00:27:37,598
The truth.

483
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,973
I'm sorry, sir,but you can't
just keep sitting here

484
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:46,348
Without ordering something.

485
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,903
I'm waiting for someone.
Have a sandwich while you wait.

486
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:50,820
- No, thank you.
- Something off the dessert menu?

487
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:51,924
I'm not hungry.

488
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:53,903
Then why do you keep meeting people at restaurants?

489
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,299
Fine, but at this point,
maybe you should consider...?

490
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:58,841
Your date's not showing.

491
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:19,243
How did it go with haggans?

492
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,035
He never showed.
He never intended to.

493
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:23,160
It was a ruse to get me
out of my office

494
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,722
So he could steal
the surveillance!

495
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:26,514
Well, let's go to his office
and confront him then.

496
00:28:26,548 --> 00:28:28,444
No. I have to get
to haggans' son.

497
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,548
Haggans now knows about
his relationship with tina.

498
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:34,173
All right. I'm gonna look up
his address for you right now.

499
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:35,215
Let's see...

500
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,528
All right, here we go.
Owen haggans...

501
00:28:39,673 --> 00:28:41,854
- "22 wedgewood lane, bel air."
- I'm on my way.

502
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,729
- Be careful.
- Yeah, yeah.

503
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:45,666
Thought you were
a photographer.

504
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:48,250
Yeah, i am.
You can still think that.

505
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,979
Then why did
one of my sound guys

506
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,659
Give me this jump drive
to give to you?

507
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:54,847
Because i asked him
to clean up some audio for me.

508
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:56,159
That's why.

509
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,555
What story is this for?

510
00:28:58,597 --> 00:29:00,992
It's, uh, it's still
in the concept stages,

511
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,680
But i think you're
really gonna love it.
Mm.

512
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,381
I met morgan.

513
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:14,589
And sure, she looks like
coraline--

514
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:16,256
A lot like coraline.

515
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,589
But it's not her.

516
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,131
Morgan is not a vampire.

517
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:23,395
What if coraline found a way
to become human again?

518
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,353
Oy. First mick, now you.

519
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:29,270
There is no cure for vampirism--
No magic pill,

520
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,624
No click your ruby slippers
together

521
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:33,041
And rejoin the mortal coil.

522
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:35,374
Becoming a vampire
is a one-Way street.

523
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,700
There has to be a way.
I think mick--

524
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,929
Look,
when it comes to coraline,

525
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:40,658
Mick doesn't think
with his big head.

526
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:42,867
You have to understand,

527
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,054
Mick and coraline's relationship

528
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:48,304
Was one of those terrifying,
completely self-Destructive freak shows

529
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:49,901
That you spend
your whole life searching for

530
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:52,693
Knowing it can only end
in one or both of you dead.

531
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:55,255
That's your idea of love?

532
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:57,443
What can i tell you?
I'm a romantic.

533
00:29:59,026 --> 00:30:00,809
This was coraline's house
in hollywood,

534
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:02,309
<i>Where they first met.</i>

535
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,457
Yeah, it was quite
the scene back then.

536
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:06,207
She could really
throw a party.

537
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,977
So you knew her?

538
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,582
Met her for the first time
in new york.

539
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:11,510
Lincoln was president.

540
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:14,165
Mick said she was
a courtesan.

541
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:15,054
Yeah?

542
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,991
Well, coraline was a lot
of things to a lot of people--

543
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:20,679
- Most of them men.
- But mick was different?

544
00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:23,887
<i>Yeah.
She wanted him and got him...</i>

545
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:26,574
<i>And then really
worked him over.</i>

546
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:29,076
<i>But eventually,
the crazy got to be too much,</i>

547
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:30,908
<i>And mick wanted out.</i>

548
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:32,192
<i>You know, he'd break it off,</i>

549
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:34,817
<i>But, uh, coraline was
like a bad drug habit.</i>

550
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:36,338
<i>He kept going back to her.</i>

551
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,109
Until she took me?

552
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,734
Mick couldn't stand the thought
of a child dying because of him.

553
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,076
<i>Finally, one happy family.</i>

554
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,176
<i>It was too much.</i>

555
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,893
<i>It gave him the strength
to break away once and for all.</i>

556
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,909
<i>I remember the fire.</i>

557
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,511
<i>I watched her burn.</i>

558
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,171
I haven't been able
to ask mick this.

559
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:16,842
I know he feels guilty enough
as it is,

560
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:20,650
But why did coraline
choose me?

561
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:24,476
Maybe she thought she could
put a little family together and settle down,

562
00:31:24,747 --> 00:31:27,289
Like the woman who gets pregnant
to save a bad marriage.

563
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:29,851
Why you specifically?
You were probably

564
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:31,705
Just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

565
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,289
But it didn't work.
She didn't get him back.

566
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,122
Look, i think you know mick
better than that.

567
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:39,309
And you knew coraline
for a long time.

568
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:42,490
So if she is back,
what does she want?

569
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:44,427
If coraline is back,

570
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:45,927
And that's a big "if,"

571
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,490
She's back for mick.

572
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,503
<i>I made up my mind</i>

573
00:31:54,524 --> 00:31:56,962
<i>To see coraline's party house
for myself.</i>

574
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:59,191
<i>It's one thing
to want to know the truth,</i>

575
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,795
<i>It's another
to confront it head-On.</i>

576
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:04,774
<i>My mind has spent so long
trying to protect me...</i>

577
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:08,538
<i>Shieldg me
from what happened.</i>

578
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:12,413
<i>It was the only way
i could feel safe.</i>

579
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:17,371
<i>Even now, something inside me
is screaming "stop,"</i>

580
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:20,309
<i>But i can't,</i>

581
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,675
<i>And i'm beginning to wonder
if i'll ever feel safe again.</i>

582
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:02,238
Yeah?

583
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,634
My name's mick st. John.

584
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:06,113
I'm a private investigator
hired by your father.

585
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:09,572
Come on in.

586
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,134
Thanks.

587
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:15,690
<i>I told you.
No one else knows, just us.</i>

588
00:33:18,023 --> 00:33:20,565
<i>Hey, listen. When you
go home, act natural, okay?</i>

589
00:33:20,606 --> 00:33:21,419
<i>It's planned out,</i>

590
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,606
<i>But if he finds out
we're trying to kill him--</i>

591
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:27,356
<i>Hey, listen.
When you go home, act natural.</i>

592
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:29,453
<i>It's planned out,
but if he finds out</i>

593
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:31,182
<i>- We're trying to kill him...
- I know.</i>

594
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:32,620
<i>
He'll kill us first.</i>

595
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:38,682
So, uh, why would my fathe
hire a private investigator?

596
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:40,037
To follow tina.

597
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:42,099
He suspected
she was having an affair,

598
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,467
But he didn't know with whom.

599
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:00,481
It was you?

600
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:02,481
You broke into my office?

601
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:17,244
We can't take the chance
that anyone else knows.

602
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,775
We'll never get to my father
if he suspects.

603
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,328
So we kill him tonight.

604
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,084
Mick?

605
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:54,369
Mick?

606
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,139
Come on. Pick up, mick.

607
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:22,313
Mick.

608
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:24,313
Here.

609
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,313
Oh, my god.

610
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:34,264
They must have hit me
from behind.

611
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:36,535
Oh, my god. Here.

612
00:35:40,243 --> 00:35:41,442
Thank you.

613
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:44,160
All right, let's get you
to a hospital.

614
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,118
No, no, i'm fine.
It's just a scalp laceration.

615
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:49,111
They're always worse
than they look.

616
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:50,111
What?

617
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,809
Uh, look, they look worse
than they are.

618
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,402
That's what i meant.

619
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:57,382
Haggans wasn't the one
planning the murder.

620
00:35:58,465 --> 00:35:59,611
I know that.

621
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:01,749
Haggans
is the intended victim.

622
00:36:02,604 --> 00:36:05,166
They're going after haggans now.
We have to get to him first.

623
00:36:36,173 --> 00:36:37,318
Oh, my god.

624
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:53,332
Hi, honey.

625
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,346
It's okay.

626
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,825
You have to go to bed now,
okay?

627
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:07,679
<i>There, there.</i>

628
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:13,005
<i>This is the she kept me,
alone,</i>

629
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:15,484
<i>Locked in this room,</i>

630
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,818
<i>Waiting to bring me
to the cabin to meet mick,</i>

631
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:22,359
<i>To lure him back.</i>

632
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,142
<i>To make us a family
in her deranged mind.</i>

633
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,498
Okay, there we go.

634
00:37:33,623 --> 00:37:35,977
You need to get some sleep
tonight. You know why?

635
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,616
Because tomorrow's a big day.

636
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:39,762
You're gonna meet
your new daddy tomorrow.

637
00:37:40,262 --> 00:37:42,762
<i>I'm gonna take you
to meet your new daddy.</i>

638
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,893
Hey.

639
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,060
- Mr. Haggans isn't here.
- Where is he?

640
00:38:14,102 --> 00:38:15,824
- Gone for the day.
- Where'd he go?

641
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,782
I'm not at liberty to say.

642
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:19,532
Tell me where haggans is,

643
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:21,553
Or you better hope this job
has a good dental plan.

644
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:24,344
He just left two minutes ago
with his son.

645
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:40,712
You take the elevator.

646
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:54,184
Tina's waiting in the car
for us.

647
00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:56,184
You're not gonna tell me what
the plan is, where we're going?

648
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:58,365
No. Come on, dad.
You'll ruin the surprise.

649
00:39:00,865 --> 00:39:01,969
Surprise.

650
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:04,323
Mr. St. John.

651
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:07,177
Hey! What the hell are you--
That's my son!

652
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,656
Yeah, it's your son.
That's also your wife's lover.

653
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,649
These two have been conspiring
to kill you.

654
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:13,878
That's impossible.

655
00:39:15,816 --> 00:39:17,649
Call the police.
Now! Now!

656
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,295
Morgan!

657
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:36,496
Holy crap.

658
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,309
What was that?

659
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:41,468
And they said jordan
had air.

660
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,885
The son and the stepmom
have an affair,

661
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,468
Conspire to kill
the husband/father?

662
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,197
They probably figured
with him out of the way,

663
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,482
They could have both the company
and each other.

664
00:39:54,523 --> 00:39:55,919
Remind me to have kids.

665
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:59,003
Listen, haggans' assistant,
a guy named tucker,

666
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:01,190
Lured me out of my office
for owen.

667
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,961
- He had to have been working with him.
- I'll send a car.

668
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:06,086
You do have evidence
to back all this up?

669
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:07,294
Audio and visual.

670
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,391
We're gonna need
those photographs.

671
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:12,766
Morgan.

672
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:15,891
Sorry.

673
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:19,308
Sorry. I'm just still
a little freaked out.

674
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:23,280
I've never been
almost killed.

675
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,551
You got everything
you need?

676
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:31,551
Yeah. Go home
and get cleaned up.

677
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:33,863
You can bring everything
down to the station tomorrow.

678
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:36,273
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

679
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,432
Do you want something,
mick?

680
00:41:53,987 --> 00:41:55,029
Coraline.

681
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:56,591
Coraline.

682
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,459
Are you really surprised?

683
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:04,167
How many clues
did i have to give you?

684
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,001
The proust book,
our old song.

685
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,459
I even ordered
my favorite glass of wine.

686
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:13,577
You really thought
you killed me, didn't you?

687
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:15,431
How have you done this, huh?

688
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,598
How have you done...

689
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,993
Become human?

690
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:19,993
Yeah.

691
00:42:20,243 --> 00:42:21,556
I thought it would
get your attention.

692
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:23,340
You seemed to like
the human girls.

693
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:25,632
You're telling me
there's a way back, hmm?

694
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:29,049
You're telling me
there's a cure?

695
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,965
Tell me. Tell me.

696
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,486
- Mick!
- Wait.

697
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:39,125
Mick!

698
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,250
<i>Mick!</i>

699
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:57,597
I got the proof.

700
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,847
She's been lying to us,
stalking us.

701
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,534
Morgan is coraline.

702
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:04,264
- I know she is.
- You know?

703
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:07,444
Hi, beth.

704
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:11,611
How could you?

705
00:43:14,423 --> 00:43:16,236
This isn't what you think.

706
00:43:29,103 --> 00:43:30,624
No! No! No!

707
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:32,020
What are you doing?

708
00:43:33,138 --> 00:43:35,034
Oh, my god.

709
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:37,784
Try not to move.

710
00:43:38,388 --> 00:43:40,513
What have you done?

711
00:43:41,242 --> 00:43:43,992
Listen to me, coraline.
Try not to move.

712
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:45,909
We have to get her
to a hospital.

713
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:48,610
Stakes don't kill vampires.
They just paralyze them.

714
00:43:48,652 --> 00:43:49,818
She's not a vampire.

715
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,589
She's coraline!
You just said so herself!

716
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,964
She's coraline,
but she's not a vampire!

717
00:43:54,672 --> 00:43:56,006
Not anymore.

718
00:43:56,652 --> 00:43:57,860
She's human.

719
00:43:58,318 --> 00:43:59,735
There is a cure.

720
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:01,290
She has a cure.

721
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:15,491
