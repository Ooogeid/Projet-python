1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,660
Previously on "moonlight"... 

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,980
I want to help people. 

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,870
It's why I became a P. I. 

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,910
If I can help others, it might make up for what I am. 

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,490
Have I got this right? 

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,290
A stake in your heart will paralyze you. 

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,660
I see it now--it's like your own little prison, isn't it? 

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,900
This whole vampire thing? 

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,310
You can't have anybody poking around--

10
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,450
a girlfriend, anyone who cares. 

11
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:29,308
oh, is that your friend--the blonde? 

12
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:31,532
This is beth turner for "buzzwire. 

13
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:35,951
since you met that guy, screwed up has started to seem normal. 

14
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:43,952
Please don't look at me. 

15
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,561
what are you? 

16
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:50,572
I'm a vampire. 

17
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:32,931
beth. 

18
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:36,912
Okay, I'm here--I'm here to talk to you about, um... 

19
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,141
you. 

20
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:43,402
Maybe you should come in. 

21
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:55,301
I really need you to tell me that I didn't see what I saw--

22
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:58,480
what I think I saw-- the other night... 

23
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:01,172
the blood, the fangs. 

24
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,741
I heard what you said. 

25
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,561
That I'm a vampire. 

26
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:07,191
How am I supposed... 

27
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:13,693
are--are you the only one, or, uh, are there other vampires? 

28
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:16,163
A few hundred here in L. A. 

29
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,091
How can people not know you exist? 

30
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,243
We're extremely careful. 

31
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:23,481
Sometimes people see things, but they dismiss it. 

32
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,761
How can they? 

33
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:27,361
Or no one believes them. 

34
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:33,852
People have been hunting us for thousands of years. 

35
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,933
So it's extremely important that no one knows we exist. 

36
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:39,753
Do you understand? 

37
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:45,652
So do you bite people's necks and s-suck the blood out? 

38
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:49,011
Actually, I-I get most of my blood from the blood bank. 

39
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:50,342
Oh. 

40
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:52,891
The red cross does not mention that in their literature. 

41
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:54,083
I don't think they know. 

42
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,223
Do you--do you know how crazy this is? 

43
00:02:56,225 --> 00:03:01,272
I'm trying really hard to wrap my mind around what you just said and what I saw. 

44
00:03:01,277 --> 00:03:02,351
Hey, I get it. 

45
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:05,700
It's a lot to... get. 

46
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,721
So how does a person even become a vampire? 

47
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:10,991
How did you become a vampire? 

48
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,380
L. A. 1952

49
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,931
I'll love you forever. 

50
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:22,282
Forever? 

51
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,032
Forever. 

52
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:30,200
nick? 

53
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:32,982
I'm sorry. 

54
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:35,373
I-I can'T. Not... 

55
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:37,922
I'm sorry. You gotta go. 

56
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,513
Were you bitten by another vampire? 

57
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:43,190
Is that how it works--

58
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:47,341
one minute you're mick the human, and the next you're mick the vampire? 

59
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,032
Another time. 

60
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:52,123
What was it like? 

61
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:55,040
Another time. 

62
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:08,050
What's it like to turn into a vampire? 

63
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:11,451
As if there was some way to describe it. 

64
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:16,611
What do you do when your whole world changes in the blink of an eye? 

65
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:26,503
Sir? 

66
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:27,801
Sir, can you hear me? 

67
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,522
Sir, are you all right? 

68
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,173
Okay, everything's gonna be all right. I'm a doctor. 

69
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:33,471
Okay, I'm just gonna feel your neck a little bit sir, okay? 

70
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,062
stay with me. Come on. 

71
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:39,532
When suddenly, all the rules change.

75
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:23,931
hey! 

76
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:25,891
What are you doing? 

77
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,503
You have to pay for those! 

78
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,523
I'm not paying for anything. 

79
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,011
Something's wrong with your food! 

80
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:34,720
It doesn't have any taste! 

81
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:40,200
You're crazy! 

82
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,492
you stay away from me! 

83
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,070
You get back! 

84
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:48,100
I mean it! 

85
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:53,912
at this time, the police aren't releasing any details, 

86
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:58,333
but earlier tonight, a store clerk was murdered at this downtown location. 

87
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:00,740
We'll post further details as soon as we get them. 

88
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:02,903
This is beth turner for "buzzwire. 

89
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:04,941
And we are good. 

90
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,052
I'll go to the van and upload your report to the archives. 

91
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:08,530
Okay. 

92
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:12,062
it's a bloody mess in there. 

93
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,910
The guy was literally chewed up. 

94
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:15,052
A wild animal maybe? 

95
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:16,663
In a convenience store? 

96
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,541
Maybe someone didn't approve of his choice of slushee flavors and--

97
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,140
and sicced his dog on the poor bastard. 

98
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:23,322
Pit bull? 

99
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:26,262
Like the one that mauled the woman in san francisco? 

100
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:27,212
Maybe. 

101
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:28,460
Best theory so far. 

102
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,313
We'll see what the coroner says. 

103
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:31,563
All right. 

104
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,392
Let's call it a night. 

105
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,820
listen, whatever you heard... 

106
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,132
off the record. 

107
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:42,521
I heard "bloody, chewed up body. 

108
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,252
I said, I don't want you going out with this thing. 

109
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:46,781
Then give me something. 

110
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,391
Come on, carl. 

111
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:49,713
It's me. 

112
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:51,192
Just give me a little something. 

113
00:06:51,197 --> 00:06:52,782
Off the record, I swear. 

114
00:06:52,785 --> 00:06:53,702
Yeah, that's what you always say. 

115
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,130
And I always hold the story. 

116
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:00,001
Look, fine. 

117
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,942
This guy in here was not just chewed up. 

118
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:04,533
His blood was gone. 

119
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:08,422
Somehow his body was completely drained. 

120
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:38,451
jeez, guillermo, you're like a 12-year-old girl with the messages, the texting. 

121
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:42,181
All right, I'm here. What's the emergency? 

122
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:44,992
Came in a couple of hours ago. 

123
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,440
Look at how the flesh has been just ripped away. 

124
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:53,120
It's like something was literally trying to eat this guy. 

125
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,322
What are the cops saying? 

126
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:56,091
Well, for now, dog attack. 

127
00:07:56,095 --> 00:07:57,472
Yeah, right. 

128
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,363
Not many vampire victims come into the morgue. 

129
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:03,081
That's why I wanted you to get down here before the coroner took a look. 

130
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:07,120
The vampire that did this must have been severely pissed off. 

131
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,100
Or newly turned. 

132
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:14,253
I can barely smell any decay. 

133
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:18,933
but why wasn't his sire controlling him? 

134
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:22,173
Maybe the sire changed his mind, deserted the newbie. 

135
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:23,911
That goes against every rule we have. 

136
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,232
A sire has to be responsible for whoever they turn, 

137
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:27,853
help them through the transition. 

138
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:30,002
I hardly remember anything from when I got turned. 

139
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:31,440
I was too out of it. 

140
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:33,083
I remember the rage, 

141
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:37,860
the need to satisfy a hunger that I didn't understand... 

142
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:42,281
and what it felt like to feed for the first time. 

143
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:45,120
We've got a rogue on our hands. 

144
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:49,608
The way to find this guy is to find his sire. 

145
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:06,042
What are you doing here? 

146
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,601
Word is something slashed him open and drained all his blood out. 

147
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:10,623
"Something"? 

148
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:13,062
What, as in something like me? 

149
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,101
I didn't say that. 

150
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:17,581
Whatever did this is nothing like me, okay? 

151
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,391
Okay, fine. I believe you. 

152
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,010
I want you off this case. 

153
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:21,923
Why? 

154
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,972
Because there's a vampire involved? 

155
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:25,621
Oh, god, I can't believe I just said that. 

156
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:27,223
Yeah, exactly. 

157
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:29,662
Hey, I've been doing this job long before I knew about vampires, 

158
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:30,511
and I'm gonna keep doing it. 

159
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,302
I don't have to ask your permission. 

160
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,881
It's gonna get dangerous, beth. 

161
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:36,933
Then it's a good thing I got you around. 

162
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,531
(Sighs) okay. 

163
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:46,183
You still want to know how someone becomes a vampire? 

164
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:50,821
Well, first, you have to reach a point near death. 

165
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:55,932
Then the vampire, your sire, feeds you their own blood. 

166
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:57,440
Your sire, like a parent? 

167
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,073
Kind of. 

168
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,562
So do they tell you what to do? 

169
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:03,343
Are you close forever? 

170
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,590
Like humans, some relationships are terrible, some are amazing. 

171
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:08,161
It can go a million different ways. 

172
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:08,913
There's no way to predict, 

173
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:11,773
but something has gone terribly wrong with this one, that's for sure. 

174
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,023
I'll go through the wire reports, 

175
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:17,193
see if the cause of death matches any other recent murder victims. 

176
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:17,850
Beth--

177
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:21,073
and will you ask the other vampires if they know anything? 

178
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:24,230
There's not like a big clubhouse where we all hang out. 

179
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,390
Oh, okay. Well, however it works. 

180
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,073
I'll deal with the cops and the computers. 

181
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,962
The other thing-- you're the expert. 

182
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:35,850
Time was, I didn't even know vampires existed, 

183
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:37,842
let alone being an expert. 

184
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,220
But I know one thing--

185
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:42,990
a rogue vampire won't stop killing on his own. 

186
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:51,350
The first thing a newly turned vampire needs to do is feed. 

187
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:55,283
Problem is, if you don't know what you're hungry for, 

188
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,172
you'll try anything, 

189
00:10:57,178 --> 00:11:02,512
when really you're only looking for one thing--blood. 

190
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:12,372
city sidewalks are covered in all kinds of crap--

191
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:18,630
gum, bits of food, cigarette butts, spit. 

192
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:24,412
but I can always find the blood. 

193
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,862
that smell can't be mistaken for anything else. 

194
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:31,870
And vampire blood smells like no other. 

195
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,700
A vampire was here... 

196
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,181
and then there were two. 

197
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:40,223
This is where the rogue was sired... 

198
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:42,840
poor guy. 

199
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:45,502
Probably didn't know what hit him. 

200
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:53,281
L. A. 1952

201
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:03,563
don't be afraid. 

202
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:06,050
It's okay. 

203
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:08,982
What have you done? 

204
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,553
What have you done to me? 

205
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:12,390
Don't be scared. 

206
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,003
It's my wedding gift. 

207
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:15,733
I freed you. 

208
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,631
I freed you from death. 

209
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,241
Tell me what you did to me. 

210
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:24,083
I joined us forever. 

211
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,412
but you don't understand. 

212
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,321
I've given you a gift... 

213
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,773
the greatest gift I can give. 

214
00:13:00,777 --> 00:13:02,840
But I don't want this. 

215
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:04,833
I love you. 

216
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:07,253
I love you. 

217
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,342
You made me into a monster. 

218
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,171
I don't know. "Monster" may be a little extreme. 

219
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:29,320
Yeah? You didn't see the body. 

220
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:31,902
I gotta play with tiger. 

221
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:34,423
Do you think tiger would be up for a little night putting? 

222
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:36,193
It was pure carnage, man. 

223
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:40,373
Yeah, well, the blood loss can be pretty heavy when you're first turned, 

224
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:41,971
and you can really lose it. 

225
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:43,352
I know I did. 

226
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:45,680
Damn, those were good times. 

227
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:52,233
You know, a newly turned vampire is like a feral kitten. 

228
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:54,121
if you don't socialize it within the first few days, 

229
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:56,842
it's never gonna be able to live with humans. 

230
00:13:56,848 --> 00:14:00,190
Well, if I were you, I would pay a visit to the cleaner. 

231
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:04,493
She knows where all the bodies are buried, so to speak. 

232
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:09,270
I've never needed a cleaner service. 

233
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:12,540
However a lot of vampires *****. 

234
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:15,451
but *************

235
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,702
she is necessary to mentain the balance. 

236
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:19,893
Mick st. John. 

237
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,971
Don't tell me you need you need a cleanup. 

238
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,580
No. 

239
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:25,761
What happened here? 

240
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,461
Mr. Sloppy and mr. Stupid over there got a little carried away, 

241
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,302
offed their midnight snack. 

242
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:31,273
These two? 

243
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,330
Accidents happen. 

244
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:36,242
Everyone feels bad, but at least they called for cleanup. 

245
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:41,512
Yes? 

246
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:44,093
Let's take a walk. 

247
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,873
Anything unusual about your recent calls? 

248
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:50,223
We've been a little busier than usual--

249
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:52,193
couple of coeds on the westside last week. 

250
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:54,562
The week before that, a gangbanger in torrance. 

251
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:56,901
What about downtown, 1st and main? 

252
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:58,971
Oh, yeah, last night. 

253
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:01,032
But that was a false alarm. 

254
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:02,760
What do you mean, false alarm? 

255
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:04,850
Vampire called about an accidental kill. 

256
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,212
I hauled my guys all the way from the westside, 

257
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:09,943
but when we got there, no vampire, no kill. 

258
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:11,561
I didn't even get out of the car. 

259
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:14,782
So did you, uh, get the name on the vamp who called it in? 

260
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:15,840
Come on, mick. 

261
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,111
You know how it is. 

262
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,961
All calls are confidential. 

263
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,813
That's why the system works. 

264
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:21,600
Really? 

265
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:25,911
'Cause, uh, he left this behind. 

266
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:31,042
I'm gonna find him eventually. 

267
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:35,451
The reason there was no body there is because it got up and walked away. 

268
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:36,373
A turning? 

269
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:37,462
Gone rogue. 

270
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,653
If I don't find this guy, there's gonna be a lot more cleaning up to do, 

271
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,572
with no one to pick up the tab. 

272
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:53,012
The vampire who called for cleanup is named gerald stovsky. 

273
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:59,032
You find this sire, call me. 

274
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:35,893
Damn it, josh, don't sneak up on me like that. 

275
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:37,610
I didn't sneak. 

276
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:38,701
Why are you so jumpy? 

277
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,351
I'm not jumpy. 

278
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,720
Oh, what is this about? 

279
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:45,590
Oh, nothing. 

280
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:47,713
What time is it, anyway? 

281
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:49,152
Uh, it's late. 

282
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:52,443
I know you usually forget to eat, so... 

283
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:56,122
I picked up some chinese-- kung pao, extra spicy. 

284
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:57,790
You're the best. 

285
00:16:57,796 --> 00:17:00,392
I still don't know how you can eat that. 

286
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:09,080
I know that look. 

287
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:10,872
No look. 

288
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,653
It's just, you've been so busy, we... 

289
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,631
never really talked about what's going on lately. 

290
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,153
What is going on? 

291
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:19,230
Shooting a guy, P. I. 

292
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,763
Buddy, your new obsession. 

293
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:24,340
Look, I know the last couple weeks have been crazy. 

294
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:26,843
I've been juggling a lot with the new job. 

295
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:32,453
But it has nothing to do with you, with us. 

296
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:35,061
I promise. 

297
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:41,561
I traced stovsky to the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena. 

298
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:46,903
Turned out he was a vampire and a rocket scientist. 

299
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:51,991
hi. 

300
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:53,633
Hi. 

301
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:54,751
Yours? 

302
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,013
My notes. 

303
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,661
Oh, thank you. 

304
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,000
I thought I'd lost them. 

305
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:01,223
Corner of 1st and main last night, right? 

306
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,333
Maybe. 

307
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,880
I go by there every night. 

308
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,473
There you go. 

309
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,003
Were you alone? 

310
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:13,232
Yes, you know, I-I think I've finally gotten used to my solitary existence. 

311
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:17,352
Other vampires seem to avoid me, and my human colleagues are--

312
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,492
well, you know how that is. 

313
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:20,982
Right. 

314
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:23,121
Where were you coming from? 

315
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,642
The empress pavilion. 

316
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,501
I love their barbecue pork buns. 

317
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,090
But we don't eat. 

318
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:34,380
I know, but I sure used to love those buns. 

319
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:39,701
Anyway, last night, after your pork bun, what did you eat? 

320
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:42,263
And by, "what, " I mean, "who"? 

321
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:43,810
What? 

322
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:46,221
I found your pad in a pool of blood, 

323
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,332
and since you're a vampire, 

324
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:51,550
I figured it's probably not a coincidence. 

325
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:53,240
That wasn't my fault. 

326
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:56,523
As I said, I was just walking along when, suddenly, 

327
00:18:56,527 --> 00:19:00,020
out of absolutely nowhere, this car mows me over. 

328
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,162
So you attacked the driver? 

329
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:02,730
Oh, no, no, no. 

330
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:05,141
I-I was in no condition. 

331
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:08,280
Fortunately, a good samaritan came by. 

332
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:09,932
So you fed on him? 

333
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,952
Drained him, I'm afraid. 

334
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:14,581
It was just an accident. 

335
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,221
I don't ordinarily feed on humans. 

336
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:20,432
I was just desperate and I... 

337
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:23,392
look, I called the cleaner as soon as I got home. 

338
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,313
She should've disposed of the body, so... 

339
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:29,643
did you check if the guy was dead before you left him there? 

340
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,360
Yes, of course I checked. 

341
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:33,052
I-I mean, he wasn't moving. 

342
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:36,260
Why wouldn't he be dead, right? 

343
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,541
(Mick) you screwed up. 

344
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,661
Some of your blood got into his system. 

345
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:43,921
You didn't kill him. 

346
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:44,933
You turned him. 

347
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:46,823
Then you left him there by himself, 

348
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:49,572
not knowing what he was and not knowing what to do. 

349
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:51,622
Now he's out there killing people. 

350
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,333
Oh, my. Oh, dear. 

351
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,712
What do you remember about him? 

352
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:56,371
Nothing much. I... 

353
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:58,813
it all happened so fast. It was dark. 

354
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:02,611
Ah, yes. He said something about being a, um, uh... 

355
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:03,762
a doctor. 

356
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:07,371
No--yes, a doctor, a doctor. 

357
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:09,493
A doctor? 

358
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:11,073
Yes. 

359
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:14,242
Are you sure? 

360
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:35,351
what? 

361
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,132
Oh, my god. 

362
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,402
Oh, my god! 

363
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:47,073
what... everything is gonna be okay. 

364
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,162
I'm a doctor. 

365
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:03,872
again, the details are sketchy, but the police appear to be treating this as a homicide. 

366
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:09,703
As of now, nobody knows who or what is responsible for the bloody crimes of the past few days. 

367
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:11,750
This is beth turner for "buzzwire. 

368
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:12,833
" And we're out. 

369
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,622
Good job. 

370
00:21:15,196 --> 00:21:17,883
You really think this is related to the other murder? 

371
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:20,982
There's only one way to find out. 

372
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,723
Watch these people over here. 

373
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:32,070
So what happened to holding the story? 

374
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,602
I did hold it. This is a different crime scene. 

375
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:38,603
Or are you telling me you think this is related to the convenience store murder? 

376
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,540
Initially, we thought this was a suicide. 

377
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:41,751
And now? 

378
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:46,310
We decided it was unlikely that he chewed out his own throat before he took his leap. 

379
00:21:46,316 --> 00:21:48,533
Was his blood missing? 

380
00:21:48,535 --> 00:21:50,500
Listen, beth, we still don't know if this is a serial. 

381
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:52,662
Okay, so don't you go giving this psycho a nickname. 

382
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,730
You name him, all the wack jobs come out of the woodwork. 

383
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:57,011
People start panicking. 

384
00:21:57,018 --> 00:22:01,302
Carl, would I do that to you? 

385
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,972
Yes, you would. 

386
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:14,660
This is beth turner for "buzzwire. 

387
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:17,931
" I watched your report. 

388
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,520
You don't know "what" did this? 

389
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:21,911
I didn't say "vampire. 

390
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,362
" Came awfully close. 

391
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:25,810
In fact, by not saying it, I'm lying to people. 

392
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,512
Well, keep it up. 

393
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:31,253
Why do you think you can't trust me? 

394
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:37,523
I found the rogue vampire's blood on the corner of 1st and main. 

395
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:39,290
I need you to use your police contacts to see

396
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:42,951
if anybody has filed any kind of reports in the last couple of days. 

397
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,403
You're a private investigator. 

398
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,222
You don't have any contacts in the department? 

399
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:49,993
It takes time to develop a contact-- years. 

400
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:52,012
People age. I don'T. 

401
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:56,173
Cops especially tend to pick up on those kind of details. 

402
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:01,613
It kinda makes long-term reshtionlaips with humans difficult. 

403
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:03,131
1st and main? 

404
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:05,731
I'll see what I can find out. 

405
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:10,162
Part of me felt bad for the rogue. 

406
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,142
It's not easy being a newbie. 

407
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:15,083
Trust me. 

408
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:16,990
there you are. 

409
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,852
Get away from me. 

410
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:22,793
I know you're hurting. 

411
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:24,940
I brought you something that will make you feel better. 

412
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,950
No, take her away. 

413
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:29,242
You don't really want me to do that. 

414
00:23:29,246 --> 00:23:32,163
Yes, I do. 

415
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:33,580
Make it stop. 

416
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,682
Make it stop, please. 

417
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:39,991
I can'T. It's done, and it's gonna be so wonderful. 

418
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:41,143
You gotta--you gotta kill me. 

419
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:42,123
I wanna die. 

420
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:43,430
No, you don'T. 

421
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:45,581
You wanna live. 

422
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:41,023
what in the world... 

423
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:54,130
Jeff, what are you doing in there? 

424
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:58,140
I'm tired. 

425
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:01,091
I'm so tired. 

426
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:03,832
I needed some sleep. 

427
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:07,540
You were sleeping in the refrigerator? 

428
00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:09,463
The cold. 

429
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,212
Ah, it's nice. It feels good. 

430
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,371
Where are your clothes? 

431
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,383
I didn't need them in there. 

432
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:22,460
Okay, honey, come inside. 

433
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:25,392
You've been under a lot of stress lately, taking on all those extra shifts. 

434
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:26,270
You're just exhausted. 

435
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:28,831
Something's happening to me--

436
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:30,470
something that I don't understand. 

437
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:33,712
Oh, jeff, please, honey, let me call the hospital. 

438
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,163
You need help. You're sick. 

439
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,293
I'm not sick! 

440
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:40,283
I'm sorry. 

441
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:42,931
I didn't mean to scare you. 

442
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:48,313
Everything's gonna be fine. 

443
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:49,550
I love you. 

444
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:52,533
I love you, too. 

445
00:25:53,158 --> 00:25:54,640
I'm just... 

446
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:57,252
so hungry. 

447
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:08,432
I should be getting those police reports you wanted, 

448
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:11,182
but there's no cell coverage here. 

449
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:14,013
I'll try again later. 

450
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,561
(Cell phone beeps) chip? 

451
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:20,240
I got the ones without garlic. 

452
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,750
I can eat garlic. 

453
00:26:21,757 --> 00:26:24,922
I mean, well, I could if I... ate... 

454
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:26,111
food. 

455
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:29,010
But I don't eat food. 

456
00:26:29,016 --> 00:26:30,232
Just blood? 

457
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:32,133
Didn't we just cover that? 

458
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:36,340
Can you fly? 

459
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:38,571
Mm-hmm, just like superman. 

460
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:40,561
-Really? 
-No. 

461
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,830
it would be cool, thoughdnwoul, 't it? 

462
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,681
Yeah

463
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:49,860
So you know what you said earlier--

464
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:51,790
vampires really don't age? 

465
00:26:51,797 --> 00:26:53,331
Really don'T. 

466
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:54,931
So how old are you? 

467
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,533
It's not polite to ask people about their age. 

468
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:58,830
That's just women. 

469
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:01,303
I know you must be older, but you look about 30. 

470
00:27:01,308 --> 00:27:03,250
That's how old I was when I was turned. 

471
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:04,922
Wow. 

472
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:08,591
So when I was 2-- I looked 30. 

473
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,123
When you're 82, I'm still gonna look 30. 

474
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,891
So how old are you really? 

475
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,930
I'm gonna be 85 this november. 

476
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,762
(Chuckles) immortality looks pretty good to me. 

477
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,841
Not from where I'm sitting. 

478
00:27:29,955 --> 00:27:31,650
Here we go. 

479
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:34,662
"No police reports of a hit-and-run on 1st and main. 

480
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:37,130
" No 9-1-1 hits, either. 

481
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:40,740
Parking enforcement said they towed an abandoned car from that intersection

482
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:42,870
that's registered to a dr. Jeffrey pollock. 

483
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,461
2810 hillside. 

484
00:27:57,987 --> 00:28:00,070
and "wait in the car" means... 

485
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:04,060
yeah, 'cause that worked out so well last time. 

486
00:28:04,837 --> 00:28:06,641
What's that smell? 

487
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:07,460
blood. 

488
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:09,862
Stay close. 

489
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:23,393
Is she dead? 

490
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:26,620
Maybe she's not dead. 

491
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,021
She's dead. 

492
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:29,380
There's no heartbeat. 

493
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,433
You can tell that from here? 

494
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:34,753
Is she going to turn into a vampire, too? 

495
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,712
No. He didn't turn her. 

496
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,831
He just murdered her. 

497
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:41,220
We need to figure out where he's gone. 

498
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:51,062
With every kill, pollock becomes more dangerous. 

499
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:54,152
His bloodlust will only get worse. 

500
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:00,031
It was his wife. 

501
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:02,980
He killed his own wife. 

502
00:29:07,618 --> 00:29:11,310
They look so happy. 

503
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:16,542
You must've had a normal life before you became a vampire--

504
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:19,551
a job, friends, family... 

505
00:29:19,836 --> 00:29:21,660
I did. 

506
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,481
But once I was turned, be I came a danger to them all. 

507
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:26,030
I had to give them up. 

508
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:28,541
Were you married? 

509
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:29,810
Once. 

510
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:31,460
What happened? 

511
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:33,322
She died. 

512
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:34,440
Did you try and turn her into a--

513
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:37,063
she's dead. Period. 

514
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:39,460
Okay. Sorry. 

515
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:42,300
You're not. Trust me. 

516
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:46,231
He works at sacred angels hospital. 

517
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:47,103
We have to get there now. 

518
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:48,480
You think he'd feed on his patients? 

519
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,023
New vampires crave blood. 

520
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:52,613
Where better to find it than a hospital? 

521
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:57,623
he's back. 

522
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:06,263
stay here. Stay. 

523
00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:20,540
You didn'T... 

524
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:22,471
it was her husband--

525
00:30:22,478 --> 00:30:24,092
the vampire you turned. 

526
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:26,211
Are you tracking him? 

527
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:30,510
After you left, I realized I had to make things right. 

528
00:30:30,515 --> 00:30:33,321
I had to take the poor vampire under my tutelage--

529
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:36,361
help him through the transition. 

530
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:38,991
You're too late, gerald. 

531
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:40,212
He's out of control. 

532
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,151
No, he's-- he's just confused. 

533
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:43,373
He's not confused. 

534
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:44,311
He's feral. 

535
00:30:44,315 --> 00:30:46,623
He's killed three people already. 

536
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:49,131
He has to be put down. 

537
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:54,883
I'm sorry. 

538
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:57,341
I wasn't completely honest with you. 

539
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:59,793
I did remember the doctor's license plate. 

540
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:03,302
I am good with numbers, after all. 

541
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:11,340
Please understand, I was never able to sire before. 

542
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:15,371
This mistake has given me something I've never had--

543
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:20,653
a son, a companion. 

544
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:25,213
I won't let you take him from me. 

545
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:48,792
mick? 

546
00:31:48,796 --> 00:31:50,610
Mick, you still here? 

547
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:54,363
Oh, my god. 

548
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:01,223
Mick... 

549
00:32:03,426 --> 00:32:04,682
mick. 

550
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:06,391
Mick! 

551
00:32:07,556 --> 00:32:08,401
take it out. 

552
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,943
Oh, my god. You're alive. 

553
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:12,272
Wait. What did you say? 

554
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,881
(Weakly) the stake--

555
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:16,742
take it out. 

556
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:20,172
Uh, okay. 

557
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,900
maybe it's like a piece of glass. You're supposed to wait--

558
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,871
take it out. 

559
00:32:54,196 --> 00:32:57,183
Thanks. I'll take that. 

560
00:32:58,317 --> 00:33:00,963
I thought stakes were supposed to kill vampires. 

561
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:04,490
No, they only paralyze us. 

562
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:13,500
Are you gonna be okay? 

563
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:14,853
I heal fast. 

564
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:16,331
Did pollock do this to you? 

565
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:18,863
No, it was his sire. 

566
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:21,723
We have to get to the hospital. 

567
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:33,012
Pollock, you missed it, man. 

568
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:34,382
Didn't know you were working tonight. 

569
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:35,260
Missed what? 

570
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,803
Car wreck. Driver's radial artery was severed. 

571
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:39,911
I mean, look at this. 

572
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,741
I've never seen that much blood. 

573
00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:44,320
How much blood was there? 

574
00:33:44,327 --> 00:33:46,620
What did I just say? A lot. 

575
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:50,411
You lucky guy. You were probably playing golf. 

576
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,631
Anyway, I got a patient down in 304 I gotta check up on. 

577
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:54,661
Can you cover the floor? 

578
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:56,211
Yeah, sure. 

579
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,373
Drpollock. 

580
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:16,181
Do I know you? 

581
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:17,463
We need to talk. 

582
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:18,823
It's important. 

583
00:34:18,826 --> 00:34:20,752
Can't right now. 

584
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:22,820
I'm on call. 

585
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,033
Hey, you seen dr. Pollock tonight? 

586
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,563
Yeah, he's up on four. 

587
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:34,080
You can't go up there! 

588
00:34:42,218 --> 00:34:43,823
you're not my doctor. 

589
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:46,403
I'm covering for dr. Duffy tonight. 

590
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:49,683
I'm gonna need to take a little blood. 

591
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:52,650
Doctor, I need to speak with you. 

592
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,320
Who are you? 

593
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,420
What do you want? 

594
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,700
I'm here to help you. 

595
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:57,750
I'm your friend. 

596
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:59,841
I don't need any friends. 

597
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:01,561
Doctor, please. 

598
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:18,150
I can't stop him. He's insane. 

599
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,092
You created a killer vampire and just left him? 

600
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:23,583
What's wrong with you? 

601
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:34,371
Gerald stovsky, we need to talk. 

602
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:38,630
hey. 

603
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:41,491
Back awaY. 

604
00:35:41,496 --> 00:35:43,432
Now. 

605
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:48,043
I can smell you. 

606
00:35:48,365 --> 00:35:50,542
You're like me. 

607
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:51,850
I'm nothing like you. 

608
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:53,973
Yeah, you are. 

609
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:57,883
We're vampires, aren't we? 

610
00:35:57,888 --> 00:35:59,972
The strength, the speed... 

611
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:02,053
the blood. 

612
00:36:02,058 --> 00:36:03,353
I figured it out. 

613
00:36:03,357 --> 00:36:05,492
You need to come with me right now. 

614
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:08,490
I'm not going anywhere. 

615
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:11,761
can't you smell how delicious it is? 

616
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:14,742
You don't have to kill to survive. 

617
00:36:14,748 --> 00:36:16,361
I like killing. 

618
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:17,620
Come on! 

619
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,210
I'll share. 

620
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:21,451
There's enough blood here for both of us, 

621
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:24,051
and they restock every day. 

622
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:26,563
You can't feed here! 

623
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,620
We have rules. 

624
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:33,570
there are no rules. 

625
00:36:33,578 --> 00:36:35,810
I'm top of the food chain. 

626
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:37,571
These are people. 

627
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:39,082
They're human beings. 

628
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:44,701
You used to be a human, remember? 

629
00:36:50,906 --> 00:36:53,110
Not anymore. 

630
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:30,572
No, I understand now. 

631
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:32,422
I'll stop killing. 

632
00:37:32,426 --> 00:37:34,792
I'll go back to my old life. 

633
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:36,160
You can'T. 

634
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:38,552
You destroyed it. 

635
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:49,891
mick. 

636
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:52,623
Some woman came and took gerald away. 

637
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:54,353
Pollock--you found him? 

638
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,740
And staked him. 

639
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:56,772
Sh-should we call the police? 

640
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:59,241
Suggestions like that are why you shouldn't be here. 

641
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:01,431
But I thought you said a stake doesn't kill a vampire. 

642
00:38:01,438 --> 00:38:02,823
It only paralyzes him. 

643
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:03,950
What should we do? 

644
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:07,623
Not "we. "Me. 

645
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:10,052
You can't just kill him. 

646
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:11,591
He's already dead. 

647
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:12,321
After all this? 

648
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:15,303
No, beth, okay? 

649
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:17,301
No. 

650
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:01,483
The incinerator. 

651
00:39:01,485 --> 00:39:02,793
Damn. 

652
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,131
Remind me to never piss you off. 

653
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,980
I didn't have a choice. 

654
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:08,750
Well, like I'm judging you. 

655
00:39:08,758 --> 00:39:12,912
I would've done the same thing, except I would have enjoyed it more. 

656
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:20,430
You know, after all these years, I still don't understand you. 

657
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:21,612
The bad guy was caught. 

658
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:24,933
Justice was served, and you're sitting there like someone died. 

659
00:39:24,937 --> 00:39:26,572
Actually, four people died. 

660
00:39:26,578 --> 00:39:28,961
Mm, collateral damage for a greater good, 

661
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,041
and pollock was a danger to all of us--

662
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:32,401
humans and vampires. 

663
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:34,633
I could've been like pollock, 

664
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,812
if coraline had let me go after she turned me, 

665
00:39:36,815 --> 00:39:40,351
if she hadn't taught me how to survive as a vampire. 

666
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:42,702
Oh, don't tell me you're saying something good about the ex. 

667
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,712
No. 

668
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:47,483
But you're still thinking about her. 

669
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:50,700
I'll tell you something I've learned in my 400 years. 

670
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:53,573
Two buddhist monks are walking down a road, 

671
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:56,282
and they see a woman trying to cross a stream. 

672
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,623
The first monk picks her up, carries her across. 

673
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:01,752
She says, "thanks, " and they go their separate ways. 

674
00:40:01,758 --> 00:40:04,081
But the second monk is spitting mad. 

675
00:40:04,086 --> 00:40:06,603
After a couple more miles, the second monk speaks up, 

676
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:09,520
tells the first monk, "you violated the rules of our order

677
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:11,890
when you carried that woman across the stream. 

678
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:14,073
And the first monk replied, 

679
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:16,573
"I may have carried her across that stream, 

680
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:19,881
but you've been carrying her ever since. 

681
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:21,711
I have? 

682
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:25,012
You stop carrying coraline around, mick. 

683
00:40:25,015 --> 00:40:27,381
You can't change the past, 

684
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:31,293
and you can't let it stop you from going forward. 

685
00:40:31,748 --> 00:40:34,263
I know. 

686
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:39,772
I know. 

687
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:47,100
When you're asleep, you should be unconscious

688
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:50,803
and not even know there is anyone next to you, 

689
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:53,782
but somehow, you do... 

690
00:40:56,365 --> 00:40:58,693
more than ever. 

691
00:41:13,148 --> 00:41:14,350
Hey. 

692
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:16,010
Mick. 

693
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:17,803
Do you wanna come in? 

694
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:18,973
No. 

695
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,480
I mean... 

696
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:27,693
you wanna know how I became a vampire. 

697
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,901
Yes. 

698
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:32,180
Okay. 

699
00:41:32,187 --> 00:41:34,600
I told you I was married, right? 

700
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:36,533
Well, she was a vampire. 

701
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,263
I didn't know. 

702
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:42,011
And on our wedding night, she turned me. 

703
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:48,132
I went to bed a happily married man, and I woke up a monster. 

704
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:49,843
You're not a monster. 

705
00:41:49,845 --> 00:41:52,472
Believe me, I was. 

706
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:56,603
You must find it hard to trust anyone now. 

707
00:41:57,827 --> 00:42:01,972
You asked me if I trusted you. 

708
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:08,021
You're the first human that I've told any of this to--

709
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:10,711
