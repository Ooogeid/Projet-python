1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,443
Précédemment...

2
00:00:01,526 --> 00:00:03,602
Just putting some of these things
in storage.

3
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:05,713
Until me and God work
some of our issues out.

4
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,840
You talked to Cappie?
What about?

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:08,696
You.

6
00:00:09,523 --> 00:00:11,677
We're looking for a new usher,
if you know of anyone.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,928
I know a guy.

8
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:14,709
Hey, I'm Lana.

9
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,862
- How do you two know each other?
- Fight club.

10
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,984
Well, before Nate left,
he told me that

11
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:23,038
you and some guy in an Iron Man Audi

12
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:24,523
told him to stay away from me.

13
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,067
Evan has an Iron Man Audi.

14
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,812
I'd rather hang out with Iron Man.

15
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,935
- She offered me an internship.
- In new york.

16
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:31,572
I can't believe that you're going.

17
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:34,629
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I'm sorry too.

18
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:40,137
"What are you wearing, Lord Doom?"

19
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,726
"My imperial cloak of darkest evil.

20
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:48,190
Commando style.

21
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,065
And you?"

22
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,649
So that's when I said,
"Polymer? I barely know her."

23
00:00:58,595 --> 00:00:59,396
Good one.

24
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,519
Rusty and... Jordan?

25
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:08,363
For a second I thought Jordan realized
what a horrible mistake

26
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:10,695
<i>- she made quitting school...
- Is that Dale?</i>

27
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,804
- I thought you broke up.
- We did.

28
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:16,168
<i>We're just catching up.</i>

29
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:19,393
Isn't technology great?

30
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:21,409
I, myself, may have actually

31
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:24,962
started a little cyberliaison
dangereuse of my own.

32
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,336
It was getting NC-17 in there.

33
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:32,161
You know, as an atheistic
former virgin,

34
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:34,385
I'm free to pursue
every urge and desire.

35
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:37,559
It's practically expected of me
to be loose with my morals

36
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:38,619
and my genitals.

37
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:40,489
Can you please not talk
about your genitals

38
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:42,289
in front of my girlfr... My friend.

39
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:44,766
<i>You know. It's OK.
I have to run,</i>

40
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:46,480
<i>go get lunch with people.</i>

41
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:47,912
Bye, Jordan.

42
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:48,848
People?

43
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:51,178
<i>- Who?
- Some people I met in my building.</i>

44
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:54,085
You've been there a week and you
already made friends? That's great.

45
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,117
<i>Yeah, they're so much fun. Marci is a
film student. She's super creative.</i>

46
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,495
<i>And Kelly is an intern at a PR firm.
And there's Eric.</i>

47
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,347
<i>And Kelly's roommate Jane
is in urban planning.</i>

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,079
<i>- She's hilarious.
- That's great.</i>

49
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:08,361
So Eric...

50
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:12,116
Is he like, the fun gay guy
in the group?

51
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,758
<i>No, Eric's straight.</i>

52
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,763
Is this weird?
Do you not want to hear about this?

53
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,344
No, it's fine. It's not like
this is a long-distance relationship.

54
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:25,144
I said that wouldn't work
and you agreed.

55
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,973
<i>So do you wanna do this again,
like next week?</i>

56
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:32,078
Sure.

57
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:34,482
Next week's great.

58
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:36,908
It's great, yeah.

59
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:38,991
OK, bye.

60
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,434
Sounds like somebody's having
a good time.

61
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:46,851
Speaking of a good time,

62
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,919
vampira69 awaits.

63
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:55,766
The coffee dates have been great.
I think we're in a good place now.

64
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,093
That's exciting!
So Fisher's officially off probation?

65
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,866
Once again, he is a full citizen
of the united states of Ashleigh!

66
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,995
It's like the whole kissing
Rebecca thing never even happened.

67
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,421
I'm happy for you guys,
it's so great when...

68
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,167
There he is!
Get down! Get down!

69
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,023
What?

70
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:13,022
Is that Cappie with him?

71
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:16,715
That's Sam from Theta Pi.

72
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,657
Can we please take a break
from our daily stalking?

73
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,576
- Staking-out.
- Stalking of Cappie and Evan.

74
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,245
Why do you care so much anyway?

75
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,316
How could I not?
It's Cappie and Evan.

76
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:29,792
If they're hanging out and protecting me
from Nate types, I want to know.

77
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,035
Do you think
they could be friends again?

78
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:35,756
Well, if they are,
why did Cappie say that Nate was wrong?

79
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,335
Why all the secrecy?

80
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:39,338
That's what I'm trying to find out.

81
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,792
Wait, where did Evan go?
We're on the move! Let's go!

82
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,558
Do you even take classes
here anymore?

83
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:04,451
Are you heading out
with cleaning supplies?

84
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:08,289
I'm staying in.
Getting a jump on spring cleaning.

85
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,120
- Isn't that what pledges are for?
- It is, yes.

86
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:12,414
But we...

87
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:15,462
We're teaching by example.
You know what they say:

88
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,383
"Cleanliness is next to godliness."

89
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,550
And you don't want to piss off God!

90
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:23,348
Anyway,

91
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:25,603
I've been thinking lately.

92
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:26,570
A lot.

93
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:30,028
- Do you remember dry weekend?
- Barely, yeah.

94
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:32,021
Did we really eat cheesaritos
and whipped cream?

95
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,188
We sure did.

96
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:36,567
Do you remember how you said
that you and Cappie talked about me?

97
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:41,574
Case, like I said before,

98
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,742
- I didn't mean to mess you guys up.
- I know.

99
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,785
I'm just wondering
how it all happened.

100
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,772
I mean, did he approach you?
Did you approach him?

101
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:53,691
I hope you're not

102
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:57,504
over-analyzing this whole thing 'cause,
God, I wish I hadn't said anything.

103
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,287
It just seems like an awfully
personal conversation to have

104
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,127
between two guys
who hate each other.

105
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,312
Cappie and I were really drunk.
You know how booze works.

106
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:12,079
One minute you're fighting,
the next minute you're best friends.

107
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:15,189
The minute after that you're puking
and then back to fighting again.

108
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:17,769
- And that's it?
- And that's it.

109
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:19,526
Sorry, Case.

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,329
I need to show these pledges
how to use a broom, so...

111
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:34,922
Happy sweeping.

112
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,591
She already has friends in New York?

113
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,502
What, do they sit
around Central Perk

114
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:46,679
and talk about
what to name Rachel's baby?

115
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,057
Stop torturing yourself.
You're the one that ended it

116
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,209
- because of the long-distance thing.
- I know.

117
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,192
It was the right decision.

118
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,040
Yeah, well, maybe you should
stop talking for a while.

119
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:58,965
I mean, you're just making it harder
for yourself to move on.

120
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,236
Any relationship
over a computer is not real.

121
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,654
Tell that to Lord Doom.

122
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:08,167
My virtual relationship
with vampira69 is real.

123
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,868
No relationship is perfect!

124
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,378
Look at you and Grant.

125
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,785
- Why? Because we're gay?
- No, not at all.

126
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,731
I'm an atheist now, I say,

127
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,544
Do 'em if you got 'em.

128
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,213
I meant the sneaking around.
That's not exactly ideal.

129
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,880
I don't really like it, but

130
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,219
at least we took our relationship
to the next level,

131
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,591
if you know what I mean.

132
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,966
Do 'em if you got 'em.

133
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:33,229
How about you both get out there
and meet some real live girls?

134
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:34,935
Let's go out tonight.

135
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:38,355
I guess it is my duty
to bump uglies in RL Now.

136
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,545
- That's "have sex in real life."
- I got it. Thanks.

137
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:43,694
C'mon, Rusty.

138
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,363
Yeah, let's drop it like it's hot
with some shawties.

139
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,322
All right. Let's do it.

140
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,618
When did you become T-Pain?

141
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:53,910
I'm going through a lot of changes.

142
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,948
So... What do you wanna do
tonight, boyfriend?

143
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,521
Well, I don't know,
what do you want to do, girlfriend?

144
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:04,912
That...

145
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:07,902
- sounded weird, didn't it?
- Yeah, it did a little bit.

146
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,852
It has to be something awesome for our
first date as a back-together couple.

147
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,753
How about the Ohio River Comic-Con,
in Cincinnati?

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,232
- Yeah, that sounds like fun.
- I was kidding.

149
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,682
Comic books and Cincinnati?

150
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,872
We could...

151
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:29,962
Go ice skating?

152
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,468
We could, but I just went
with some of the sisters last week.

153
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,622
- Right. Yeah, I knew that.
- Yeah.

154
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,439
Oh, my God.

155
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:41,668
Clueless is playing at the Titan.
I've never seen it in a theater!

156
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,756
- You hate that idea.
- No. No, I've actually never seen it.

157
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,479
You've never seen Clueless?
And you're a film major?

158
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,803
I thought CRU had a good program.

159
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,550
You're right.

160
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,348
We should go. Let's go.

161
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:58,018
Great. So should I just meet you
at the theater?

162
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,698
Or I could pick you up here.
That's what we used to do before, right?

163
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:02,979
Right.

164
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:06,000
Just like it used to be.

165
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,465
We might have a problem.

166
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:14,433
I know, you missed a spot,
Chambers-maid.

167
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,892
We can't pay our respects
tomorrow night

168
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:20,438
to the cremated remains of the
original amphoras in a dirty lair.

169
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:22,584
No, no, I'm talking about Casey.

170
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,780
I think she's on
to our secret friendship.

171
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:27,600
- She talked to you, too?
- Yeah.

172
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:30,342
- She tried that on me at Dobler's.
- So, what should we do?

173
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:35,632
Do you think we should just tell her
things are different between us?

174
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,887
Down here they are.

175
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,643
Down here?
"Down here it's our time."

176
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,776
Goonies, nice.
That line holds up.

177
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,652
I can see myself
in your 200-year-old walnut.

178
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,635
You know what they say:
"cleanliness is next to godliness."

179
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:52,321
And you don't wanna piss off God.

180
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,407
It was a joke?

181
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,904
Yes, I took a well-known phrase
and I spun it...

182
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,938
Explaining it doesn't make it
any funnier.

183
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:05,044
Anyways, these amphoras seem to take
this whole secret society thing

184
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,384
really seriously.

185
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,495
- They will kick us out.
- Rules are rules. Right?

186
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:12,313
We just keep denying.
Casey'll have to give up eventually.

187
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,641
It's a text from our mutual friend.

188
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,393
"Evan told me everything.

189
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:23,963
Meet me at the stairs
at eight to discuss."

190
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:26,481
She'll give up eventually?

191
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,798
Pesky times call for pesky measures.

192
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,034
- I'm so ready.
- We're gonna tear it up!

193
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:46,293
Check it out. Streetwalker fishnets,
at your nine o'clock.

194
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:48,890
I thought I felt some hungry eyes.

195
00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:57,929
It's just 'cause I'm gay. Trust me,

196
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:00,515
gay guys go over bigger
than glow sticks in the club world.

197
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,653
No offense, r-man, I think
you're cramping my style.

198
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:05,846
- I'm gonna go in, OK?
- Excuse me, fellas.

199
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,406
Get out of here.

200
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:13,490
I don't know about this, calvin...

201
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,790
Your friend over there
said I should come say hi.

202
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:22,159
He's my gay friend.

203
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:24,167
I'm not gay, though.

204
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,416
I love girls. And I can
prove it to you.

205
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,710
No, thank you.

206
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:44,776
Impressive.

207
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:46,696
So I guess you got my text?

208
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,824
You can't tell anybody.

209
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,985
I knew it!
Why all the secrecy?

210
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,047
If our enemies find out
that me and evan are

211
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,059
vigilante crime fighters
who protect the people

212
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,708
of cyprus from the dark forces
of evil and corruption,

213
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,622
we'll be so screwed.

214
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,336
You're messing with me.

215
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:03,869
There's my partner now.

216
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:06,051
Reclusive boy billionaire
evan chambers.

217
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,055
He's so good at pretending

218
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,228
he's mad at me, I almost
believe it myself.

219
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:16,846
Tell casey that we're
a stealth crime fighting team.

220
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,177
Wha...

221
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,478
- That is hilarious.
- Really.

222
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:22,906
- Did you put him up to this?
- OK, I get it.

223
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:24,932
Come on, she knows.

224
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:28,109
Let's use that. She could be the
gwyneth to our robert downey!

225
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,701
The michael caine slash morgan
freeman slash katie holmes

226
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,805
slash maggie gyllenhaal
to our christian bale.

227
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,201
- You can stop now.
- Yeah, get out of my way, crappie.

228
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:37,865
Guys, come on!

229
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:43,018
Oh, my gosh!

230
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,638
Guys...

231
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,511
Guys!

232
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,774
Come on, guys!

233
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,545
Stop!

234
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,694
So, what'd you think?

235
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,957
Are you kidding?
What'd you think?

236
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,760
I'm just gonna say it.

237
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,475
I think cluelessis one
of the greatest movies

238
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,258
in the history of movies.

239
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,776
That's is what I was thinking.

240
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,269
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

241
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:46,382
The music and the clothes

242
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:50,278
and the Make-overs,
come on, it's a classic.

243
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,003
I have the greatest idea.

244
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,785
You should show it
at your film club.

245
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,514
At my film club?

246
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,901
Clueless, it's a great idea.

247
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:01,754
Yeah, I could pitch it
at tomorrow night's screening.

248
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,601
We're watching this old ingmar
bergman classic, wild strawberries.

249
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:07,541
You should totally
come. Only if you want to.

250
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,543
OK. No, I love old movies.

251
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:13,744
I've seentootsie, twice.

252
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:15,543
What do you wanna do for dinner?

253
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:17,958
- I could go for some pizza.
- Anything but pizza.

254
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,673
- Let's do pizza.
- Are you sure?

255
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:23,483
- Absolutely. I love that idea.
- OK, me, too.

256
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:28,210
So maybe electric rage
was the wrong step

257
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:29,763
into the single world for you.

258
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,576
I'm not so sure
there's a right step.

259
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,938
Come on. We gotta keep getting you out
there and you'll be moving on

260
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:36,965
from jordan before you know it.

261
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:38,900
What was that?

262
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:41,668
Vampira69 just told a twilight joke

263
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,400
that would make your ears bleed.

264
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,739
I thought it was
your duty to have sex.

265
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,659
You can't have sex with a computer.

266
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,787
- Not real sex, face-to-face.
- It's pronounced "f2f".

267
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,622
And I know, but that's
about to change.

268
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,822
Vampira69 just told me she
wants to meet in person tonight,

269
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:59,441
at the, ohio river
comic-con in cincinnati!

270
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,439
Tonight? Let's all go.

271
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:05,384
Maybe the problem with the club
was it just wasn't your crowd.

272
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,983
Dude, comic book conventions
are crawling with hotties.

273
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,849
- Everybody knows that.
- Yeah. No, they don't.

274
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,847
We're talking skin-tight
cat suits, man.

275
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:15,814
Skin-tight.

276
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:22,630
With great power,
comes great responsibility.

277
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,055
See?

278
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,737
Dork talk.
They are gonna love you.

279
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,193
It was like
the most polite date ever.

280
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:33,682
At one point, I thought fisher
and cover a puddle for me.

281
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,376
Didn't you take him off probation?

282
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,127
I did. So why does it feel so off?

283
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:40,999
You guys will find
your rhythm. Don't worry.

284
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:43,485
At least you weren't beating
the crap out of each other.

285
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,095
Right, the big kt-omega chi brawl.

286
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,497
Give me details.
I heard someone pulled a shiv.

287
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,352
There was no shiv-pulling
or pushing.

288
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,199
Wait, what's a shiv?

289
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,863
Whatever. All my sleuthing made them
hate each other more.

290
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:59,215
- I'm like the worst detective ever.
- Stop it.

291
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,854
Remember inspector gadget?

292
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:03,990
He needed a dog and a ten-year
old girl to solve anything.

293
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,617
I just really wanted it to be true.

294
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:09,190
Why? Is this about cappie?

295
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:11,535
It's clear there are
still feelings there

296
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,454
since every time you're around
him you turn into the female hugh grant.

297
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,004
How I feel about cappie
is kind of irrelevant

298
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,410
since he's off
with that fight club girl.

299
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,746
- And what about evan?
- We're friends.

300
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,613
And that's what I wanted all
of us to be, like freshman year.

301
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,375
When evan and cappie and I
hung out together, it was...

302
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,072
Everyone was happy.

303
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,469
And my ugg boots
were still in style.

304
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,366
It was a good time.

305
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,252
Maybe someday you three
will get that back.

306
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:41,548
Regardless, I owe them both
a wildly humiliating apology.

307
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:47,767
There's a q&a via
satellite with q from star trek.

308
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:49,856
Not bad, cincinnati.

309
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:52,519
Is that the guy who reads the
bible to you before you go to bed?

310
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:54,744
I'm excited for q. Not god.

311
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:57,788
Are you nervous?

312
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:00,575
I'm just going over
some opening lines

313
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,959
so I'm ready when I meet somebody.

314
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,095
Yeah, we're just on the road.

315
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,071
I'm here with rusty and dale.

316
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:12,156
Rusty say hi to grant.

317
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:18,924
That's sweet.

318
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,722
Yeah, I Miss you too.

319
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,380
Are you going to comic-con?

320
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,111
Yeah. Are you?

321
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:53,795
Guess it's pretty obvious.

322
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:57,557
Find me there, OK?

323
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,963
Lord doom is ready for comic-con!

324
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:11,148
Yeah! Comic-con, baby!

325
00:17:26,803 --> 00:17:28,711
Case, got your text.

326
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,619
Just making sure there's
no omega chi waiting

327
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:33,226
to ambush me this time.

328
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:37,074
I think you're safe. I got you a
beer to make up for my meddling.

329
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,058
In that case, that case
meddling forgiven.

330
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,552
How're you feeling?

331
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:46,480
Nothing a little
drinking won't heal.

332
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:50,264
I can't believe that I thought
you and evan could be friends again.

333
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,737
Yeah, a little bit of a
hair-brained scheme there.

334
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:57,007
Me and chambers? Not gonna
happen. Way too much baggage.

335
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,304
It would've been nice,
though, if I were right.

336
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:02,929
Don't you Miss freshman year?

337
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:05,708
The three of us, hanging out
in the dorm. It was fun.

338
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:07,264
It was pretty fun.

339
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,020
But, the past is the past.

340
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:13,048
You can't change it,
and you can't go back.

341
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,448
I guess so. You gotta keep
moving forward, right?

342
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,530
How are things with lana?

343
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,683
- Good. She's cool.
- She seems cool.

344
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,461
I'm happy for you.

345
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,572
- Thanks for the beer.
- You off?

346
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,282
To sweep some chimneys?

347
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:40,076
I was just doing a little
tidying up at the kt house.

348
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,986
Cleaning? At kt?
Has that ever happened before?

349
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,256
First time for everything.
You know what they say:

350
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:48,247
"cleanliness is next
to cappie-ness."

351
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:50,267
And you do not want
to piss off Cappie

352
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:51,729
See ya.

353
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,977
Oh, my god.

354
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,102
- Nice.
- That's how it's done.

355
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,228
Guys. Everyone decent?

356
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:11,083
To what do we owe this...

357
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,219
obscenely large fruit basket?

358
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:15,627
We are delivering fruit baskets

359
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:18,829
to every house on campus.
Just a little ZBZ good well

360
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:21,331
for what seems like
the longest semester ever.

361
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:26,581
- No cheesaritos?
- No. Sorry.

362
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,888
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

363
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,641
Do we just play around it?

364
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:34,870
Like putt-putt?

365
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:55,526
I really can't believe you
talked me into this.

366
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:00,551
What makes you think they're not
gonna look inside the basket?

367
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,951
The only fruit the KTS
consume is used to flavor vodka.

368
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:08,290
Can you believe I fell for that fight?
They must've told their houses to fake

369
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,744
the fight to throw me off the scent.
Diabolical.

370
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,078
<i>You sucking suck-sucker!</i>

371
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,151
That seems a little
needlessly complicated.

372
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:16,942
And a tad egotistical
on your part.

373
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:21,339
<i>Why are kittens called kittens?
They're little cats. </i>

374
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:22,794
<i>Shouldn't they be called cattens?</i>

375
00:20:23,277 --> 00:20:25,957
So this is what fraternity guys
talk about when no one's listening?

376
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:28,908
<I>Do you think Ashleigh was acting
a little strange?

377
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:30,940
<I>Whatever. She's hot.

378
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,431
<I>I'd do her.

379
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,488
<I>That reminds me, the other day this guy
at dobler's was telling me

380
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:40,418
<I>that 80 percent of college kids have sex
in any given year. Can you believe that?

381
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,957
<I>It's nothing compary the fact One out of
every two pregnancies in america

382
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:44,996
<I>are unplanned.

383
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,657
<I>What do you expect when half of
unmarried men who have sex 

384
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:49,062
<I>never wear a condom.

385
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:50,838
They know! They know! Get down!

386
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:52,178
<I>We just sounded fancy!

387
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:53,881
<i>your butt crack's showing.</i>

388
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:55,670
Never mind.

389
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,141
I'm gonna go.

390
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:59,272
Why don't you come with me
to fisher's film club?

391
00:20:59,397 --> 00:21:03,119
We're watching movie called
strawberries gone wild, or something.

392
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:05,388
You go. I'm gonna stay here and
wait for cappie.

393
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,523
Have fun.

394
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,612
and good luck with your...
...crazy.

395
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:20,612
ok, boys. Gotta run. I will meet you
later at dobler's.

396
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,499
Later.

397
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:45,376
Seventy-five bucks

398
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:46,377
for spock ears?

399
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:47,935
Nerd-sploitation

400
00:21:47,936 --> 00:21:48,936
is what that is.

401
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:49,998
I don't think I've ever seen

402
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,349
so many comic-obsessed fans

403
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,811
in one place before.

404
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:54,327
I just need to find one.

405
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,001
Vampira69's waiting

406
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:57,874
on lord doom.

407
00:21:58,124 --> 00:21:59,174
I've got no intention

408
00:21:59,436 --> 00:22:00,938
of disappointing a 500-year-old

409
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:01,875
blood-sucking

410
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:03,226
should we be concerned that

411
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:08,750
dale's taking this super-villain

412
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,201
thing a little too seriously?

413
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:11,937
She's wearing green alien

414
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,688
makeup. It can't be that hard.

415
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:19,002
Oh, hey, wait,

416
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:20,313
there she is!

417
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:24,187
Excuse me.

418
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:27,063
Oh, I'm sorry.

419
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,250
hey.

420
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:41,062
- Leopard boy!

421
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:41,937
- Leopard boy?

422
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:42,876
It was my favorite

423
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:43,877
tv show growing up.

424
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:45,062
His mom is human

425
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,313
but his dad is a leopard,

426
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:47,249
and he solves these mysteries

427
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,750
at this posh caribbean resort.

428
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,064
They've gotta have a booth here.

429
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,065
I'll be right back.

430
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:54,312
Come on.

431
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:03,037
We made first contact.

432
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,188
- Wow! That was...

433
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:07,739
- Amazing? Bergman is a genius!

434
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,375
I know, the allusions to freud

435
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:11,437
and german expressionism in

436
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:12,752
the opening dream sequence,

437
00:23:12,753 --> 00:23:13,753
it was just awesome!

438
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,436
What'd you think

439
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,437
about it, ash?

440
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,753
What did I think

441
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:20,754
of the movie?

442
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:22,437
Um, I thought

443
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:23,438
it was very...

444
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:25,813
Honestly, I was so

445
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:28,501
bored for a minute I thought

446
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:29,502
I couldn't breathe.

447
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:30,438
How is that even possible?

448
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,989
It's probably the greatest film

449
00:23:32,438 --> 00:23:33,438
in cinema history.

450
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:34,937
I wouldn't say that.

451
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:35,813
Right, fisher?

452
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:36,501
Name one film

453
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:37,602
that even comes close.

454
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:38,693
Uh,clueless?

455
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:40,188
- Is that godard?

456
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:41,626
- Silverstone.

457
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:43,189
- Is she kidding?

458
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:45,374
- No. Fisher agrees with me.

459
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,064
We think it's one of the

460
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:47,365
greatest movies ever made.

461
00:23:47,504 --> 00:23:48,504
Right, fisher?

462
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,978
Uh... Yeah, I thinkclueless

463
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:51,876
is, uh... Colorful, with

464
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,127
a really great... Spirit,

465
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:55,312
and it has a very

466
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:57,416
interesting use of montage.

467
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:59,104
And it also evokes the, uh,

468
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:01,938
nuance, of early

469
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:03,188
screwball comedy.

470
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:04,504
Hey, who wants pizza?

471
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:05,505
I do!

472
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:12,128
I'm meeting

473
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:13,501
my internet girlfriend here.

474
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:14,629
I mean, not really girlfriend.

475
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,080
More like sex partner, but...

476
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:17,439
...you know.

477
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:19,764
How much are the sticky buns?

478
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:21,003
Lord doom,

479
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:22,579
are you ready to submit?

480
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:24,791
Vampira69, we meet at last.

481
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:29,753
Dale?

482
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,190
Sheila! You're vampira69?

483
00:24:33,065 --> 00:24:34,065
Is this a joke?

484
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:35,126
Did you know it was me?

485
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:36,227
No, no, of course not!

486
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:38,003
Although given

487
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:39,304
the tawdry yet imaginative

488
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:40,687
scenes of debauchery you typed,

489
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,254
I suppose

490
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,127
I should've guessed.

491
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:42,877
Maybe there's a reason

492
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:44,378
we were brought back together.

493
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:46,814
Maybe it's all part

494
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:47,815
of god's plan.

495
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,001
I don't really believe

496
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,152
in that anymore, but...

497
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:51,892
And you hurt me, sheila.

498
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:53,689
Sorry.

499
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:55,503
Think you could find

500
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:56,504
a way to forgive me?

501
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,940
And if not me, vampira69?

502
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,692
I still can't believe you found me.
There's a lot of green girls.

503
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:09,198
I'd already introduced myself
to two aliens and a shrek.

504
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:13,614
I'm Rusty Cartwright, by the way.

505
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:14,764
Falitza.

506
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:17,121
I'm a Borgton from the planet Lycon.

507
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:18,934
My friends call me Sally.

508
00:25:19,926 --> 00:25:21,209
So where's Sally from?

509
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,026
I assume not Lycon.

510
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:25,132
You assume correctly, Rusty.

511
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:26,590
I'm from Adamsburg.

512
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:29,929
I go to school in Cyprus!
We're ten minutes away, that's great.

513
00:25:30,385 --> 00:25:32,753
My last relationship ended
because of long distance.

514
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:36,178
You're not planning on moving
to New York anytime soon, are you?

515
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:37,709
New York? No.

516
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,413
That's not... No.

517
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,081
Don't worry.

518
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,877
I just mean, if this were to progress
into a relationship,

519
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,253
it'll be easy for us
to sleep at each other's places.

520
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,116
Do you have a car?

521
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,463
Great.

522
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,718
I don't. My sister does,

523
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,573
but she hardly ever lets me use it.

524
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,264
She's cool though.
You'll really like her.

525
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,618
If you meet her.

526
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:05,730
I'm not saying that...
you will meet my family.

527
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,875
Oh, my God.

528
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:13,738
Well, that was weird, wasn't it?

529
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,192
Sort of.

530
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,098
It was nice to meet you, Rusty.

531
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:21,154
Have fun at Comic-Con.

532
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:36,552
Did you walk into a door?

533
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,006
Yeah, that really
got out of hand, right?

534
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,603
- It worked on Casey, right?
- Yeah, I talked to her. Trust me,

535
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,252
she doesn't suspect a thing.

536
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:46,520
No more suspecting, that's for sure.

537
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,815
I knew you were secret friends!
Oh, my god, I'm awesome!

538
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,902
- How did you find this place?
- I followed Cappie from KT.

539
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,992
What?
I used my super secret sneaky route.

540
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:58,770
Yeah, and I almost puked three times

541
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:00,576
in the sewer tunnels, but I made it!

542
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,203
I've so many questions for you.

543
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,372
How long have you been friends?
What is this place?

544
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,201
- You need to hide!
- Casey, hide.

545
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:07,667
Hide? From who?

546
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,788
Quiet, incessant question girl! Hide now
and everything will be explained.

547
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:22,025
- We should get started.
- Yeah!

548
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,698
We're here tonight to pay homage

549
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:26,725
to our amphora fore-fathers.

550
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:27,575
Amphora.

551
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:29,647
It's time to bring out the ashes

552
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,846
of the original amphora members.

553
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,364
Retrieve the burial urn.

554
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,936
You don't... I think it...

555
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:44,857
Who is she?

556
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,399
I'm...

557
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:51,014
You're Casey Cartwright?

558
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,050
- He did it.
- He did it.

559
00:27:57,321 --> 00:28:00,136
Guys, you totally broke the trust!

560
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,916
I can't believe this but

561
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,041
- we're going to have to banish you.
- Brett, no, we can explain...

562
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:09,864
Sorry. Fellow amphora brethren.

563
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:12,498
Since you two obviously
can't handle a simple

564
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:14,514
"secrecy until death" rule...

565
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:18,428
Don't blame them.
It's not their fault.

566
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:19,894
I'm just

567
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:22,372
really clever when it comes
to investigating...

568
00:28:22,455 --> 00:28:23,367
Quiet!

569
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,472
I have...

570
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,398
no idea what to do with you.

571
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:29,741
She's the first intruder
in the history of amphora.

572
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:32,430
- Like I said, really clever.
- You should stop.

573
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:33,754
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

574
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,718
Certain ancient aboriginal tribes
would sacrifice

575
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,595
those who intruded
on a holy plot of land.

576
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:49,019
I don't think
it's come to that, but

577
00:28:49,505 --> 00:28:51,270
thank you.
Amphoras,

578
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:53,731
minus the trust-breakers...

579
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:55,828
Let's consult!

580
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:04,158
So this is why you guys
were keeping it a secret.

581
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,173
Exactly.

582
00:29:05,256 --> 00:29:07,457
Now you might get kicked out
because of me.

583
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:10,873
Don't worry about it, Case.
No way you could have known.

584
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,930
Yeah, but I could've stopped
trying to be

585
00:29:13,013 --> 00:29:15,169
Nancy freaking Drew
and minded my own business.

586
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,922
- We won't argue with that.
- I'm gonna Miss this abandoned

587
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,581
water pumping station.

588
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:24,513
OK, guys.

589
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,820
We've decided...

590
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,058
... not to report you to the alumni.

591
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,205
You both can stay in amphora.

592
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:32,264
Thank you.

593
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,897
As for you, intruder,

594
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,164
being the first to find the lair is

595
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,692
an impressive feat.

596
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,819
We've decided

597
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,921
to let you in
to the amphora society.

598
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,076
Really? Are you guys OK with this?

599
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:49,650
- Totally great.
- Totally. It'll be awesome.

600
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:53,582
You must first perform
the amphora emotional purge.

601
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:57,044
You will stand before us
and share your secrets,

602
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:58,450
your truths,

603
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,214
everything.

604
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:02,833
Everything?

605
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:07,823
So I guess I'll see you tomorrow?

606
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:16,230
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like Clueless?

607
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:21,835
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like

608
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,872
I have to walk on eggshells
around you now.

609
00:30:24,345 --> 00:30:27,128
I mean, have you felt completely normal
since we got back together?

610
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:28,851
Excuse me, sorry.

611
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,068
Not completely.

612
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,314
But we're fine now.

613
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:39,837
Old Ash and Fisher,
picking up where we left off.

614
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:43,092
It's not that simple,
I mean, I feel like

615
00:30:43,994 --> 00:30:47,670
if I make a wrong move,
you're gonna put me back on probation,

616
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:50,627
or break up with me.

617
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,815
I'm over what happened.

618
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,133
I wouldn't have taken you back
if I didn't want to.

619
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,673
That's great, but it doesn't
change the fact that...

620
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:06,733
- I can't feel comfortable.
- You don't feel comfortable because

621
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:08,157
you're not being yourself.

622
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:10,183
Which sucks,

623
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:12,620
'cause the person
I want to be with is you.

624
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:15,662
The old you,

625
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,339
the person who

626
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:19,210
wasn't afraid to say
what he was thinking.

627
00:31:38,554 --> 00:31:40,689
Yeah, I just spent 40 bucks
on this hat.

628
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,567
- Don't judge me.
- How can I?

629
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,903
Falitza from borgton thought I was
too weird to have a relationship with.

630
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:47,453
Wait, relationship?

631
00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:49,887
- You just met her.
- You know what I mean.

632
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,452
- Nice leopard boy hat.
- From the man in the cape.

633
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,792
What happened with vampira69?

634
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:57,237
Funny story.

635
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,833
- She turned out to be Sheila.
- Our landlady?

636
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:06,477
Yeah, she wants to

637
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:08,518
put her grill all...

638
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,344
She wants to do it again.

639
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:13,115
Rusty's hook-up didn't go
so well either.

640
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:15,509
I'm thinking
about taking her back...

641
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:16,998
And her front.

642
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:19,002
You can't get back
with the landlady.

643
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:21,888
- Tell him, Rus.
- What's wrong with going back?

644
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:24,567
Maybe Sheila's the only
right person for Dale.

645
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,301
Maybe he made a huge mistake
letting her go.

646
00:32:28,176 --> 00:32:29,863
He should do everything
to get her back.

647
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:32,277
You've got your facts
wrong there, Rus.

648
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,286
- She did me and dumped me.
- He's not talking about Sheila.

649
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:38,080
Who are you to give
relationship advice, anyway?

650
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,318
Come on. You can't even
be honest with your brothers

651
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:43,335
about your relationship
with that Grant.

652
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,161
What does this have to do with me?

653
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,734
This is about you being afraid to put
yourself back out there and date again.

654
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:51,505
I don't want to put myself
back out there!

655
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:53,941
I had the perfect girl

656
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:55,806
and I let her go.

657
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:59,643
Why? Because long-distance can't work?
Says who?

658
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:03,711
I made a mistake,
and it is not too late to fix it.

659
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,311
Jordan and I can make this work.

660
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:15,705
Well, that covers the summer
after high school.

661
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:19,631
My friends and I made a pact
never to go back to lake Galena or

662
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:21,846
that rest stop on route 93,
ever again.

663
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,318
Let's see.
I started CRU in the fall.

664
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:28,191
That's where I met Evan and Cappie
at the big KT rush party.

665
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:29,950
Fast forward!
We know about that.

666
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,264
I'm fast forwarding.

667
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:35,679
- Cappie and I started to date...
- Keep it moving,

668
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:39,292
I'll just skip ahead to the night
of the all-greek ball.

669
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,436
Evan and Cappie got into a fight
that ended their friendship.

670
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:46,075
I've always felt responsible.

671
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:49,963
They were truly great friends,

672
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:51,379
an unstoppable duo.

673
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,315
And I never got over the fact
that it was me

674
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:55,908
who stopped them.

675
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,397
But we have a chance to get back
to what we were freshman year.

676
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,216
We're three years older now,
maybe wiser.

677
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:09,463
Evan and I found a way to get past

678
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,164
bribery and corruption.

679
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,121
Cappie found a way to

680
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,134
move on to Lana.

681
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,697
Even after Evan told me about Cappie

682
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,208
at the end of the world party,
coming to see me...

683
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:25,607
What?

684
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:28,273
- You told her about that?
- It was no big deal.

685
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,928
- Yeah, Cap, I did, but I was...
- He was high.

686
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:35,989
Totally baked.
He was trying to eat shampoo.

687
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,098
- Come on, what do you want me to say?
- Nothing. If that's even possible.

688
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:54,106
Can you hear me?

689
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,337
I think we made a mist...

690
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:07,792
I think we...

691
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:16,914
<i>Thank you for your patience.
We will begin shortly.</i>

692
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:22,524
Please have video chat.

693
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,740
Rusty, hey, finally!
What's up?

694
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:42,139
Remember before you left I said
long-distance relationships can't work?

695
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:45,777
I was wrong.

696
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,632
A lot of people have
long-distance relationships.

697
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:50,252
And I think we can, too.

698
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:57,504
There'll be plenty of time to rekindle
our carnal flame after we see

699
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:01,057
the opponent spiritual
and sometimes malevolent counterpoint.

700
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:06,381
<i>Our Q&A with Q aka John de Lancie
will begin momentarily.</i>

701
00:36:06,506 --> 00:36:08,582
<i>Just as soon as we finalize
our satellite feed.</i>

702
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:10,900
<i>Why should we give up
on a great relationship</i>

703
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:12,920
<i>just because we live
in different cities?</i>

704
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:15,250
<i>We can have internet dates,</i>

705
00:36:16,432 --> 00:36:17,716
<i>and cook the same meals.</i>

706
00:36:18,182 --> 00:36:21,018
<i>Rent the same movies online
and watch them at the same time.</i>

707
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,468
<i>Fall asleep</i>

708
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,743
<i>next to the computers.</i>

709
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,897
Sounds like somebody could use
a little self-esteem.

710
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:29,892
<i>It'll be like you never left.</i>

711
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:32,650
<i>Almost.</i>

712
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:35,752
And we will never have
to be single again.

713
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:41,698
I miss you.

714
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,747
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

715
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,497
<i>It sounds like you miss being
in a relationship more than you miss me.</i>

716
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,499
Come on, that's not it.

717
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,167
<i>Falling asleep on a keyboard?</i>

718
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,045
<i>That's not a relationship.
I don't think you want that.</i>

719
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:56,703
<i>And I know that I don't.</i>

720
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:02,424
<i>What was that?</i>

721
00:37:03,502 --> 00:37:04,620
<i>Where are you?</i>

722
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:09,558
<i>Who's that on our screen?</i>

723
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,645
<i>What is going on here, Josh?</i>

724
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,030
<i>I told you, all problems</i>

725
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:16,775
<i>taken care of before
I get on the damn line!</i>

726
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:18,989
<i>This is an abomination!</i>

727
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:31,311
About that night, I was leaving
the party to come see you, but I...

728
00:37:31,436 --> 00:37:32,291
It's fine.

729
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,849
You don't have to explain it to me.

730
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:37,061
That was...

731
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,976
That was the pot brownie talking,
it wasn't me.

732
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:44,286
- I wish I could take it back.
- Less talking, more not talking.

733
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:48,131
I get this is why you were keeping

734
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:49,706
all this from me.

735
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:52,060
Because I might screw
it up and, apparently,

736
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:53,910
you were right.

737
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:57,698
I thought if the two of you
could be friends again,

738
00:37:57,823 --> 00:38:00,218
then maybe we could all go back
to the way things used to be.

739
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:02,665
But I guess I was wrong.

740
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:06,033
We can't go back.

741
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:11,041
But maybe all three of us can
try to move forward together.

742
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,371
I can try.

743
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,509
Fellow amphoras, it is time
to resume the ancestry ritual.

744
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,565
We can try.

745
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,282
But

746
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:29,556
this is your place down here.

747
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,620
"down here, it's our time." wow,

748
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:33,727
- gooniesreally does hold up.
- So good.

749
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,173
I really appreciate
you guys letting me in,

750
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:42,444
but I don't belong
in the amphora society.

751
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,009
I really think a sacrifice
is an effective way...

752
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:48,951
We're not gonna kill her.
Just drop it!

753
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:53,205
You've purged all of your
deepest, darkest secrets.

754
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,600
If you ever reveal anything
about the amphora society,

755
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:58,333
it will go public.

756
00:38:58,862 --> 00:38:59,795
you understand?

757
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:02,010
Understood.

758
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,361
The events of this evening
will remain secret.

759
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,085
That was humiliating.

760
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:17,675
It wasn't that bad.

761
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,131
She told me to get a life
in front of people

762
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:21,899
who live in their
parents' basements.

763
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:24,091
It sucks it didn't work
with you and Jordan.

764
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,977
She was super hot.

765
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,065
I tried to warn you.

766
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:29,670
I know.

767
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:32,755
I feel pretty bad about
what I said about you and...

768
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,862
That grant?

769
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:38,266
We do need to take our
relationship to the next level.

770
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:40,510
And I need to stop moving
for a little while.

771
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:43,296
I tried to turn an impractical
relationship into

772
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,925
something rather than start over,
just because I hate the search.

773
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,049
The search is the worst.
I'm done with it.

774
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:51,138
I'm going back to what
gives me the most pleasure.

775
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:54,320
- You don't told Sheila to take a hike?
- I did. I'm talking about god.

776
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,601
Q brought me back.

777
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,021
I was clinging to this notion of me
as this sexy atheist super-vilain.

778
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:01,227
But that's not me.

779
00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:04,735
I mean, I'm sexy, but I'm not
an atheist and I'm not a super-villain.

780
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:07,989
I'm Dale Kettlewell.

781
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:13,105
Let's get out of here.
I don't think I can spend

782
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,578
one more minute at comic-con.

783
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,790
- Does leopard boy have a theme song?
- I don't think so.

784
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:21,760
Come on. Sing it for us.
I'll get you started.

785
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,420
Who's got spots?

786
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:25,581
I got spots

787
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,706
I got spots...

788
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:33,141
I can't believe he couldn't
be honest with me about a stupid movie.

789
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:36,933
Maybe it can't be like it was.

790
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:40,096
Maybe.

791
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,484
I thought you said
tailing cappie led nowhere.

792
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,920
You're putting your friendship
theory to bed, remember?

793
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,883
I know. I am.

794
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:53,168
Cappie and evan will
never be friends again.

795
00:40:58,143 --> 00:40:59,957
- What's wrong?
- You can't cook.

796
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,125
Leg warmers are not gloves.

797
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,376
And duringclueless,

798
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,838
I literally gagged twice and pretended
that I had popcorn caught in my throat.

799
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,050
That was way harsh.

800
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:15,180
But you do have really cute toes
and the most amazing laugh.

801
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,310
And I am gonna try really,
really hard

802
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:20,587
to make the new ash and fisher
even better than the old one.

803
00:41:22,971 --> 00:41:23,688
Me too.

804
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,747
Who you toasting?

805
00:41:39,905 --> 00:41:41,706
Just raising a glass
to the party gods.

806
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,168
Look at those jackasses.

807
00:41:46,902 --> 00:41:49,630
We should go finish what they started.
No, easy, bro, easy.

808
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:52,075
Those douche bags aren't
worth the trouble.
