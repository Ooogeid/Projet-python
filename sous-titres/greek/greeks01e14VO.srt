1
00:00:00,096 --> 00:00:01,340
Previously on Greek...

2
00:00:01,378 --> 00:00:03,332
I'm gonna be here until
ZBZ nationals determines

3
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:05,345
that you girls are back
on the straight and narrow.

4
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:07,737
I think we could
all use some real fun...

5
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:09,929
- Like a party.
- Agreat gatsby theme party!

6
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:11,647
Did I just fall asleep
with my eyes open?

7
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:13,714
This never would have happened
if Frannie were here.

8
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:15,908
Are you implying your pledges
are better than our pledges?

9
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:18,377
Our pledges could kick
your pledges' asses any day.

10
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:20,693
We always said we weren't gonna
let our houses get in the way

11
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:23,124
- of us being friends.
- Tell me you come bearing gifts.

12
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:25,819
From the Omega Chi front yard!

13
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:28,405
- You ratted out our party.
- There will be retribution.

14
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,018
Bring it.

15
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:36,920
Hey!

16
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:38,094
Hey.

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,453
I've been chasing after
you for the last 100 yards.

18
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:43,127
- Thought you were trying to ignore me.
- No. Sorry.

19
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:46,474
- I'm just really into this book.
- Animal farm.

20
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,431
Cautionary tale of power,

21
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:51,844
as told through farm animals
who overthrow their human masters.

22
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:54,475
Four legs good.
Two legs bad.

23
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:00,646
You know,
just because you made a colossal

24
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:03,962
mistake going back to Omega Chi
doesn't mean I'd ignore you.

25
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:06,214
No. I thought you were just
too embarrassed to talk to me.

26
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:07,209
Embarrassed?

27
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:10,304
Yeah, seeing as how you blatantly
used me to get back at Evan.

28
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,492
Yeah, I guess we both
got a little carried away.

29
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:14,775
Yeah, we did.

30
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:17,835
One second.

31
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,969
All pledges report to the Kappa Tau
house immediately.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,027
Justice has been served.

33
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:29,621
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, you know,

34
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:32,090
just house stuff. If I told you
i'd have to kill you. So...

35
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,772
Me too.
I'll see you later.

36
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:37,553
Okay,
how's my top?

37
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:42,462
There's some cleavage showing.

38
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:44,981
Just think what your grandmother
would want you to wear.

39
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:46,728
My grandmother bought me this top.

40
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:47,663
Here.

41
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:50,408
Just until we get out of the house,
and then we're good to go.

42
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,168
I Miss looking cute.

43
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:53,927
I Miss cute boys!

44
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,910
Lizzi's rules are totally robbing us
of our college experience.

45
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:00,387
She makes us go to bed at 10:00...
So I wake up at 4:00.

46
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:03,937
And do you think it's fun
watching all the drunk couples

47
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:07,048
make out on Greek row when
I know that I should be there?

48
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:09,877
I know how challenging it's been

49
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:11,698
to have Lizzi here.

50
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:13,943
We've hit rock-bottom.

51
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:16,340
But that means there's
nowhere to go but up.

52
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:18,716
Ladies, foyer, please!

53
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,485
We have visitors!

54
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:25,355
May I have your attention?

55
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:31,556
As a reward for all of your hard work
and dedication,

56
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:33,090
i'm very proud to announce

57
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:36,163
that this saturday
I have arranged for us to have...

58
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:40,079
A mixer!

59
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:46,957
So let's meet our guests and show
them the new Zeta Beta Zeta.

60
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:01,957
The Psi Phi Pis.

61
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:03,914
They're "pstoked"?

62
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,049
I believe the "P"
is silent.

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,996
Much like the cry
of despair inside me right now.

64
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,352
I think we've hit a new rock bottom.

65
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:13,597
<i>Hello.</i>

66
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,953
Season 1 - Episode 14
" <i>War & Peace</i> "

67
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:20,913
- Synchro :
¤AkaZab¤  &  Kasius

68
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,942
- Transcript : <i>Swsub-sub</i>

69
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:26,293
Fellow defenders of the free
and easy world.

70
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:30,065
As you all know,
we recently suffered a grave indignity

71
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,037
at the hands of the enemy

72
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:34,585
who seeks to destroy ourway of life.

73
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,006
I refer, of course, to...

74
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:38,719
A certain fraternity and

75
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:41,439
and a certain member of said fraternity

76
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:44,225
who tipped off our good friend
officer huck

77
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,909
about the prohibition party.

78
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,014
<i>- Omega Chi.
- Evan Chambers.</i>

79
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:50,062
They are not worthy of names.

80
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:53,523
But they do however,
deserve our help.

81
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:54,538
Beav?

82
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:03,649
As a one-time photography minor,
what really interests me about this

83
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,576
particular study is
that it is completely

84
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,014
unretouched.

85
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,641
Give 'em one of these, one of those.

86
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:14,217
Give 'em some big teefers.

87
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:19,006
All right, boys, line up.
Let's see if we can't make this

88
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:21,188
fine showpiece complete.
Ben bennett, get up there.

89
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,884
Time to shine.
Come on.

90
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:26,846
Are we gonna sneak the picture
back into the Omega Chi house?

91
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,022
Green as a young sapling.

92
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,894
We're not going back
to the Omega Chi house.

93
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,405
We're gonna wait for Omega Chi
to come to us.

94
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,433
Now...

95
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:39,122
Get your draw on, son.

96
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,478
We're goin'to battle.

97
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,294
Every second that banner stays up here
is a permanent scar on our reputation.

98
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:54,556
It's like a stretch mark.

99
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:56,596
I'm gonna need your help
if we're going to fix this.

100
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:58,146
- Anything.
- You're social chair.

101
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:00,936
Do you think you can convince
the Psi Phi Pis to back out of the mixer

102
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:03,234
without making it look like
they dumped us?

103
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:04,986
Challenging, but doable.

104
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,310
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll take care of Lizzi.

105
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:09,309
Somehow. We've ignored her,

106
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:11,868
snuck around her,
gone along with her.

107
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,580
It just keeps getting worse.

108
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:18,028
I think a little higher on the right,
and then it'll be perfecto.

109
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:20,838
You know, she plays it straight,
but she's gotta have a past too.

110
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:23,533
Maybe she's got, like,
dead people in her closet.

111
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:24,925
You did blackmail Rebecca.

112
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:28,810
And if Lizzi were a diva demon like
Rebecca, it would be much easier.

113
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:31,848
But she's so freakin'perky
and nice.

114
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:53,345
Suit yourself.

115
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,233
Won't be long now.

116
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:02,120
You said that two hours ago.

117
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,363
Is that fear I sense in you, son?

118
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:08,059
Or are you just quivering
with anticipation?

119
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,279
I wish I knew what I was anticipating.

120
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,627
Why are you speaking
with a southern accent?

121
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:15,079
It's the chaw.

122
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,447
Listen.

123
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:19,952
Nobody can predict the twisted mind
of the Omega Chi.

124
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:21,477
But they're coming, spitter.

125
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,001
They're coming hard.

126
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,841
They ain't gonna come polite.

127
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:27,155
Nobody's gonna be ringin'that doorbell.

128
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:34,223
Doorbell. Doorbell.
We've got doorbell. Hot alert.

129
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:36,074
- <i>Red leader?</i>
- Red team is go.

130
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:37,673
- White leader?
- White team is go.

131
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:38,772
Blue leader?

132
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:41,394
<i>Blue leader.</i>

133
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,130
I ordered a pizza.

134
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:47,860
And we all learn the lesson:

135
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:49,684
pack a snack.

136
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:51,811
Here.

137
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:55,187
- Go get the pizza.
- What if it's the Omega Chis?

138
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:56,853
Then tip them poorly.

139
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:02,224
And nail them with hot sauce.
We'll be right behind you. Go on.

140
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:10,475
Sweet moves.

141
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,953
Calvin. What are you doing here?

142
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,710
- Sorry, Rusty.
- Sorry for what?

143
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:25,856
Sorry for this.

144
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,559
Fish smell! Fish smell!

145
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:32,760
<i>We have breach.</i>

146
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,098
<i>Stand by.
Stand by.</i>

147
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,762
Hit the lights!

148
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,609
There it is!

149
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,338
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

150
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,225
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

151
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,651
<i>Spitter, let's go, let's go!</i>

152
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:52,462
<i>- I can't see! Go, go, go!
- We got 'em!</i>

153
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,120
This is gonna be fun.

154
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,886
Omega Chis!

155
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:04,661
These guys were just decoys!
Ambush. Mobilize. Mobilize!

156
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:05,943
<i>Run!</i>

157
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:08,490
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

158
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:11,208
<i>Get down, everybody!
Get down!</i>

159
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:42,706
Hold the fence!

160
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:48,113
<i>Don't breathe it!</i>

161
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,614
Got a large meat lovers for beaver?

162
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,228
Over here.

163
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:33,742
Keep the change.

164
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,388
Enjoy your pie.

165
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:43,861
Egg whites and fruit?

166
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:45,711
You're so healthy.

167
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:49,510
Discipline has become a theme
in my life, thanks to you.

168
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:51,528
Deep down, I think

169
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:54,650
we've all been craving the structure
you've brought to the house.

170
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:57,870
That makes me so happy.

171
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:00,855
And I'm so proud of
our little ZBZ kittens.

172
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:04,791
As... are we all.

173
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:06,979
And I'm thinking

174
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:10,455
that it would really benefit
the sisterhood to have a sense of

175
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,470
when

176
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,407
we... As
ZBZ kittens.

177
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:17,790
Are ready to,

178
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,550
be weaned...

179
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:21,609
From your...

180
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,645
Teat?

181
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,145
You wanna know what it's
gonna take to get me gone.

182
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,161
We don't want to be a burden.

183
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,320
There must be other chapters
in need of your considerable talents.

184
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,460
If we had a chart,
perhaps...

185
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:38,666
A chart!
That would be so cool!

186
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:39,872
Yes.

187
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:40,992
But no.

188
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:43,937
This chapter's independence
is solely up to my own discretion.

189
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:48,996
And,

190
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:50,480
in my mind,

191
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,725
there's really only one thing left
for you to do

192
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:55,233
to prove that you're all back
on the right path.

193
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:00,933
You and I are going on a field trip.

194
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,283
So you want us to do more philanthropy?

195
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:09,081
- That's it?
- Not exactly.

196
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,899
It does involve a little selflessness,
though.

197
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,326
Frannie?

198
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,223
Your lost ZBZ sister.

199
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,035
I thought Frannie was insane
last semester, but I never...

200
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:46,690
So, you've known where Frannie's
been this whole time.

201
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:50,286
Frannie contacted me almost
immediately after I arrived at ZBZ.

202
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,021
And she made it clear that she has
deep regrets for her actions,

203
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,059
and she wanted to make things right.

204
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,779
And you believed her.

205
00:11:57,213 --> 00:12:00,658
Casey, I sincerely
understand your skepticism.

206
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:01,553
You do?

207
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:05,064
I have been selfish
and controlling...

208
00:12:06,137 --> 00:12:08,337
Well, most of my life. But

209
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:10,913
being away has helped
me gain some perspective.

210
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:12,103
Take a hard,

211
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:15,735
honest look at myself and figure out
what I have to do to change.

212
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:19,080
And since Frannie left, she has logged
so many volunteer hours

213
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,280
that if she were still a ZBZ
in good standing,

214
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,559
the cru chapter would be leading
the race right now

215
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,462
for the national philanthropy cup.

216
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,702
Great.
But...

217
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:31,029
We suspended her for abandoning
the sority.

218
00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:33,705
A simple majority vote
can overturn that suspension.

219
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,057
We'd hold the diamond ceremony

220
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:38,873
in which Frannie pledges her
eternal loyalty to the sisters.

221
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:41,325
And then each and every
girl would have to accept.

222
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,923
I wanna come back to ZBZ, Casey.

223
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:46,861
And I want Jessica Simpson
to stop putting out CDS,

224
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:48,981
but you can't always get what you want.

225
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:52,015
She nearly cost us our charter.

226
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:54,317
Forgiveness is the
supreme act of sisterhood.

227
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:59,544
You asked me what you could
do to regain your independence.

228
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,475
This is it.

229
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:04,813
Heal ZBZ's most painful internal wound.

230
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:15,545
Jason?

231
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,378
Hi. I'm ashleigh.

232
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,849
It's weird how we all look the same.

233
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,756
You're Psi Phi Pi social chair

234
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,105
- Jason?
- Yeah.

235
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,590
Sorry.

236
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:32,700
So.

237
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:35,890
You're desperately looking for a way
out of the mixer.

238
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,871
- Not... desperately.
- Why don't you just cancel?

239
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:40,419
Well, we're...

240
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:43,528
Sort of under the thumb of this
rules-obsessed woman

241
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,479
who's totally out of touch

242
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:47,248
- with stuff.
- Like

243
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:49,332
social hierarchy and that sort of thing.

244
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:51,273
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Sure.

245
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,799
So since you can't back
out of the mixer,

246
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:55,456
you want us to.

247
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,705
Which is fine.

248
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,195
Consider it done.

249
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,764
Well, you know, it's not what you think.
Our social calendar is really limited,

250
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,177
and we have to consider our
entire year when we make plans.

251
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:08,838
Any smart social chair would.

252
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,618
Like I said, consider it done.

253
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:13,113
Fine.

254
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:17,766
Did you just call me smart?

255
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,168
Is that a problem?

256
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,762
I just don't want there
to be any hard feelings here.

257
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,370
There aren't any.

258
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,963
Well, I think there are.

259
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:28,923
Okay.
There are.

260
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:32,874
Let's, have some coffee and discuss it.

261
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:34,445
Thank you!

262
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,425
Do I still smell like fish?

263
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,241
Weallstill smell like fish, spitter.

264
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:46,901
Get your daggum chins
out your shoestrings.

265
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:48,661
Okay, now.

266
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:51,071
My Grandcappie used to tell me

267
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,409
that the true test
of a solider don't come until

268
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:56,852
you're full of holes
and ain't got no bullets left. Now,

269
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:59,317
we may be bleedin'
and shooting blanks.

270
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:02,472
We may smell like the stuff you find
at the bottom of a catfish barrel,

271
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:03,823
but this ain't over!

272
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,013
This ain't even close to bein'over!

273
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:07,797
It kinda feels over.

274
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,417
Hot sauce in my chaw pouch.

275
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:17,552
Pledge.

276
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:21,885
Thank you.

277
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,478
That's because you don't
know about the counterattack, beav.

278
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:26,957
What... counterattack?

279
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:28,970
The biggest one ever.

280
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:29,973
Yeah.

281
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,266
Who's planning it?

282
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:33,477
Beaver.

283
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,218
Yeah. And me.

284
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,626
And wade.

285
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:39,782
And whoever else has the persimmons

286
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,385
to pull themselves out of the pity pool

287
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:43,554
and reload

288
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,409
like a true Kappa Tau.

289
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,026
Now, who's in?

290
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,416
I said who's in?

291
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,061
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah...</i>

292
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:54,948
Come on.

293
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:59,284
- Hey, Cap, can I talk to you?
- Yeah. Morale's low, spitter.

294
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,321
- What do you got for me?
- I hate Evan

295
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,770
as much as you do, for many reasons.

296
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,132
But if we launch a counterattack,
the Omega Chis are gonna

297
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,133
counter our counterattack.

298
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:12,607
And then we'll counter their
counter of our counterattack,

299
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:16,021
and it'll go on and on and on
until dean bowman busts us

300
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:18,490
or someone gets really hurt.

301
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,637
I mean, it's like, what's the point?

302
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,593
What's the...

303
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,520
What's the point in defending the honor
of a bunch of guys

304
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,604
who vowed to protect you
as you have them?

305
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,903
I'm sorry, spitter. I don't really know
how to answer that one.

306
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,752
Keep working!

307
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:49,169
And I really want to apologize
for calling you stout.

308
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,362
You're not.

309
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:55,114
And Mandi, I am so, so sorry

310
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:57,424
I told you your boyfriend was gay.

311
00:16:58,652 --> 00:16:59,994
You never told me that.

312
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:03,558
Well... i was...
Certainly thinking it.

313
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:05,841
And I'm deeply sorry for that.

314
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:10,450
The sisters are way too smart
to buy her "thank you, India" act.

315
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,893
Although she does
kinda look like alanis.

316
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,596
What? Like with her hair like that.

317
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:21,295
Heather, if going plaid is your plan,
then it's my plan too.

318
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:24,386
Is it true that if Frannie's reinstated,
lizzi will be gone?

319
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:26,843
Did Frannie tell you that?
Is it true or not?

320
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,060
There

321
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:30,529
would have to be a majority vote

322
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:33,069
of the sisterhood to Even consider
bringing her back.

323
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,515
Then we hold this really

324
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,193
complicated ceremony,

325
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:39,609
and there the decision
has to be unanimous to let her back in.

326
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:41,634
I know you guys want Lizzi gone,

327
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,041
but do you seriously
think Frannie has changed?

328
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,670
Think about how she treated you.

329
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:49,762
Then ask yourself if you really
want to go through that again.

330
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:55,280
It looks like our friends over
at Psi Phi Pi

331
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,537
have made this saturday's big event...

332
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,866
The biggest news on campus.

333
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:01,689
I'm so excited!

1
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,504
I think I'm ready to vote.

2
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:13,060
I can't believe no one else had the guts

3
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,374
to vote against
holding the diamond ceremony.

4
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,601
- I feel so antiwar right now.
- Lizzi's been so annoying,

5
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:21,185
everybody's forgotten had bad
Frannie really is.

6
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:22,766
And now she's back.

7
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,173
Not necessarily.

8
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:28,016
All it takes is one sister to say no
during the diamond ceremony

9
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:30,714
- to keep her out.
- I don't know much about politics

10
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,494
other than it's the only time
it's okay to wear buttons.

11
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:37,370
But, as president, aren't you supposed
to follow the wishes of the sisterhood?

12
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,705
Not if it hurts us in the long run.

13
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:42,074
And you're one to talk, by the way.

14
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:44,420
What happened to getting the PPPs
to back out of the mixer?

15
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:47,925
- Did you talk to their social chair?
- Yes, I did.

16
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:50,391
And they said they would back out.
But then.

17
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:51,661
I don't know.

18
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,345
We ended up having coffee, and then...

19
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:56,931
somehow the mixer ended up
being back on.

20
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,529
And... I don't know.

21
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:03,692
You had coffee
with the Psi Phi Pi social chair?

22
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:05,530
And now you like him?

23
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:10,348
He's totally awkward
and smart in the least attractive way.

24
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,197
- Still, there's something about him.
- Really.

25
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,161
Could it be that...

26
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:17,675
I don't know, he's a guy?

27
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:20,379
- You said it yourself. You miss boys.
- I know that,

28
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:22,093
but this is different.

29
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:26,270
I've never met Jason before, and yet,
it's like I've known him forever.

30
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:30,993
And I know it's totally creepy,
but at the same time...

31
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,166
Disturbingly hot.

32
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,764
Make a little room for me?

33
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:49,885
Might not wanna get too close.
I smell like an ahi burrito.

34
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:53,325
Let me guess...
Fish oil and hot sauce.

35
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:56,407
- You heard?
- I heard.

36
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:58,242
It's kinda stupid, huh?

37
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:01,534
If it wasn't stupid,
it wouldn't be boys fighting.

38
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,209
You ever feel like everybody around you
has completely lost their mind?

39
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,530
Last night when I was
under the barbecue,

40
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,802
I saw Beaver smearing mayonnaise
on an Omega Chi pledge.

41
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:14,714
People are who they are. Just because
one says they're gonna be different

42
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:17,470
- doesn't mean they will be.
- Same goes for pigs.

43
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:19,296
See? You're all crazy.

44
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:23,734
It's an allegory using barnyard animals
to criticize the russian revolution.

45
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,820
How even the purest minds

46
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,190
can be corrupted by leaders
who are addicted to power.

47
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:31,818
- Sounds alarmingly familiar.
- You read it?

48
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,657
But Frannie's doing
this whole born again nice person act,

49
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,412
- everybody wants her reinstated but me.
- Wasn't she gone?

50
00:20:38,532 --> 00:20:41,239
She's back, and
since I'm the leader of the resistance,

51
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,525
which is basically just me and Ashleigh,

52
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,289
Lizzi makes me go through mediation.

53
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:47,789
Mediation.

54
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:53,503
- That's actually a really good idea.
- I doubt it.

55
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:55,925
You never know until you try.

56
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,557
Phase one of mediation
is airing of grievances.

57
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:04,287
There can be no yelling,
no interrupting,

58
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:06,012
no scoffing, and no face making.

59
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,194
And to avoid accusations,
each point of interest

60
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:11,890
must begin with the words
"I feel."

61
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,151
I feel...

62
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:22,990
that Frannie put the entire sisterhood
in jeopardy by advocating a policy

63
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,058
of dishonesty in handling
our crisis with Nationals.

64
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:30,150
I also feel that her abuse
of chapter funds and decision

65
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,837
to leave the house after being removed
as president showed

66
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,382
that the well-being of the sisterhood
was not her primary concern.

67
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:38,843
That was very well done.

68
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:42,097
Frannie, it's your turn.

69
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:45,073
I feel...

70
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,292
that...

71
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:50,565
I have no grievances to air.

72
00:21:52,735 --> 00:21:53,816
Was that a scoff?

73
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,978
A... hiccup?

74
00:21:57,337 --> 00:21:58,337
Sorry.

75
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,833
All right.

76
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,354
What{\, specifically,} do you need from Frannie
in order to accept her back?

77
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:08,289
Not only into Zeta Beta Zeta,
but back into your heart.

78
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:18,278
- I need...
- I feel.

79
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,508
I feel.

80
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:22,021
I don't know.

81
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:25,359
That I need Frannie to...

82
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:27,642
make things right.

83
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,815
I feel that...

84
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,401
I can't do anything to change the past.

85
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,777
But I promise...

86
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:41,116
to do everything I can as a sister

87
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,950
and a friend to redeem myself
in the present.

88
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:48,829
Is that satisfactory?

89
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:52,500
- I'm sorry, it's not.
- What's the problem?

90
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:56,376
She doesn't mean it.
How can I be the only one to see?

91
00:22:56,496 --> 00:22:59,514
- Violation.
- This is just not going to happen.

92
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,514
I'd like my privacy.

93
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:24,138
Perfect.

94
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:27,037
I know you're upset, and I honor that.

95
00:23:28,226 --> 00:23:29,766
I just thought if...

96
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:34,014
We spoke privately, we could
get underneath...

97
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:37,806
- what's bothering you.
- You are what's bothering me.

98
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:40,058
There's nothing to get underneath.

99
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm really trying here.

100
00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:45,991
- Maybe you could do the same.
- Please.

101
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:50,182
You and I both know that nice Frannie
is just a new way to manipulate people.

102
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:53,763
- It's what you've always done.
- You have a selective memory.

103
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:57,440
And here are the memories I've selected.

104
00:23:57,956 --> 00:24:01,381
You wanted to give my room to Rebecca
because of her father's private jet.

105
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:04,489
You tried to sabotage my chances
to become Omega Chi Sweetheart.

106
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,191
You guilted me into staying
with Evan after he cheated on me.

107
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:11,514
Then when our relationship was no longer
helpful to you,

108
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:12,884
you broke us up.

109
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,207
Are there some other highlights
I've missed?

110
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:16,832
Look...

111
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:21,917
I've done my best to take
responsibility for my mistakes.

112
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:24,809
But you act like I made you stay
with Evan.

113
00:24:25,471 --> 00:24:26,594
It was your choice.

114
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,597
It was also your choice
to haze Rebecca out of spite,

115
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,868
which put me in the awkward position of
having to discipline my little sister.

116
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,338
Who eventually...

117
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:39,840
Went behind my back to Tegan
and stole my presidency.

118
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:44,070
I didn't steal your presidency. I did
what I had to do to save the house.

119
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:47,596
- You should have talked to me first.
- And you should have been a friend.

120
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:50,117
But you were completely
incapable of doing that.

121
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:55,793
You don't want me here?

122
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:58,801
Fine.

123
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,125
Good luck spending the rest of the year
with Lizzi.

124
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:12,379
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

125
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:17,115
- This is a bad idea.
- It's a great idea.

126
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:19,313
Shouldn't we be able
to be in separate fraternities

127
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:21,239
and still have a normal friendship?

128
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,925
But right now,
things are still totally agro.

129
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,279
- And Cappie and Evan hate each other.
- Exactly. That's my whole point.

130
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:30,324
Now is not the time, okay?
Please don't do this.

131
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:32,480
I have to do this.

132
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,177
You lost?

133
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,294
I'm not lost.
I'm here to make a proposition.

134
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:52,008
My proposition is we clean
the toilet with his brillo head.

135
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,690
Let's hear what he has to say.

136
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:03,677
I'm here to make a case for peace
between Omega Chi and Kappa Tau.

137
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:09,234
Pipe it, guys. Come on, look,
he had the nuts to walk in here alone.

138
00:26:09,772 --> 00:26:12,522
Give him a chance to say his piece.
Go ahead.

139
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,057
I know there are plenty
of good guys in this fraternity.

140
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:19,827
There are plenty of
good guys in Kappa Tau.

141
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:22,042
So here's my question:
why are we enemies?

142
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,234
I'll tell you why.

143
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:26,463
Because we let a conflict
between two people

144
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:30,467
or maybe three people become a war
involving us all.

145
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:32,926
Are we just barnyard animals,

146
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:36,446
blindly following our leader
into a battle we don't even understand?

147
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:39,242
Or are we intelligent
people who see the value

148
00:26:39,362 --> 00:26:42,828
in an alliance between
the two best fraternities on campus?

149
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:46,598
If we work together,
we can make this happen.

150
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:51,426
It all starts with getting the people
that have a problem with each other

151
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:54,645
in the same room
and helping them solve their diff...

152
00:27:15,744 --> 00:27:17,094
Officer Huck. Hey.

153
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:20,237
- How's the fungus coming along?
- Save it.

154
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:22,801
- He one of yours?
- Our best and brightest.

155
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:25,522
Who's responsible for the prank?
I want names.

156
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,289
Think he's ratting us out right now?

157
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:31,320
Cappie's gonna want revenge
on his own terms.

158
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:35,407
He's probably just telling Officer Huck
some lame story to make him go away.

159
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:37,409
It's actually a physics experiment.

160
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,610
Gone awry.

161
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,558
A physics experiment?

162
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:45,571
How heat affects the molecular
structure of lode-bearing adhesives,

163
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,212
which, as, I'm sure you know,

164
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,910
creates a highly volatile results set.

165
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,690
You okay, buddy?

166
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,754
You hang in there, okay?

167
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:56,868
Kinda feel bad about this.

168
00:27:56,988 --> 00:28:00,325
He knew what he was getting into
when he walked into the house.

169
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,445
True.

170
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:04,671
Do you feel bad 'cause you really
believe we shouldn't have done it,

171
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:08,041
or because you're worried
about what Rusty will think?

172
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:09,941
There's a difference.

173
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:13,988
Everybody always says that
leadership is about compromise,

174
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,616
I never thought I'd have to
make a decision like this.

175
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,742
You girls take everything so seriously.

176
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:22,370
In the grand scheme of things,
who gets to live in a sorority house?

177
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,383
- It's pretty meaningless.
- Excuse me?

178
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:30,038
Did I tell you that Jason
is an astrophysics major?

179
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:33,756
- He knows Rusty.
- Could you get us some more macchiatos?

180
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,760
- Sure.
- Single shot of espresso.

181
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,678
- Small dollop of foam.
- Right.

182
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,364
I know of your brother.
But he's a...

183
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:48,211
A polymer engineer.

184
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:51,156
So it's not like
we have a lot to talk about.

185
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:54,387
- That's weird.
- Not really.

186
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,697
Polymers are as interesting
as a dirt sandwich.

187
00:28:57,446 --> 00:29:00,758
What's weird is I feel
like I've met you before.

188
00:29:01,762 --> 00:29:03,012
Highly unlikely.

189
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:06,566
- I am gonna go hit the head, Carrie.
- It's Casey.

190
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:13,340
Right. I'm sorry.
I'm so bad with names.

191
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:16,584
Bad with...

192
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,882
- My God, that's it!
- Where's Jason?

193
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:22,436
In the bathroom.

194
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:26,718
Remember how you said you felt
like you've known this guy forever?

195
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:31,484
It only seems like forever.

196
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:35,157
The truth is, you've known
him for the past seven years.

197
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,780
Jason is Travis.
In a dork suit.

198
00:29:40,096 --> 00:29:43,851
Jason is nothing like Travis.
Travis was tall and hot.

199
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,241
And...

200
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:48,077
And rude,

201
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:51,072
arrogant and disrespectful.

202
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:53,587
And had you fetching drinks
you don't even like.

203
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:56,215
He called me Carrie.

204
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,781
I am so...

205
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:03,073
daytime talk show material.
What is wrong with me?

1
00:30:01,786 --> 00:30:03,258
What is wrong with me?

2
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:05,906
Well, maybe you didn't
find him so much

3
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:07,587
attractive

4
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,531
but

5
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:09,645
familiar.

6
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:11,351
We all repeat patterns.

7
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:12,126
No.

8
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:14,289
I thought he was attractive.

9
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:17,602
And that's a pattern
that's gonna end right now.

10
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:19,078
Come with me.

11
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:25,412
Listen up, Jason.

12
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:27,804
Or should I say Travis?

13
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,462
You...
go find a tree.

14
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:35,193
I spent seven years letting
you make me feel like I wasn't pretty

15
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:38,416
or smart or refined
enough to be worthy. And

16
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,645
I'm not gonna do it anymore.
I'm not gonna be attracted

17
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:43,631
this
anymore.

18
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:47,028
Because I am smart,
and I'm hot,

19
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:49,854
and nobody I spend time
with is gonna disrespect me

20
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,585
or my friends... ever.

21
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:52,801
So

22
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:56,118
you know what you're gonna do now?
You're gonna go back to your house,

23
00:30:56,262 --> 00:30:58,201
and you're gonna say
that as social chair,

24
00:30:58,265 --> 00:31:01,570
you think it's in everybody's
best interest to cancel the mixer.

25
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:03,072
Why would I do that?

26
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:04,738
Because, if you don't,

27
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:07,082
i'll tell everyone what I saw.

28
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,706
Or, actually,
didn't see

29
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:11,487
while I was in here.

30
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,615
I think...
We can go now.

31
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:16,742
Yes, we can.

32
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:27,983
Hey.

33
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:29,825
Just came by to, you know,

34
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,265
- see how you're doing.
- And then what? You and the brothers

35
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:33,831
gonna go club some baby seals?

36
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:34,731
Well,

37
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,363
are they Kappa Tau baby seals?
Because maybe...

38
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,582
Come on.

39
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,702
Rusty, it was a college prank,
all right?

40
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:44,304
You can't take it so personally.

41
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:50,373
It's funny you say that, 'cause
I keep thinking how it would have played

42
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,410
out if you'd gone
to the Kappa Tau house.

43
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,740
I never would have let that same
thing happen to you.

44
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:56,137
I warned you, all right?

45
00:31:56,198 --> 00:31:58,776
I told you going in it was not
a good idea. You didn't listen.

46
00:31:58,857 --> 00:32:01,793
They abducted me and taped
me to the side of a building.

47
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,798
- You did nothing to stop it.
- It was a prank!

48
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:07,477
Come on.

49
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,281
I've got studying to do.

50
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:21,007
Okay.

51
00:32:40,894 --> 00:32:43,167
Since I'm gonna be staying until
the end of the year,

52
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:45,348
I thought I would make
my room a little homier.

53
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:46,885
And this danish furniture...

54
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,463
It's so snazzy!

55
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:49,672
And economical.

56
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,187
Now,
I am all about this farnsek bureau...

57
00:32:52,214 --> 00:32:54,268
But maybe the blogaard bookshelf
would just be a more

58
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,709
practical use of my space.

59
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:57,586
Is there some other thing

60
00:32:57,706 --> 00:32:59,342
we can do as sisters

61
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:00,642
to be independent

62
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:02,632
other than readmitting Frannie?

63
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:05,146
Wish there was, Casey.
That's the only solution.

64
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,361
I know you said forgiveness is

65
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:09,175
the ultimate act of sisterhood.

66
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:11,504
But how can I do something

67
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:14,597
when every fiber
of my being tells me it's wrong?

68
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:20,095
Read this.

69
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:23,043
I read this as a pledge.

70
00:33:23,107 --> 00:33:24,630
It's not like there's some

71
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,919
ritual for behavior modification.

72
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,146
Sometimes a second, closer examination

73
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:31,162
can reveal things you didn't see before.

74
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:35,086
Now,
if I go with the blogaard bookshelf,

75
00:33:35,105 --> 00:33:37,546
i'm totally getting
the smeglon nightstand.

76
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:46,718
- Hey, Cappie.
- Spitter,

77
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:49,357
good to see you're out and about.
Here, come check these out.

78
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,515
Schematics of the Omega Chi house.
First drawn in 1979.

79
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,087
Then carefully added to

80
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:01,720
and adjusted by each class ever since.

81
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:05,410
Egyptian Joe, head of the plumbing
after the war of'04.

82
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:08,046
The only thing we don't
have is the air vents.

83
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:09,190
These will help.

84
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:11,884
You still looking for
a counterattack idea?

85
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,062
Well, I was waiting for inspiration
to strike at any moment.

86
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:17,482
Unless you've got something.

87
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:19,519
Yeah. I think I do.

88
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:24,036
To reaffirm the spirit

89
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:26,608
and foundation of the Diamond Ceremony,

90
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,075
we will begin with the sacred

91
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:31,877
Zeta Beta Zeta
pledge of sisterhood.

92
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:34,788
To the sisterhood, we pledge truth...

93
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,568
<i>Loyalty, and sority.</i>

94
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,147
<i>Unrestricted, our commitment.</i>

95
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:42,621
<i>Unconditional, our allegiance.</i>

96
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:46,256
<i>With hearts and souls
that are forevermore</i>

97
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:48,274
<i>Zeta Beta Zeta.</i>

98
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,624
With humility,

99
00:34:52,178 --> 00:34:53,575
I pledge my soul

100
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,459
to Zeta Beta Zeta.

101
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:57,302
I accept your pledge.

102
00:34:57,691 --> 00:34:59,629
And I welcome you back into my heart.

103
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:11,329
With humility,

104
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:13,081
I pledge my soul

105
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:14,830
to Zeta Beta Zeta.

106
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:17,983
I accept your pledge.

107
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,124
And I welcome you back into my heart.

108
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:37,383
With humility, I pledge my soul

109
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:39,569
to Zeta Beta Zeta.

110
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,583
I accept your pledge and welcome
you back into my heart.

111
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:59,577
With humility,
I pledge my soul

112
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:01,433
to Zeta Beta Zeta.

113
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:18,024
I accept
your pledge

114
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:21,309
and welcome you back into my heart.

115
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:39,095
Stop it.
You gotta stop.

116
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:41,288
Casey...

117
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:46,781
That's a cow!
That's a cow!

118
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:21,478
Truly inspired idea, spitter.

119
00:37:21,788 --> 00:37:22,884
How do you feel?

120
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:25,407
Good.

121
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:27,498
I feel good.

122
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:30,976
Guess we'd better reinforce
the house before they strike back.

123
00:37:31,054 --> 00:37:31,706
Hey!

124
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:32,868
Too late.

125
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:35,250
Quite a mixer you boys
must have had last night.

126
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,528
Is this a new sorority, or...
You will pay for this.

127
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:38,459
Chambers.

128
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:40,971
Dean bowman wants names and specifics.

129
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:41,866
Yeah.

130
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:46,765
You take us down,
and you will go with us.

131
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:48,047
Or...

132
00:37:48,323 --> 00:37:49,143
Or what?

133
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,298
Or...

134
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,552
we let things cool off,

135
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:54,971
turn our swords into plowshares

136
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:56,881
for the time being.

137
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:02,428
For the time being.

138
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,062
Chambers!

139
00:38:06,722 --> 00:38:07,896
For the time being.

140
00:38:12,364 --> 00:38:13,847
We're gonna start farming?

141
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,827
Perhaps, wade.
Perhaps.

142
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:18,959
But it will be the memories
of this victory that sustain us

143
00:38:19,585 --> 00:38:21,859
until the fires of war burn again.

144
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:25,397
Let's go get some pizza.

145
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:43,516
Who better
to be my welcoming committee?

146
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,542
I thought I'd start moving back in
gradually.

147
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,418
I'm so glad we were able
to come to this agreement.

148
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,724
- It's good to be home.
- I'm glad too.

149
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:56,025
But I wish you had called before
you packed everything up.

150
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,640
Is Lizzi still in my room?
I don't mind waiting.

151
00:38:58,678 --> 00:39:02,647
Are you familiar with rule 57q
in the ZBZ book of rules and ritual?

152
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:04,757
57q.

153
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:06,913
It states that the ZBZ president
has the right

154
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,028
To put recently reinstated
members on probation.

155
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:11,719
It does.

156
00:39:11,846 --> 00:39:15,103
Yes. And since actives on probation
aren't allowed to live in the house,

157
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:17,399
i'm sorry to tell you that ZBZ rules

158
00:39:17,428 --> 00:39:19,424
prevent you from moving in today.

159
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:21,959
Are you sorry...

160
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:23,042
Casey?

161
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:25,613
The agreement was that
you would be reinstated.

162
00:39:25,701 --> 00:39:28,235
And you are.
But for the good of the sisterhood,

163
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:31,249
we need to be sure
that you really have changed.

164
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:34,903
Well, whatever's
best for the sisterhood.

165
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:36,805
I'm glad you understand.

166
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,829
I do.

167
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:40,565
And besides...

168
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:44,235
You can't keep me on probation
for more than three months.

169
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,946
I believe that's rule 62.

170
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:01,119
You smell that, spitter?

171
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:03,314
It's the smell of peace.

172
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:06,150
I'm actually talking about the coffee
here. Having a little moment.

173
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:10,205
Yes, absolutely.

174
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:13,226
Vacationing off the sumatran
coast two summers ago...

175
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,996
Alonecon me bella mentor, altagracia.

176
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:20,143
Sumatra is an Island off Indonesia.

177
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:22,054
People there speak Malaysian.

178
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,809
- They do?
- Yeah.

179
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:25,598
Well, that explains a lot.

180
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:29,878
- Hey.
- Hey.

181
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:37,505
Have you ever had any
friends outside the fraternity?

182
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,555
Sure. Yeah.

183
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:40,813
Jana.

184
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,561
Julia.

185
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:45,988
Rachel.
She was an especially good friend.

186
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:47,576
No, no.
I mean guy friends.

187
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,989
Right...

188
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,516
Then the answer's no.

189
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:52,490
Well, weren't you friends with Evan?

190
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:53,780
Yes.

191
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,342
Evan Longoria
and I roomed together freshman year,

192
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:57,982
as you well know. But,

193
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:00,926
there were numerous factors
that led to our breakup.

194
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:05,180
Friendships in college
are sort of like Cro-Magnon man.

195
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:07,858
They either evolve
or they become extinct.

196
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,789
Now, for you and Calvin,
it's all gonna depend on how much energy

197
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,614
you're willing to put into

198
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,230
adapting.

199
00:41:14,526 --> 00:41:15,854
Yeah. I guess it's hard

200
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:18,981
knowing whether we're evolving
or dying out.

201
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,085
Well, only time will tell.

202
00:41:21,751 --> 00:41:23,547
- Meanwhile...
- Dobler's.

203
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,903
See? You are adapting.

204
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,963
I wanted to return this.

205
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:38,015
And say thank you.

206
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:39,618
Guess I finally realized

207
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,904
I could use the rules
to help me get what I want instead

208
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:44,086
of trying to figure
out a way to go around them.

209
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:46,339
You're becoming an excellent leader,
Casey.

210
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:48,094
And I want you to keep the book.

211
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:49,821
One question.

212
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,547
Were you specifically thinking of rule

213
00:41:52,603 --> 00:41:55,398
57q when you told me to reread the book?

214
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:57,534
Rule 57q.

215
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:00,619
I'm not familiar.

216
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:05,916
So...

217
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:08,460
- where are you off to?
- Oklahoma chapter.

218
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,324
Hazing gone haywire.

219
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:14,582
Farewell, my sisters.

220
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:17,200
Keep the principles of Zeta Beta Zeta

221
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,089
close to your heart always.

222
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:22,334
Farewell.

223
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,993
<i>Bye!</i>

224
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:29,767
<i>Bye!</i>

225
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:40,831
I sure am gonna miss Lizzi.

226
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:42,694
Really?

227
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,144
Not at all.
