1
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,925
Greek Week's a bigger deal
than I'd imagined.

2
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:08,278
Biggest Greek-on-Greek competition
of all.

3
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,343
If our friendship's going to be
tested anywhere, it's here.

4
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,318
Which is why we are...

5
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:14,661
Switzerland.

6
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:16,719
Cappie swears
by their method of neutrality

7
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:19,758
- in dealing with Rebecca vs Casey.
- We survived six hours being trappe

8
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:22,329
in Dale's car listening to Amy Grant,
all right?

9
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,261
- Together we can withstand anything.
- When he busted out the Christmas...

10
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,916
I was ready to launch myself
out a window.

11
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:31,373
- But I would've thrown you out first.
- Now that's friendship.

12
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:35,479
<i>Welcome everyone
to the 63rd Annual</i>

13
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,429
<i>Greek Week Olympiad!</i>

14
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:40,585
<i>I now give you the Parade of Houses.</i>

15
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,723
<i>Alpha Sigma Rho.</i>

16
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,056
<i>Beta Theta Tau.</i>

17
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:49,394
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Where is it?

18
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:52,241
- I don't know.
- <i>Gamma Psi Alpha.</i>

19
00:01:57,237 --> 00:02:00,208
- Time to cross the border.
- We'll always have Zurich!

20
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:07,958
We are so going to win again,
I can practically taste our victory!

21
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,843
And what does it taste like?

22
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,745
Cheesecake miraculously devoid
of calories.

23
00:02:13,913 --> 00:02:16,925
The Gamma Psi Alphas are looking
pretty scary-buff this year.

24
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:19,650
They've all have Madonna arms
from doing power yoga.

25
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,746
I will not be the first ZBZ president
in ten years to give up this trophy.

26
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:25,027
We are winners
and cementing our winning status

27
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,775
is going to be the cornerstone
of my presidential campaign.

28
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:31,267
I plan to be the legitimate,
elected president of ZBZ.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,138
I am no Gerald Ford!

30
00:02:33,843 --> 00:02:35,324
Frannie taught me that one.

31
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:37,308
But I don't want to get too confident.

32
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:39,873
I must first focus
on a Greek Week victory.

33
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,570
Even the Ice Queen looks melty.

34
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:46,824
Think about it: We escaped Myrtle
unscathed by Logangate '08.

35
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,071
She looks so perky.
Seriously, if my Dad did that...

36
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:53,987
I don't care how she acts as long as the
only perky thing she shows off this week

37
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,452
is her attitude.

38
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:58,509
<i>And our reigning sorority champions,</i>

39
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,054
<i>Zeta Beta Zeta.</i>

40
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:06,384
<i>This week's Greek Olympiad events
include the Tug of War</i>

41
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,184
<i>Powder Puff Sorority Football game,</i>

42
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:10,924
<i>the Human Pyramid,</i>

43
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,792
<i>the Fraternity Cheerleading Contest,</i>

44
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:16,177
<i>the Ultimate Relay Race...</i>

45
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,312
Just look at the spectacle.

46
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:28,497
This is even better than the ice-skating
cows, Torino opening ceremonies, 2006.

47
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:31,113
- Cap's a big fan of the Olympics.
- More than a fan.

48
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:34,804
- I'm an Olympic historian.
- <i>The reigning fraternity champions,</i>

49
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,043
<i>Omega Chi Delta!</i>

50
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,234
The insurance salesmen convention's
a few hundred miles to the left,

51
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:57,784
- in Toledo!
- Take a good look at that trophy.

52
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,901
It'll be your only chance
to see it up close.

53
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:02,577
I thought it was your Oscar
for Best Actress in a Supporting Role,

54
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:05,106
- Evan-gelina Jolie.
- Laugh it up now.

55
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,716
You guys are gonna be crying
when we're done with you.

56
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:10,168
Like you cried
when we beat you in beer pong?

57
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,337
Like when we kicked your asses
at floor hockey.

58
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,165
You won on a technicality.

59
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:16,955
But since I'm so generous,
we'll call it a draw.

60
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,795
- Greek Week is the tie-breaker.
- Yes, it is.

61
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,741
Do you think later this afternoon
we could talk?

62
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:32,841
That is Rebecca Logan!

63
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:37,746
- What?
- Pledge gone wild at spring break.

64
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:42,326
I think we have
a code pink situation here.

65
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,009
The miracle cheesecake
just got fattening.

66
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:48,825
<i>In the spirit of Greek unity,
I hereby declare open</i>

67
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,985

[Sub-way.fr]

72
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:16,568
You{\ sure you} wanna stay{\ here}?

73
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:19,537
Why should I bury my head in the sand

74
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:22,455
because certain people without lives
resort to Internet voyeurism

75
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,525
in a pathetic attempt
to justify their existence?

76
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,554
So, did you see the video?

77
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:35,953
Too bad they missed the part
where I got punched in the face.

78
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,289
I told you how sorry I am
about all that.

79
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:43,406
You were drunk and the whole thing
with your dad, I get it.

80
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,895
It's water over the bridge,

81
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:47,049
under the dam,

82
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,979
whatever. Same with the video. Everyone
is gonna be bored with it by tomorrow.

83
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,941
- Not according to my dad.
- You called him?

84
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:58,318
He called me.

85
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:02,513
Instead of apologizing for bringing
our{\ dirty little} family secrets out in the open,

86
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,034
he had the nerve to discipline me.

87
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:09,058
For whatever damage this video
may cause his situation.

88
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,619
"Lay low.
Ride out the storm."

89
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,550
He always uses clichés.
He's a politician, after all.

90
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:19,700
Your dad's delivery was lame,
but you know, maybe he has a point.

91
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:23,471
Keep your head down,
focus on Greek Week and the Zbzs.

92
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,562
Give your sisters a chance.
You might be underestimating them.

93
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:35,605
I'm gonna have to think about that one.

94
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:42,070
I could use another beer.
You want anything?

95
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:45,304
Actually,
I've put in enough of an appearance.

96
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:48,844
I'm gonna head back to the house,
get some rest for the big week ahead.

97
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:58,388
Maybe we can find
a way to put her out of commission.

98
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:00,797
Step away from the kneecap,
Tonya Harding.

99
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:04,256
I'm thinking we call her
in front of the Standards Board

100
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,326
for the spring break incident.

101
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,088
Nip this in the kneecap now,

102
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,058
because inevitably
Nationals will see that video.

103
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,685
By then we can tell them
we've already handled it.

104
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:16,809
I'd like to avoid another special
guest star appearance from Tegan.

105
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,815
She is a little scary.
Really good hair, though.

106
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,196
I just have to say I am so impressed
with your presidential prowess.

107
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:30,202
I'm gonna go check with Laura, make sure
everyone has their spirit shirts.

108
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,165
She's being more supportive
than a pair of Spanx.

109
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:39,247
New, nice, de-clawed Frannie.

110
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,486
How's it feel to be dating
an Internet star?

111
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:51,426
How does it feel to be dating...

112
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,871
- nobody?
- Because I'm pretty sure

113
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:57,541
just about everybody on campus
has seen her in action by now.

114
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:03,775
Did you know that one time
Evan pooped his pants at Camp Kitchiwa?

115
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:07,041
Did you realize
when Cappie started dating Rebecca,

116
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,911
he took my sloppy seconds?

117
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,519
Watch it, Bing, watch it!

118
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:21,343
Who knew Ben-Hur
would be such a hot ticket?

119
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,486
I can't believe we had to get these
a day in advance. Dale was right.

120
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,895
I{\f you think about it, i}t is one of the few movies
that has something for everyone:

121
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,265
Jesus for Dale.

122
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,274
Buff gladiators for me.

123
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:34,392
Roman history for the more studious
among us.

124
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:37,439
And a leprosy subplot
for really for everyone.

125
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:41,523
You consorting with the enemy?

126
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,026
- Very funny.
- Who says I'm joking?

127
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,197
I am.
Barely.

128
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:51,900
But I do assume
if you're hanging out with this guy,

129
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,266
you must be doing
some re-con work on the Kts.

130
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,713
He's trying to spy on the Kts

131
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:02,261
to try and learn how not to be lame.

132
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:06,230
Maybe you guys can learn a thing or two.

133
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:09,510
Because you are lame.

134
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:15,229
We're headed to the house
to practice for the final relay.

135
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,977
- It's Greek Week.
- I'll be right behind you guys.

136
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,588
- We're cool, right?
- Yeah. One more test for Switzerland.

137
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:38,105
The entirety of your ZBZ-emblazoned
bosom was all over my computer screen.

138
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:42,619
We absolutely do not want to demonstrate
that this type of raunchy behavior

139
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:45,193
is in any way indicative
of ZBZ-ian values.

140
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:49,415
Entirety of my bosom aside, it certainly
looked like I was having fun, right?

141
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:52,844
Maybe we could use this
as a recruiting tool for rush.

142
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:55,513
This violation warrants
an immediate suspension.

143
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:58,067
She's right.
We've called you here today

144
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:01,499
because we should've punished you
right after the incident occurred.

145
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,374
But I was there,
we all understand how upset you were,

146
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:07,496
and, well, everyone does things
they don't plan to do.

147
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,518
- Especially over spring break.
- Just ask Betsy.

148
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:12,698
She ended up
with a one-way ticket to rehab.

149
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:14,790
Bottom line, you violated ZBZ standards,

150
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,245
and therefore we are fining you
with 20 hours of sister service.

151
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,297
Sister service?

152
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,910
- Sorority-centric community service.
- I know what it is.

153
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,868
Instead of picking up highway trash,
I get to, what,

154
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:28,738
apply Laura's self-tanner?

155
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:31,186
- Lucky me.
- You are lucky.

156
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:33,677
And you should be grateful
we're going easy on you.

157
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:36,221
You have to think about the sorority.

158
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:39,683
So I strongly encourage you
to lay low and ride out this storm.

159
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:41,394
Trust me,

160
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,019
it's for your own good.

161
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,700
I can't believe
how sprightly those guys are.

162
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,204
We're gonna blow
the Ocs out of the water!

163
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:02,998
Those guys are such assfaces.

164
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,557
We should never take for granted

165
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:09,654
how lucky we are to be in a house whose
brothers have their priorities straight.

166
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:13,161
Because of instead of controlling jerks
like the Omega Chis,

167
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:16,186
the Kts know what really matters
is friendship.

168
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,677
And fun.

169
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,109
I present to you this year's Greek Week

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,381
Powder Puff cheer squad:
The Kappa Tau Hotties.

171
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:35,726
Formation.

172
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:50,443
<i>We heard you caught a chill
Well, we're here to warm you up</i>

173
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:54,306
<i>We call ourselves the hotties
And we're gonna win that cup</i>

174
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:20,673
A special shout-out to my man Heath,

175
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:24,639
whose 15-year-old sister
taught him that little gem.

176
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:26,607
Which, I'm sure you will agree,

177
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:29,577
is gonna help us win
the Powder Puff cheer-off.

178
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,324
Is...

179
00:12:39,503 --> 00:12:42,150
- Rusty around?
- Why do you want to know?

180
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,224
- We're gonna go see a movie.
- Is that so?

181
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,761
We're in really good shape
with the human wheelbarrow.

182
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,480
Ben and I are very sprightly.

183
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,066
- What's going on?
- Calvin is an Omega Chi.

184
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:58,497
You are a Kappa Tau.
It's Greek Week.

185
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:00,615
The twain does not meet.
It never shall.

186
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:04,208
Are you doing an impression
of Evan Chambers?

187
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,908
No ha. Look at me.
I'm deadly serious.

188
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,249
Don't look at my outfit.
Look at me.

189
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:11,285
See?
Serious.

190
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,755
Sorry, nothing personal.

191
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,908
Double air-kiss for Evan Lame-bers,
though.

192
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,464
Go back to work.
Go on.

193
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,576
All my lip-synchers, practice, stat!

194
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,671
Friday is red T- shirt day.

195
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,678
- Today, it's yellow spirit shirts.
- Yellow makes my skin look diseased.

196
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,872
Don't blame the shirt.
Look to your foundation.

197
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,636
Put on a yellow T-shirt.

198
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,939
The shirts are
an easy way to earn spirit points.

199
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,241
Especially because, for obvious reasons,

200
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,775
the Mu Gamma Sigs are heavily favored

201
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:56,030
to take gold in Powder Puff Football.

202
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,783
Let's get into formation.
Abs in, lips relaxed.

203
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:02,479
Can I have a private word real quick?

204
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:05,874
What?
Where?

205
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,450
I'll be right there.
Campus security.

206
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,021
We'll talk as soon as I get back.

207
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:16,275
Take your time.

208
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:19,645
You deserve it,
you hard-working little president, you!

209
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:29,583
- God!
- Nope, just me. But thanks.

210
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:32,706
- What are you doing here?
- I got a call from Rebecca.

211
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:34,584
I got a call from campus security.

212
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,253
- What's wrong with you?
- Officer Huck.

213
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:39,923
On Coast Guard duty tonight?
Where are your water wings?

214
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,552
I should've known
you'd be a part of this kerfuffle.

215
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:47,514
- Cappie's my boyfriend!
- Yes, he is.

216
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:49,911
- Now, let's get you dry.
- And back to ZBZ.

217
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:52,626
- No thanks.
- Rebecca, I'm trying to help you.

218
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:58,025
I'm so sorry
these pledges interrupted this...

219
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,727
- event.
- This is not just any event.

220
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:04,030
It's the president's private shindig
for Greek alums coming to Greek Week.

221
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,385
Including some elderly folk
with delicate sensibilities

222
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:10,974
- and varying heart conditions.
- Whatever! They looked bored.

223
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,605
So we entertained them.

224
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:17,330
And Mandi used to be the synchronized
swimming champion of Western New Jersey!

225
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:20,875
I'm drowning.

226
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:26,135
So I thought we'd use this
for some of my sister-service hours!

227
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,746
- You've just earned a lot more of them.
- Don't worry.

228
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:31,616
- I'll take her home. Come on.
- Not so fast.

229
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:37,929
Don't worry, big sis,
we took off our pledge pins. See?

230
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:40,383
I laid low and rode out the storm.

231
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,446
Come on.

232
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,489
There she goes.

233
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:02,361
I hope you appreciate this sign
of solidarity to the Three Musketeers.

234
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:04,007
I'm touched beyond words.

235
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:06,759
Look away, Dixieland.

236
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:14,716
You guys ready to see some Chuck Heston,
may he rest in peace?

237
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,185
You still have your VCR?

238
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:18,831
Why would I need my VCR?

239
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,809
We're going to see Ben-Hur
in its original anamorphic widescreen

240
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:24,652
with seat-rumbling sound
and overpriced concessions.

241
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:28,823
- I bought some popcorn.
- The video store didn't have it on DVD.

242
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,265
We thought it would be more fun
to watch it here.

243
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:33,995
No noisy crowds to disturb
the Three Musketeers.

244
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:37,316
Stop blowing smoke up my as...
bottom.

245
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,489
Since it's Greek Week,

246
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,631
the brothers aren't that comfortable
with Calvin and I hanging out.

247
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:47,379
So what? We're supposed to
ide here in a dark room

248
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:50,094
like lepers
that we're not seeing on the big screen?

249
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,782
We're just laying low.

250
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:54,756
- It's our own private Switzerland.
- Switzerland?

251
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,667
You mean the wusses
that wouldn't stand up to the Nazis?

252
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,679
We wanna conduct our friendship free
from prying fraternity eyes this week.

253
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:04,689
We made a pact
t spring break, OK?

254
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:08,449
- I just took down the Southern Cross.
- Dale, we're pledges, OK?

255
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,371
We have to do what the brothers tell us.

256
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:14,410
We've lasted an entire year as pledges.
Can't blow it when a few months're left.

257
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:18,028
So we do their laundry,
we scrub the toilets.

258
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,420
We don't hang out during Greek Week.

259
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,950
Do you think the brothers
are gonna stop caring

260
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,090
about who you hang out with
once you're actives?

261
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,471
Today it's Greek Week.
But then it's next week,

262
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,933
then it's the week after.

263
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:31,636
And then Poland falls.

264
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,778
I had a very simple plan
at the beginning of Greek Week:

265
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:45,629
"To win".
A simple, doable plan

266
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:48,538
considering we've won Greek Week
for the past ten years.

267
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:51,591
But then Rebecca gets
all Dirty Dancing... again.

268
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,621
This time aquatically, and distracts me.

269
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:56,911
And here I am wearing a red spirit shirt
on green shirt day.

270
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,948
Very unpresidential of me.

271
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:02,137
And not at all befitting
my "Zbzs are winners" election platform.

272
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:05,717
Meanwhile, Suzanne and the standards
hyenas are dying to kick her out.

273
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:07,545
I'm dying to kick her out!

274
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:10,826
It's time to put Baby
in the corner for good.

275
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:14,055
She has got to be the worst pledge
in the history of pledgedom.

276
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,441
Including Jen K.

277
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:19,598
and that legacy from last year who wore
culottes and had that little mustache.

278
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:22,778
- Thank God she deactivated.
- Seriously.

279
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:26,737
The only reason Rebecca's stuck around
as long as she has is because

280
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,308
she's a senator's daughter,
which is really doing nothing

281
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:31,078
for anybody these days.

282
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,709
But maybe I'm just looking for an excuse
to get her out because I simply

283
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:36,975
hate her.

284
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,991
She has been going through a hard time.

285
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,997
And you did almost myrtle
her boyfriend at spring break.

286
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:45,042
We didn't even come close to myrtling.

287
00:18:45,616 --> 00:18:49,046
We kissed. Very briefly.
Under the influence of spring break.

288
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:52,574
Which we have since left behind,
unlike someone I know.

289
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:56,846
I caught you sniffing that thing
yesterday.

290
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:00,357
Hot Ness.

291
00:19:03,788 --> 00:19:07,250
If I don't have a problem with Casey
and everyone else seeing us,

292
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,720
- then why should you?
- Because I don't want to be hated

293
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:12,573
at ZBZ,

294
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:17,741
which I will be if Casey sees me
as an enemy.

295
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:20,605
I want it all,

296
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:24,715
and the only way I can have it
is if I can prove to Casey

297
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,301
that I am still her friend and Big Sis.

298
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,382
Before we tell her.

299
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:34,047
You've had a week.
So hurry up.

300
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:37,754
Or you're gonna have
to find another cheerleader.

301
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:44,333
You're cute when you give ultimatums.

302
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:00,674
<i>And now,</i>

303
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:03,868
<i>the Omega Chi Hotties!</i>

304
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,027
Those sluts stole our cheer!

305
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,550
The Gamma Psi Alphas
are looking pretty tough, huh?

306
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:57,773
Fortunately, some of our pledges
have passed the Freshman 15

307
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,517
so we have a size advantage.

308
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:01,999
Especially if Tammie leads
with her hips.

309
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:06,020
Maybe I could harness
Rebecca's powers for good.

310
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,822
To help us win Greek Week.

311
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:10,513
- How would that work?
- You'll see.

312
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,659
I've decided to overlook
the fountain incident.

313
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:24,099
For now. Don't take that out,
the game's about to start!

314
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:27,198
I know you're going through a hard time,
and you need to blow off steam.

315
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:30,628
So, on that note, how about you channel
your frustrations in a positive way.

316
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,169
No, leave it in.
I can tell they're just about to start.

317
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:35,936
For my blog.

318
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:40,789
And guess what? I found
one of your dad's hookers online!

319
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,054
She's trying for a music career.

320
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:46,717
I especially loved her song
Daddy's Girl.

321
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,143
Now focus those feelings on the game

322
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:51,720
and rip those little flags off
that GPA quarterback!

323
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,898
Go ZBZ!

324
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:03,288
1 Blue 42, pink 23.

325
00:22:03,507 --> 00:22:05,982
Hut one, hut two, hut!

326
00:22:13,117 --> 00:22:14,894
Put that in your blog, bitch!

327
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:20,676
That's it! I've tried to be nice. I've
tried to be understanding that is it!

328
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:23,290
I'm recommending your expulsion
to the ZBZ standards board!

329
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,974
Until then you are suspended
from all ZBZ activities.

330
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,227
You might as well
start packing your bags.

331
00:22:34,326 --> 00:22:36,358
Remind me never to do the splits again.

332
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:38,198
It was a noble effort, Beav.

333
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:40,153
I had to try something new,

334
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:42,931
otherwise it just looked like
we were ripping off the omega chis.

335
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,430
It did, didn't it?

336
00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:48,850
It was like the battle of the carmens,
ladies figure skating, calgary, 1988.

337
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,820
The omega chi were Katarina Witt,
sexy, powerful, Germanic,

338
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:56,026
and we were poor Debi Thomas,
just biting it left and right.

339
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:59,425
And to be fair, their cradle
catch was much tighter than ours.

340
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:01,636
So Chambers and Co.
Won.

341
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:05,513
In the sneakiest way possible. And
we're left with one lingering question.

342
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,903
How,
how, did they Steal our Cheer?

343
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:10,239
Yeah, no kidding!

344
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:19,042
What? What is everyone
looking at me for?

345
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:22,253
You're the only one who associates
with the Omega Chis.

346
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,973
- I slept with Calvin last semester!
- Wait a minute, what are you implying?

347
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:30,157
Are you saying that
I memorized the Cheer

348
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:31,978
and taught it to Calvin in one day,

349
00:23:32,158 --> 00:23:33,718
all to sabotage my own house?

350
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:36,907
Absolutely not, Spitter.
You are a loyal pledge. We know that.

351
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,041
OK, good.

352
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:39,861
But we also know that

353
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:43,565
a fortress is only as strong
as its weakest part.

354
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:46,648
You've been hanging out with Calvin.
Maybe you happened

355
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:48,942
to mention to him
when we'd be practicing our Cheer.

356
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:51,098
And since I'm sure
the Omega Chi Cheer sucked,

357
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:55,265
Calvin seized the opportunity to spy
on us and Steal our sweet, sweet moves.

358
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,580
He came over to meet me for a movie.

359
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,419
That's what he told you.
I'm not saying you did it it on purpose.

360
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,116
For your protection and ours,

361
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:04,462
I have to ask you to stay
out the final competition.

362
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,554
The relay?

363
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:08,286
You won't find anyone sprightlier.

364
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,447
We'll manage.
I'm sorry, Spitter.

365
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,126
Hey, sourpuss.

366
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,349
What's up?

367
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:21,880
My supposed brothers
think I helped Calvin Steal our Cheer

368
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,684
and give it to the Omega Chis.

369
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,225
Cappie kicked me out of the relay race!

370
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:29,201
I'm over this.
I'm about to re-ignite usag.

371
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:31,796
Sometimes a good president
has to practice tough love.

372
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:33,926
How do you know Calvin
didn't steal the Cheer?

373
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:35,852
Casey, Calvin didn't steal the Cheer.

374
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:38,340
Hey, it's greek week, all bets are off.

375
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,499
You're a pledge, and pledges
are supposed to do what they're told.

376
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:44,420
I don't understand why all
the competitions are so important.

377
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:46,727
I thought greek week was about unity.

378
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,957
Whatever happened to the brotherhood,
friendship, family?

379
00:24:50,077 --> 00:24:52,403
Oh, my god.
You are such a boy scout!

380
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:55,206
Eagle scout.
I made it to the eagle scout. Rember?

381
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:59,030
I went to the ceremony. You were a tool,
earned more badges than anyone else.

382
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:01,344
- That's a good point.
- That you were a tool?

383
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:04,168
You thought I was a tool,
you found me annoying,

384
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:07,606
but you still showed up to the ceremony.
Because you're my sister.

385
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,109
Mom and dad made me go.

386
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:10,575
You knew that, right?

387
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:14,052
Which was the right thing to do,
because no matter how much you

388
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,207
and I find each other annoying,
we're still a family.

389
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,981
Underneath it all, we'll still trust
and support each other.

390
00:25:21,113 --> 00:25:24,231
So why aren't I seeing that support
from my brothers at Kappa Tau?

391
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,529
Because you're not a brother yet,
you're a pledge.

392
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:27,493
Semantics.

393
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,387
Call it what you want, it's
still your duty to be a good pledge.

394
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:33,075
What about being a good President?

395
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,386
I was right.
It is called greek week.

396
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:50,394
Not "personal drama week."
So what's yours?

397
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:52,601
You're going to kick Rebecca out.

398
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:56,135
- And you banned Rusty from greek week.
- It's not exactly the same thing.

399
00:25:56,277 --> 00:25:57,683
It's for a similar reason.

400
00:25:57,946 --> 00:26:00,715
Rebecca was putting the ZBZ
house at a much greater risk.

401
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,012
I know you care about her. But honestly,
Rebecca kind of asked for this.

402
00:26:06,553 --> 00:26:09,230
And I frankly don't even know
why she's in a sorority. Do you?

403
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,233
Because she seems
to hate everything about it.

404
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:15,006
That's just her way. Her
hostility and

405
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,942
sporadic verbal abuse are endearing
once you get to know her.

406
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,263
I know her and I'm over it.

407
00:26:23,237 --> 00:26:25,656
OK, look,
Rebecca's in trouble.

408
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:28,656
And I can't hold her
together all by myself.

409
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,135
You're stronger
than you think.

410
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,374
Not to mention Rebecca and I
don't Even like each other.

411
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,599
So why do you want me to help her?

412
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:43,350
Because she's your sister.

413
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,187
If that's just empty crap to you,
then why are you in a sority?

414
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:50,802
For the parties.
Why else?

415
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,313
Whatever you say, Case.

416
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:04,419
Where's Suzanne?
I need to talk to her about Rebecca.

417
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,153
Casey,
look who's here!

418
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:09,873
Tegan!

419
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:12,383
Casey.
My little success story.

420
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,550
Nationals thought you might need
help with the Rebecca Logan problem.

421
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:21,231
Politico offspring, never easy.
So here I am!

422
00:27:21,363 --> 00:27:23,026
So
here I am!

423
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:25,159
Doesn't her hair look great?

424
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:28,859
That's so sweet.

425
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,408
Of course,

426
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:35,828
like pretty much everyone else
in America, we saw Rebecca's

427
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:40,810
very special dance video
from Spring Break.

428
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,485
- Flat and French!
- Great.

429
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:48,232
Now we're not monsters. We know that
Rebecca's been through a tough time.

430
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:51,401
Right, right. And you know,
if you've checked recently,

431
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:55,484
the number of hits on Rebecca's
video has gone way, way,

432
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,181
- way down.
- Way down.

433
00:27:57,313 --> 00:28:01,109
But Nationals' tolerance has reached
its limit with the fountain fiasco

434
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:04,329
and that little'roid rage
assault on the football field.

435
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:08,004
Wait, how did you hear about
the fountain and the football?

436
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:10,556
Girls,
we have eyes and ears everywhere.

437
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,596
Boo!

438
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,952
Kidding!

439
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:19,897
About the "boo."
Not about the eyes and ears.

440
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:25,152
So, your Standards Chair
informs me that you are

441
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:27,407
planning to vote to expel her tonight.

442
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:30,555
- We were, but I've been thinking...
- Things could get messy?

443
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:34,745
- Yes.
- Well, I'm here to keep things clean.

444
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,035
If the decision comes from Nationals,
it could carry more weight.

445
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:41,271
Invite less resistance.

446
00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:48,280
If only we had more girls like you,
Casey, ones who value

447
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:52,192
standards,
image and reputation.

448
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:58,762
Now, where is that adorable
little stain on our good name?

449
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:08,636
Come in.

450
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,712
Just wanted to see how you were
doing after the big cheertastrophe.

451
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:18,492
The KTS looked pretty pissed.

452
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:21,886
Well, yeah, they think
the Omega Chis stole the cheer.

453
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,879
Who's to say the Kappa Taus didn't
steal the cheer from the Omega Chis?

454
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:30,363
The KTS aren't known for being
the most prepared guys on the planet.

455
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:32,716
We got it from Heath's sister.
She made it up.

456
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:36,296
We got it from O'Toole's sister.
She made it up. The Kts...

457
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,074
- we're doing it.
- I know we're doing it.

458
00:29:42,236 --> 00:29:43,868
We said we weren't gonna do it.

459
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,849
What have I come upon?

460
00:29:47,982 --> 00:29:49,627
Nothing, Dale.
We just

461
00:29:50,176 --> 00:29:53,634
almost chucked our friendship
again over some stupid stolen cheer.

462
00:29:53,915 --> 00:29:55,336
Cheer?
What cheer?

463
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,739
Some cheer that our friend
Heath's sister

464
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:00,257
thought of about hotties
warming people up.

465
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:02,361
Yeah?
As in...

466
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:06,316
We heard you caught a chill
Well we're here to warm you up

467
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:09,852
We call ourselves the hotties
And we're gonna win that cup.

468
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:14,596
- That cheer?
- How did you know that?

469
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:16,920
It's from the 1998
film Cheer It Forward.

470
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:18,710
It's a clean-cut tale

471
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:22,285
of nubile, lightly-muscled young ladies

472
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,597
engaged in competionin the world
of high-school cheerleading.

473
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:27,708
It was followed in 2000
by a deeply-flawed sequel

474
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,203
called Cheer It Backward.

475
00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:32,327
I've just seen bits and pieces on TV,
you know.

476
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:35,105
It's always on while
I'm waiting forThe 700 Club.

477
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,819
I mean, I haven't seen the whole thing.

478
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:40,783
It's not like I was a cheerleader
in high school or anything.

479
00:30:42,637 --> 00:30:44,602
They would never let guys on the team.

480
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:52,878
No matter how talented they were.

481
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:58,842
I'd like my packing privacy please.

482
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:02,505
No time for barbed banter! Togan's
waiting downstairs to kick you out!

483
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,023
And you're here to, what,
celebrate?

484
00:31:06,495 --> 00:31:09,705
I changed my mind, OK?
I don't want you to go.

485
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:11,611
You're serious?

486
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:13,791
God help me but yes.

487
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:15,543
I'll explain later.
We need to figure

488
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,635
out what to say to Tegan
so she'll let you stay.

489
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:20,247
- She should go humble.
- Groveling's essential.

490
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,935
And tell Tegan you like her hair!

491
00:31:23,857 --> 00:31:26,225
Even if you don't really like her hair,
just say it.

492
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:29,394
I want you to explain why
I should even care if she kicks me out.

493
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:32,565
- Rebecca, this is a really good deal.
- I don't know.

494
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:35,025
You tell me. Why did you
even join in the first place?

495
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:36,619
Why else?
The parties.

496
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:38,779
Right.
That's why I joined, too.

497
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:41,005
That's what I would've
told anyone who asked.

498
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,577
Because admitting the honest
to God truth, "Hey,

499
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,873
I'm Casey,
scared and friendless freshman"

500
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:48,646
would've been just too pathetic.
So I rushed.

501
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:51,035
And, as luck would have it,
somewhere along the way,

502
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:52,969
I discovered I ended up with a family.

503
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:56,541
Screwed up and dysfunctional, like every
other family but a family nonetheless.

504
00:31:56,976 --> 00:32:00,169
And this family can include
you if you want it to.

505
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,210
Sorry.

506
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:12,761
Yeah,
well, families suck.

507
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,923
You don't have to worry
about kicking me out.

508
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:20,904
Because I quit.

509
00:32:31,694 --> 00:32:33,914
Rebecca. Just the person I wanted to...

510
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,428
Ashleigh!

511
00:32:42,723 --> 00:32:44,834
- My God, slow down.
- Anyone?

512
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:51,263
I know Casey, and I know
she meant what she said back there.

513
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,580
Of course you'd say that.
Casey's sidekick.

514
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,459
Stop it!
Stop with the whole tough girl act!

515
00:32:56,942 --> 00:33:00,296
My God, I've been a friend to you, even
when it was the last thing Casey wanted.

516
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,588
And I get it.

517
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:03,755
Your dad let you way down.

518
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,635
But don't go down with him.
Stop being a stupid

519
00:33:06,772 --> 00:33:09,383
senator's daughter
and start being Rebecca Logan!

520
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,197
Being a senator's daughter is the only
reason ZBZ wanted me in the first place.

521
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,345
Yeah,
well, things change.

522
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:24,713
Fine!
Leave!

523
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:27,332
And I'm not Casey's sidekick!

524
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,476
He's not nearly as sprightly as you are.

525
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:38,080
You here to fess up?

526
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,108
Nope.
I just came to give you this.

527
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:45,031
Cheer It Forward,
I've been meaning to catch this one.

528
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:47,155
The stolen cheer?

529
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:49,486
It's from this movie.

530
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:54,893
Apparently it's a popular movie
for 15-year-olds like Heath's sister.

531
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:56,052
And O'Toole's.

532
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:58,345
And Dale.

533
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:59,720
I...

534
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,173
Before you apologize,
I'd just like to say one thing.

535
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:05,094
I'm a really good pledge.

536
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:06,997
And you know it.

537
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,676
For the past seven months,
I have scrubbed the toilets,

538
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:13,690
I have done your most
questionable laundry,

539
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:16,889
and I even let Wade throw
up into my hands one time.

540
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:21,286
And I'll continue to do so,
if that is what you tell me to do.

541
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,897
Well...
thank you?

542
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:26,210
But there's one thing
that I will not do.

543
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:28,629
I will not let you
tell me who my friends are.

544
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:32,231
Real brothers will treat
each other with trust and respect.

545
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:36,171
They won't be threatened by
friendships made outside the house.

546
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,299
I think you're letting your grudge with

547
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,405
Evan poison how you treat
your own brothers.

548
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:44,258
And that's not what I signed up for. So.

549
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,762
So maybe this isn't
the place for me after all.

550
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,347
I'll be at the relay
race later to cheer you on.

551
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:53,972
Unless I hear otherwise.

552
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:02,119
God, Wade, dismount.

553
00:35:20,257 --> 00:35:21,561
Excuse me.

554
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:25,858
The spirit point tally just
came out and we are miles ahead.

555
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:27,942
Turns out you were the only president

556
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:30,523
anal enough to make us wear
those shirts every day.

557
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:33,102
Yay obsessive-compulsiveness.

558
00:35:33,272 --> 00:35:36,523
You don't sound very excited for
someone who's about to win Greek Week.

559
00:35:36,738 --> 00:35:38,059
Your whole "ZBZ winners"

560
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,565
campaign strategy is coming
together just like you wanted.

561
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:44,088
You are going to be a
totally legitimate president!

562
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,476
- Then why do I feel so Gerald Ford?
- Hi.

563
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,203
Frannie was just apologizing
for going off the rails so

564
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,343
perilously last semester.

565
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:55,122
Thank you for listening.

566
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:58,824
- Code pink.
- Code pink.

567
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,398
Code pink.

568
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,493
- Tegan?
- Yes?

569
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:06,977
I'm here to apologize.

570
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:09,352
And to ask for a second chance.

571
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:11,953
I'm sorry I put the sisterhood at risk.

572
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm sorry for...

573
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:15,650
I don't want to make
you grovel needlessly.

574
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,511
There won't be any second chances here.

575
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,473
Tegan.
One more thing.

576
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:25,710
- Your hair is...
- Rebecca! No. Stop.

577
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:29,050
Rebecca shouldn't have
to grovel at all, Tegan.

578
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,941
Yes, she should apologize,
but that's it.

579
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:36,131
We can't desert our sister now,
when she needs us the most.

580
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:40,098
Sisters trust and support each other.
No matter what.

581
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:41,501
It's simple.

582
00:36:42,153 --> 00:36:43,476
We stand together.

583
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:46,934
Which means
if Rebecca goes, I go.

584
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:51,059
And I go.

585
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:53,384
And I go.

586
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:54,942
And I go.

587
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:59,053
If I stay,
can I pick whatever room I want?

588
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:02,491
Something tells me
Nationals wouldn't be too happy

589
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:05,067
if an entire ZBZ chapter de-activated.

590
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:06,395
Am I right?

591
00:37:06,987 --> 00:37:09,325
So,
you're really going against me.

592
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:10,888
For her?

593
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:14,146
Yep.

594
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:18,243
And ealize if she screws up again,
that it's all on you?

595
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:20,839
Yep.

596
00:37:21,893 --> 00:37:24,953
I stake my
presidency on it.

597
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,622
Your interim presidency.

598
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:29,453
Right.

599
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,595
<i>And, next up in the lip-synch competion,</i>

600
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:39,282
<i>the Zeta Beta Zetas!</i>

601
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,463
Girls,
come on, hurry.

602
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,677
Go on. Get up there and do your thing.

603
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,397
Just keep your clothes
on and don't get wet this time.

604
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:57,847
So I guess we won't be wheelbarrowing
against each other after all.

605
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,928
- And I told him I was...
- I know, you're really sprightly.

606
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:06,715
Cappie won't lift your punishment
even after you told him?

607
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:07,896
Apparently not.

608
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:11,645
- Switzerland has its limits.
- Yeah, too many limits.

609
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:14,780
We need to come up with a stronger,
more outspoken country.

610
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,818
A brave little land with two citizens.

611
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:21,581
We could call it Ralvin!

612
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,137
Yeah, maybe it doesn't
really need a name.

613
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,714
That's right, we'll be more
powerful in our namelessness!

614
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:29,059
Right.

615
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:31,060
Could I request a temporary visa?

616
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:34,952
I'm sorry.
To both of you.

617
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:37,598
Calvin, you're welcome at
the KT house any time you like.

618
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:41,263
Even Grey's Anatomy night, which can
be quite exclusive, so feel privileged.

619
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:44,643
Any friend of my little
bro is a friend of mine.

620
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:46,013
Thanks.

621
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:48,402
Pledge,
what's going on here?

622
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:52,731
- Just talking with some friends.
- Well, it's time for the relay race.

623
00:38:52,851 --> 00:38:55,157
We'll discuss your
choice of friends later.

624
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:57,810
Discuss away.
Doesn't mean I'll listen.

625
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,012
So, what about that feud?

626
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:08,449
- Nothing good can come of that.
- You might be right, Spitz.

627
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:12,469
As in swimmer Mark Spitz,
nine-time Olympic gold medalist.

628
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,824
Assume the position, pledge.
We need your human whee lbarrow.

629
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:19,899
I'm off to face Chambers
in the last leg.

630
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:23,845
By the way, you were terrifyingly adept
when you ripped me a new one last night.

631
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:25,017
I was impressed.

632
00:39:25,645 --> 00:39:26,909
Do not do it again.

633
00:39:27,494 --> 00:39:30,537
Take your marks,
get set...

634
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:05,230
Come on, pick it up, pledge!

635
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:08,542
Ready to come in sloppy second?

636
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:13,341
May the best man win.

637
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,055
Beaver, come on!

638
00:41:09,587 --> 00:41:11,042
- Cap, you OK?
- Yeah.

639
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:14,257
We can't let them get away with this!
Let's go mess 'em up!

640
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:16,470
No, you know what, Beav?
Just let it go.

641
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,253
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah.

642
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,869
I'm sorry Evan went aggro out there.

643
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:27,692
It looks like Cappie's
ready to move to Ralvin.

644
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,939
That is not what we're calling it!

645
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:34,555
<i>The winners of this year's
Gree k Week Olympiad are...</i>

646
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:38,015
<i>... Omega Chi Delta and Zeta Beta Zeta!</i>

647
00:41:47,629 --> 00:41:50,793
Well, we won. You should've seen
the look on Janette's face.

648
00:41:50,963 --> 00:41:53,328
- It went well with her black eye.
- "We" won?

649
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:56,074
Yes,
I'm still a ZBZ "we."

650
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,127
That whole cheesy sister bond thing?

651
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:02,516
It's...
actually stronger than I thought.

652
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:11,293
Sorry, I've been a little
distracted this week.

653
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:13,357
It's OK.

654
00:42:31,378 --> 00:42:32,720
What are you doing?

655
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,767
<i>I hereby declare the end of these games.</i>
