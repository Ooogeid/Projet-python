<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,228 --> 00:00:03,327
- Welcome to Titan Towers Apartments.
- Thanks.

3
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,755
I'll admit I was taking aback
when you add

4
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,275
two gentlemen roommates,
but these two look responsible.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,115
Not to mention, charming.

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,877
I'll call you later?

7
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,174
- Who was she?
- A girl I met in town

8
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:19,810
- a few weeks ago. Started hooking up.
- What about Frannie?

9
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,194
I'm Jordan. I just transferred here.
I don't know anyone. Not a soul.

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,279
I met a girl.
She's beautiful.

11
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,722
- And funny.
- That's great, Russ.

12
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:34,075
She want to join us?

13
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,036
I'm a little nervous
about the whole sorority thing.

14
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:39,602
I don't usually make friends
with these kind of girls.

15
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:40,998
Or, really any girls.

16
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,905
Ashleigh told me that ZBZ
is gonna offer me a snap bid.

17
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:47,672
I don't know what that is,
but it means they want me.

18
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,131
Thank you so much.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,817
- Where're you going?
- To make my move!

20
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:52,734
Nice!

21
00:00:53,683 --> 00:00:56,514
He hooked up with her, before
I could even tell her I liked her.

22
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,224
So now, they're all into each other

23
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,227
and just makes me want to puke
when I'm around them.

24
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:04,689
<i>Zeta Beta Strong and true.</i>

25
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,942
<i>Our sisterhood awaits us.
To all our sisters</i>

26
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:12,863
<i>We love you forever we'll be Zetas</i>

27
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,827
Now, don't forget,

28
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,205
tomorrow night is big sis,
little sis bonding at Dobler's.

29
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:26,210
And right now, we're about to watch
<i>Dancing With The Stars</i> in the TV room.

30
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:30,651
Stay if you can.
Bridget baked her famous Hello Dollies.

31
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,093
So have fun, be strong

32
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,992
and go forth in Zeta love.

33
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:42,440
Little sis.

34
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,407
You up for some Carrie Ann Inaba?

35
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:51,486
I would love some of whatever that is,
but I gotta take off.

36
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:54,822
But we'll see you
at Dobler's, right?

37
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,325
- We've got some bonding to do.
- You bet.

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,155
I grabbed you
one of the last Dollies.

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,025
It's like girls've never
had sugar before.

40
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,211
Tell me they're not like that
in meetings.

41
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,587
They're really trying.

42
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:11,714
Excited, enthusiastic, eager.

43
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:15,843
That is, all of them except for Jordan.
She didn't even stay for cookies.

44
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,643
Maybe she wanted to avoid the clawing
and scratching for food.

45
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:22,001
I don't think she's happy here.

46
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:25,352
It just seems like
she's not really connecting.

47
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,105
You don't think she's gonna de-pledge,
do you?

48
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,701
Jordan just needs
some big sister love.

49
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,792
Read 'em and weep, boys.

50
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:41,464
A pair of fours.

51
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:45,687
Meet Queen Elizabeth,
and Queen Latifah.

52
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,102
Nice play, Andylicious.

53
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:51,631
I'm gonna get something to drown down
the bitter taste of defeat.

54
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:53,924
- Anybody want anything?
- I'll take one.

55
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,746
Let your big brother
give some advice.

56
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,099
Poker night's about
letting the brothers win,

57
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:00,510
so they don't have
to haze you to feel superior.

58
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,998
I thought hazing
was to bond us as a group.

59
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,519
That's just what they tell you.

60
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:07,959
You're the best big brother
a guy could have.

61
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,388
What's the buy in?

62
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:12,274
Chick alert.

63
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,237
This is kind of a guy thing.

64
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:19,050
There's a lot
of scratching and cursing

65
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:20,699
and objectifying of women.

66
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,370
I don't blush easy.

67
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,203
Will $50 cover it?

68
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:29,583
We play for pretzel sticks.

69
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,545
I'm sorry.
I thought this was a fraternity.

70
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:37,107
Pony up, gents. It's too early
in the evening to get emasculated.

71
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,134
Guys, I would love to take
your money, but I have to run.

72
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:45,984
What? I thought you had the rest
of the night free.

73
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,559
Come on, stick around.
I promise I'll go easy on you.

74
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,398
You know, I would.
But I totally forgot,

75
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:56,080
I need to defibrillate
this transpolymer orgasmitroid.

76
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,683
Man, science sounds hard.

77
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,594
And kind of dirty.

78
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,071
Don't forget about
the scavenger hunt tomorrow.

79
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,858
All right, Miss Moneypants,
what are we playing?

80
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,930
Seven Card Stud. Low card brings
in first bet

81
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,261
Ante up, girls.

82
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:15,197
Girls?

83
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,092
She just called us girls.
Nice to meet you. Welcome to our house.

84
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,803
- Dollar a pretzel.
- Dollar pretzels.

87
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,991
Got any plans for the weekend?

88
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,750
I've spent so much time
at the KT house lately,

89
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:39,606
I thought I'd just hang around here.
Log some me time.

90
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:41,929
Can I join?

91
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,159
I could use a couple nights off
from Omega Chi. And from Evan.

92
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,815
Unless by "me time," you meant...

93
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,584
Of course you can hang out.

94
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:57,004
What is that?

95
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,424
I'm making a valance
for the kitchen window.

96
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,433
- What's a valance?
- For a gay guy,

97
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:06,013
you are so ignorant about
the basics of home decor.

98
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,016
- It's a window treatment.
- Since when did you become so domestic?

99
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:12,418
This is our home.
And since neither of us have wives yet,

100
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:14,446
somebody's got to keep it
feeling that way.

101
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,791
It's been great out hanging
with you two in the fifties,

102
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,633
but I gotta go to the gym.

103
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:21,528
- Later.
- Bye.

104
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,351
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

105
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:28,459
Those are the two guys that live here
and I'm sure they'd be happy

106
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:30,634
to buy anything you're selling.

107
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,408
I was hoping I'd run into you.
Mind if I show your apartment?

108
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,937
It says welcome on that mat
for a reason.

109
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:39,862
Great.

110
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,566
As you can see, the living room
has plenty of natural light.

111
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:45,691
Very airy.

112
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,572
Something smells delicious.

113
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:56,471
Just a little something
I threw in the slow cooker for dinner.

114
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:02,114
Dale is an excellent example
of the type of tenants

115
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,323
we attract here at Titan Towers.

116
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,181
Let me show you the bedrooms.

117
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,721
- Man, you are good.
- At what?

118
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:19,963
At being a model tenant.

119
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:24,184
I just try to lead by example.
Like Jesus.

120
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:28,886
This is really gonna tie
the whole room together.

121
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,715
You up for some spontaneous big sis,
little sis bonding?

122
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,795
I was just about to go for a run.

123
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,444
You wanna come with?

124
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:47,379
I would, but these heels
aren't Easy Spirits.

125
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:48,797
Right.

126
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,953
- We could hang out here.
- Perfect!

127
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,249
Cute!

128
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:59,251
You can tell so much
about a person by room.

129
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,503
I love your whole color palette.

130
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:03,547
Sorry about your roommate.

131
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,675
That's my side of the room.

132
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:10,054
I love your aesthetic.

133
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,098
It's really...

134
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,301
Spartan.

135
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:16,643
This is for you!

136
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:22,978
Open it.

137
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,571
His name is Mr. Purrs-A-Lot.

138
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,254
He's a cherished ZBZ heirloom
that's been passed down

139
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:33,911
from big sis to little sis
once way back in 1994.

140
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,497
- And now he's yours.
- You didn't give him Rebbeca?

141
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,707
She's... allergic.

142
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:42,480
Anyway, I know stuffed animals
are goofy and silly.

143
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:46,111
But Mr. Purrs-A-Lot represents
the lasting bonds of ZBZ sisterhood.

144
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,968
I mean, just think of all the women
who have held this kitty.

145
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:53,388
Crazy, right?

146
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:59,799
I guess what I'm saying
is Mr. Purrs-A-Lot

147
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:03,232
shows us we're a part
of something larger than ourselves.

148
00:08:03,995 --> 00:08:05,770
That we're just a thread

149
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,358
in the fabric of ZBZ.

150
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,304
And that fabric is exactly
what we need to keep us warm

151
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:13,742
when we're cold and lonely.

152
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,662
All that from a stuffed cat?

153
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:18,973
Thanks.

154
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:20,997
Of course!

155
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,950
We're sisters!

156
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,974
Good, you're alone.
You never know these days.

157
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:41,798
The I-Kap/Omega Chi mixer's tonight.
I need to call Dobler's

158
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:43,439
to reserve some tables ASAP.

159
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:46,964
What?

160
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:48,718
I cheated on you?

161
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,988
In fact, I drove her to your house,

162
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,972
and now you want
to talk about a mixer?

163
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,651
I'm sure you have your reasons
why you did...

164
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,452
who you did.

165
00:08:58,193 --> 00:08:59,544
But that's irrelevant now.

166
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:03,230
I said when we got together
that I liked Evan and I liked Chambers.

167
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:06,295
Evan's hooking up with someone else.
That just leaves Chambers.

168
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,881
So you don't want to break up?

169
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,813
I don't need your money.

170
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,555
The house is self-sufficient now.

171
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,648
But, last semester
you promised that you'd help me,

172
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,893
I'm not about to give up
everything I worked so hard

173
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,560
for just because you slept
with someone else.

174
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,813
I still need your social standing.

175
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,614
Look, not to sound too callous,

176
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,359
but why should I care what you need?

177
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:33,560
How long do you think the Omega Chis
could keep their repas

178
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:36,087
as the best fraternity when
their president's cruising

179
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:39,953
the mean streets of Cyprus with
some piece of local talent in a USV.

180
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:42,868
Not to mention how your parents
would feel about your love interest

181
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:45,584
and that fact that you lost
your $200,000 car.

182
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,990
I'm your protective cover,
you're my social security.

183
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,547
Perfect relationship.

184
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:55,914
It sounds like
a business arrangement.

185
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,802
- You really are like my mother.
- I'll take that as a yes.

186
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,100
And a compliment.

187
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,017
I'm gonna reserve
the tables for the mixer.

188
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:11,272
Take that!

189
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,785
- You watching football?
- I DVR the Viewall week

190
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,412
so I can watch 'em back-to-back.

191
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:20,914
I just love it when
Hasselbeck serves them supper.

192
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:33,030
When are you going to the store?
We're out of milk.

193
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:36,521
Just put it on the list.
I'm ordering groceries online, now.

194
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:39,249
It feels so good to be free
of check-out lines.

195
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,822
Just like this burden off of me.

196
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,463
How are your purity pledge brothers?

197
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:48,396
You still hang out with those guys?

198
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:50,851
Haven't seen 'em
since last semester.

199
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:57,990
- When was the last time you go out?
- What?

200
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:04,330
When did you last go outside?
Besides just for classes.

201
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,844
Couple weeks ago.

202
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:09,984
I think it was raining.

203
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,652
Maybe I watched a movie
where it rained. I don't know.

204
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,220
We don't know anything
about this girl.

205
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:24,094
Since Jordan didn't go through rush,
we're just starting to get to know her.

206
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:25,848
And she's getting to know us.

207
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:28,143
It's like
she's a foreign exchange student.

208
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:29,469
They start weird,

209
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:31,778
and then they turn into
the most popular kid in school.

210
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,151
Trust me, your subscription is safe.

211
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:37,821
As much as I'd love to stay and discuss,
I'm late for class.

212
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:48,582
Those girls are descended
from Spanish royalty.

213
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,792
Excuse me
for being culturally polite.

214
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:53,231
Fran-Fran, you still don't get it.

215
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,790
It's not about pedigree,
it's about the bonds of sisterhood.

216
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:56,757
Since when?

217
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,050
Since you left.

218
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:00,967
In fact, just today
I passed down Mr. Purrs-A-Lot

219
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,804
to one of the most unique pledges.

220
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:03,932
Unique?

221
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,266
Is that code for homely?

222
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,357
It's always been
about being the best.

223
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:11,647
And the I-Kap house is just that.

224
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:14,547
First, everyone calls it "icky."

225
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,460
And second, I'm not going
to be drawn into a competition

226
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,566
over who's the best.
We're over that.

227
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:20,906
Spoken like a number two.

228
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:22,645
Check that out!

229
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,119
Mr. Purrs-A-Lot?

230
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,547
Nice bonds of sisterhood.

231
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,148
You're working.
I'll come back.

232
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,837
Stay! Whoever said the U.S.
doesn't torture hasn't graded 80 papers

233
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:58,235
on cement elasticity.

234
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,994
I guess that's the price you pay
for getting your PHD.

235
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:04,324
It's the price I pay here at CRU.

236
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,399
This is a teaching school.

237
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:08,835
Cal-Tech is a research school.

238
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,041
If I were there, I'd be working
on next-gen thermoplastics.

239
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:15,124
That sucks.
Are you having second thoughts?

240
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:19,808
I love it here.
There's this awesome Ohio weather.

241
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:21,633
And the Cartwrights.

242
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:26,055
- What's going on with you?
- I need your help.

243
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:29,094
I'm afraid Dale has, unfortunately,
become a shut-in.

244
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:31,726
He hasn't left the apartment
in two weeks.

245
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,061
He's driving me crazy.

246
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,272
- I want a little personal space.
- Did he do this last year?

247
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,594
Last year he was always
coming and going.

248
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,566
He would lieve the room for classes
and meal and showers.

249
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:43,947
I know.
I'll check my RA binder.

250
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,828
Bed bugs, internet addiction...

251
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,249
Here it is... shut-in.

252
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,244
- What does it say?
- Don't be passive agressive.

253
00:13:57,482 --> 00:14:00,172
Playing loud music or being obnoxious
won't solve anything.

254
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,008
Just sit the person down
and talk to them directly.

255
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:05,051
Looks like
I'm having an intervention.

256
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:09,402
Can I come? Please?

257
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,454
You wanted to see me, Casey?

258
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,857
I'm hoping you can explain this.

259
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:23,069
My God! I am so sorry.

260
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,991
I have this guy friend
who's a Kappa Tau pledge.

261
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:30,120
They were doing a scavenger hunt and
needed something with sorority letters,

262
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,816
but I did not know
this would happen.

263
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:37,542
- Fraternity pledges can be cool.
- Jordan, don't worry about it.

264
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:41,505
I think we can get the tape off
with minimal fur damage.

265
00:14:42,351 --> 00:14:43,882
- Great.
- But,

266
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,926
I think we've got a bigger problem.

267
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:54,851
You don't seem like
you're really enjoying pledging.

268
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:58,481
I guess I don't feel
like I'm really fitting in here.

269
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,024
I grew up with three brothers.

270
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,595
The only girlfriends I had
were on my softball team,

271
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,196
and they all went to Smith,
if you know what I mean.

272
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:10,534
I guess I'm not used
to being around so much...

273
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:11,914
pink.

274
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,940
And I know I stick out
like a sore thumb.

275
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:18,708
- When you say "fit in," do you mean?
- We can fix that!

276
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,378
- You can?
- Makeover!

277
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,467
Haven't you ever seen a sorority movie?
We're really good at this.

278
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:48,034
You realize
I'm not a pledge anymore.

279
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:50,949
Right. Listen,
what are you doing tonight?

280
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,615
'Cause I'm in the mood to go out

281
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,353
and get hammered,
courtesy of Chambers International.

282
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,336
I already sort of have plans, man.

283
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:04,045
Why don't you hang out with Frannie?
Or your other girlfriend.

284
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,215
Because guy's night sounds better.
What are you gonna do?

285
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,967
Hang out at Rusty's house.

286
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,303
Why do you waste
so much time on that loser?

287
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,288
Come on, that was a joke!

288
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:17,671
I misread my audience.
Forget I said anything.

289
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:20,155
Let's go run up a huge bar tab
somewhere.

290
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:23,746
No, thanks. I think I'm gonna

291
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,275
hang out with my loser friend.

292
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,194
Which is something I probably
should've done in the first place.

293
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,510
What's going on?

294
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,241
We need to talk.

295
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,613
We're worried about you.

296
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,965
I'm worried that Reed Richards
and Sue Storm will break up

297
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,548
and that'll be the end of Fantastic Four
but I didn't stage a meeting.

298
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:56,973
Rusty's concerned
you haven't left the apartment.

299
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:58,933
We just want to find out why.

300
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,061
Are you avoiding
something out there?

301
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,604
- Vegans and Coldplay fans.
- See,

302
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,845
you are avoiding the question

303
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,405
- about avoiding.
- What do you care?

304
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,398
Because you have no life.
And right now, it is affecting my life.

305
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:13,907
I got no life?

306
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,369
Allright, I just made my seven-hundredth
friend on Facebook.com.

307
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:20,001
So who's the big winner today?

308
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,417
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm boiling
these mason jars for my apple butter.

309
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:34,803
I think it's time
to get passive aggressive.

310
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,292
You guys are such a cute couple.

311
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,733
Isn't he the greatest?

312
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,801
I think I am going
to call it a night.

313
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,315
He's got an early tee time.

314
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:51,508
And don't worry,
I left the tab open.

315
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:53,732
Bye.

316
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,852
This is Dobler's. It's kind
of like our Peach Pit.

317
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,588
How do you have a conversation
in these shoes?

318
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,756
All I can think about is the pain.

319
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,041
Soon it'll turn into a dull throb
and you'll hardly notice.

320
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:17,235
There's the gang.

321
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,366
- You look amazing.
- And your hair.

322
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:24,525
It looks professionally done, right?

323
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:25,527
My God!

324
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:27,105
You're... so feminine!

325
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,636
- Thanks?
- I need a lemon drop.

326
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:34,112
- Anyone want anything?
- Can I get a light draft?

327
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,606
You... can't.

328
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:41,494
OK, fine, I'll try a lemon drop.

329
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:43,413
No, I mean because you're a pledge.

330
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,124
I have a fake ID.
It's fine.

331
00:18:46,828 --> 00:18:49,621
See, pledges can't drink
at ZBZ-sponsored events.

332
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:51,421
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:53,588
Gotcha.

334
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:56,801
Who's up for a fun ice breaker?

335
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,629
How about we go around in the circle
and tell our most embarrassing moment?

336
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,435
However will you choose?

337
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:05,393
You guys get started.

338
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,203
I'm gonna hit the ladies' room.

339
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,517
You want me to come?

340
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,151
I think I've got it.

341
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,189
Looks like somebody drank
the sorority Kool-Aid.

342
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:25,455
More like the Pepto.

343
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,798
These girls are sharing
their most embarrassing moments.

344
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,795
I don't think they want to know
that having to wear this outfit is mine.

345
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:34,015
Come to the house with us.

346
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:35,965
Tango & Cashis on cable.

347
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,151
I love that movie.

348
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:44,390
Let me guess. A lemon drop?
You're such a creature of habit.

349
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:46,518
And you're such a creature.

350
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,731
How cute, all your little pledges
are bonding in ways

351
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,982
that'll surely last a lifetime.

352
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,947
It's all so sincere
and heartwarming.

353
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:59,489
We'd be doing but the Omega Chis
won't stop hitting on them.

354
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,884
They're also drinking, which
is a Pan-Hellenic violation.

355
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,307
But you're not
a real sorority, so...

356
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:08,414
I guess losing to a fake sorority
would look pretty bad for you guys.

357
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:11,334
All right, Frannie.
You want a face off so bad, let's do it.

358
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,127
Name your game.

359
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,004
Perhaps the real sorority
should chose.

360
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,589
Fine. Let's...

361
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,384
- have a karaoke contest.
- You're on.

362
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:24,097
Don't get cocky. I've heard you
sing in the shower, Sanjaya.

363
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:31,189
Looks like it's one of your pledges
who's been drinking.

364
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,649
For your information,
she's not drunk. She's athletic.

365
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:39,528
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna go.

366
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:42,551
I just don't think
that ZBZ's the place for me.

367
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,160
I really appreciate
everything you've done.

368
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,475
Thanks.

369
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,417
I think I know
what song you should sing.

370
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,586
Another One Bites the Dust.

371
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:58,787
Excuse me. For the whole bar,
can you put the next two rounds

372
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:00,689
- on Evan Chambers' tab?
- Got it.

373
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,482
Dale? If you've been in this apartment
for the past two weeks,

374
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,815
you've missed church.

375
00:21:16,238 --> 00:21:19,569
- What is God gonna think about that?
- No, man. It's cool.

376
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,284
I do my spiritual workout online.
Cyber-church, can you believe that?

377
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:25,255
He works in wondrous ways.

378
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:28,348
Anyway,
you heading over to the KT house?

379
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,288
I'm just gonna hang out here
all day in the apartment.

380
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,395
Maybe have a few friends over.

381
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:37,652
Wait! Could be Sheila.
Hold on!

382
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,705
Free porn!

383
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,133
We came as soon as we heard.

384
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:50,683
Actually, Cap, our cable box
isn't getting free adult channels.

385
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:52,572
Is this some vicious prank?

386
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:54,853
I needed a bunch
of brothers over here fast.

387
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,135
Adult video bat signal. All right.
What's going on?

388
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,636
I'm in the middle
of this infomercial here.

389
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:04,321
If I order the Chip & Chop in the next
five minutes, I get two for $19.99.

390
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:07,200
Let Beaver have the remote.
He's our guest.

391
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:09,656
Thank you.

392
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:11,829
Who knew mimes were so strong?

393
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,457
Dale hasn't left the apartment
in two weeks.

394
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,139
We need to drive him out.

395
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:17,710
Operation Annoy the Boy.

396
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,462
I think we can handle that.

397
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:21,672
Where you been?
We had the scavenger hunt yesterday.

398
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,675
Last night
was Ampersand Movie Marathon.

399
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:27,637
<i>Turner & Hooch</i>, <i>Tango & Cash</i>,
<i>Thelma & Louise</i>.

400
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,514
You love that movie.
Are you OK?

401
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:32,265
It'll be great
when I get some personal space.

402
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:35,643
All right, boys,
Rusty said to make ourselves at home!

403
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:39,399
Which it appears you already are,
so let's just keep up the good work.

404
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:40,829
Let's do it!

405
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,068
I can't find the porn.

406
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:47,115
- There's no porn.
- You don't even have Skinemax.

407
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:50,117
I know what you're doing.

408
00:22:50,587 --> 00:22:52,996
If you don't like it,
you can always leave the apartment.

409
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,276
Puffy paint!
Why didn't you wait for me?

410
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,170
I have too much nervous energy.
I had to do something with my hands.

411
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,975
Is this about the karaoke contest?
Don't worry, Case.

412
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,017
Once I sing  And I Am Telling You,
those bitches don't have a chance.

413
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:18,132
Actually,
I'm upset about Jordan de-pledging.

414
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,026
I was really upset, too.

415
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,698
I'm bummed because isn't the new,

416
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:29,363
improved, post-Frannie ZBZ supposed
to be about inclusion?

417
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,825
We have all these different girls,

418
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,751
girls we never
would've normally rushed.

419
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,441
We even have a Wiccan...

420
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:39,206
I think.

421
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:41,833
But we can't be everything
for everyone.

422
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:43,109
I know,

423
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,699
but Jordan's my little sister,
my pledge,

424
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,656
and Rusty's crush.

425
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,834
Plus, she's a really cool girl
and I don't want to give up on her.

426
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:56,326
I mean,
I kept Rebecca in the house last year.

427
00:23:56,877 --> 00:23:57,893
And she hated me.

428
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,189
That's why she stayed in the house.
She loved torturing you.

429
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,567
- She found sisterhood later.
- I don't understand.

430
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,619
How could Jordan
love her high school softball team,

431
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:09,613
but not love us?

432
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:12,214
I'm sure we smell better.

433
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:14,781
That's it!

434
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,055
What? Jordan needs deodorant?

435
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:20,420
- Where are you going?
- Karaoke's canceled.

436
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:22,994
Who wants nachos?

437
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:28,256
Get in there, fellas.
Plenty for everybody.

438
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:31,285
- Come on, use a napkin.
- Sorry, Mr. D.

439
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,268
Calvin? When did you get here?

440
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,412
I honestly can't remember.

441
00:24:35,537 --> 00:24:38,158
Chew with mouth closed.
These aren't seafood nachos.

442
00:24:41,384 --> 00:24:42,134
Look,

443
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,121
you guys are getting weak on me.
You have to turn it up.

444
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,319
He made nachos.
That's like Kappa Tau Kryptonite.

445
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:51,099
This was clearly the wrong tactic.

446
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:53,041
I'll try something else.

447
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,229
You guys have been here for 12 hours.
You can leave.

448
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:57,971
Save room for cowboy cookies
and ice-cold milk!

449
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,774
I don't think we can.

450
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:02,839
Pig in a blanket?

451
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,541
I'll be in my room.

452
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,194
Please tell me you're from UPS.

453
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:15,388
I'm here to see Frannie?

454
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:18,725
I'm expecting my gin
of the week delivery.

455
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:21,571
Best gift I ever gave myself.
Come on in.

456
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:24,397
You got company!

457
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:38,035
Let me guess,
you're selling cookies?

458
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:40,612
I want to change the competition.

459
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:42,488
You heard one of our
made it all the way

460
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:45,751
to Hollywood on American Idol.
Sorry. We're not changing it.

461
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:49,152
But Frannie,
I thought you could beat us in anything.

462
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:52,681
I'll tell you what.
We'll even let your housemother play.

463
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,430
- She's charming.
- She is. The girls love her.

464
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,683
What did you have in mind?

465
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:12,486
What happened out here?

466
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:14,721
Cookies are done!

467
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:19,368
Rusty? Rusty what time is it?

468
00:26:19,817 --> 00:26:20,822
7:59.

469
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,098
Don't answer the door!

470
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,723
Tenants we attract here at...

471
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:30,492
Could you just wait outside one sec?

472
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,616
That's great. Thanks.

473
00:26:35,246 --> 00:26:36,818
What's going on here?

474
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,949
- Inside voices.
- Disregard him.

475
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:43,017
I can explain this whole mess.

476
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,950
We just woke up.
We don't know these guys.

477
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:46,764
They broke in.
They're squatters.

478
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:48,689
Dale, more nachos, please.

479
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,428
There's been a misunderstanding.

480
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,613
And

481
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,494
I'm late for class.
See you guys.

482
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,297
- You violated your contract.
- Well, not...

483
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:08,708
- Where's Ms. Cartwright?
- She is...

484
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,170
- Doctor's office.
- ... volunteering at a shelter.

485
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,896
Then you'll have someplace to stay.

486
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:14,854
You have 24 hours to move out.

487
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:18,542
Remember, any stains on the furniture
come out of your deposit.

488
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:32,130
- You gonna move back in the KT house?
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

489
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:36,255
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't invited them over.

490
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,155
This would've happened
if you had a life.

491
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:41,409
That's a lot harder than it sounds.

492
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,999
- What are you talking about?
- We lived in the dorms,

493
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,749
there were always people around.
In the dining hall,

494
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:51,252
in the TV lounge, even the bathroom.

495
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:54,213
You know how I feel
about urinal chat.

496
00:27:54,476 --> 00:27:55,718
I'm wel aware...

497
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,171
Now we moved off campus,

498
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:59,398
that built-in social network
is gone.

499
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:00,467
And

500
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:02,722
it's kind of hard
to meet new people.

501
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,575
Did you try joining a club?

502
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:06,970
I'm not a joiner.
I'm a starter.

503
00:28:07,095 --> 00:28:09,644
What exactly are you starting here
in this apartment?

504
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,741
I'm starting
to get annoyed right now.

505
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:15,034
I'll admit, I've been avoiding
my problems by staying here.

506
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:17,750
- But what's your excuse?
- What are you talking about?

507
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,574
This is the most time you've spent here
in weeks, I would know, I haven't left.

508
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:26,411
- Fine. I'm avoiding something too.
- What is it?

509
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,661
It's not important.

510
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:30,336
You're avoiding the question
about avoiding.

511
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:32,997
The important thing
is we both need to get out there

512
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:34,574
and face the music.

513
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,257
Evicicted? Seriously?
After a month?

514
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,602
We can explain.

515
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:42,928
Explain to my credit rating.
Do you know what an eviction does?

516
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:45,152
Me and Rusty are hiding out

517
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,414
for a while.
Maybe if you came by more often...

518
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:49,418
- What're you hiding from?
- Not important.

519
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:51,479
Something at the KT house.
Look at him.

520
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:53,981
I try to get it out of him.

521
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:56,418
I think we need to work together.

522
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:58,652
Stop. We have to deal with Sheila.

523
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:01,364
Just make it right for her.
We need to...

524
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,972
offer her something she wants.

525
00:29:08,056 --> 00:29:10,164
What do you guys got on your mind?

526
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,811
- Do I have to?
- She likes you best.

527
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:15,923
I get all nervous
when I talk to her.

528
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,680
It's just because
she's in a position of power.

529
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:23,940
- I think it's her breasts.
- Just keep looking in her eyes.

530
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:25,719
What is this...?

531
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:39,276
What can I do for you?

532
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,919
I was just wondering

533
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:45,825
if there were any apartments available
in the building that are vacant?

534
00:29:46,632 --> 00:29:50,079
The staff here at the Titan Towers
doesn't find you worthwhile tenants.

535
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:52,878
I know, but I think
you got the wrong impression.

536
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:56,572
I'm not a fraternity guy.
I don't drink or smoke.

537
00:29:57,158 --> 00:30:00,047
Look, I took a purity pledge.
I'm saving myself for marriage.

538
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:01,378
Really?

539
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:03,300
I did not know that.

540
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:06,804
Women should be cherished and...

541
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:09,903
respected, like a...

542
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:13,227
like a bottle of fine wine.

543
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,023
What you saw at the apartment
this morning, that's not...

544
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,719
Tell me more about
those women and wine.

545
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:28,019
You know, you wouldn't want to pop
the cork from the bottle

546
00:30:28,144 --> 00:30:29,635
as soon as you buy it, right?

547
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,947
Of course not.

548
00:30:31,072 --> 00:30:34,788
You got to let it age and ripen,
until it's just right.

549
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,801
And when it's ready,
you take out your corkscrew and...

550
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:40,337
you just make it...

551
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,430
pop.

552
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:45,963
Dale, I find you...

553
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:48,429
intoxicating.

554
00:30:50,336 --> 00:30:51,336
Do you?

555
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:53,764
I really do.

556
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:59,088
It'd be a shame if I had to move out
of the building and we couldn't...

557
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:00,213
hang out.

558
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:05,321
Lucky for both of us,
a unit just opened up.

559
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:07,008
Is it a pretty big unit?

560
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,515
I'm sure it's plenty big.

561
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:17,871
Jordan, can we talk?

562
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:19,161
Look.

563
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:21,795
I know. You've de-pledged.

564
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:23,532
I got that message loud and clear.

565
00:31:23,657 --> 00:31:25,793
But until I turn in your drop form
into Pan-Hellenic,

566
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,306
you're still my little sis.

567
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:29,851
- And I need your help.
- What's going on?

568
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:32,492
Look,
when I gave you Mr. Purrs-A-Lot,

569
00:31:32,617 --> 00:31:35,608
I left out a small part
of our ZBZ family history.

570
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:39,160
You have an evil grand-big-sis
named Frannie.

571
00:31:39,658 --> 00:31:41,621
Really? Why is she evil?

572
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,968
It's a nature versus nurture discussion
we just don't have time for.

573
00:31:46,522 --> 00:31:47,696
All you need to know is

574
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:50,783
she broke away from ZBZ
and started a rival sorority.

575
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,202
She also started
dating my ex-boyfriend.

576
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,163
This is after she broke us up.
In fact, she even...

577
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Anyway,

578
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:04,907
she's challenged ZBZ to a contest,
and we need to kick her ass.

579
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:06,966
Why do you need me?

580
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:09,845
You said you played softball.

581
00:32:10,182 --> 00:32:11,929
I'm assuming
you've got an arm on you.

582
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:15,536
- You need me to play softball?
- Nope. Too civilized.

583
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,018
I need you to play dodgeball.

584
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:32,359
I don't think this
is a good idea, Case.

585
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:35,635
I had to take off my jewelry
and I'm feeling really naked.

586
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,055
We're gonna be fine.
We got Jordan.

587
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:42,136
I loveve this.

588
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:45,293
I finally get to throw things at you
without looking like the bad person.

589
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:46,839
No ringers.

590
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:50,134
You poached her from the hockey team.
She has lesbian all over her.

591
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,834
She's not a lesbian
and she's not a ringer.

592
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,980
- She's our pledge.
- She was your pledge.

593
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:58,721
I still am a pledge.
And trust me.

594
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:01,656
The only time I'll appreciate your ass
is when I kick it.

595
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:06,864
That's your grand-big sis.

596
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,918
Let's crush her.

597
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,745
Remember, if the other team
hits you below the neck you're out.

598
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,578
If you catch the ball,
then your opponent is out.

599
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:22,666
The team still standing
at the end wins.

600
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,072
Ready...

601
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:53,530
They allowed to throw hard?

602
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:56,145
OK, so maybe dodgeball
isn't our best sport.

603
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:08,837
- This shouldn't take long.
- Good. I have to pee.

604
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,310
Go throw it at them!

605
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:29,901
Throw!

606
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:33,339
Nice.

607
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:37,092
Beth, throw this ball as hard
and fast as you can.

608
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:38,687
I don't want to hurt them.

609
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:40,579
If you do it,
I'll boy you frozen yogurt.

610
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,876
- Can I get mine in a waffle cone?
- You bet.

611
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,468
You be ready. Let's go!

612
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:03,600
That's not bad.

613
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
Son of a bitch!

614
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:19,825
ZBZ has three players left.
IKI's down to five.

615
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:25,622
ZBZ, with just two players left.

616
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:28,500
Awesome!

617
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:31,211
Nice, Casey.

618
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,497
ZBZ with a catch.

619
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:34,923
<i>- IKI down to three players</i>
- Come on.

620
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:46,773
We're down to our final four.
Last team standing wins.

621
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:50,541
Beth, take Casey out.

622
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,418
I'll try not
to make it hurt too much.

623
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,062
Before you throw it,
I think your ball has a leak.

624
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,325
Can I see it?

625
00:35:57,673 --> 00:35:58,485
Sure.

626
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,695
Beth, don't!

627
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:02,701
Nice one.

628
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:05,499
Sorry, Beth, you're out.

629
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,168
- Bye, Casey!
- Bye, new girl!

630
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:14,681
IKI down to one player.

631
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:17,593
May I?

632
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:19,051
Take her out.

633
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:23,492
That's a catch.

634
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:25,974
We won!

635
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,817
Casey, I told you we'd win...

636
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:29,770
The winner is Zeta Beta Zeta!

637
00:36:40,118 --> 00:36:41,447
That was awesome!

638
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,564
See, Jordan,
there's a place for you at ZBZ.

639
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:07,266
We're not just girly-girls.

640
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:11,449
We like to spend a Sunday kicking ass
before we watch the game at Dobler's.

641
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,877
I didn't know you guys
were football fans.

642
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,794
Really, we just watch the guys
that watch the game, but...

643
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:21,238
- You do?
- I'm just here for moral support.

644
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,958
Who is that?
Enquiring minds want to know.

645
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,631
That is Andy,
a KT pledge I'm dating.

646
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:42,571
You're dating Rusty's
little brother?

647
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:45,446
Last week,
he took me to the Olive Garden.

648
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:49,141
It is so hard
to flirt around endless breadsticks.

649
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:52,227
You totally like him.

650
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:04,156
Come in.

651
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,912
Let me guess,

652
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,622
you're here to discuss
the Winter Semi-Formal?

653
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,663
What happened?

654
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:20,379
Now, you want to discuss this?

655
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:22,090
Why'd you cheat on me?

656
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:24,801
Why'd you bring her to the house?

657
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:26,762
Were you trying to hurt me?

658
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:31,269
A little.

659
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:34,905
It can really make you crazy
when you doubt whether

660
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:37,986
the people close to you
really care about you.

661
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,560
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why, because

662
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:42,694
I don't have a trust fund?

663
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,406
You used me to make Casey jealous.

664
00:38:46,746 --> 00:38:49,409
We both started this relationship
as a business arrangement,

665
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,745
- back at spring break.
- I know what my motives were.

666
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:54,256
Yours, I still don't get.

667
00:38:54,675 --> 00:38:56,776
Why do you care so much
about being a Chambers?

668
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,294
This isn't exactly
Victorian England.

669
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:03,958
- You wouldn't understand.
- Well, try me.

670
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:13,517
When my mother was younger,
she could've married anyone she wanted.

671
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:15,272
She's beautiful,

672
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:16,897
like me.

673
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,409
Old money family in Virginia.

674
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:23,109
Then one night she meets this handsome,
aspiring musician from New York.

675
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,726
My grandparents disapprove
and give her an ultimatum.

676
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:30,435
She can have her inheritance
or my dad.

677
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:34,054
And in this grand romantic gesture,
she chose him.

678
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,956
She didn't care he was broke.
She loved him.

679
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:38,105
Until

680
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:41,835
he took the show on the road,

681
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:44,104
and we never saw him again.

682
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,426
I didn't know that.

683
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,178
I didn't want you to.

684
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:53,056
I always thought she was stupid
to give all that up

685
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,392
for something as unreliable as love.

686
00:39:57,232 --> 00:39:58,519
But maybe she was right.

687
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:02,983
Do you like her?

688
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:06,153
The girl in the car?

689
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,524
Honestly? I hardly even know her.

690
00:40:10,446 --> 00:40:13,406
Last year,
when you cheated on Casey,

691
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:16,371
I told her to ignore it.
Remember?

692
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:20,752
To just find a way to make it

693
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:22,878
right for herself,

694
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:25,422
to stay with you for all
the advantages you could give her.

695
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,410
Nice.

696
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:30,952
It's a lot easier

697
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:33,305
to give that advice than to take it.

698
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:38,712
It wasn't all opportunity, you know.

699
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:41,469
Us.

700
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,048
I know.

701
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:47,194
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

702
00:40:48,872 --> 00:40:49,863
Me, too.

703
00:40:53,556 --> 00:40:54,868
You gonna be OK?

704
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:57,742
I'm gonna be OK.

705
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:01,374
The I-Kaps could use you
in our corner though.

706
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:04,648
We are the hottest girls on campus.

707
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:09,590
You should really work
on that confidence problem.

708
00:41:11,994 --> 00:41:15,388
I'll add it
to my self-improvement list.

709
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,033
Good luck, Evan.

710
00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:40,561
Spitter's back.

711
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:43,189
You need a place to crash
till you find a new apartment?

712
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,529
That's OK.
Dale got us a new apartment.

713
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:47,712
And I think he got
himself a girlfriend.

714
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:49,723
Impressive for a shut-in.

715
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:52,241
Is it one of those
prison pen-pal type things?

716
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,553
It's our apartment complex manager.

717
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:57,661
Trust me,
it's weirder than it sounds.

718
00:41:58,228 --> 00:41:59,807
So does this mean no more nachos?

719
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,334
No more nachos.

720
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:05,310
And no more
avoiding uncomfortable situations.

721
00:42:06,445 --> 00:42:08,316
I'm sorry, I lost you after nachos.

722
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,946
I've been avoiding
coming over to the house.

723
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,202
Watching Andy and Jordan
together is physically painful.

724
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:17,647
It's kinda like watching Michael Douglas
and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

725
00:42:19,111 --> 00:42:20,078
Kinda.

726
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:25,145
I know that feeling well.

727
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:27,408
It's torture, watching the girl
of your dreams

728
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:29,004
on the arm of some other guy.

729
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:32,845
I just wish I could accept it
and stop hoping for things to change.

730
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,754
You've always got to have hope.

731
00:42:39,094 --> 00:42:41,266
I'm going in.
Wish me luck.

732
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:47,513
There's my big bro!

733
00:42:47,955 --> 00:42:50,108
Rusty, where have you been?
I've missed you.

734
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,943
Nowhere important.

735
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,085
What's new with you guys?
