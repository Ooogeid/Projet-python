4
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:24,383
Hi, I'm Rusty Cartwright.
I'm a freshman. College!

5
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,642
Pretty exciting, huh?

6
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:37,169
Tomorrow night, we are gonna host
over 1,000 girls for rush.

7
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:39,859
And we're gonna get all types.
We're the best,

8
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:42,354
so of course
we accept nothing less.

9
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,590
Now, what can you tell me
about Ashleigh

10
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,942
just from her appearance?

11
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:48,367
Anyone?

12
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,635
There are four things
that I see right away.

13
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:54,924
One : the stain on the right side
of her Theory shirt. Means she's sloppy.

14
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:57,138
Two : her Marc Jacobs skirt looks

15
00:00:57,273 --> 00:01:01,306
brand new, but is last season,
so I'm guessing clearance rack raid.

16
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,515
Three : her Prada shoes, while quite
nice, are too big for her feet.

17
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:06,974
Probably on loan from a friend
with better taste

18
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,826
and more money. Four...

19
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:11,291
The bags under her eyes.

20
00:01:11,464 --> 00:01:14,011
She's a party girl who's probably
still drunk from last night.

21
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,447
That's all true!

22
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:20,187
Thank you, ladies.

23
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:26,028
Speaking of, when talking to rushees,
do not discuss drinking, drugs, or sex.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,422
- What if they ask about it?
- We have a reputation to uphold.

25
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:30,927
Lie!

26
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:35,751
Remember, I don't care if she's
the lamest, fattest girl in the room.

27
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,643
Your mission is to make every girl
who walks through that door

28
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:41,669
wanna kill to be your best friend.

29
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:43,179
Clear?

30
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,358
Why don't we break for the day?

31
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:47,974
Maybe...

32
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:50,048
... we could go to the
retirement center,

33
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,421
spread some cheer,
rack up on our philanthropy hours.

34
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:59,748
I know, I'm like a stand-up comedian
all of a sudden, right?

35
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,474
Rush just makes me so rowdy!

36
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,364
Everyone with an ID,

37
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:07,315
fake or real, meet me at
Dobbler's in exactly one hour.

38
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,706
Move out!

39
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:11,299
Casey, walk with me.

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,324
Oh, you came to play.
I'm impressed.

41
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,287
Frannie, please.
This is rush.

42
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:18,460
So, I have some inside scoop.

43
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,404
Rebecca Logan,

44
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:24,991
daughter of our fair state senator, is
coming here this fall, and she's rushing

45
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,075
I want her. Having a senator's daughter
could do so much for us.

46
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,588
That's as good as a Bush twin.

47
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,652
But without the whole...
war thing.

48
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:34,657
Having a high-profile pledge like
her puts more alumni money

49
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,959
- in the party fund.
- Exactly.

50
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,611
The sluts at Tri Pi have already
taken her to Canyon Lake,

51
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,135
so we have to up our game,
sell our reputation,

52
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:46,504
and sell the fact that we have a direct
line to the hottest guys on campus.

53
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:50,443
From what I hear, she's a little boring,
so give her all the help you can.

54
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:52,591
Maybe recruit that stud
boyfriend of yours

55
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:54,270
and some of his Omega Chi brothers.

56
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,891
No worries.
It's in the bag.

57
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:57,024
And Casey,

58
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:58,987
as you know,
I am graduating this spring.

59
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:01,929
And I am seriously considering
who will be my successor.

60
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:04,116
Being president of Zeta Beta...

61
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:06,603
Is the most prestigious honor
offered at this college.

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,897
It tells the world you are
the best of the best.

63
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:10,342
It changed my life.

64
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:11,635
You're campus royalty.

65
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:14,182
Land Rebecca Logan...

66
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,808
and you could be the heir
to my throne.

67
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:30,845
- Call you later.  - No, Casey, wait.
Do you know where Cal...

68
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,543
<i>1x01 Pilot</i>

69
00:03:58,126 --> 00:03:59,154
I'm Dale.

70
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:00,877
All right.

71
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,464
Hey, Dale. Nice to meet you.

72
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:03,940
A Yankee, huh?

73
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,036
I guess.
I'm from Chicago.

74
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,628
I didn't realize
people still used that word.

75
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,573
Oh, I didn't
mean anything by it.

76
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:13,779
I mean, you gotta be pretty smart

77
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,266
to get in the honors
engineering program.

78
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:16,512
How'd you know that?

79
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:19,005
This is the honors engineering floor.

80
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:21,497
You know, it seems kinda weird

81
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:22,615
puttin'us all in here together,

82
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,252
considering how competitive
the program can get. But...

83
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,320
I mean, you...
you don't gotta worry.

84
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,537
Um, I am not into that stuff.
I'm just real, real confident...

85
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,265
... when it comes to my grades.
Graduated with a 3.7.

86
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,220
Got a... 2110 on my SATs.

87
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,281
- Cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

88
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,176
How about you?
How'd you do?

89
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:45,183
I... 3.9-something
and 2280.

90
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,078
Right, right...

91
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,415
- Are you going to the big department
orientation party tonight? - A party?

92
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,581
College party?
Yeah, it sounds great.

93
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,373
Uh... germs.

94
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,355
Fantastic.

95
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,237
Okay, here is to the future
of Madame President.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,139
Nothing is definite yet, but

97
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:25,817
this is seriously what I've wanted

98
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,052
since I came to Cyprus-Rhodes.

99
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,414
It's huge for me.

100
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,860
And now it's yours for the taking.

101
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:33,710
Good lord.

102
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,656
What the hell is that idiot doing?

103
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:39,512
Good thing you won't ever date him.

104
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,442
Oh wait, you did!

105
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,082
You sure are eating
a lot of chips, Ash.

106
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:47,827
Rush starts tomorrow.

107
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:51,467
I gotta go to the bathroom.

108
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,595
Evenin'.

109
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:01,260
Have you no self-respect?

110
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,336
In my book, you gotta
respect yourself a lot

111
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:06,694
to walk around showing off
a package this early before Christmas.

112
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:08,095
Takes you back, doesn't it?

113
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:11,105
Oh, yeah... to those drunken nights
at the Kappa Tau house,

114
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,255
having the choice of

115
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,176
seeing you get stoned, or
watching Old School for the 900th time.

116
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:17,878
Don't go getting
all nostalgic on me.

117
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:19,715
Look, Case, the reason
I broke up with you is...

118
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:21,069
I dumped you.

119
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:24,448
And the important thing is,
we both can love again.

120
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:26,741
Hey, Crappie.

121
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,536
The name's Cappie.

122
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:30,281
For that, I truly am sorry.

123
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,546
Haven't they taught you Kappa Tau boys
how to dress yourselves yet?

124
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:35,765
Well, Evan, we Kappa Tau boys spend
so much time with our clothes off,

125
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,261
we just figured, why bother?

126
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:39,880
Your girlfriend and I were just
talking about that, actually.

127
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:50,445
That's my cue.
Always a pleasure.

128
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,935
What were you thinking?

129
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,228
I was young
and naive.

130
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,930
Call you later, Rusty.
Promise.

131
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:04,330
No, no, wait.

132
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,039
Oh... My stupid brother.

133
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:08,568
You have a brother?

134
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:22,533
Casey?

135
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:25,275
Casey?

136
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:29,776
Boy in the house!

137
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:31,356
You didn't tell'em
you had a brother?

138
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:32,575
Rusty, what are you doing here?

139
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:35,364
You wouldn't return my calls.
What was I supposed to do?

140
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:42,000
I knew we'd have to figure out
this new situation at some point.

141
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:45,116
I accept that you go here now.
It's...

142
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:50,276
- A given? - I'd like to say
unavoidable, but that sounds too harsh.

143
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,972
- Inevitable?
- That's it!

144
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:54,776
You being here is... inevitable.

145
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,396
So I thought maybe...

146
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:57,916
I could coordinate a monthly brunch.

147
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,691
Where we get together, catch up.

148
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,331
I'm totally willing to do that.

149
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:02,709
You might not have to.

150
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:06,539
I've decided that I want
to rush a fraternity.

151
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,209
No.

152
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,403
- Why not?
- Euh...

153
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,395
because guys in fraternities are hot.

154
00:08:13,962 --> 00:08:15,841
And... they have upper bodies.

155
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,461
They don't study engineering.

156
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:18,613
Polymer science.

157
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,606
See, guys in fraternities
would kick your ass

158
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:22,304
just for saying
"polymer science. "

159
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,395
It's not like I'm saying
I want to join your sority.

160
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,512
Look, I was at
an engineering party last night

161
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,441
with my roommate,
who I suspect is kinda racist.

162
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,818
And we stood around
a multipurpose room, talking

163
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:37,896
about all the theoretical scientific
inconsistencies of The Matrix.

164
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:42,429
- And this is weird for you because...
- There were robots, Casey. Robots.

165
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:47,513
Look... I wanna have
a real college experience.

166
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,867
- I wanna have fun.
- You don't know how to have fun!

167
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,548
But I can learn!
Isn't that what college is for?

168
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:53,677
Hell, no.

169
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:55,907
You and I,

170
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:58,434
we've always stayed
in our respective worlds.

171
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,547
I never crashed one of your
gay camp sleepovers.

172
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:02,734
- Wilderness excursions.
- Whatever.

173
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,541
My point is...

174
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,224
you have your world,

175
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:07,455
and I have mine.

176
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,839
But I don't have
a world anymore.

177
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:13,640
Please.

178
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,141
Help me.

179
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:18,540
I'm trying to help you.

180
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,527
You're not fraternity material.

181
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,554
You're just gonna be
disappointed.

182
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,047
I'm gonna do it, Casey.

183
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,721
- Monthly brunches. I'll call you.
- I will join a fraternity!

184
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:41,359
Okay, gather'round, everybody.
Gather'round.

185
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:42,748
Eyes and ears on me.

186
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:44,851
The first house
we're gonna be visiting tonight

187
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:47,089
is Lambda Sigma Omega.

188
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,828
Over the next couple of hours,

189
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,684
we're gonna be visiting
all 14 houses on campus. So...

190
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,315
if you have any last-minute
letters of recommendation,

191
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:56,032
Be sure you get those out tonight.

192
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,015
Hold on to those letters
of recommendation

193
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,137
until you get to the house
of your first choice.

194
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,823
Letters of recommendation?
Is he serious?

195
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:07,064
They're not required.
More of an unspoken necessity.

196
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:08,899
Weed out.

197
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:11,302
Medical school admissions
are less involved than this.

198
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,109
Welcome to the Greek system.

199
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:18,139
So how important is athletics
to the Lambda Sigs?

200
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:21,192
Real important. We're intramural
champs four years in a row.

201
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:22,486
You guys play football?

202
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,122
Oh, I played for a year.

203
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,116
In Little League.

204
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:31,743
I was All-State quarterback
for my high school.

205
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,155
The university courted me,
but I opted out of playing

206
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,508
so I could focus
on sports medicine.

207
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,752
- What was your name again?
- Calvin Owens.

208
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:41,240
Glad to meet you.
Let me introduce you around.

209
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,202
So you guys have some
raging toga parties, huh?

210
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,558
Anyway, wax is okay,
but it builds up in your hair.

211
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:56,159
- Pomade's better.
- See, I learned this trick

212
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:58,056
when I was modeling in Milan.
You just take a...

213
00:10:58,796 --> 00:11:01,183
- You modeled in Milan?
- Oh, nothing major. I mean...

214
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,658
just a couple summers.
I was offered a deal with Abercrombie,

215
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:06,455
but I turned it down so I could
come here and study communications.

216
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:08,431
That's what I'm studying!

217
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:11,360
- Get out!
- Calvin, right?

218
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:18,690
Shalom.

219
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,728
Calvin Rosenberg.

220
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:29,782
I really love traveling
places with beaches.

221
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:31,788
And sand.

222
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:35,340
- Yeah... sand's great.
- Excuse me.

223
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:38,454
- Casey, can I borrow you a sec?
- Thank you.

224
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,196
That girl was verbally handicapped.

225
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:43,019
Rebecca Logan's here...

226
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,922
I've greeted her, and I've already
told her that I wanted her to meet you.

227
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:47,542
Make me proud.

228
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,226
Rebecca? Hi.

229
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:53,638
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm Casey Cartwright.

230
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,467
- Hi. Beautiful house.
- Oh, well, thank you.

231
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:58,648
It was designed
by the Irish architect

232
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:02,137
Charles D. McKenzie, and erected
in the 19th century Colonial style.

233
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,566
- I know. I'm a fan of his.
- You have great taste.

234
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:10,427
So let's cut to the chase.
Tell me about the Zeta Betas socially.

235
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,608
We have an awesome time.

236
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:14,915
We cohost mixers
with Omega Chi,

237
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,152
who are the hottest guys on campus.

238
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,985
We have formals, date dashes,

239
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:20,946
unbelievable trips.

240
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,426
And those don't get too crazy,
do they?

241
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:27,664
Our reputation on campus
is based on our tradition of upholding

242
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:31,154
the graceful qualities of a fine,
honorable woman.

243
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:36,139
Good for you.
Well, it was great meeting you, Cassie.

244
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,324
Sitting this one out?

245
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:56,131
Shoulda sat out
this whole night.

246
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,250
I had no idea
it'd be this hard.

247
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:01,304
These guys aren't gonna
take me seriously.

248
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,212
Even these fish
are judging me.

249
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,331
Maybe you shouldn't take it
so seriously.

250
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,726
It's a fraternity.
It's all about fun.

251
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:10,996
- So have fun.
- You having fun, Calvin Rosenberg?

252
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,682
I'm having a blast. Look...

253
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:15,842
it doesn't matter what I told
those other guys.

254
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:18,169
I'm a Omega Chi legacy.

255
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:21,909
- I'm stuck here. - You're a legacy,
so you can't screw up.

256
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:28,517
Relax. You seem like a really nice,
smart guy. Just be yourself.

257
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:32,818
And if that doesn't work,
be someone else.

258
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,497
No one knows you here.
You can be anyone you want.

259
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:38,240
All right?
Hey. Ready?

260
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:40,545
Let's go. Time's running out.

261
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:45,053
So we have a lot of parties here.
It's really cool. There's...

262
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,356
Hey, guys.
My name's Calvin Owens.

263
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,787
My dad was an Omega Chi,
class of'85.

264
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:53,155
This is my buddy
Rusty Cartwright.

265
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:55,087
He was on The O.C.

266
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,242
You're Casey's little brother.

267
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,805
- How'd you know?
- I'm her boyfriend. I'm Evan.

268
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,857
- I didn't know she had a boyfriend.
- I didn't know she had a brother.

269
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,219
Not till yesterday.

270
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,306
You know, she also didn't
tell me you were rushing.

271
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,578
Well... she wanted it to be fair.

272
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,573
No playing favorites.

273
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:15,776
Shoot, well, that's what
this process is all about.

274
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,082
So tell me, Rusty,
why are you rushing?

275
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:20,756
To join a fraternity.

276
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,362
Well, I don't know if you're aware
of the following statistic.

277
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,665
2% of the American male
population was in a fraternity.

278
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:31,985
It's not a lot of people,

279
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,324
but that 2% represents some of the
most influential men in this country.

280
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:39,759
43 CEOs of the top 50
U.S. companies are Greek,

281
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:44,709
and all but three of the U.S. presidents
since 1825 were in fraternities.

282
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:49,259
But, I mean, prestige aside, I like
the idea of having a group of friends

283
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:53,279
who share a sense of tradition
fostered by an institution

284
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,024
that's over two centuries old.

285
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,951
Brothers for life.
Right?

286
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:07,987
That is the best answer
I have heard all night.

287
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,282
Okay, everybody, time's up.
One house to go.

288
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,514
Hey, Rusty, you know...

289
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:19,945
when you guys are done,
you should swing back by.

290
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,503
You know, we'll be hanging out.

291
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:23,171
Just... nothing too fancy,
having some beers,

292
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,235
maybe some girls...
for you single gents.

293
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,109
Wink wink, nudge nudge.
But seriously, you should come by.

294
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,154
- Thanks, Evan.
- No problem.

295
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,484
Okay.
Here you go, guys.

296
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:43,473
Good luck.
I'll... I'll see you later.

297
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:07,862
I'm Wade Matthews,
rush chair.

298
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:18,428
So... who here
has heard about us?

299
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:21,731
Knows our reputation?
If you have, please, raise your hand.

300
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,345
Wonderful. All right,
everyone with your hand up,

301
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:26,851
get out.

302
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:29,043
Now.

303
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:38,401
All right, you three...
come with me.

304
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:44,634
Come on.

305
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:52,735
All clear!

306
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,140
Holy crap.

307
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:05,648
We prefer virgins.
Welcome to Kappa Tau.

308
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,199
Kappa Tau!

309
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,164
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

310
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:27,883
I'm Cappie.
President of Kappa Tau Gamma.

311
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:29,176
Sorry for all the secrecy,

312
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:32,494
but the Hellenic ass clowns don't
allow this type of fiesta during rush.

313
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:36,443
So we keep it on the D.L.
Name? Home state?

314
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,818
I'm Rusty Cartwright.
I'm from Illinois.

315
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,700
Really?
Do you know Casey Cartwright?

316
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:43,803
Yeah, she's my sister.

317
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,231
- I didn't know she had a brother.
- Did she not tell anyone about me?

318
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:53,229
- How do you know her?
- Uh... in the Biblical sense.

319
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,078
From church.

320
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:58,115
- Trade ya.
- Hey, I know this guy.

321
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,219
Rusty, this is the Beaver.

322
00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:02,166
Like the TV show?

323
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:04,859
The TV... the TV...
Who sent you?

324
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,877
What are you, a narc? Come on,
there's someone else I want you to meet.

325
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:12,542
Hot girl, Rusty.
Rusty, hot girl.

326
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,367
Okay, now it's real easy.

327
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:17,044
It's salt, shot, lime.

328
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:18,476
S, S, L.

329
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:20,271
Yeah, whatever you need, little man.

330
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,479
First, we sprinkle a little salt
on her tightly toned tummy.

331
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:29,230
We take the shot in this hand.
Slip the lime into her mouth.

332
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:33,359
Right.
I can do this.

333
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:41,614
Sorry.

334
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:00,919
Oh, my God.

335
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:04,113
I'm so sorry. I'm so...

336
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,862
What the hell did you do
to my girlfriend?

337
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:07,058
I never had tequila before.

338
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:08,968
Calm down, calm down.
It was an accident.

339
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,064
- He didn't mean to do it.
- He spit on my girlfriend's face.

340
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,798
But licking salt off
her stomach is acceptable?

341
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,783
- I'm gonna kick your ass!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

342
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,356
- I gotta go.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

343
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:39,316
- The bad man can't hurt you now.
- No... no, I'm late.

344
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:40,938
It's great meeting you, Cappie.

345
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:43,834
It's great meeting you too.

346
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:48,897
I like him. Salt me.

347
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,855
Excuse me.

348
00:19:58,134 --> 00:20:00,159
I'm looking for Evan.

349
00:20:02,652 --> 00:20:04,054
Sorry.

350
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,155
Evan ?

351
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,264
Susan, don't.

352
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,295
- Yes?

353
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:55,244
- I'm looking for Rusty.
- It's a little early for visitors.

354
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,069
What are you,
one of his frat bros?

355
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,181
Rusty?

356
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,552
I'm gonna wait outside.

357
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,888
Look, I'd like to personally
apologize for last night.

358
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:15,808
My actions were...
they were simply inexcusable.

359
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,768
Look, I'd never do anything
to hurt Casey.

360
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:22,917
I don't know you all that well, Evan,

361
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:24,981
but I'd like to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

362
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:28,426
That means a lot.

363
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:31,723
You know, I knew you were
the type of guy I wanted in my corner.

364
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:36,417
And that is why I'm going to offer you
a bid to join the Omega Chis.

365
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:41,728
- Really? Are you serious?
- Absolutely. You're a smart guy.

366
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,276
- You know, we'd be lucky to have you.
- Thanks, Evan. - No problem.

367
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:49,405
So I can trust that...
what happened last night,

368
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:50,885
that's just between
us brothers, right?

369
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,365
You're not gonna tell Casey?

370
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:56,864
Look...

371
00:21:57,331 --> 00:21:59,668
I made a horrible mistake.

372
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,304
Okay?
But...

373
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,460
it was one transgression.

374
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,355
And it's not gonna happen again, so...

375
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,453
I don't see why Casey
would need to know.

376
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,717
Take that speech last night.

377
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:12,365
43 CEOs.
All those presidents.

378
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:13,845
I mean, we are all fallible.

379
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:16,961
- Yeah, but she's my sister.
- We could be your brothers.

380
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,606
Look, consider this
a test of loyalty.

381
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:24,578
- You're asking me to lie.
- I'm asking you not to tell her.

382
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,707
Come on.
Don't be such a Boy Scout.

383
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:30,265
It's time to man up.

384
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:33,225
You wanted to join a fraternity.
This is what it's all about.

385
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:35,484
And brothers stick together.

386
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:37,587
For life.

387
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:47,234
That's Rebecca Logan.

388
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:56,893
Rebecca, do you remember me?

389
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:58,996
The architecture freak?

390
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,644
- Cassie?
- Casey.

391
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,520
Isn't it against the rules for you
to talk to me and hold me captive

392
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:08,502
in public restaurant rooms
during rush and stuff?

393
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:12,544
And yes. That's why this entire
conversation is off the record.

394
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,615
I'm aware that you basically have
your pick of any sority on campus,

395
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:17,796
but no one wants you
more than Zeta Beta.

396
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,963
You could join another sority
and be their star,

397
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,158
but at Zeta Beta,
you'd be with the best.

398
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:24,807
We have the best parties,
the hottest guys,

399
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:26,901
and I am willing to give you

400
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,290
not only a bid

401
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:30,523
right now, but a bonus offer
you can't refuse.

402
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:34,104
- What are you offering?
- Anything. You name it, it's yours.

403
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,507
I want my own room.

404
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,131
Done.

405
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:41,739
- Family vacation homes?
- We girls share everything.

406
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:46,173
I'm in.

407
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:52,372
- Are you gonna tell your sister?
- I have to. Don't I?

408
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:55,090
If you do, you can
kiss Omega Chi good-bye.

409
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,501
- Well, what other choice do I have?
- You could forget about

410
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:59,539
this whole ridiculous fraternity thing.

411
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,457
I'm sure your sister
is a lovely person.

412
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:04,524
But it doesn't sound like you two
are that close anyway.

413
00:24:04,674 --> 00:24:06,939
You said so yourself...
she wouldn't help you with rush.

414
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:08,731
- Rusty?
- Yeah, Dale?

415
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:11,934
I know that that I may seem
like just a Christian hick

416
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:13,982
with a very bright future
ahead of him, but...

417
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,413
Can I give you
some advice?

418
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:20,437
Sure.

419
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:24,444
These guys.

420
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,413
You've known'em
for a couple of hours.

421
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:28,859
But she's been your sister
for 18 years.

422
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:31,897
She's always gonna be
your sister. Now...

423
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:35,402
I know that you came here to have fun
and join a fraternity,

424
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,627
and sin in the eyes of God, but...

425
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:41,369
you could be missing out on
creating a relationship with her.

426
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:57,675
At least you're not
wandering into the house.

427
00:24:58,022 --> 00:24:59,770
- That's an improvement.
- I need to talk to you.

428
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:03,353
Is this about brunch? I'm still working
on scheduling. All TBD.

429
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,989
It's not about brunch.

430
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,806
This is about you listening to me
for two minutes. Can you do that?

431
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,844
- Did you go through rush?
- Casey!

432
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:13,713
What is it?

433
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:17,920
I was at the Omega Chi house
last night,

434
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:21,292
- and I saw Evan... - Wait, I don't
know if I want to hear this...

435
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:24,260
- With another girl... - Rusty!
- He was in a private room. And...

436
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:26,904
they were kissing.

437
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:29,085
And, you know,
they were gonna...

438
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:30,358
have sex.

439
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:34,927
- You misinterpreted.
- I didn't.

440
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:38,510
- Then you're lying.
- Casey.

441
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,094
Have I ever lied to you?

442
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:49,550
Are you okay?

443
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:51,108
Um... no.

444
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:56,716
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Casey, talk to me.

445
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,676
- Is there anything I can do?
- Look, I don't need your help, Rusty.

446
00:25:59,828 --> 00:26:01,157
Just go away.

447
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:07,310
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:16,575
Are you okay?

449
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:18,680
Uh, yeah, it's... it's nothing.

450
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:20,942
Honey...

451
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:24,915
I heard about Evan hooking up
with Rebecca Logan.

452
00:26:25,226 --> 00:26:27,658
Rebecca Logan?
She was the girl?

453
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,714
That whore!
God, she's ugly, and...

454
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,689
I gave her a bid
this morning.

455
00:26:33,063 --> 00:26:34,186
Did she accept?

456
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:35,931
Seriously?

457
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:37,989
Sorry, sweetie.

458
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:39,908
Have you talked with Evan yet?

459
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:41,299
No, I'm too mad.

460
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:43,892
I don't want him to think
I'm dumping him out of spite.

461
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,137
You're breaking up with him?

462
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:47,434
He cheated on me.

463
00:26:47,544 --> 00:26:49,195
With one of our pledges.

464
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:50,542
So she did accept the bid.

465
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:52,786
Yes, she accepted
the stupid bid.

466
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:58,805
Well, all I'm suggesting

467
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:00,498
is you think about this :

468
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:02,296
I hate to say it, but

469
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:03,503
but he is Evan Chambers.

470
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:05,090
His family owns half this state.

471
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:08,332
You two are on your way to
becoming "the" couple on campus.

472
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:10,925
When I mentioned you
being president someday,

473
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,444
I can't lie and say
that he didn't factor into that.

474
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:15,389
What it comes down to is,

475
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:17,533
how bad do you want it?

476
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:19,278
I want it, but...

477
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,676
Think of it like this.

478
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:24,516
You would be giving up everything
you worked so hard for because...

479
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:26,661
... he slept with someone else?

480
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,506
That's not fair.

481
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,207
So what do I do ?

482
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:33,150
Just overlook it?
Forgive and forget?

483
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,646
Listen to me.

484
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:36,891
If you want to be powerful,

485
00:27:37,435 --> 00:27:39,148
then you have to learn
to not let things like this

486
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:41,463
get in the way of what you want.

487
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,921
You do what you need to do
to make it right in your mind.

488
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:46,739
That's it.

489
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,100
"Mr. Cartwright,
you are cordially invited

490
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:11,719
to attend the Bid Night party this
evening at 8:00 p.m. at Dobbler's.

491
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:14,861
Congratulations,
welcome to Omega Chi Delta. "

492
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:17,804
"Rusty, you're a Kappa Tau. Cappie. "

493
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:33,788
You up for some competition ?

494
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:37,779
You know I suck at pool.

495
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:40,073
Ah, that's okay.
I'll give you a handicap.

496
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,939
Sure.

497
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:44,445
I'll break.

498
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:48,652
So what brings you out here tonight?

499
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,831
You do remember that
I introduced you to this place?

500
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,590
I'm just taking a night off
from Greek life.

501
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:56,969
A night off
at my secret place.

502
00:28:57,418 --> 00:28:58,475
Secret place ?

503
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,476
You sound like
a 12-year-old girl.

504
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,316
Let's put some stakes on this, huh?

505
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:07,271
It's no fun playing when there ain't
something on the line, right?

506
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,917
If you win,

507
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:10,613
what do you want?

508
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:15,052
How about 100 bucks?

509
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:18,459
And what do you want?

510
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:21,933
What do you think?

511
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:24,978
You're trying to take advantage of me

512
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:28,383
because I'm a little drunk and
a lot bad at this game, aren't you?

513
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:34,129
You're on.

514
00:29:40,694 --> 00:29:43,111
Wait, what's my handicap again?

515
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:44,838
Two balls.

516
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,292
Of course.

517
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,517
I took a class over the summer.

518
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,882
So, where's Numbnuts?

519
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,757
Evan's at Bid Night.

520
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:09,432
I was talking about Rusty.

521
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:14,464
Now... now how would Evan feel

522
00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:16,833
knowing you think
his nuts are numb ?

523
00:30:17,573 --> 00:30:19,152
I don't know
what Rusty's doing.

524
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:22,161
Don't you think it's a little weird
that we dated for over a year

525
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:24,262
and you never mentioned
you had a brother?

526
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:25,749
Sibling rivalry, I guess.

527
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:28,259
And, uh... something I'm not
talking about on my night out.

528
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,153
You know, Cap,

529
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:38,768
I hope I didn't hurt you
when I ended things.

530
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,417
Who said it's over ?

531
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:48,424
Last ball.

532
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,151
Don't scratch.

533
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:02,989
Did you mean to do that?

534
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:06,601
No.

535
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:31,143
Oh, hey, Rusty. What's up, man?
You made it.

536
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,610
Yeah. Where's Evan?

537
00:31:35,732 --> 00:31:36,755
By the bar.

538
00:31:44,218 --> 00:31:45,332
Ginger ale.

539
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,512
Excuse me. Evan.

540
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:51,875
There you are, man.
Here he is.

541
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,160
Congratulations, buddy!
We're happy to have you.

542
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:55,508
I told her.

543
00:31:55,824 --> 00:31:56,828
You told who what?

544
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:58,403
I told Casey
you cheated on her.

545
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:02,025
When ?

546
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,511
What difference does it make?

547
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:05,790
I just thought
that you should know that.

548
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,327
And also, I'm decling your bid.

549
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:09,498
You don't decline us.

550
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,748
All right, we decline you.

551
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:13,850
You couldn't keep your mouth shut.

552
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:15,625
You had to go be
a little bitch about things!

553
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,996
She's devastated
because of what you did.

554
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,355
She's too good for you.

555
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:31,891
That was a mistake,
little man.

556
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:38,443
Hey, nothing to see here, folks.

557
00:32:39,114 --> 00:32:40,693
Everybody,
go back to your beers.

558
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,386
What the hell are you doing?

559
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:54,667
I'm manning up.

560
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:08,432
Get this punk out of here.

561
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,485
This is a private party.

562
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,616
I want his ass
thrown in jail.

563
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,525
Come on.

564
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:03,676
Those aren't mine either,
in case you're wondering.

565
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,343
The less information,
the better.

566
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,224
How about some breakfast?

567
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,734
You make such tasty omelets.
How about it, huh ? For old times'sake?

568
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:15,170
- Later, Cap.
- We're not gonna cuddle?

569
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,425
Last night
was a one-time thing.

570
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,084
Well, it wasn't just
one time last night.

571
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,304
I'm saying...

572
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,496
it's done.

573
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,975
Not to be repeated,
in every sense of the word.

574
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,541
Understand?
Last night was...

575
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,620
it was just a fond trip
down memory lane.

576
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:33,261
Fond ?

577
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:35,335
Call me!

578
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:51,702
Okay, it's clear.

579
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,769
Go out that window.
There's a lattice you can climb down.

580
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,264
Listen, you know, this doesn't mean
I'm gay or anything.

581
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,040
I'm not gay.

582
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:02,619
I was just drunk.

583
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:06,868
See you, Keith.

584
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:08,052
It's Heath.

585
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:09,939
Right.

586
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:27,000
We were studying.

587
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:28,202
For a project.

588
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,446
And I fell asleep.

589
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,213
You guys suck.

590
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:57,484
What the hell
were you thinking?

591
00:35:57,629 --> 00:36:00,392
A bar fight with Evan ? You're
the size of, like, one of his arms.

592
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,405
- I was defending your honor.
- My honor ?

593
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,863
That's the lamest thing I ever heard.
Why couldn't you just...

594
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:06,618
... stay out of it?
He's my boyfriend.

595
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,037
- It's my business.
- You mean, was your boyfriend.

596
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:11,760
You're staying with him?

597
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,417
You're pathetic.

598
00:36:15,826 --> 00:36:17,049
Don't judge me!

599
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:19,260
Don't you dare judge me.

600
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,749
I don't need Jiminy Cricket
sitting on my shoulder

601
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:24,141
telling me what I should
and shouldn't do. That's...

602
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,131
... why I didn't want you
here in the first place.

603
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,325
It's simple, Case.
Someone cheats on you,

604
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:29,448
and you dump them.

605
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,776
I appreciate your idealism,

606
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:35,248
but you'll learn you left
black and white back in high school.

607
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,314
It's shades of gray
from here on out.

608
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:39,787
Doing the right thing
isn't always the right thing.

609
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:41,103
Especially here.

610
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:43,278
- This is my life...
- Your social life.

611
00:36:43,432 --> 00:36:45,091
Which is my life.

612
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:47,905
What do you want, Rusty?

613
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:50,841
Do you want me to lose everything
that I've worked so hard for

614
00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:52,731
because Evan screwed up?

615
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:55,801
Do you want me to
become a social piranha?

616
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:58,035
Pariah.

617
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,285
What ? I don't...
I don't know what you're saying.

618
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:04,035
Pariah. Social pariah...

619
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:05,790
How did you think it was piranha?

620
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,864
No one wants to hang out
with a piranha.

621
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:14,902
What the hell's a pariah?

622
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,636
I won't judge you.

623
00:37:26,832 --> 00:37:28,826
I just want to be
part of your life.

624
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:32,396
Okay.

625
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:34,607
Really?

626
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:39,021
Thank you
for defending my honor.

627
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:40,903
You're welcome.

628
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:43,216
Does your eye hurt?

629
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:45,168
No.

630
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,093
Do you remember the last person
who gave me a black eye?

631
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,038
Yeah.

632
00:37:51,432 --> 00:37:52,464
Me.

633
00:37:57,724 --> 00:37:58,856
Fore.

634
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:01,731
Spitter!

635
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,464
A fine day for nine holes,
wouldn't you say?

636
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:05,776
Indeed, Cappie, indeed.

637
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,589
What brings you
to our fair house?

638
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,023
I think I'm gonna need a putter

639
00:38:09,171 --> 00:38:11,544
and a screwdriver
for this shot, pledge.

640
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,256
Well, I... I wanted
to talk to you.

641
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:17,327
I know I missed the deadline
for bid acceptance,

642
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:19,202
but I still want to join.

643
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:20,617
I wanna be a Kappa Tau.

644
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:23,529
Oh, too late, buddy.
We've already reached our quota.

645
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:28,115
You were supposed to let us
know by last night. Look at that.

646
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:30,548
But I was in jail.

647
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,793
Really?
For what?

648
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,053
Bar fight.

649
00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:36,126
- Anyone good?
- Evan Chambers.

650
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:39,391
- Who started it?
- He did.

651
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,718
- Who ended it?
- Guess I did.

652
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:45,923
You, uh...

653
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:48,488
hit him with one of these?

654
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,442
Pledge paddle.

655
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,636
Would you excuse us, pledge?

656
00:38:53,992 --> 00:38:55,707
Is that part of the
whole hazing thing?

657
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:57,182
Calling'em "pledge"?

658
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,812
No. Can't remember his name.

659
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:03,340
So the only person that can
overturn a missed deadline

660
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,947
is the president of the fraternity.

661
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:07,224
But aren't you the president?

662
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,439
Oh, yes I am.

663
00:39:10,032 --> 00:39:11,088
And...

664
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:12,904
I've considered your appeal.

665
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:16,733
The course awaits.

666
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,137
Let's go, pledge.

667
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:32,562
You know,
the thing for me is,

668
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:34,317
I don't know how
to open up.

669
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:36,824
I hide.

670
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,351
So is this the extent of hazing?

671
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,863
I wasn't finished
opening up, Rusty.

672
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:46,847
But to answer your question, no.
You have a lot of hell ahead of you.

673
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:49,623
Look, Cappie, I got my first class
tomorrow at 8 :00 am,

674
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:52,049
- so I probably...
- You registered for an 8 :00 am?

675
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:54,289
Oh, wow. You are screwed, man.

676
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:56,204
Dad would be so proud.

677
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:58,266
Look,

678
00:39:58,421 --> 00:39:59,675
Evan and I talked
a lot about this,

679
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:02,668
and we agreed we don't want things
to be awkward between us.

680
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,192
Now that you're here,

681
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,238
you both are gonna be
a part of my life,

682
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:08,102
and I really want you
to get along.

683
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,390
Look, Case, it's not that
Evan and I don't get along.

684
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,137
- It's more the fact that...
- She wasn't talking to you, dumbass.

685
00:40:21,623 --> 00:40:22,735
I think she meant me.

686
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,034
Right?

687
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:27,880
Rusty.

688
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:31,099
I hope you and I can grow
to be, if nothing else,

689
00:40:31,454 --> 00:40:32,585
great friends.

690
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,111
Truce?

691
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:40,008
