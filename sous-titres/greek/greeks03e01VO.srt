00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:04,597
Kapatau's having this end
of the world party this weekend.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,336
We'll see what we can do to
get your o-chem grades back up.

3
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:10,225
You left. Aren't you gonna get in
trouble for leaving the lab?

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,988
- I'll figure that out tomorrow.
- I decided I don't want my trust fund.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,799
Don't play this game with us, Evan.

6
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:18,099
We make an agreement, a pledge to
not have sex with our tempters.

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,087
It's the four horsemen
of the apocalypse.

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,537
Don't you read the scriptures?
There's gonna be signs.

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,775
- There is no more I-Kap.
- I'm disbanding the house. I'm leaving.

10
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:29,319
- For real, this time.
- I'm in love with Cappie.

11
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,627
- What are you doing?
- I want to be with you.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,866
Don't ruin things with max
because of some fleeting thought.

13
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,845
- You don't even want to try?
- Dumped?

14
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,687
Casey says it wasn't 'cause of Cappie,

15
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:40,618
- but I know it was.
- How do you know?

16
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,225
I saw them come out
of a closet together.

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,627
And then she dumped me.
Never pick the girl.

18
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,538
They'll leave you every time.
You can count on it.

19
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,829
So Casey broke up with Max
because of you.

20
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:53,592
Let the countdown to
the end of the world begin!

21
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,980
<i>- Six... Five...
- It's the end of the world, Cappie.</i>

22
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:58,228
<i>-  Four... Three...
- What are you gonna do?</i>

23
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:01,015
<i>Two... One...</i>

24
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:37,012
You know, it's kind of weird to
watch people while they sleep.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,181
Sorry.

26
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,142
No, no, I meant him.

27
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,138
Jeremy, go to your place.

28
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:54,218
- Are you OK?
- What?

29
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,824
Still thinking about Casey and Max?

30
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:00,617
Do you really think Cappie's
the reason they broke up?

31
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:01,933
That's what Max said.

32
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:06,044
So are, like, Cappie and Casey
dating now? That's so weird for me.

33
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:11,230
Let's do something fun today,
just you and me.

34
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:14,625
We could
drive up to canyon lake.

35
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:18,795
- That sounds like... Crap!
- It was just a suggestion.

36
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:22,224
No, I have to finish my stupid
O-Chem extra credit today.

37
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,732
You're not gonna get in trouble
for skipping out, are you?

38
00:02:24,857 --> 00:02:26,729
No. Hastings left the lab before I did.

39
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:29,403
I just have to show him
my results first thing tomorrow,

40
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:32,760
which is why I have to get back
to the lab to finish it today.

41
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:34,430
OK, well, good luck.

42
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,096
- Call me later.
- I will.

43
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:47,605
Dude!

44
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:51,080
- Get off my hand, dude.
- Ouch! Dumb-ass.

45
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,847
- Hi.
- Hey.

46
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:00,944
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you still at Fisher's?

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,844
I came home early to check on you.

48
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,913
- Thanks, Ash.
- So, hitting the showers?

49
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:12,801
- Do you want to come with me?
- Why? What's going on in our room?

50
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:14,319
Is someone else in there?

51
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,490
Case.

52
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,452
I had a pity party last night.

53
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:26,958
Is that salsa?

54
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,428
I may have eaten a box
of frozen taquitos...

55
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,090
...and some cookies, but they were
in the 100-calorie packages, so

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,738
I had seven of them.
I also watched

57
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:39,828
the first hour of once twice

58
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:43,398
and the last 45 minutes
of the notebookonce. But today,

59
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,997
I'm great.

60
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,546
So you're OK about Max?
No regrets?

61
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,409
I'm still sad about Max.

62
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,741
But today is a new day.
That's out

63
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:55,275
of my system, no dwelling, no more pity.

64
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,646
I've even decided to stay
positive about Cappie.

65
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,643
I mean, I could sit here,
angst all over myself about

66
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:03,128
him turning me down, but who knows?

67
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,369
Maybe when he finds out
that max and I broke up, then...

68
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:10,595
- I told him.
- Told who what? What's that?

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,592
Last night after you left the party
I found Cappie on the roof and I

70
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,371
told him that you and Max broke up.

71
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,187
You did?
And... And?

72
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,712
It was super dramatic.

73
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,136
It was during the countdown to the end
of the &party and everyone's like,

74
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,221
"eight, seven, six..."

75
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:29,111
So... I mean,
how'd that go?

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,985
Well, he thought about it...

77
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,639
...a lot.

78
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:38,040
I actually sat there for, like,
five minutes until I had to pee, so...

79
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,570
It means he's probably still thinking.

80
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:44,898
Well, if... If

81
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,640
Cappie wants to give us another
shot, then...

82
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:51,985
then he knows where I live.
He can come over here or call me.

83
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:56,177
In the Meantime I am just going to...
Think about other things and...

84
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:03,967
Just in Case.

85
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:09,461
<i>You have felt the love inside</i>

86
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,887
<i>but now that it's through</i>

87
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:17,285
<i>our sister cat is broken</i>

88
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,717
<i>we want to fix you</i>

89
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:24,530
I wasn't sure if you wanted people
to know or not, but...

90
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,565
It's not like it's the end of the world.

VO By :
¤Aka¤, flolo, McFly, Jujuleder

93
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:59,130
I'm sorry about your breakup with Max,
but it's totally for the best.

94
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:02,551
- Thanks, Laura.
- I mean, he was a nerd, but he was hot.

95
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,254
It was just so confusing.

96
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,148
- Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that.
- Time to get some guns, girls!

97
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:09,971
Are we raiding the Iki house?

98
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:14,894
Everyone, so, last night,
the ikis disbanded.

99
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,729
Frannie's left
the greek system for good.

100
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,637
But despite all the bad things she did,
deep down she really was a good...

101
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:23,715
- What are the guns for, then?
- It's for gotcha, the Omega Chis'

102
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:27,565
campus assassin game. Starts today.
Here are your dossiers.

103
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,314
"The object of the game is to
eliminate your assigned target.

104
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,600
If you succeed,
you take their target and the game

105
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:36,108
continues until one lone
survivor Remains."

106
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:39,987
"And the winner receives a party
at Dobler's hosted in their honor while

107
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:42,523
the winner's house gets $500

108
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,569
and five points towards
the greek Blue Ribbon."

109
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:47,812
"The game starts tonight at the dead
man's party hosted by Omega Chi."

110
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:50,156
"Come as your favorite assassin or spy."

111
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:52,452
I call Ethel Rosenberg.

112
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:55,913
So are you gonna go tonight?

113
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:58,153
I might just hang around the house.

114
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:00,381
I got a gamma psi.

115
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:02,068
No way.

116
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,580
- Who'd you get?
- Who do you think?

117
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,954
- Yeah. Wanna trade?
- Cappie can come to me.

118
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:14,768
Or i can hunt him down tonight.

119
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:16,610
I need water.

120
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:19,348
Looks like someone
had a lot of fun last night.

121
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,588
- Is "fun" a euphemism for vodka?
- I didn't have that much fun.

122
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:26,335
Actually, i saw rebecca having
a lot of fun last night, with a guy.

123
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,265
- No, you didn't.
- Who?

124
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,605
It was hard to tell, given his face
was inside her mouth.

125
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:35,068
Becks, who's the mystery man?

126
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:37,565
I'm really not telling
any one of you.

127
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:43,244
Is that my phone?
Whose phone is that?

128
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:48,587
<i>I am the lord your
god, who brought you out</i>

129
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:51,547
<i>of the land of egypt, out
of the house of slavery.</i>

130
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,999
<i>You shall have no
other gods before me...</i>

131
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:58,158
it's actually "Q" from "Star Trek".
Ever since i was a little kid,

132
00:07:58,283 --> 00:08:00,050
i liked to imagine
they sounded the same.

133
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:03,015
This could very well be the worst

134
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:07,200
i've ever felt in my entire life.

135
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:10,483
- What happened last night?
- You don't remember the party?

136
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:13,448
Getting frisky with your buddy grant?
Your purity pledge?

137
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:14,919
Oh, no.

138
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:16,417
Grant and i kissed.

139
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,567
If anyone from the house
saw him, he's screwed.

140
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:20,756
'cause he didn't
want to come out yet.

141
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:23,054
Not to mention how they'll react

142
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,354
having two gay guys in the house.

143
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:28,827
One is fine, but
two is just a bathhouse.

144
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:30,863
So you guys didn't do anything else?

145
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,731
No.

146
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:35,872
Wait a minute.

147
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,708
The only reason i kissed
grant is 'cause i saw you

148
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,735
and the landlady slide
into second base.

149
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,963
What's up with that?

150
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,740
Well, you know, i've got
really powerful pheromones.

151
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:47,045
I had to fake a nosebleed
to get out of there.

152
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,583
At least both of us
kept our purity pledges.

153
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:52,223
Yeah. Hey, whose pants are those?

154
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,782
Those would be mine.

155
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,307
Oh, god.

156
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:05,237
Morning! You're oot and aboot
early this fine sunday.

157
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,613
Looking for Max, eh?

158
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,700
Yep. I'm a friend of his.
I was hoping he can let me

159
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:14,393
into the chemistry
building for this lab today.

160
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:16,936
- Have you seen him?
- He left.

161
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,269
- Do you know when he's coming back?
- Oh, he quit.

162
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:21,660
Quit? What, he quit his ra job?

163
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:24,345
I think he had to since he
quit the graduate program.

164
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,831
Oh, in one night?

165
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:32,096
He went back to england to work with
George Stephanopoulos.

166
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,107
Magda Stephanopoulos.

did he tell you he was
leaving the country?

169
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:45,620
- Did you talk to him?
- This morning.

170
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,707
He said there was nothing
here for him anymore.

171
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:49,505
So he's really gone.

172
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,250
Gee, i'm sorry.

173
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,817
<i>I call heaven and earth to
witness against you today,</i>

174
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,207
<i>that i have set before you life...</i>

175
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:06,385
dale, do you think we can give
q a rest for a little while?

176
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:08,164
Yeah.

177
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,955
<i>... that you and your
offspring may live...</i>

178
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:16,480
you know,
school is a game of averages,

179
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:19,852
and while i've never had
to average in a "d" before,

180
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,712
maybe it's not as bad as we think.

181
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:24,585
So without extra credit,
"d" on my midterm,

182
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,032
even if i make 100 on the final,

183
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:29,183
which is virtually impossible...

184
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:31,496
... my average is still a low "c."

185
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,265
I should've listened to you.

186
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,998
Whoever said "live every day like it's
your last

187
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:37,597
is an idiot.

188
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,685
I guess the first rule
of living every day

189
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,792
like the world's gonna end is to
make sure the world actually ends.

190
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,836
Well, one world kind of ended.

191
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:47,840
Even if i get "a's" in
my other honors classes

192
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:50,684
i'm still gonna drop
below the required 3.5 cum.

193
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,344
So, that's it.

194
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:55,918
I'm out of the honors program.

195
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:05,784
Sorry, rus.

196
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:07,921
I'm dart gun shopping.

197
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,740
- What's in the box?
- It's for you.

198
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,710
It's from Max.

199
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:18,219
So you know he and i, broke up?

200
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,501
- Did you know he went back to england?
- He's gone? How?

201
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,895
The grad program only gave him
a temporary leave of absence.

202
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,164
Apparently he's taking a
permanent leave of absence now.

203
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:31,865
I told you this would happen.
Scorched-earth, you know, remember?

204
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,810
He fled the country because of you.

205
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:37,114
You can't blame me for that.
It was his own choice.

206
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,440
He was my friend

207
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:43,224
and he was the only guy
at cru who inspired me academically.

208
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,925
And now he's gone.

209
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,561
That's no reason for me to
stay in a relationship with him.

210
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:50,464
He just wasn't the right guy for me.

211
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:53,531
- And Cappie is?
- I'm not with Cappie, i don't think.

212
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:56,049
- You don't think?
- Look.

213
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:59,897
I really am sorry about Max.

214
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:03,799
But you can always call
him, email him,

215
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,835
- skype him.
- I need him today,

216
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,593
'cause i didn't finish my
grignard project last night.

217
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,868
Grignard?
Like that guy from entourage?

218
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:13,339
- Maybe i can help.
- Yeah, case, you can help me

219
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:16,616
with my organic chemistry
report on the guy from entourage.

220
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,002
Forget it.

221
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:22,382


222
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:30,813
There's gotta be
something you can do.

223
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:33,917
Is it too late to drop the
class or take an incomplete?

224
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,484
I looked into all that.

225
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,909
Gentlemen, if we want
to dominate at gotcha,

226
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:42,286
then you pukes need all
the practice you can get.

227
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,754
Marksmen, on your... marks.

228
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,539
Aim... fire at Wil... bur.

229
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:53,815
Suck it, Wilbur!

230
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:03,520
That's two points for
Pickle, zero for Spitter.

231
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:06,296
Have you talked to Cappie about this?
He might be able to help.

232
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,511
The last thing i need is his help.

233
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:13,805
- Spitter's disqualified.
- What?

234
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,038
Pickle wins.

235
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,198
- Why'd you shoot an old lady?
- How are you an old lady?

236
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:20,405
Spitter's right.
You could've been a serial killer

237
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,619
dressed to look like an
old lady, for all he knew.

238
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:24,413
Haven't you seen Steel Magnolias?

239
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,720
I don't think that's what
that movie was about, cap.

240
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:28,875
No, but if you imagine they're

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,013
secret homicidal maniacs
it's much more enjoyable.

242
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:32,389
Cut Spitter some slack.

243
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,079
Everything OK, Spitter?
You seem kind of...

244
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:38,282
- clenched.
- I'm fine.

245
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,503
I wish i could say the same for Max.

246
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,771
Yeah. I heard they broke up
last night. How's she doing?

247
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:47,203
Well, we all made choices last night

248
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,349
and we just have to live
with those consequences.

249
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:52,579
I guess you're right.

250
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:54,202
Hey, beav, i'm up next.

251
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:07,276
You really don't remember
what happened last night?

252
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,181
The sex was pretty incredible,
right?

253
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:14,065
No, i totally remember.

254
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:16,594
Just a little hazy, is all.

255
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:19,459
But, yeah, last night was great.

256
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:22,963
Then you remember what
you said, about fate?

257
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:25,287
Fate? Yeah.

258
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,190
And eternity?

259
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,404
Eternity? Really?

260
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:35,546
I know you seem pretty
intent on a small ceremony,

261
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:38,642
but i wouldn't mind
a big wedding in Maui,

262
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,862
with our friends and family.

263
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:43,451
OK, there's no way that
we talked about that.

264
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:46,417
Consider this payback for
telling me dale's your boyfriend.

265
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,126
Dude, you suck!

266
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:50,519
Nothing happened.

267
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:53,867
- We kissed. That was it.
- Yeah, at a kt party.

268
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:56,424
Look, we're just gonna
have to be better

269
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,164
and try to keep it quiet if
this is gonna continue, OK?

270
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,553
Is this gonna continue?

271
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:07,495
What happened to you guys last
night? You didn't come home.

272
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,938
Nothing happened!
I stayed at Rusty's,

273
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:12,945
and grant stayed someplace
completely different.

274
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:16,924
Well, we have a busy day.

275
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,395
I'm gonna take care of the
deposit on the booze for tonight.

276
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,047
Grant, grab some pledges,
go pick it up this afternoon?

277
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,719
Sure. You got it.

278
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:28,627
Maybe later tonight's better.

279
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,472
Yeah. It's a date.

280
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:32,263
Sorta.

281
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,583
Want a cat? Please?

282
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,434
I'm all good, thanks.

283
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,824
You're all dressed up.

284
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:50,119
Oh, yeah. I need to find a
sexy spy costume for tonight.

285
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:53,691
Do you think i can pull off this la femme
Nikita chick without the creepy'80s hair?

286
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:56,632
I talked to Rusty and i'm a
little worried about him.

287
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:59,461
Don't be. He always sounds
like that when he breathes.

288
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:02,499
- You get used to it.
- No, i think he might be in trouble.

289
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:05,885
And i think i'm the last
person he wants any help from.

290
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,954
- Chocolate?
- It's about polymer science.

291
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,072
Really, the last person that...

292
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:12,001
he got a "d" on his o-chem midterm

293
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,371
and he's probably gonna fail
out of the honors program.

294
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:15,694
Fail out?

295
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:18,371
He had a chance to make up for
it with this extra credit project,

296
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:20,659
but he skipped out on
that to go to the party.

297
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:22,236
I'm really worried about him.

298
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:24,942
He's gotta get into the
lab and finish it tonight.

299
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:28,939
Tonight?

300
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:31,202
We could both use
help from our big sis.

301
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:37,823
So fisher and i are going
to the dead man's party

302
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:40,532
as Mr. And Mrs. Smith.
Which should be pretty easy for me

303
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:43,469
since i already have plenty of
dresses that show off my boobs.

304
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:48,839
- You could go as Angelina Jolie in "Wanted".
- What's the difference between angelina jolie

305
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:51,550
in "Mr. And Mrs. Smith" and
Angelina Jolie in "Wanted"?

306
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,579
Four kids, maybe five.

307
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,762
I'm thinking Sydney Bristow.

308
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:59,085
You know what i always
loved about Sydney Bristow?

309
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,307
Her double life. It must
have been pretty hard for her

310
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,877
to have to keep all those
secrets from her friends,

311
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:07,073
her really close friends...

312
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:10,197
- who she goes shopping with.
- Nice try.

313
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,685
I'm still not telling
you who the guy was.

314
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,703
I need cash.

315
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:16,104
I need coffee.

316
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:18,765
But i'm not giving up,
becks. I will not rest

317
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,447
until i find out who
your mystery man is.

318
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:26,157
Was she talking about
your gotcha target?

319
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:27,496
I wish.

320
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,951
How's your bank account zero?

321
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:36,098
I don't know. Must be some
weird bank failure thing.

322
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,010
Banks have been failing
all over these days.

323
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:41,741
What's going on?
You can talk to me.

324
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:47,315
OK. You remember homecoming?

325
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,181
My parent problems?

326
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,108
... i gave up my trust fund.

327
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,401
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you an idiot?

328
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:56,773
I thought you, of all
people, would understand.

329
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,745
Oh, my god, you're poor.

330
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,338
Not completely.

331
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,636
I have some separate accounts,
my credit cards. I'm gonna be fine.

332
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:06,230
For how long?

333
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:07,727
Good question.

334
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:11,651
Do you need some cash now?
I could help you out.

335
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,653
I do. I need some cash for the
deposit on the kegs for tonight.

336
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:18,157
I could pay you back later.

337
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,924
Actually, if i could trouble you
for a favor, we could call it even.

338
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,434
What do you think?

339
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,954
<i>And his sword shall devour flesh...</i>

340
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:34,501
<i>... from the long-haired
heads of the enemies.</i>

341
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,043
<i>Rejoice in him, o heavens!
Bow down to him...</i>

342
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,115
what the hell is that?

343
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,059
It's "Q" from "Star Trek".

344
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:45,448
I've grown to find
him oddly calming.

345
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:49,611
I talked to jordan and she
told me about the honors program

346
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,370
and i'm here to help.

347
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:55,163
I know how important this is to you,

348
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:58,259
and the fact is, when you
want something bad enough

349
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,030
you'd do anything you can to get it.

350
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:03,219
- It shouldn't take all day to figure it out.
- I'm fine with it.

351
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:07,035
You made one hasty decision
without considering the repercussions.

352
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,798
Don't let it ruin your future.

353
00:19:08,923 --> 00:19:10,731
No offense, but how
are you gonna help me?

354
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:13,638
I may not know anything
about organic chemistry,

355
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,869
but i know i can get
you into that building.

356
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:18,427
I don't... no, i don't know.

357
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:20,911
Stop wasting time.
Get your coat and let's go, now.

358
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,655
You know you sounded
like mom just now?

359
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,444
I know, and i'm
freaking out about it, OK?

360
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,882


361
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,908
Did you two call to
have the building opened?

362
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:40,697
Yes. My brother here
forgot his medication.

363
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:46,563
- Yeah, he does look a little sickly.
- Yeah, he's, hypoglycemic.

364
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:50,354
- That's why he looks that way.
- I'm hypoglycemic, not deaf.

365
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:56,115
Rusty, i think you're looking a little
flush, like you might go into shock.

366
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,457
- I don't think i am.
- Trust me. Think you are.

367
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:00,860
I think you are.

368
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,155
I think I'm feeling
a little light-headed.

369
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,348
Let me look in my bag
for a candy bar.

370
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,954
Hold on.
I've got a candy bar.

371
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,209
Really?

372
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,795
Here. Eat this.

373
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:15,611
- Eat this.
- Why?

374
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,926
Listen to him, Rusty.
He's a professional.

375
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:21,322
Oh, God!

376
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:31,104
I think that did the trick.

377
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,799
He's looking much better now.

378
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:33,924
Really?

379
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,402
It comes and goes.
Thank you so much for your help.

380
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,180
I'm gonna take him
to the student health center. Thank you.

381
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,974
You were great.

382
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:44,781
You were so awesome. Thank you.

383
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:46,113
Check you later.

384
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,811
Look at all of these keys.

385
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:53,670
You'd think at a science building
they'd have fingerprint scanners.

386
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,629
If we need his fingerprints,
we can get 'em off my tongue.

387
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:03,214
OK. This might take a while.

388
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,063
Thank you, pledge.

389
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,046
It's my costume
for the dead man's party tonight.

390
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:19,527
Aren't you a little wore out
from last night's party?

391
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:21,474
Yeah. So?

392
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:24,518
Anyway,

393
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,609
I know you seem to help Rusty out a lot
with matters of the heart...

394
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:30,805
- and flesh.
- I'm glad you mentioned Rusty.

395
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,790
He's been moodier than usual today.

396
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,959
Is there like an engineering
menses or something?

397
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,587
Only when you're flunking out
of the program like he is.

398
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,465
Since when?
Why didn't I know about this?

399
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,520
I don't know. I figure he used to talk
to Max more about that kind of thing.

400
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:45,303
I don't know.
Back to my problem, I'm having a...

401
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,262
Used to?

402
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:50,683
Maxi pad skipped the country.

403
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,519
What? Since when?
Why didn't I know about this, either?

404
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:55,730
Did you...

405
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,233
Did you just say "Maxi pad"?
That is still funny.

406
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:00,590
Yeah, I know.

407
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:01,986
He left town this morning.

408
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,448
Where's Rusty now?

409
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,222
He left me a note. Seems he's gonna try
to get into the chem lab tonight.

410
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:08,722
But...

411
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:10,950
- the thing that I'm dealing with...
- I gotta go.

412
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:13,998
- If you could finish up here...
- I'm not even positive what this is.

413
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,764
Kinda having a personal crisis.

414
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,653
- If I could just have a minute...
- You look good.

415
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:21,433
Thanks.

416
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:28,171
Delivery for Rebecca Logan.

417
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:30,527
Rebecca got flowers!

418
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,195
- What?
- You got flowers?

419
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,395
I bet they're from the mystery guy.

420
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:36,563
Don't!

421
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,276
"Last night was amazing."
Signed, "E.C."

422
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,777
Who's E.C.?

423
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,320
Eric Chapman, from Pi Sigma?

424
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,148
Edward Cullen.

425
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:48,825
He's a fictitious character.

426
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,786
Emma cannon? Is she a lesbian?
Are you a lesbian again?

427
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:55,206
- It's Evan Chambers!
- Evan Chambers? Really?

428
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:56,916
You got me.

429
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,306
He and I made out at the party,
and I know that's bad

430
00:22:59,431 --> 00:23:00,878
because of the whole Casey thing.

431
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,198
You don't have to worry
about Casey and the girl code.

432
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:06,217
I can think of a million other reasons
you should want to keep this a secret,

433
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,844
but Casey and Evan are old news.

434
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,638
So you should do
whatever makes you happy.

435
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,808
Evan's gonna be at the party tonight.
You should give it a shot.

436
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,940
Now, tell me everything
that happened last night.

437
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:20,353
God...

438
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:22,229
Where to start?

439
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:26,528
Thanks for letting me raid your closet.
You are the only person I know

440
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:29,711
that might have clothes
resembling Austin Powers.

441
00:23:29,836 --> 00:23:30,836
Thanks.

442
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,370
So you really didn't end up breaking
your purity pledge at all?

443
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,205
Nope. Aren't you proud of me?

444
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:38,875
- The proudest.
- Doesn't mean I'm not going to, though.

445
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,753
I really like Grant. He's awesome.
We're gonna give it a shot.

446
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,588
What about the house
and the brothers?

447
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,122
Just have to keep it quiet.
I did it last year with Heath.

448
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,991
Come to think of it, I'm pretty good
at sneaking around.

449
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:51,988
Maybe I could be a real assassin.

450
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:54,609
Do you know anything about
the four horsemen of the apocalypse?

451
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,100
Yes, Dale, and I get it.

452
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,228
I'm going to hell twice for being gay
and for having pre-marital sex.

453
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,335
Hey, you know what?
If the U.S. Legalizes gay marriage

454
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,234
and Grant and I get married,
am I safe on one of those?

455
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,944
I had sex with Sheila.

456
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,636
I was at that stupid party,

457
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,992
and everybody was talking about the end
of the world and the apocalypse,

458
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:18,372
and it was like
every easter Sunday back home.

459
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,917
I was surrounded by all that partying.
I kept thinking,

460
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,689
what if the world really does end?
I'd die a virgin.

461
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,422
Did you ever have thoughts
like that before you had sex?

462
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:29,581
And then I saw the four horsemen...
I thought it was the four horsemen.

463
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:32,569
I realize now the more obvious
answer is it's probably just...

464
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:34,771
mounted campus security and not...

465
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,349
the sixth sign of the apocalypse.

466
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,392
But, you know, I digress.

467
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,974
And then I heard his voice...

468
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:42,846
Well, q's voice...
telling me it was OK.

469
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:45,636
So while you and Grant stayed back
at the party and boozed it up,

470
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:48,389
me and Sheila came back here
and we did it.

471
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:51,235
She was gone
before you even got back.

472
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,117
No, it's OK.
I washed the sheets nine times today.

473
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:55,643
But...

474
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:58,708
The thing is,
it wasn't the horsemen or q

475
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,058
or anybody else that made me do it.

476
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:04,335
I think I was looking for any possible
reason to do it because I wanted to.

477
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,935
And now I wish I wouldn't have
because sex changes everything

478
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,580
and you cannot change it back.

479
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,401
You tried that one already.

480
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,403
This is taking forever.

481
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:34,155
I got it!

482
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:38,452
- Wait, I just...
- Yeah, now we gotta start over.

483
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:40,371
Sorry.

484
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,835
It's Jordan. She just texted me
to see how we're doing.

485
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,975
So what happened with your grades?

486
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:56,095
I don't know.
I guess I got a little distracted.

487
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:57,638
You must really like her.

488
00:25:58,049 --> 00:25:59,299
Jordan's great.

489
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,852
What I like most is the way I feel
when I'm with her.

490
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:05,313
Do you mean sexually?

491
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,508
Well, we haven't...

492
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:12,278
- exactly...
- OK, no physical stuff.

493
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,446
Sorry.

494
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,732
Since we started dating,

495
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,604
I kinda feel like that guy

496
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:20,668
who doesn't have to think
about studying all the time.

497
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,618
Like, I could just hang out
at the KT house

498
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:26,834
with my arm around my girl.

499
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:29,295
Just have fun, you know?

500
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,421
And that's it.

501
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:32,548
But you're not that guy.

502
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,009
Thanks, Case.

503
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:36,928
No, I mean...

504
00:26:37,877 --> 00:26:40,702
Any guy can be that guy.
You're the amalgam, remember?

505
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:43,046
You can't give up one for the other.

506
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,604
Like you gave up Max for Cappie.

507
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,065
I didn't give up Max for Cappie.

508
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:52,663
I just realized
he and I were too different.

509
00:26:57,963 --> 00:26:59,881
Are you bummed about Max?

510
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:04,041
I really wanted it
to work out with us.

511
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,400
He's a really...

512
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:06,707
good guy.

513
00:27:08,124 --> 00:27:10,711
He did kind of leave
without saying goodbye, though.

514
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,090
Well, sometimes guys leave, Rus.

515
00:27:13,774 --> 00:27:15,611
Sometimes they never show up.

516
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,325
My nose.

517
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,604
You guys know the windows
are open in here, right?

518
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:30,006
Come on.

519
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,083
No killing till midnight.

520
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:54,551
I need your help.

521
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:57,216
Ashleigh saw the flowers
and got the impression that I liked you.

522
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,350
You don't have to sound so grossed out
when you say that.

523
00:28:00,475 --> 00:28:02,824
So, she's coming here tonight
thinking that we like each other

524
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:05,600
and this is our first date or something.
Help me, just for an hour or two.

525
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:10,019
- What's in it for me?
- I already paid you once.

526
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:12,736
You paid me for the flowers.
This is different. I'm spending

527
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:15,026
an entire evening
when I could be hitting on other girls.

528
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,469
I'll pay you

529
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:22,557
because I, unlike you,
am not an insecure mess

530
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:24,618
when it comes to flaunting my money.

531
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,830
Sydney Bristow.
Great costume.

532
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,876
And Evan, you're... wearing

533
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,127
banana republic.

534
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:34,920
I'm Jason Bourne.

535
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,343
I'm not a big costume guy actually.

536
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,124
You would've thought
for your own house's costume party

537
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:44,096
you would've put forth a little
more effort, but whatever.

538
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,308
- Fisher, this is Evan Chambers.
- Nice to meet you, man.

539
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,101
- Yeah, you too.
- So...

540
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
Rebecca told me
all about last night.

541
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:57,347
- That was pretty crazy.
- All that time you were with Frannie

542
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,236
it was an attempt
to get closer to Rebecca.

543
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,975
Makes more sense
than dating Frannie, I gotta say.

544
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,401
- Pretty romantic, right?
- The secret notes,

545
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:06,118
the longing, the subtext.

546
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,705
Who knew all that time you were talking
there was happening on your side?

547
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,541
I keep replaying some
of the conversations you guys had

548
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,832
and imagine them
with what I know now.

549
00:29:14,957 --> 00:29:17,389
<i>It's like watching the sixth sense
the second time.</i>

550
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:19,715
I really don't know what to say.

551
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:28,074
Let me know what I can do to help.
It's what I'm here for.

552
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:29,611
Great.

553
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:34,227
- Nice ninja costume, Cap.
- Thanks!

554
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:37,039
I was gonna head
to the dead man's party tonight.

555
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:39,470
- Thought it might come in handy.
- Speaking of parties,

556
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:41,779
how was the rest of your night
last night?

557
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,197
It was good.

558
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:45,644
Ashleigh told me all about it.

559
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:48,285
You know, the party...
and stuff.

560
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,515
So, I know

561
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,814
about the party...

562
00:29:52,663 --> 00:29:53,663
and stuff.

563
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:01,165
Case, can you grab a clean beaker

564
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,398
- from on top of the shelf?
- Yeah, sure.

565
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:08,755
I just have to get this.

566
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,146
So, this thing kind of
looks like a giant bong?

567
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:21,277
Got it.

568
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:26,949
- I'm a ninja.
- Case, can you quit messing around, OK?

569
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:31,801
Case, I need a nitrogen bubbler.
It's labeled in the drawer over there.

570
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:33,696
Bubbler?

571
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:35,770
Are you sure
we're not making a bong?

572
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:37,530
So what can I do?

573
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:40,024
Chemistry's just like cooking, right?
I watch the food network.

574
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:42,573
- I could be like your sous-scientist.
- But don't...

575
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:45,686
Rusty, six hands
are better than four.

576
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:51,526
Fine. All right. Cappie,
can you grab some hoses over there?

577
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:55,186
I need two for the water and the reflux
condenser, one for the nitrogen bubbler.

578
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,941
Then we plug them
into the valve right there.

579
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,452
OK, I got it.

580
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:06,325
See?

581
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,533
I should totally switch my major.
This is so easy.

582
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,929
Maybe I'll take up chemistry
next semester.

583
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,793
I'm sorry.

584
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,763
Case, can you grab
a nitrogen bubbler?

585
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:28,488
Maybe I'll just stand guard,

586
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:29,845
over here.

587
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:35,645
I think there were
more parts to that.

588
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:39,480
Pledges,

589
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,098
- can you guys get me some water?
- OK, right away.

590
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:44,696
Very cute.

591
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,840
So how much longer do we need
to stay down here?

592
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:52,163
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.
Maybe we should just wait a while.

593
00:31:52,487 --> 00:31:54,638
- Like a half-hour?
- Maybe longer.

594
00:31:55,387 --> 00:31:57,626
- Thirty-five minutes?
- I want to slow down.

595
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:00,350
You know,
sex just changes everything.

596
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:02,795
I'm enjoying right now,
just getting to know each other.

597
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:05,631
And after we get bored with each other,
then we have sex?

598
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,725
Can't believe I'm sneaking
around the house with a guy again.

599
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:12,275
- Again?
- Calvin, here's your water.

600
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:29,291
I think it's working.

601
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,865
You're going through an awful
lot of trouble to keep this secret.

602
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:35,619
Look, seriously, you can tell me.
Who'd you make out with last night?

603
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,830
Not part of our deal, Bourne.

604
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,001
Regret is a powerful emotion, huh?

605
00:32:42,354 --> 00:32:45,761
I'm starting to wonder if giving up my
money was that great of an idea myself.

606
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,817
- You got to stand up to your parents.
- Yeah, but to what end?

607
00:32:50,422 --> 00:32:52,261
The money I have is gonna run out.

608
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,956
I'm not gonna lie to you, Evan.

609
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:56,473
From where I stand,
you are pretty screwed.

610
00:32:57,564 --> 00:32:58,812
I think we both are.

611
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:01,562
So we'll be screwed together.

612
00:33:02,317 --> 00:33:04,440
So we can keep these secrets
just between us?

613
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:06,200
Between us.

614
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,365
- You suck!
- What?

615
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:17,168
If all you're looking for
is a piece of ass, then forget it!

616
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:23,907
I knew you would do something
to screw this up.

617
00:33:33,987 --> 00:33:36,513
I'm all finished. I just have to write
some of these results.

618
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:38,647
- I can put stuff away?
- No.

619
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,853
Come on! I said "I'm sorry" like
a thousand times. It was an accident.

620
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,981
Did you "accidentally"
hit on Casey, too?

621
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:50,235
When? I've been sitting
on this stool for almost two hours.

622
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:52,077
Come on. Last night.

623
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,156
Max told me everything.

624
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:58,410
You admitted you weren't over casey,

625
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,956
and then you pulled her into the closet
to try and win her back.

626
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,084
For all the crap you gave me
for being a douche-mover with Jordan?

627
00:34:05,324 --> 00:34:07,586
At least I felt terrible
for what I did.

628
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,756
You, you've been acting like
you didn't do anything wrong all day.

629
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:12,243
I'm sorry.

630
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,563
- You're right, I'm a douche-mover.
- Stop! Cappie didn't...

631
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,858
... hit on me. He didn't pull me
into the closet. I pulled him in

632
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,956
and told him that I wanted
to get back together with him.

633
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,059
And he turned me down.

634
00:34:27,586 --> 00:34:29,602
Cappie and I
aren't getting together.

635
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:35,037
Are we?

636
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,039
Crap! That's the leak detector.

637
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:46,072
I forgot to turn off the gas!
We gotta go!

638
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:47,292
Case, come on!

639
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,754
No, just leave it.

640
00:34:57,338 --> 00:34:59,025
- Let's go out the side door.
- OK.

641
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,086
Is that it?

642
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:19,908
This can't be good.

643
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:27,630
You two go back into the lab
and leave out the window.

644
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,533
What are you going to do?

645
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:31,648
I'm gonna do what I do best.

646
00:35:33,576 --> 00:35:35,090
Test tubes, not bunnies.

647
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,383
What the hell?

648
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,677
I'm a ninja
for the ethical treatment of animals.

649
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:40,262
N.E.T.A?

650
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,093
Not one of you guys again.

651
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:45,267
Look, there are no animals
in this building.

652
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,289
Really? Then where are they?

653
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:52,524
Did you know there are more animals used
for testing than there are in the world?

654
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:55,611
Well, that doesn't sound accurate.

655
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,737
Well... OK.

656
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,589
Cool.

657
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,996
Hugs, not drugs!

658
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:08,123
Hugs, not drugs!

659
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:14,488
Well, Dale,
you'll be interested to know

660
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:17,143
that grant and I have decided
to hold off on having sex.

661
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:19,648
I'm actually not that interested.

662
00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:21,859
Thanks, Dale.

663
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:23,006
So...

664
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,389
How are you?

665
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:28,062
You know, I've done a lot of thinking,
a lot of soul searching, and...

666
00:36:28,492 --> 00:36:30,997
I think I've come to terms
with my relationship with Sheila.

667
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:32,575
I know what to do now.

668
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,533
That'd be her.

669
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,081
- Hey.
- Hi, Dale.

670
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:42,422
Hi, Dale's friend.

671
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:47,788
I gave you my virginity and now
I need to give you something else.

672
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,089
I think we need to get married now.

673
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:55,045
It's just my class ring.
I'm gonna have to ask money

674
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,096
from my parents
to buy a real one, but...

675
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:03,929
Dale, that is so sweet.

676
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:06,557
And last night was really...

677
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:08,264
Special.

678
00:37:08,496 --> 00:37:12,246
And you're a great tenant, but,
I've been really busy with work.

679
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:14,481
I might have to tend building C

680
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,401
and I have to go to tucson next week
and then there's my cat.

681
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:22,406
So I will totally call you
when things slow down, OK?

682
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:39,047
Hey! How'd it go with hastings?

683
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:41,331
My D is officially a C.

684
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:45,304
Wait, that's it? After everything
you had to do last night?

685
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,176
It's good enough for now.

686
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,259
Thank you for calling
in reinforcements last night.

687
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,855
You kinda saved me.

688
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,099
You have passion for what you do.
I think it's great.

689
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:58,429
Honestly I'm kind of jealous,
'cause I probably would've blown it off.

690
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:00,277
I have to warn you.

691
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,269
I might not continue to be

692
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:05,657
the cool fraternity guy
that you know and love.

693
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:07,201
Like,

694
00:38:07,846 --> 00:38:08,783
I mean.

695
00:38:09,106 --> 00:38:11,455
You might have to share me
with engineering for a while.

696
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:14,296
Sounds like a hot three-way.

697
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,002
So, Becca and Evan?

698
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,291
Yeah, it's weird, the fact
she wanted to keep it a secret.

699
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:26,213
She didn't feel the need to be discreet
last time they hooked up.

700
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:28,642
- People change.
- Totally.

701
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,000
Like Cappie.

702
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:31,886
I really thought he'd come around.

703
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:34,345
Yeah, after all the back and forth.

704
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,389
I can't hardly blame him.
I spent two years telling him "No."

705
00:38:39,242 --> 00:38:40,934
Couldn't expect him to wait forever.

706
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:44,154
- Case.
- What?

707
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,532
<i>You have felt the love inside</i>

708
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,318
<i>But now that...</i>

709
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:50,691
- Stop singing.
- Why?

710
00:38:50,816 --> 00:38:53,216
I'm getting to the
"Meow Kitty Meow-Meow" chorus.

711
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:02,169
- I'll see you at the house.
- OK. Thanks, Ash.

712
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:09,092
Nice vest.

713
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:12,266
Seems to bring out my eyes, huh?

714
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:15,346
That was pretty great,

715
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,937
what you did last night.

716
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:19,200
It was the least I could do.

717
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:21,253
I wasn't gonna help him
with the chemistry.

718
00:39:21,378 --> 00:39:23,318
Now I know how rusty feels
at a date function.

719
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:30,659
- Listen...
- You know...

720
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:34,830
I think the answer's
pretty clear about us.

721
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:36,164
You know.

722
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:37,978
I felt so lame.

723
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:41,415
Yesterday I actually thought
you might change your mind

724
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,439
and come for me
in some grand movie moment

725
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:46,675
that only exists in the deranged mind
of Nora Ephron.

726
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:48,989
Like I said, lame.

727
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:50,580
Anyway,

728
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:52,922
guess I'll see you around.

729
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:56,393
Around it is.

730
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:00,842
Hey, Cap?

731
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:07,919
Gotcha.

732
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:28,068
What the hell am I waiting for?

733
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,566
Hey, Beaver, have you seen Casey?

734
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,483
- Where's Casey?
- Like, recently?

735
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,605
Whoa there, numbnuts.

736
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,632
I'm celebrating
my independence today, man.

737
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:46,026
- Come celebrate with me.
- Actually, I gotta go.

738
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,748
Wait! It's 1:00 in the morning.
Where do you have to be right now?

739
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:51,114
No one's looking.
They're all too drunk to care.

740
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:52,908
Speaking of drunk,

741
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,137
I had the distinct displeasure

742
00:40:56,262 --> 00:40:59,206
of watching casey's enginerd

743
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,834
actually puke into a coat pocket.

744
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:05,962
- It was amazing.
- Ex-enginerd. They broke up tonight.

745
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:08,789
That's too bad.

746
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:12,598
I thought they kinda made sense.
He seemed really good for her,

747
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:15,263
something that you and I
definitely were not.

748
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:19,184
- Why do you say that?
- I don't know why you still care.

749
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:24,231
- Please, tell me you aren't...
- Aren't what?

750
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:26,720
No, for a second I thought you were

751
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:29,152
heading out to pay a visit
to the ZBZ house.

752
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,338
- So what if I was?
- Well, they just broke up.

753
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:33,508
It's not like that, OK?
It's this whole thing.

754
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:35,092
A few weeks ago, I told...

755
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:38,959
I told her that I still had feelings
for her, but she was with Max.

756
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:41,540
And we agreed we couldn't be friends
because I need to move on,

757
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,392
and I was moving on...

758
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:45,722
Yeah,
I'm tired just listening to it.

759
00:41:45,847 --> 00:41:48,705
Aren't you tired? Do you really want
to get back into that?

760
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,799
Look, you don't know
what you're talking about.

761
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,718
You obviously have no intention

762
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:56,566
of ever graduating
and leaving this place.

763
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:58,796
It's her senior year, man.

764
00:41:58,982 --> 00:42:02,135
Casey thinks about the future.
How's that gonna work out?

765
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,864
I have no ulterior motive here.

766
00:42:09,502 --> 00:42:10,838
We're friends, aren't we?

767
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:13,405
Amphora brethren? Kha'y?

768
00:42:13,928 --> 00:42:15,613
Kha'y, Bing!

769
00:42:16,794 --> 00:42:19,820
Look, all I'm saying is you know
how it felt to lose her once.

770
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:22,129
You really want to go
through that again?

771
00:42:24,717 --> 00:42:26,626
Come on, man.
Come on, let's grab a beer.

772
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,870
And sleep on it.

773
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:30,120
If you wake up
and feel the same tomorrow,

774
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:31,798
I can't stop you.

775
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,091
Hey, wait up.

776
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:57,765
You're a good kisser.

777
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,482
What are we doing?
