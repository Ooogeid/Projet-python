<i>Previously on</i> Greek

2
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,567
- So what do I do?
- You do what you need

3
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:05,347
to do to make it right in your mind.

4
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:06,900
How about some breakfast?

5
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:09,357
- Later, Cap.
- Purity pledge, activate.

6
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:10,907
Amen!

7
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,097
You have to choose.

8
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:13,839
Her or me?

9
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:17,233
- You don't want me to choose.
- What's the story with this Kappa Tau

10
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:18,723
who looks like Rob Thomas?

11
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:20,467
He was talking to Casey this morning.

12
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:23,922
Casey made the mistake
of dating Cappie freshman year.

13
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,881
$275?

14
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:29,010
- He said he was buying.
- You want me to bail you dorks out, huh?

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,805
Look around.
Some day this could all be yours.

16
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:33,515
How did you know about that video?

17
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:35,153
I sent it to you.

18
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,664
We can still move
our relationship forward.

19
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:51,167
It's after 3:00,

20
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:53,231
and no word.
That's not good.

21
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,864
Our house is at the end of Greek Row.

22
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:56,814
They have four other nominees
to give roses to.

23
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:58,597
I'm sure they'll show up any minute.

24
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,115
Any word?

25
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,548
I'm competing with every girl
in the greek system.

26
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:11,495
Case, maybe not being nominated
for Omega Chi Sweatheart

27
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,010
wouldn't be the end of the world.

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,997
Or maybe it would.

29
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:20,911
No sister has ever been elected
President of ZBZ

30
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,851
without taking Sweatheart
of Omega Chi first.

31
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:26,689
Well, there was Vanessa Davis in '95,

32
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:28,986
but she had scoliosis
and played the whole

33
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:31,247
I've-overcome-obstacles-thing
to gain sympathy votes.

34
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,541
So it's possible without.

35
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:36,016
But not with your posture.

36
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:39,912
So Casey's entire political future
at Zeta Beta Zeta depends on this moment?

37
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,586
Okay, I'm just gonna stop
with the helping.

38
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:49,177
Being nominated Omega Chi Sweatheart,
it's like running in the primaries.

39
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,233
- If you don't take new hampshire...
- It's 3:05.

40
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:58,107
Maybe we should think of some obscure
disease you could be suffering from.

41
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:00,889
Let's plan a <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> marathon
just in case.

42
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,371
God, this is so exciting.
It's almost like it's happening to me again.

43
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:18,039
Casey Cartwright,

44
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,269
it is my pleasure
to announce your official nomination

45
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,174
to the court of Sweatheart of Omega Chi.

46
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,772
I accept!

47
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:48,792
Sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my dorm key,

48
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,846
and then I realized it was
in my room, locked.

49
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:53,821
- My roommate was absolutely no help.
- Come on in.

50
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,404
- I missed you.
- Was the longest 3:30 hours of my life.

51
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,317
So...

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Do you think you want...

53
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:10,707
You know, you might...

54
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,691
That's why I said "Yeah" just now.

55
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:14,551
- I wasn't sure.
- It's okay.

56
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,318
I didn't want it to be awkward.

57
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,149
Wait, where's Dale?

58
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:26,667
It's Wednesday,
so he'll be at the biology building

59
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:30,032
for another 20 minutes, and then he'll
get his cherry limeade and cheesaritos,

60
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:34,158
which'll take another 8 to 11 minutes
depending on pedestrian traffic.

61
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,324
- You know, this'll be our third time.
- Fourth.

62
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,619
Maybe.

63
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,790
Yeah, I don't know.
I wasn't keeping track or anything.

64
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:51,075
Ignore it.
It must be broken or something.

65
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,432
Did you say Wednesday?

66
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:54,636
It's Thursday.

67
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,478
He'll freak if he catches us.

68
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,084
What a waste.

69
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:05,610
Thermodynamics
and heat transfer analysis?

70
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:08,007
My little sister could teach that class.

71
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:11,097
I'm gonna check <i>My Second Life</i> stock.
You wanna see my new avatar?

72
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:17,239
What are you guys doing?

73
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:19,219
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

78
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:33,716
Winning the title of

79
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:37,256
Omega Chi Sweatheart is completely
dependent on your personal interaction

80
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:40,924
with each and every Omega Chi,
as well as catering to their basic needs.

81
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:42,761
Hello!

82
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,304
We're ZBZs, not Tri Pis.

83
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,936
Not those needs.

84
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,259
- Right?
- Of course not.

85
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,196
This isn't the Clinton administration.

86
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:52,847
Think more Laura Bush.

87
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:56,557
Trust me, the Omega Chis
aren't looking for a girl

88
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:58,684
who swigs beer
and shows off her whale tail.

89
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,859
This girl represents
the fraternity publicly, so...

90
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,220
they're wanting less Ginger
and more Mary Ann.

91
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:08,263
This is the girl they want
to bring home to mother Bush.

92
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:11,856
Now, I like to take
the two-pronged approach:

93
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,429
win their stomachs,
and then win their hearts.

94
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:18,026
So let's start talking baked goods.

95
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:20,646
I was thinking maybe
something in a scone.

96
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,112
Casey's not much of a baker.

97
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,957
But I can drive to the store,

98
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:28,751
buy some muffins, wrap 'em up
to make 'em look homemade, right?

99
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,084
Genius.

100
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,712
I've been inspired by the master.

101
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:38,025
I only wish I had a me
for inspiration last year.

102
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,150
My God.
I was so nervous.

103
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,788
Despite completely dominating the competition.

104
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,182
It seems like so long ago.

105
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,324
I can barely even remember Blake

106
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:49,057
coming over to the ZBZ house,

107
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:52,390
presenting me with my white rose.

108
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:00,336
Muffins?

109
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,003
Right.
Okay.

110
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,823
Next topic: "Current events".

111
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:12,156
"Ten things you should know
about fantasy football."

112
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:19,603
How about tomorrow night?

113
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,057
Yep, that should be good.

114
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:24,354
- Could we use your room?
- I don't think so.

115
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:27,489
My roommate Stephanie could barely
make it past the dresser this morning.

116
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:29,130
She needs to go to student health.

117
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:31,233
That's the problem, she's agoraphobic.

118
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,829
She can't really "go" anywhere.

119
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:36,502
She spends all day on the internet
talking into her little web cam.

120
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,245
It's like living with <i>lonelygirl15</i>.

121
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,008
What about your room?
Tonight?

122
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,073
Hold on.
Let me check Dale's schedule.

123
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,557
Is this weird?

124
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,500
Trying to have sex
around Dale's schedule?

125
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,876
It's getting weird, right?

126
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:54,232
I mean, I know he has some issues,

127
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:55,995
- but...
- "Some" issues?

128
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:58,208
He cancelled our cable
after accidentally

129
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,535
watching three minutes
of a <i>Dawson's Creek</i> rerun.

130
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:03,938
Then can't we just tell him we'd like
to have the room for one evening?

131
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:06,673
You have as much of a right
to personal time as he does, huh?

132
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:07,762
Yeah, you're right.

133
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:11,497
It's not like being baptist qualifies
as a debilitating medical condition.

134
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,180
- I'll talk to him.
- Good.

135
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:17,174
'Cause I'd kinda like
to get into the double digits.

136
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:19,968
What?

137
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:43,986
Wait up!

138
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:49,269
It's a beautiful day, wouldn't you...

139
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,181
You look different.

140
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:53,163
Haircut?

141
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,918
Maybe I look different
because I had sex?

142
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:59,467
No, that's not it.
Are you wearing a bronzer?

143
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:00,844
I lost my virginity.

144
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:05,118
<i>Mazel tov</i>, young man.

145
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:07,867
- How's it going in the afterglow?
- Great.

146
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,173
It'd be better
if I didn't have a roommate

147
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:12,747
who's a born-again christian
with a light class schedule.

148
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:13,929
Logistical problems.

149
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,880
Well, I'd be happy to let you use
my deluxe accommodations.

150
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,510
Really?
You don't mind?

151
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:19,619
Absolutely not.

152
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:23,018
Only 20 bucks an hour.
For reservations, contact Wade.

153
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:25,080
We are booked for the next two weeks.
However...

154
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,463
after finals I am expecting a lull.

155
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:28,994
Two weeks?

156
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,731
I need the cash flo, bro.
I've got some debts to pay off.

157
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,369
Hold, please.

158
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,106
You can't get me in any sooner?

159
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:38,867
Do you have AAA?

160
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:40,314
Would that matter?

161
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:45,485
Never mind,
I'll just have to talk to Dale.

162
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:48,151
He's probably just finishing
his fruit roll-up.

163
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:57,285
Side effects may include nausea,
blindness,

164
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:00,168
decapitation, rectal oozing.

165
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,151
This is not a pharmaceutical study.

166
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:04,233
I know, I was just hiding
behind witticism

167
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,901
to mask the resentment
of an unfulfilled childhood.

168
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:09,900
The intent of this experiment
is to examine

169
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,967
theories of behavioral psychology.

170
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,450
Tomorrow's experiment will begin
with the stroop task.

171
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,200
I think I had the stroop once.

172
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,798
And we will be adding environmental
stressors over time.

173
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,617
We're exploring the gestalt
perceptual laws of organization.

174
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,488
The test requires you
to stay awake for 30 hours.

175
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:26,931
30 hours?

176
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:29,422
One of our psych lower-division
undergrads will be with you

177
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:33,122
for the duration of the test
to supervise and record your responses.

178
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,605
I love being supervised and recorded.

179
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:37,854
We'll start tomorrow afternoon.

180
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:41,431
Be sure to bring plenty of food
and liquids with you. No alcohol.

181
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:47,824
Most students can't resist a joke.

182
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:49,617
Clearly I'm not most students.

183
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:51,741
Clearly.

184
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:55,352
The student who will administer the test
is participating for a grade,

185
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,994
but understand this is
a professional study.

186
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:03,701
You'll be expected to answer every
question the administrator gives you.

187
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:07,666
You'll be given access to a bathroom,
but that is it for 30 hours.

188
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,333
Ms. Logan, please come meet
your test subject.

189
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:16,824
This is case study 8675309.

190
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,054
Rob Thomas guy?

191
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,493
- Actually, your subject's name is...
- Unimportant.

192
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:22,778
Remember, Logan,

193
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,980
we don't see things as they are.

194
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:27,727
We see things as we are.

195
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:32,468
I used to be a psych major.

196
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,245
I finished your milk.
But I can get some more.

197
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,740
No problem.

198
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:42,931
Off to calculus?

199
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,492
- Parlin hall, from 2:00 to 4:00?
- You know me well.

200
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:49,420
I wanted to talk to you.

201
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:52,325
- I gotta talk to you too.
- Well, if I could go first...

202
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:54,592
Doreen Dresselhaus McCaw
is coming to CRU!

203
00:10:57,508 --> 00:11:00,091
Dale, she's a nuclear physicist,
not a rock star.

204
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:03,948
Excuse me, her work in proton emulsion
has literally rocked the world.

205
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:06,575
- She's giving an open lecture tomorrow.
- I thought we could go.

206
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:07,642
Tomorrow?

207
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,746
- Sure. That sounds fine.
- Great.

208
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:10,993
And then...

209
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:12,676
Maybe...

210
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,071
Perhaps...

211
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:17,677
I could possibly have the room...

212
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,160
Alone...

213
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:21,928
With Jen.

214
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:25,428
I see.

215
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:29,433
Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.

216
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:30,931
Really?

217
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:35,020
Yeah, you know.
Love the sinner, hate the sin, right?

218
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,679
Is that a yes?

219
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,299
Just give me some notice.
I'll disappear.

220
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:46,907
This really means a lot to me.

221
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:48,111
Thank you.

222
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:51,704
All right, tomorrow it is. Just you,
me, and Doreen Dresselhaus McCaw.

223
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:58,252
And it never occurred to you

224
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,734
that in order to be pre-med,

225
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:03,178
you might need to take
some actual science classes?

226
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
I did.

227
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:07,721
I took biology and chemistry...

228
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:10,917
- Didn't I?
- You didn't take chemistry.

229
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:12,827
- Nor physics... Nor...
- I figured

230
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,669
those would start when I finished
the pre part and got to the med.

231
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,884
- Sorry.
- But what about my dream

232
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:21,176
of becoming a gorgeous
but troubled intern in a hospital

233
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:22,554
full of other gorgeous interns

234
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:26,004
discussing my love life while performing
complex surgeries and hating my mother?

235
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,894
Try the drama department.

236
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:35,773
Are there any exceptions?

237
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:42,363
By the way... I'm not just saying this,
but I love your glasses.

238
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,243
If you plan to graduate with any degree

239
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:49,611
from this institution,

240
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:52,921
you're going to need to complete
a fifth year here at Cyprus-Rhodes.

241
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:59,416
I mean, with the way HMOs
are cutting into profit margins,

242
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,883
it just doesn't make sense for me
to go into medicine anyway.

243
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:03,333
So I'm thinking...

244
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:05,160
pre-law, perhaps.

245
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,635
Regardless, I'm staying for a fifth year
here at CRU!

246
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,053
- Isn't that great, Case?
- Yeah!

247
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:20,353
Let's get drinks to celebrate.

248
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:27,134
Are you really okay with this?

249
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:31,771
My parents are gonna freak out

250
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:33,755
when they find out they've to pay
for a 5th year.

251
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,995
And of course that means
I'm never gonna get to be...

252
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,776
An <i>Izzie</i>.
Or a <i>Meredith</i>.

253
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:40,397
I know.
I'm so sorry.

254
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,227
You know me so well.

255
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:53,562
I really need to think of something
to keep my mind off things.

256
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:56,659
How about a spa weekend?

257
00:13:57,368 --> 00:14:00,062
- I don't think so.
- How about we charter Rebecca's jet...

258
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:02,510
It's all so empty.

259
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:07,318
Is there something you had in mind?

260
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:10,295
I knew you'd understand.

261
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:13,965
I was thinking about running
for Omega Chi Sweatheart again.

262
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,235
- Is that possible?
- Totally.

263
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,124
I've already checked into it, and as
the formerly-crowned Omega Chi Sweatheart

264
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:26,785
- I have the right to run again.
- So we'd be...

265
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,242
running against each other.

266
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:30,294
Wouldn't that be bad?

267
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,379
It'd split the ZBZ vote.

268
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:34,122
And if that happens,

269
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:35,482
you know who loses.

270
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:36,915
Zeta Beta Zeta?

271
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,444
Exactly.

272
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:40,579
So what you're saying is

273
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:43,161
I need to drop out
of the Sweatheart race

274
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:44,781
for the good of the house?

275
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,984
If that's what you feel
like you should do,

276
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:48,944
I totally support you in that.

277
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,151
But Frannie,

278
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:52,163
what about the primaries?

279
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,289
And all that stuff you said
about New Hampshire

280
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,907
and the ZBZ presidency?

281
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:57,985
All that was just a theory.

282
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,366
You could still be

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,533
President without being
Omega Chi Sweatheart.

284
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:05,552
You just have to work a little harder.

285
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:06,885
That's all.

286
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:10,996
You know what?

287
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,435
I'm feeling better already.

288
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,779
So what's the process of removing myself
from the running?

289
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:35,805
Wait a minute.

290
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:41,947
Are you sure you wanna do this?

291
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,007
Frannie's my big sis.

292
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:45,541
She's done so much for me.

293
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:47,204
The advice, the encouragement.

294
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,696
And I admire your loyalty.

295
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,091
I do.

296
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,574
But you really wanted this.

297
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:58,344
Is it your fault that she's
not graduating on time?

298
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:00,531
It's complicated.

299
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:03,887
She's, like, my mentor

300
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,048
and my friend.

301
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:08,505
Well, then you know what? This should
just be some friendly competion.

302
00:16:08,745 --> 00:16:10,345
She's had her time.

303
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,044
She needs to exit the stage...

304
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,404
gracefully, and...

305
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:18,051
Well, I shouldn't be telling you this.

306
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,283
She might not be the most popular ZBZ
at the Omega Chi house.

307
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:25,678
You think I could beat Frannie?

308
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:27,432
I don't know if you've noticed,

309
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:29,549
but I have been running
quite the campaign.

310
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,992
That's the most adorable thing
I've ever seen.

311
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:41,625
Listen, Frannie's already had her reign.

312
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:42,849
All right?

313
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,142
It's your turn now.

314
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,357
My weekend with the senator's daughter.

315
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:01,482
Sounds kinky.

316
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:05,809
We'll start with the stroop task.

317
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:08,186
The objective of this test is
to measure your reaction time

318
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:10,099
as it relates
to your brain's unconscious.

319
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:11,282
So is this your major?

320
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,406
I don't get credit for small talk.

321
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,098
- Let's start the test, shall we?
- What is your hurry?

322
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,213
We have all weekend.

323
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,119
Besides, I like to get to know
my supervisor before I stroop her.

324
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:25,548
It really is an amazing word
that can be used in many different ways.

325
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:28,883
Maybe it's time you start cooperating,

326
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,046
- or...
- Or?

327
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,929
I'll tell everyone on campus
your real name.

328
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:41,728
Name the color this word is written in.

329
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,215
Red.

330
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,144
Correct.

331
00:17:58,948 --> 00:17:59,981
I saved you...

332
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:01,892
A seat.

333
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,446
I didn't know you had an interest
in nuclear fission, Jennifer.

334
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,255
I figured if it was important to Rusty,

335
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,074
that I should learn a little bit
about it.

336
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:18,426
- I see.
- Do you mind if Jen and I sit together?

337
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:20,522
No, sure.

338
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:22,288
That's a better seat up there anyway.

339
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:42,667
<i>Ready, set!</i>

340
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:54,751
Hike!

341
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:57,775
Nice play, Cartwright.

342
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:05,417
The guys are loving the smoothies.
Big hit.

343
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:08,550
So sweet of you to come out
and support my campaign, Case.

344
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,966
Actually, I'm not here
in support of your candidacy.

345
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,716
Then why are you here?

346
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,916
I hope you understand.

347
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:19,006
But I've decided that I'm...

348
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,675
not...

349
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,350
going to drop out of the race.

350
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,808
Wait.
You're not dropping out?

351
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,935
Not that I think I'll win or anything.

352
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,419
Of course not.

353
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,400
So why run?

354
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:34,925
You know,

355
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:36,352
this is my junior year,

356
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:39,352
and it's my only chance,
since I'm going to graduate on time.

357
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,831
Not that I'm super-proud
of that or anything.

358
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:45,454
I mean, a lot of people do fifth years.

359
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:48,230
It's common.
And if I should happen to win,

360
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,053
that'd be better than losing
to some Tri Pi, right?

361
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:53,253
Yes, it would...

362
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,193
If I was planning on losing.

363
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,997
Good luck, sweetie.

364
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:11,474
Have you seen my milk?
I just bought a half gallon yesterday.

365
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,486
No, sure haven't.

366
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,260
Why is my milk in the trash?

367
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:22,718
That milk.

368
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,077
I thought that expired.

369
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,167
After one day?
It's not even open.

370
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,255
Maybe you shouldn't buy
such a big carton,

371
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,451
so it doesn't take up so much room
in the fridge.

372
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:32,504
We agreed to share the fridge though.

373
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,614
No, we did, but that means halvesies,
not three-quartersies.

374
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:38,515
See, your milk crossed the border.

375
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:47,977
So Jen and I were thinking
about using the room tomorrow night.

376
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:51,261
You know what?
That's not gonna work for me.

377
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:54,263
What about sunday night?

378
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:57,269
Now, that is really not
gonna work for me.

379
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,221
But you said you were okay
with it before.

380
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:02,889
You know I'm a complex individual.

381
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:04,021
I change my mind.

382
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:21,651
So what do you think?
Which shoes?

383
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,758
Well, you know, they always say
you can never go wrong with a peep toe.

384
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:30,354
- Who's they?
- Don't know.

385
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:32,081
I was just tryin' to help.
Again.

386
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,408
What would Frannie say?

387
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:39,673
She seriously hasn't spoken one word
to you since the game?

388
00:21:39,718 --> 00:21:42,935
I've seen her six times,
and she just smiles and walks away.

389
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:45,949
This morning at breakfast,
she winked at me.

390
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:47,974
Well, that's scary.

391
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,617
- Have you...
- What?

392
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:56,081
Do you think that she's
gonna wanna run for president?

393
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,401
I can't read her.
I'm not sure if she's

394
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:01,171
being passive-aggressive
or just totally cool about all of this.

395
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:02,677
I have no idea where her head is.

396
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,518
- There you are.
- Hi.

397
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,448
Getting ready for the big night?

398
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,763
I was just trying to decide
what shoes to wear.

399
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,930
Definitely the peep toes.

400
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:15,345
Demure but inviting.

401
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:16,983
So how's the speech coming?

402
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:18,538
All done.

403
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:20,648
I expect nothing less.

404
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:23,712
May the best woman win.

405
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:31,531
And don't be late.

406
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,326
If you miss the speeches,
you're automatically disqualified.

407
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:35,733
Bye.

408
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,878
I can't believe you worked everything
out with Dale.

409
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:47,894
Yeah, it's great.

410
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,481
Why is your stuff all piled
up over here on the floor?

411
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:53,279
I think Dale's cleaning or something.

412
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,812
The Dale tracker again?

413
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:58,871
I thought you said
you talked through all this.

414
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:01,967
- Something's wrong with my computer.
- Did you reboot it?

415
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:04,196
That's weird,
it says the signal is coming from where?

416
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:07,740
Inside the room.

417
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:13,896
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure this out?

418
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,703
Gps with a five-mile radius?

419
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:16,876
Please.

420
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:21,618
Got milk, Rusty?

421
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,503
Jen, you should go.

422
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
Okay.

423
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:36,602
Bye, Dale.

424
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:42,521
Rusty, call me.

425
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:47,745
Tell me what you see.

426
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,050
I see me taking a nap.

427
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:53,559
You can sleep when you're finished.

428
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:54,803
Answer the question.

429
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:00,887
- Two triangles and three circles.
- Wrong!

430
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,745
There are no actual triangles
or circles in the image.

431
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,490
Isn't there a rule that the supervisor

432
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:08,152
has to avoid showing her personal
feelings about the subject?

433
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:09,175
Maybe.

434
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:10,771
This is my first class.

435
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:12,444
Well, there should be.

436
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:15,145
This is like being at a slumber party
with Jack Bauer.

437
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:17,978
I know how hard you work
to pretend nothing ever bothers you.

438
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:20,970
Stop. I'll tell you where the nukes are.

439
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
Next topic,

440
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:24,788
aural stimuli.

441
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,152
You
wish.

442
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,530
I'm gonna play a sound,
and you identify what it is.

443
00:24:35,877 --> 00:24:37,394
First thing that pops in your mind.

444
00:24:42,592 --> 00:24:44,255
Evan chambers losing his allowance.

445
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,800
Come on, that deserves a check.

446
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,598
But it's so much more fun to be wrong,
isn't it?

447
00:24:51,613 --> 00:24:52,888
I don't know. Is it?

448
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,167
Little miss perfect
has her Cinderella ball tonight.

449
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:09,452
Doesn't bother you that Casey picked
another prince charming?

450
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:11,544
I don't get paid for small talk.

451
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,059
Should we get back to the test?

452
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:25,222
I don't know anything about this.
Where's Frannie?

453
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:28,006
She's not here, but he said your name's
on the work order too.

454
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:29,672
This is Casey Cartwright.

455
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:30,905
I'm John the plumber.

456
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,762
A Frannie Morgan called earlier.
Said you needed some pipes replaced.

457
00:25:33,883 --> 00:25:35,816
But tonight?
They've been leaking for months.

458
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:37,696
She insisted. Said it was an emergency.

459
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,232
It had to be taken care of today.

460
00:25:39,342 --> 00:25:41,488
So I'm gonna need to shut this water
off for a while.

461
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:43,404
Okay, well, give us a few minutes

462
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,511
to finish getting ready,
and then it's all yours.

463
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:47,832
I'm gonna need you
or miss morgan here until I finish.

464
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,090
Your names are on the work order.
You gotta sign off.

465
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,327
It's company policy.
I told her that on the phone.

466
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,351
Well, how long did you tell
her this was going to take?

467
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,578
That depends on the condition
of the pipes.

468
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:59,012
We could be here all night.

469
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:10,190
The greek system at CRU is
certainly not what it used to be.

470
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,156
You've seen the Kappa tau house, right?

471
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:13,574
Disgusting.

472
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,007
And those girls at mu Gamma pig...

473
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,167
What did I just say? I meant sig.

474
00:26:25,394 --> 00:26:26,394
Casey.

475
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:28,870
The speeches are about to start.

476
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,778
I was afraid you weren't going
to make it.

477
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:31,926
Here I am.

478
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:33,710
The plumbing's all taken care of.

479
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:36,533
Great, I'm glad it wasn't as extensive
as I thought.

480
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:37,835
No,

481
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:40,116
it was exactly as extensive
as you thought.

482
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:43,398
It would have taken all night,
but it turns out jen k's dad's a plumber

483
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:46,418
and she was able to help. John
the plumber actually offered her a job.

484
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:48,504
I hope you encouraged her to take it.

485
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:51,324
Hey, Frannie.

486
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:52,843
O'toole!

487
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:54,780
Great game the other today.

488
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:57,452
Travis says I don't know how to follow.

489
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:58,799
I'm a total follower.

490
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:02,942
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but, uh, travis might be right.

491
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:07,596
Well, thanks for being
my handsome escort for tonight.

492
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:10,984
I am Lucky
to have such a beautiful lady on my arm.

493
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:13,356
And my feet.

494
00:27:14,152 --> 00:27:15,166
I'm sorry.

495
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,346
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

496
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:18,938
So

497
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:21,105
give me the dirt.
How's the Sweatheart race looking?

498
00:27:21,503 --> 00:27:22,686
My money's on Casey.

499
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:25,613
This is it!

500
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:27,225
Come on in.

501
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:30,480
I heard about the honors
engineering floor,

502
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,944
- but I thought it was a joke.
- It's real.

503
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:34,799
Want something to drink?

504
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:36,114
Yeah. Sure.

505
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:42,340
Cool flag. You english?

506
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:49,871
Hey, Beaver,

507
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,104
why don't you tell Dale
how you got your name?

508
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:54,739
Hey, Dale.

509
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,068
Dale.

510
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,512
All right,

511
00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:03,574
last test.

512
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:07,750
Emotions can have an important
effect on perception.

513
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:09,490
Emotions play a larger role

514
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:11,864
in perception under stress
or extreme circumstances.

515
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:14,247
So

516
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:15,700
what do you see?

517
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:18,365
A dog.

518
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:20,763
Correct answer is cloud.

519
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:23,546
Who looks at a cloud
and just sees a cloud?

520
00:28:25,446 --> 00:28:26,446
Me.

521
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:27,728
Look.

522
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,216
The dog's head's over there.

523
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,568
The legs are in the back.

524
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's a boy.

525
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:34,183
I don't see it.

526
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,175
Maybe you're projecting.

527
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,282
I always wanted a dog.

528
00:28:40,942 --> 00:28:42,214
We moved around too much.

529
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:45,839
And chances are my parents would have
accidentally killed it anyway.

530
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:48,462
I'm so tired, I feel drunk.

531
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:52,419
I am seriously on the verge
of singing the Kenny Rogers

532
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:54,797
songbook or making
some embarrassing true confessions.

533
00:28:56,582 --> 00:28:59,443
So why would your parents
have accidentally killed the dog?

534
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:02,054
Let's just say there wasn't an
abundance of stability.

535
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:06,041
My parents are hippies
with all kinds of great ideals,

536
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:07,703
but they're not the most

537
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:09,482
responsible people.

538
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:12,314
Got it.

539
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:16,262
You know what your problem is?

540
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:17,403
What?

541
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:18,525
Perspective.

542
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:22,689
Come sit over here. Look at it this way.

543
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:26,179
Come on.

544
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:40,107
It kind of looks like a bong.

545
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:44,845
Oddly enough, I don't see that.

546
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:52,271
I used to see everything in terms
of whether it would piss off my parents.

547
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:54,053
Bongs did that.

548
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:55,924
You like to walk on the wild side?

549
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,770
Not anymore.

550
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:01,156
The whole

551
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,638
out-of-control rich girl thing got to be
a little too Lindsay Lohan-ish.

552
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:06,479
You know,

553
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:10,504
you're not nearly as unpleasant
as I thought you'd be, Logan.

554
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,125
I know.

555
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,666
You smell better than
I thought you would.

556
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:27,179
What kind of hippies would name you...

557
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,883
Hippies with a finely-honed sense
of irony.

558
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,300
Time's up.

559
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:44,220
This concludes our experiment.

560
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:45,404
Thanks to both of you.

561
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:49,002
Here is your compensation
for participating.

562
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,661
Rebecca...

563
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,500
I'll see you in class on tuesday.

564
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,884
Those are the real weapons of mass
destruction. Am I right?

565
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,445
You guys are awesome.

566
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:09,432
Just remember,

567
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:11,016
a vote for me

568
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,552
is a vote against the terrorists.

569
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:16,813
God bless America!

570
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:42,351
Frannie,

571
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:44,040
can we please stop this?

572
00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:46,148
I know you're angry with me,

573
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:47,679
so why don't we stop pretending?

574
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:50,514
Pretending?

575
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:52,555
I don't know what you're talking about.

576
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,979
Just because your plans changed,

577
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,229
doesn't mean I should have to give up
on everything I've worked so hard for.

578
00:31:59,244 --> 00:32:00,259
Casey.

579
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:02,104
Can you please put your own political

580
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,444
ambitions aside and think of someone
other than yourself.

581
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:05,689
You started all this.

582
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:07,573
And you knew how important
this was to me.

583
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:09,401
But you wouldn't drop out.

584
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,481
I should have known you'd stop
at nothing to get ahead.

585
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:15,415
After all,

586
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:17,258
you took evan back

587
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:19,031
even though he cheated on you.

588
00:32:58,248 --> 00:32:59,265
I didn't back up!

589
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:01,165
Dale,

590
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:03,315
what happened?

591
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:06,582
Maybe some prankster hacked into
the university power grid and

592
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:07,674
shut you down.

593
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:10,097
And drained my battery
so it wouldn't work, either?

594
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:12,994
I'm going to have sex, Dale.

595
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:14,009
Deal with it.

596
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,405
- This isn't about sex, Rusty.
- Then what?

597
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:19,899
When school started, I thought you were
this cool, smart engineering guy

598
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,806
understood the importance of things
like comic-con and nuclear physics.

599
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:25,054
You're still talking about that
stupid lecture?

600
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,929
That stupid lecture was important to me,

601
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,359
okay?
And I thought it was important to you.

602
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,340
I thought that our friendship
was more important.

603
00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:32,664
We're not friends, Dale.

604
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:34,019
We're roommates.

605
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:40,242
Well,
maybe you should find a new roommate.

606
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:41,288
Maybe I will.

607
00:33:57,016 --> 00:33:58,883
When I came to Cyprus-Rhodes,

608
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:01,223
I knew nothing about the greek system.

609
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:04,064
At first glance it seemed like a great
way to have fun.

610
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:07,713
What I quickly discovered

611
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:09,800
was an incredible group of people

612
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,988
who I will have a special
bond with forever.

613
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:13,893
I wondered

614
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:16,076
where that
unconditional bond comes from.

615
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:17,656
What I've Learned,

616
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:20,422
thanks to some very special
people in my life,

617
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:22,485
is that,

618
00:34:22,513 --> 00:34:24,284
well, for me anyway,

619
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:26,598
being greek is about tradition.

620
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:28,839
And passing that tradition on

621
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:29,995
to others.

622
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,426
That proud passing of the torch

623
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,036
keeps the integrity of our greek
system alive.

624
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,557
It's our foundation.

625
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,099
I found someone

626
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:40,303
who was

627
00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:42,766
selflessly willing to pass
her legacy on to me.

628
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:44,521
Someone

629
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:47,103
I see not only as a mentor,

630
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:49,151
but as a friend.

631
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:55,146
But

632
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:57,241
no matter what happens,

633
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,483
till the day I die,

634
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,511
I will always be sweet

635
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:03,290
on the boys of Omega Chi.

636
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:15,802
All right, you guys,
it's time to cast the votes.

637
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:17,673
Okay.

638
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:34,738
The votes are in.

639
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:40,404
And the title
of Omega Chi Sweatheart of 2007

640
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:42,234
goes to...

641
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,549
- Casey Cartwright.
- Oh, my gosh.

642
00:35:53,104 --> 00:35:54,821
At least that bitch didn't win again.

643
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,518
Too bad you have to live with her.

644
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,078
The best girl won.

645
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:26,819
Can you believe that tri pi and her
"wardrobe malfunction?"

646
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:28,787
Jen!

647
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,056
Rusty!

648
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:32,019
You should have seen Casey.

649
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:34,595
Casey, great.
Dale's out of control.

650
00:36:35,003 --> 00:36:36,057
He hacked my power.

651
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,303
I lost my paper.

652
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:38,786
There's milk everywhere.

653
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:40,016
And...

654
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,207
I'll catch up with you guys later.

655
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:44,979
Are you okay?

656
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:46,936
You seem a little worked up.

657
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:50,038
You come back to my room
and have sex with me front of Dale?

658
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,369
That's my only logical recourse.

659
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:53,981
Rusty, let it go.

660
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,970
If he doesn't want us in his room,
then that's fine.

661
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,345
We'll figure something out.

662
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:00,749
Maybe I can put in a transfer
to another room or something.

663
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:01,991
No, I'll do it.

664
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,210
And leave Dale?

665
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:04,804
You're willing to leave stephanie.

666
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:06,912
Because she's an
agoraphobe who scares me.

667
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,429
But Dale's a germaphobe who's
constantly butting into my business.

668
00:37:10,444 --> 00:37:14,028
And studying with you
nd going to lectures with you,

669
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:15,802
- and watchingplanet earth...
- Yes.

670
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,786
Didn't he teach you how to play hockey
and show up your intramural game?

671
00:37:18,814 --> 00:37:19,814
Yes.

672
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,636
- But he...
- What about the volcano?

673
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:23,303
He committed a crime for you.

674
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:25,987
There's no way we could
have pulled that off without him.

675
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:28,845
I mean, without Dale,
who knows if we'd even be together.

676
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,057
But he's a conservative,
right-wing southern Baptist

677
00:37:33,072 --> 00:37:35,065
with a confederate flag on the wall.

678
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:36,725
And you're a frat guy

679
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,047
who is asking him to push
his religious beliefs aside

680
00:37:39,062 --> 00:37:40,862
you can have sex with your girlfriend.

681
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:43,448
Yeah, you guys definitely
have your differences,

682
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:45,433
but when you add it all up,

683
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:47,590
you and Dale are friends.

684
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:56,261
I'm exhausted.

685
00:37:57,573 --> 00:37:58,723
At least you got paid.

686
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:01,848
But the knowledge you
received was far more valuable.

687
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:03,701
Right.

688
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:06,424
You realize it was totally pointless.

689
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:08,373
The slides, the tests, all of it.

690
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:10,769
I'm not sure all of it was.

691
00:38:11,638 --> 00:38:14,648
What happened in that room
means nothing in the real world.

692
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:16,462
There is no real world.

693
00:38:16,857 --> 00:38:18,374
Just two strangers

694
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:20,615
picked to sit in a room
and get their lives taped.

695
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:23,990
See ya around.

696
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:55,871
I'm awake now.

697
00:38:58,442 --> 00:38:59,442
Sorry.

698
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:13,708
- Look, Dale...
- I asked around and

699
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:17,091
a couple other guys on this floor
dropped out, so if you

700
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:19,504
- still wanna change rooms...
- I don't wanna change rooms.

701
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:22,777
Unless you still want me to.

702
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:25,394
Maybe.

703
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,236
You know, you're right about Jen.

704
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,710
No appreciation for doreen.

705
00:39:36,763 --> 00:39:38,229
Yeah, well, few do.

706
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:42,360
Sometimes showing appreciation
is a hard thing to do.

707
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,403
You mean like showing appreciation
for me?

708
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:48,284
Yes, I mean you.

709
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:51,447
So you mean you appreciate me.

710
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:53,685
Exactly.

711
00:39:55,608 --> 00:39:57,275
You appreciate me like a good roommate?

712
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,535
I appreciate you like a good friend.

713
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:11,022
So, I...

714
00:40:11,232 --> 00:40:13,579
bought some cookie dough
for all that milk.

715
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,679
You want some?

716
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:16,927
Nah, no thanks.

717
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:18,577
Cookie dough salmonella can kill you.

718
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:22,551
Good night, Rusty.

719
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:25,324
Good night, Dale.

720
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:46,743
Great speech tonight.

721
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:50,559
Really tugged on those heartstrings.

722
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:54,388
I tried to find you
after the announcement

723
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:55,922
but I guess you'd already left.

724
00:40:56,885 --> 00:40:58,452
I know when to make my exit.

725
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:06,245
Frannie.

726
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:08,629
I meant what I said.

727
00:41:09,404 --> 00:41:10,421
We're friends,

728
00:41:10,975 --> 00:41:12,321
first and foremost.

729
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:20,909
What's on your mind?

730
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,165
Al Gore.

731
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:29,611
I'm more of a
Jake Gyllenhall girl myself.

732
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:32,697
No, I was actually thinking
about how crazy it is that

733
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:35,834
someone can win the popular vote,

734
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,529
and still not be elected President.

735
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:44,224
Yeah. That's pretty crazy.

736
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,217
Enjoy your win, poodle.

737
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,330
Doesn't last forever.

738
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,452
Don't stay up too late.

739
00:41:58,463 --> 00:41:59,664
Guess I missed the fun.

740
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:04,016
This is for you.

741
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:11,446
It's from Cappie.

742
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:25,660
"Payback's a bitch, and so am I.

743
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,903
"Sorry you had to bail me out.

744
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:32,311
Cap."
