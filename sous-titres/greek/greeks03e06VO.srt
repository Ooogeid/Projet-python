1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:04,002
- I'm looking for a new job.
- "Part-time cater-waiters."

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,458
Lana. What's it take for
a guy to get your number?

3
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,548
The staff phone sheet.
Too bad you quit.

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,412
Do you think you
could trust him again?

5
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:11,866
I think I want to try.

6
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,970
I used to have so much fun with you.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,707
Whenever I'm around you, it just

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,573
reminds me of all the bad crap
I did to you

9
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:20,393
I'm not used to
giving second chances.

10
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,786
And you won't regret it.

11
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:24,605
She's back with fisher
and i'm still in the doghouse?

12
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:26,281
Jordan seems a little down.

13
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:28,665
I don't think she's
very excited about school.

14
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:40,562
Can you help me carry some stuff in?

15
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:41,790
Of course.

16
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:44,334
Let me get that.

17
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:48,008
Awesome.

18
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:53,677
Got it.

19
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:55,762
Look like you need some help.

20
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,098
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,626
Flowers, muffins,

22
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,924
and a map of the us?
OK, let me guess.

23
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,205
You are...

24
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:06,972
...having a giant
geography tea party?

25
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,164
Worse. It's ZBZ founder's weekend.

26
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:11,880
You know, that special time
of year where former cru ZBZS

27
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:15,323
come from far and wide return to their
alma mater to wax nostalgic about

28
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:16,806
our shared history

29
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:19,633
and sing multiple bonding songs.

30
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,951
And get hit up for cash
on their way out the door.

31
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:23,671
The joys of sisterhood.

32
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,037
Laura? Could you,
help me with some more stuff?

33
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,983
You guys really went
all out this year.

34
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,351
Well, we seem to have
been slipping in the

35
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,996
campus rankings a little.

36
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:36,428
What? That's crazy.
I hadn't heard anything about that.

37
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,009
- I hate that I know when you're lying.
- Sorry. So how bad is it?

38
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:44,102
Fourth... Ish.

39
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:47,663
So we're hoping to bring
in some extra cash to

40
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:50,996
help with some bigger
mixers and socials.

41
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,893
You know.
Money certainly doesn't hurt, right?

42
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:56,214
- Sounds familiar.
- Anyway,

43
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:57,921
Ashleigh and I are

44
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:01,035
committed to leaving ZBZ
the way we found it: back on top.

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,712
Well, if there's anything
the Omega Chis can do to help out...

46
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:04,870
Thanks.

47
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,392
I can't believe
you knew about fourth-ish.

48
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:11,462
It's getting harder and harder
keeping secrets on this campus, right?

49
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:12,719
I guess...

50
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,652
Watch where you're going,
Evan keller!

51
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:18,452
You watch where you're going,
Cappie... Keller.

52
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:24,112
Really gotta come up with
some snappier comebacks.

53
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:27,729
Or maybe you two'll just disengage from this
pissing contest and actually become friends again.

54
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,096
Yeah, like that'll ever happen.

55
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:35,072
So we're definitely on for operation:
secret double date tonight?

56
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,274
Jordan and I can't wait
to finally meet grant.

57
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:40,216
You know, I've never gone out with
any of your boyfriends before.

58
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:43,328
- That came out wrong.
- Does Dale want to join us?

59
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,122
He turned in all his work early
and went home for the weekend.

60
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,220
His parents flew him home after
he told them he was an atheist.

61
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:52,879
He said they totally accepted his newfound
belief that there's no point to existence.

62
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:53,874
Ambush?

63
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,285
Personally,
I think they're gonna crucify him.

64
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:59,492
Ladies and Gentlemen,
let's prepare to dive

65
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:03,554
headfirst into our innermost id

66
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,492
as we roam over the lascivious

67
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:09,244
paint strokes
of artists who conspire

68
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:13,368
to arouse our beings
in undeniable pleasure.

69
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:16,328
Thirty seconds into class
and I'm already creeped out.

70
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,448
- A new record.
- What's wrong?

71
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,281
- Jordan's not here.
- So

72
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,407
let's complete the journey through
the eroticism of modernism

73
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,447
with the final two presentations.

74
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,032
Reed and Rutherford.

75
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:31,303
Starting with Ms. Reed.

76
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:32,995
This is bad.

77
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:34,941
Jordan Reed?

78
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:40,844
Ms. Reed?

79
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,555
No, I'm Rusty.
Her boyfriend.

80
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:46,367
I think she's just
running a little late.

81
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,606
Art does not wait.

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,588
Neither do i.

83
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,795
If we can just wait five minutes...

84
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,073
In five minutes,

85
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:57,944
she will get the same grade
i'm giving her now.

86
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,894

VO By :
¤Aka¤, Flolo, JuJu

88
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,709
<i>Kappa Team</i>

89
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,050
Aren't we overdoing
it on kitty spirit?

90
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,736
Each cat represents a year
of ZBZ's history

91
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,884
as well as a great way
to change conversation

92
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,009
should any of our alumnae ask
about our recent downturn on campus.

93
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,376
You really think we shouldn't
tell them we're fourth-ish?

94
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,631
Cause we could really use
their help now more than ever.

95
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:39,625
And run the risk of them thinking
we're responsible? Not a chance.

96
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,914
This weekend is all about charm,

97
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:44,311
flattery and shameless butt-kissing.

98
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:47,021
Right. And I'm keeping
my sights on Doris Mcgovern,

99
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:49,936
class of 1966 and our wealthiest alumna.

100
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,782
I've spent the last week
researching her.

101
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,261
She could single-handedly
fund next year's entire rush.

102
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,170
In one year, ZBZ could be back on top.

103
00:04:58,218 --> 00:04:59,527
Isn't that right?

104
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:03,354
About the cats...
Well, I'm

105
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:06,894
worried one day you'll end up surrounded
by dozens of them in

106
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:09,883
a small apartment with newspapers
stacked against the door.

107
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,663
Sorry, it's just,
you have no real social life anymore.

108
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,834
Fisher's been trying to set you
up with some of his friends...

109
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:18,110
Between pan-hellenic, the pledges,
my classes and this house,

110
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,766
I have too much on my plate already.

111
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:22,423
Why can't you have more than one plate?
You could have two plates,

112
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:24,906
- maybe a chafing dish?
- No time to chafe.

113
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,953
This weekend I have one job, and that's
to keep my attention on Doris Mcgovern.

114
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,837
And her stupid hot grandson.

115
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,883
There you are.

116
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:49,324
Here I am.
Here, come check these out.

117
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:51,641
I took these photos this
morning on main street.

118
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:55,603
You should've seen the light, it was
all Dusty and diffused. It was perfect.

119
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,242
The light was pretty great in
art history this morning, too.

120
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,881
Gosh, I totally forgot.

121
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:06,065
Maybe I can talk to professor
summerfield about turning it in late.

122
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,347
It's OK, I took care of it.
After class, I told him

123
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,804
you were involved
in a pretty bad hair dryer accident.

124
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:14,869
You can return your report in on monday,
?????????????????????

125
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,768
Thank you.

126
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:22,457
You helped me get into the lab
to do my o-chem extra credit.

127
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,046
- It's the least I can do.
- OK, look at this one.

128
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,639
This one is my favorite.

129
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:34,709
As soon as I put xavier down for his
nap, then Brianna's up running around.

130
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,197
Then I put her down
and then he's up running around.

131
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:39,459
I mean, I get so exhausted.

132
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:42,946
Yeah, I'm exhausted just hearing
about it. Would you excuse me?

133
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:48,038
Excuse me.

134
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:53,281
Hello.

135
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:56,651
- You're talking to me now?
- Just for the weekend.

136
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:59,700
Remember, this is all about sisterhood.
And their money.

137
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,604
Thanks for the refresher
course on sisterhood, Ash.

138
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:05,339
Super helpful.
Not to mention hypocritical.

139
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,277
What's that supposed to mean?

140
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:09,427
How about we start with Fisher?

141
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:11,888
You've already forgiven him for
something he and I both did.

142
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,585
It's a total double-standard, yet you're
giving me lessons on being good sister.

143
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,259
Because you're the one that started

144
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:19,479
when you decided to play&tongue
twister with Fisher.

145
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,304
Which makes you the worst sister...
In the whole world.

146
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,051
- You want to put that to a test?
- What kind of a test?

147
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:27,129
A bet.

148
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:30,662
The house needs money, so the sister
who raises more money this weekend wins.

149
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:33,326
And if I do, you have to
give me a second chance, too.

150
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:38,498
Fine. And if I win, you have to be
sober sister for the rest of the year.

151
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:42,088
And spend every ZBZ event at the house,
waiting for drunk distress calls?

152
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:44,284
Super.

153
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,757
Look at the plus side, at least
we'll both know what you're doing.

154
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,345
At least we'll both
know what you're doing.

155
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,266
I want it yesterday I was 15
and now i'm 16.

156
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,474
Isn't that weird?
It's just so weird, right?

157
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,693
Totally weird.
Here's your cake.

158
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:11,954
Can you get me a different piece?

159
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,659
- What's wrong with this one?
- It's cut weird.

160
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25,446
That cake looks delicious.
Did you make that yourself?

161
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,715
Are you warming up to use
that line on a 16 year-old?

162
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,557
'cause it might need a little work.

163
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:31,573
Please I'm here for the cake,
although I'm more

164
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:33,919
of a pie man, but we can
discuss that later over drinks.

165
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:36,805
The only drinks i'm dealing with
later are the ones i'm cleaning up.

166
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,243
Great! Tomorrow night?

167
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,518
You really aren't clear on
the meaning of "no", are you?

168
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:44,515
No. But I'm very good with yeses, as in:
"yes, I find you insanely hot"

169
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,683
and "yes,
I was hoping you felt the same",

170
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:48,651
and "yes,
tomorrow night sounds great."

171
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,079
- And what if I still said no?
- No to which "yes"?

172
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,195
The first two.

173
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:55,327
Then I'll pick you up at eight,
and won't take no for an answer.

174
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:56,918
No to which "yes?"

175
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,252
- Hey man, is she going out with you?
- I don't know.

176
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:08,285
So... That was weird, running into
you and casey this morning. Literally.

177
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,212
Yeah. She and I are friends again.

178
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,454
A Psi Phi brownie was involved.

179
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:16,677
I've heard of their psychedelic
healing powers.

180
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,302
You're OK with that, right?

181
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:20,311
Yeah, completely.

182
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,152
Friends are fun.

183
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:24,187
I think plato said that.

184
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:25,648
Or...

185
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:26,953
Elmo.

186
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:30,934
The birthday brat just put in a special
request for you to serve them...

187
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,685
- ...shirtless.
- What?

188
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,528
I'll make you mine, Mrs. Mcgovern,
I just wanted to say how honored

189
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:42,795
- I am to have you back here at ZBZ.
- Of course you are, dear.

190
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,021
Boy on the floor!

191
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:47,825
We never bothered to use towels.

192
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:51,652
Well, with your figure,
you didn't need to.

193
00:09:52,236 --> 00:09:53,236
Right.

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,760
So, I bet the study lounge looked
different without the computers.

195
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,585
Are you implying that I'm old?

196
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,242
No, I just wanted to
point out the computers.

197
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,890
That they're a little outdated...

198
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:08,794
I've always said,
"if it ain't broke."

199
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,236
I always say that, too!

200
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,778
But of course, if it is
broke, it takes money...

201
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:16,113
Right.
I'm going to find my old room.

202
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:21,062
She's warm.

203
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:22,881
A word of advice?

204
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:25,113
She spends her life
getting hit up for money,

205
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:26,540
so stop sucking up.

206
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,594
Am I coming across
a little desperate?

207
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,085
A little, yeah.

208
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,004
For what it's worth,
i'm enjoying the tour.

209
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:33,674
I'm glad to see that someone is.

210
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,654
So what do you think
of the house so far?

211
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:38,770
Honestly, I'm a little surprised
you girls are such slobs.

212
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:41,090
You do know you're only
getting the second floor tour

213
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,503
- because you're with doris.
- Yeah, I know.

214
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,970
Traveling with her sometimes
does have its perks.

215
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:50,557
Don't be nervous.

216
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:52,398
What if he recognizes me?

217
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,063
He won't. Just trust me,
it was over a year ago.

218
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:01,047
Grant, this is rusty
and this is jordan.

219
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:03,422
- Great finally meeting you guys.
- Yeah, absolutely.

220
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,220
I feel like we've met before.

221
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:08,458
No. Probably not.

222
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,794
So jordan, what happened
to you this morning?

223
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,423
I was taking pictures
on main street.

224
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:16,937
You should see her pictures.
She is really good.

225
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,938
Are you sure we haven't met?

226
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,353
Are you taking any photography
classes this semester?

227
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:24,799
No, I've never thought
about taking it in school.

228
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,103
A friend of mine from back home is
a professional photographer in new york.

229
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,760
Twenty-three and she's already
shooting spreads forvogue.

230
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:32,772
Teen vogue.

231
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:35,777
If you want, you could call her.

232
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,474
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love
to hear how she got started.

233
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,409
She must be really talented if
she's doing all that just out of school.

234
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,746
Actually, she dropped out and
she got a job as an intern,

235
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,957
paid her dues, and now
she's working on her own.

236
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,375
Really?
I had no idea you could do that.

237
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:53,152
It's pretty risky though.

238
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:56,128
Seems like you need a college degree to
do anything these days.

239
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,899
- Not necessarily in the arts.
- Exactly!

240
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,296
She was telling me that...

241
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:03,764
Stuff.

242
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,768
- School's not for everyone.
- It should be.

243
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,651
You're one of the omega chis

244
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:13,105
that taped me to the wall last year.

245
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:19,605
You guys should try this corn bread,
it's really... Fresh.

246
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:26,256
With our country torn asunder,

247
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:29,373
it pains me that we are
engaged in battle as well.

248
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,001
<i>You are my sister,
and have betrayed me.</i>

249
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,482
<i>If only a magical wood nymph.</i>

250
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,547
Someone got herself a chafing dish.

251
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,606
- He's really sweet.
- But don't you think it's kinda weird

252
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:44,328
that doris brought him
to a sority function?

253
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,000
He's the only boy here.

254
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:48,167
He's helping his grandma out.

255
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,682
I think it's really nice.

256
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:51,622
<i>An injured wood nymph approaches.</i>

257
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,148
<i>Be calm and quiet so we
do not scare the injured.</i>

258
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:04,908
Wood nymph?

259
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,488
- Really?
- Come on, it's zbz history.

260
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:10,749
How's it going with doris?

261
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,854
I've tried professional,
gracious, nonchalant...

262
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:17,078
But I'm not any closer
than I was with desperate.

263
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,631
Don't give up.
She loved her time here.

264
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,752
That's the problem.
She loves zbz of the past.

265
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:23,672
Not really zbz of the present.

266
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,391
- So, focus on the past.
- Nostalgia...

267
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,227
We could brainstorm
more later. Grab a drink?

268
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:38,072
I provided that you ditch the
bayonet and the mustache.

269
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,193
I'm sure I could manage to...

270
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:43,556
your stupid brother is
waiting for you in the kitchen.

271
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,493
I'm sorry, I have to...

272
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:51,105
No excuses. It's a soldier's duty.

273
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,569
But what can eugenia and I offer yee.

274
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:58,424
In return, ensorcelled nymph?

275
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,590
You need a shave.

276
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:05,427
And you need to stop
eating our food.

277
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,276
What's up? You just interrupted
some serious.

278
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,725
Networking.

279
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,071
It's jordan. Has she talked
to you about school lately?

280
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:13,781
Like if she's having any problems?

281
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:16,298
She's mentioned she has
an 8:00am class she hates.

282
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,226
But I mean, who could blame her?

283
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:19,733
Brains don't work that early.

284
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,359
No, I mean academically.

285
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:23,506
I just get the feeling
she's not that into school.

286
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:25,571
Like she doesn't see
the point to any of it.

287
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,509
Yeah, with an 8:00am, who would?

288
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,141
OK, unfortunately, unlike you,

289
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,472
we all didn't know what we
wanted to do when we were born.

290
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,355
Most of us are still
figuring it out.

291
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,630
<i>I said,</i>

292
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:39,058
"does he not see
how devotedly I love him?"

293
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:40,949
Crap, that's my cue.

294
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,173
You're saying there's
nothing I can do about it?

295
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:45,578
Isn't the question "what is
jordan going to do about it?"

296
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:47,095
What affects jordan affects me.

297
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,305
You love studying polymer
science, what does she have?

298
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:53,508
I don't know. She's been
really into photography lately.

299
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,181
Then maybe that's her direction.

300
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:58,739
"Does he not see how
devotedly I love him?"

301
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,280
Sorry, I gotta go storm atlanta.

302
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:08,844
According to the undergrad catalogue,
all you need is professor belski

303
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:11,504
to approve your portfolio
and then you're in the major.

304
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,625
- But I don't even have a portfolio.
- Yet.

305
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,404
We'll worry about that
after she agrees to look at it.

306
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,772
Thank you for doing this for me.

307
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:21,908
You can thank me if it works.

308
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:29,548
Hi, professor belski...

309
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,363
What do you think of this?

310
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,014
It's an eye?

311
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,021
They say that eyes are
the windows to the soul.

312
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:37,854
But windows are clear, transparent,
merely a framing device.

313
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,864
So what does a well-exposed
close-up of an eye,

314
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,034
a frame within a frame, mean?

315
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,157
Nothing? If there's no context.

316
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,988
Exactly.

317
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,619
What's your name?

318
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:53,410
Jordan reed.

319
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:56,911
I'm actually interested in majoring in
photography and I was wondering...

320
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,584
We're wondering if you could
take a look at her portfolio.

321
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:03,306
May you take a look
at her portfolio?

322
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:07,123
The month. I look at portfolios
the month of may for next fall.

323
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,274
I was hoping to start
sooner than that.

324
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,122
Do you think you could
make an exception?

325
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,164
May. No exceptions.

326
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,009
And no eyeballs, please.

327
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:20,969
May isn't that far away.

328
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,701
But the program doesn't
start'til next fall.

329
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,393
And that's if I even get in.

330
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,136
What if she doesn't
like my pictures?

331
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,597
She'll love them.
You just have to wait.

332
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,470
Another year?

333
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,607
We used to roast marshmallows here

334
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:40,039
but the cost of cleaning
the chimney became too great.

335
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:43,135
My kids love to roast marshmallows.

336
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,721
They're six and four.

337
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:46,394
It's the first time I've been away.

338
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:49,621
- You must really Miss them.
- What?

339
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:51,397
My kids, sure.

340
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:54,939
But I Miss this house.

341
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,682
And the sisters, and the gossip...

342
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,829
Come on, gimme some gossip.

343
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:04,124
Caroline is failing german.

344
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,997
And jamie wears invisible braces.

345
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:10,028
Come on, give me some real dirt.

346
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:11,404
I won't tell.

347
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:18,807
See that girl over there?

348
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,285
She kissed my boyfriend
at a kt party.

349
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,822
You're hanging out with kts?

350
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,586
B: what a skank!

351
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,565
Yeah. We're in a bet.

352
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,896
And if she raises more money than me,
I actually have to forgive her.

353
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:37,292
I just don't know what I can do.

354
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,632
We can make damn
sure she doesn't win.

355
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:42,377
Hand me my purse.

356
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,011
Are there always this
many people here?

357
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,886
This is a slow night. You go for
a table and i'll get us some drinks.

358
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:53,767
But I was hoping to treat.

359
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:57,284
Girls get served way faster
than guys. So, this one's on me.

360
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:01,796
<i>- Two drafts please.
- You got it.</i>

361
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:03,312
Girls always get served faster.

362
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,202
It's probably because of the boobs.

363
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,639
Do you want me to get you one?

364
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,212
Two, actually.

365
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,090
I just saw these
girls in pink sweaters

366
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:15,993
almost throw down over
an empty bathroom stall.

367
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,346
Hey, I'm lana.

368
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,682
I'm casey.

369
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,269
So... How do you
two know each other?

370
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:27,771
Fight club. Damn.
I broke the first rule.

371
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:29,602
And the second one.

372
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,754
Do you know each other from class?

373
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,403
I don't go to school here.

374
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,989
Where do you go?

375
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:38,032
To work. That's about it.

376
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:43,741
<i>- Here you go.
- You look thirsty.</i>

377
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,133
No.

378
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,587
I'm here with... nate.
He's this guy...

379
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,628
That I'm seeing. He's over there.

380
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,427
<i>He got a table. He's a keeper.</i>

381
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,153
Does he share?

382
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:00,137
Do you want to join us?

383
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,552
Sure, yeah.

384
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:14,823
Nate, this is lana.

385
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:16,321
<i>And cappie.</i>

386
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:18,823
That's a funny name.

387
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:20,883
Yeah, it makes me laugh, too.

388
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,853
So how do you two know each other?

389
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,260
We just met actually.
At zbz founder's weekend.

390
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,731
Funny. You look awfully young
and male to have founded zbz.

391
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,651
No, he's accompanying his
grandmother. Isn't that sweet?

392
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,173
Actually,
doris is not my grandmother.

393
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,759
She's not?

394
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:39,932
No, I'm more of her helper.

395
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:41,836
Her helperish friend.

396
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,808
What does a helperish friend do?

397
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:47,316
Other than make great
meals out of hamburger?

398
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,039
When doris's husband died,

399
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,431
she had to run
the company by herself,

400
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:55,512
and she needed
an extra set of hands.

401
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,420
And what exactly do those hands do?

402
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,321
They help, OK?

403
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:02,492
I think taking care of the
elderly is a wonderful thing.

404
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,376
Sure. Helping is great.

405
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,552
I think elmo said that. Or plato.

406
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:12,192
So what kind of name
is cappie? Dutch?

407
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:29,600
After all this work, I really feel like
I've "urned" this wine.

408
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:32,790
- That's funny, right.
- No.

409
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,482
- So I was with casey last night...
- Really?

410
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,160
- You guys hung out?
- Yeah.

411
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:42,349
She was with this guy, nate.
Something's not right with him.

412
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,876
Not to mention i'm 99 percent sure
he lifted a tip off the table.

413
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:46,338
Why didn't you say something?

414
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,472
I can't. She'll just accuse
me of being jealous.

415
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:51,028
- Are you?
- No. I want her to move on.

416
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:53,303
- Just not with a douche bag.
- Right.

417
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:57,406
But... Someone could talk to her.

418
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,161
A friend?

419
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:02,384
Yeah, all right.
I'll warn casey off your douche bigalow.

420
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,226
"Douche bigalow", that's funny.

421
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:06,518
- I must be wearing off on you.
- That's what he said.

422
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:07,891
The streak ends at one.

423
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:10,116
- So, you'll talk to casey?
- Yes.

424
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,599
Just one question.

425
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:15,063
How am I supposed to warn her
about somebody I've never met?

426
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,431
If I don't do something soon,

427
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:20,613
I have a feeling jordan
might leave school.

428
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,001
So what if she does?

429
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:24,454
It's possible that college
might not be right for her.

430
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,036
She would be making a
massive mistake if she quit.

431
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,160
- And I have to stop that.
- What does that mean?

432
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:32,477
It means you should drop
your jacket back at the house,

433
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:34,339
'cause you're not going to need it.

434
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,494
This isn't one of your
really bad ideas, is it?

435
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,255
This is one of
my really great ideas.

436
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:45,134
It's amazing how fast the years go.

437
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:47,412
It seems like only yesterday.

438
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,598
All the more reason we need zbz

439
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:51,772
to remain a part of our lives now.

440
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:53,642
I'm rebecca logan.

441
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:56,974
- You kissed ashleigh's boyfriend.
- Excuse me?

442
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,360
- That's not what zbz sisters do.
- Excuse me?

443
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,266
I'm donating to the house, but
i'm giving my money to ashleigh.

444
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:04,651
Excuse me.

445
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:09,629
What in the hell have
you been telling people?

446
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:12,080
- B The truth.
- I suppose she neglected to mention

447
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,751
that she's forgiven her boyfriend,
but she won't forgive me.

448
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:15,833
Is that true?

449
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:19,864
She has a completely different
standard for boyfriends than sisters.

450
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:21,914
That's a little
hypocritical, don't you think?

451
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,870
- No. I don't. Because...
- Well I do.

452
00:22:23,995 --> 00:22:25,993
I think it's time people
found out the whole story.

453
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:27,804
We have a lot to discuss.

454
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:33,933
Some group?

455
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:36,315
Wait, this is your year, isn't it?

456
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:38,394
I didn't know we brought that down.

457
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:43,124
Sometimes it helps when
you're being terribly obvious

458
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:44,879
to just admit it.

459
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:47,384
I brought it down on purpose.

460
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,343
And you should,
it was a stellar year.

461
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,838
- We won greek week...
- Sports banner,

462
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:55,489
top gpa, greek blue ribbon.

463
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,875
You know what they say,
the more things change.

464
00:22:58,054 --> 00:22:59,683
The more they stay the same.

465
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:02,046
This doesn't look the same.

466
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,514
Actually,
this place looks like hell.

467
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,335
It is the same.

468
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:08,954
Zbz, number one.

469
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,437
<i>The men of omega chi have
courage to always fight</i>

470
00:23:13,562 --> 00:23:15,672
and here are omega
chis serenading us

471
00:23:15,797 --> 00:23:18,686
like they always do, because we're the
number one house.

472
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:22,566
<i>Where fraternal bonds make us strong</i>

473
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:26,360
<i>a sword to our chest on the field</i>

474
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:34,027
<i>the men of omega chi</i>

475
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:36,345
<i>stout hearts brave and true</i>

476
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:40,110
just in the nick of time.
You are the best!

477
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,856
Hopefully this'll stir up
some rewarding memories.

478
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:50,625
Who's the new guy?
I don't recognize him.

479
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:53,973
He's just here for the weekend.

480
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:57,621
Do I detect a cartwright crush?

481
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,187
He's all right.

482
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,152
Hey man, I'm evan chambers.

483
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:03,316
Nate radcliffe.

484
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,298
- Where you from?
- Baltimore.

485
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:06,910
Balti-more.

486
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,173
Would you excuse us for a minute?

487
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,888
Sure.

488
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:17,881
- I don't know. I don't like him.
- What? You just met him.

489
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:19,875
But I got a really
bad feeling about him.

490
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,918
- From a handshake?
- Sweaty palms.

491
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,604
Wait a minute. Are you jealous?

492
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:26,946
What?

493
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:30,074
Jealous? No, I'm
not jealous. I'm concerned.

494
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:32,220
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

495
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,320
And as your friend, i'm telling you,

496
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:36,933
I don't like douche
bigalow over there.

497
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:41,533
And that sounds like cappie.

498
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:51,334
You guard the door, I'll get
the pictures from the computer.

499
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,324
And then what?

500
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,121
Then I'll get her pictures
in front of professor belski.

501
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:00,712
It's just one of those things
boyfriends do for

502
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:02,728
their girlfriends
because they love them.

503
00:25:02,853 --> 00:25:05,336
Are you sure you're doing this
for jordan, or for you?

504
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,173
OK, I don't think that's really...

505
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,599
Surprise!

506
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:21,185
Rusty! What are you doing here?

507
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,350
I thought since we had
that afternoon free...

508
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:28,317
That we would play Stephen Hawking

509
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,386
and the naughty
scientist girl again?

510
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:34,146
C'mon, say it.
Say it. Say it for me!

511
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,370
Rusty, say it!

512
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,719
Take off your clothes.

513
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,598
Actually...

514
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,012
I thought first
we could actually go...

515
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,299
We could study somewhere else.

516
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,758
You surprised me to study?

517
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:54,510
As foreplay.

518
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,130
Straight people...

519
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,432
I had fun tonight.

520
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:20,226
To be honest, I haven't really
done much dating lately.

521
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:21,341
Me either.

522
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,472
Doris tends to take up
a lot of time.

523
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:25,750
I can only imagine.

524
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:28,669
What do you do for her, anyway?

525
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,756
- I'm a friend who helps her out.
- Helps her out how?

526
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,453
Crossing the street? Opening jars?

527
00:26:33,578 --> 00:26:36,538
Aiding and abetting sorority girls
who dare cross her path?

528
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,882
It's complicated.

529
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,897
So in the interest of

530
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,647
keeping this simple.

531
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:55,902
By the way,

532
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,406
I talked to doris.

533
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,417
She's gonna write ZBZ
a nice big check.

534
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,911
That's amazing, thank you!

535
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,371
Even after you slip me my percentage,
you're gonna have a lot for the house.

536
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:07,725
- Your what?
- My cut.

537
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,405
I was thinking 20 percent,

538
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,425
but since you're so incredibly hot,
I'll take 15.

539
00:27:14,857 --> 00:27:16,496
That money is supposed to be

540
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:18,844
a charitable donation
to the sorority.

541
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,222
And it will be.
Most of it, anyway.

542
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:23,808
And what if I tell doris?

543
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,269
Be smart, Casey.

544
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:28,393
No offense,

545
00:27:28,518 --> 00:27:31,023
you don't want to do anything
that you're gonna regret later.

546
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:33,701
I already did.

547
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:45,663
I still can't believe
you wanted to come to an art show.

548
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:47,937
I didn't think this was your thing.

549
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,710
I've got a feeling.

550
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,049
We'll both find something
to enjoy here tonight.

551
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:57,296
If taking pictures makes you happy,

552
00:27:57,421 --> 00:28:00,094
then you belong here at CRU
in the photography department.

553
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,316
And if professor Belski
doesn't look at your portfolio,

554
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:06,563
maybe she'll look at
your first public showing.

555
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:11,276
Oh, my God!

556
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,579
My photos...

557
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:26,495
You remember Jordan Reed?

558
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,078
Of course. I'm looking forward
to seeing your portfolio in may.

559
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:32,960
We don't have to wait that long.
These are her photos.

560
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:49,643
What do you think?

561
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,770
Amateurish.

562
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,194
But there is some interesting
composition, depth.

563
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,502
And no eyeballs.

564
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,736
Are you gonna keep annoying me
until I let her into the program?

565
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,114
You can count on it.

566
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:03,103
I'll probably regret this.

567
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:05,609
You can begin classes next semester.

568
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:08,639
It's a three-year program.

569
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:11,624
Culminating in an art show
you won't have to crash.

570
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,801
- And then?
- You'll have to do what everyone else

571
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:16,675
does after they graduate
with a degree in photography,

572
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,839
hunt for a job as an assistant.

573
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,550
And if you're good,
you work your way up.

574
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,189
What are you doing here?

575
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,436
I was on a date. With Nate.

576
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:38,651
It ended early.

577
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,488
I guess I need two dates to figure out
what you got just from shaking his hand.

578
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:46,951
Sorry I accused you
of being jealous,

579
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,904
you were just looking out for me.

580
00:29:57,037 --> 00:30:00,101
Anyway, he got Doris
to donate money to the house,

581
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:02,466
then expected a percentage
for himself.

582
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:03,984
You're kidding.

583
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,726
I should've known. Money has a real
knack for turning guys into jerks.

584
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,308
I didn't mean...

585
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:13,070
I meant Nate.

586
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:15,030
No, I get it. It's OK.

587
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:21,426
I shouldn't have started dating.
I guess I'm not ready.

588
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:22,472
After...

589
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:23,916
Max and...

590
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:26,845
... everything.

591
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,198
I think you're ready.

592
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,727
I just don't think you're ready
to date jerks like him.

593
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,508
Can I walk you home?

594
00:30:46,437 --> 00:30:48,158
I'm good, but...

595
00:30:48,594 --> 00:30:49,531
Thanks.

596
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:10,175
What was all that about?

597
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:14,629
I think you were right
about her new douche.

598
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:18,885
First Max then Nate.

599
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:21,894
I swear it's all been downhill
since me.

600
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,091
Thanks. Yeah...

601
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:33,057
We should take pictures
of your pictures.

602
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,017
Is that weird?

603
00:31:36,683 --> 00:31:38,342
Thank you for everything today.

604
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,168
God, it was amazing.

605
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:47,635
I turned it down.

606
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,653
What? Why?

607
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,248
Rusty, do you know how many classes
I took in community college,

608
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,019
in every possible subject?

609
00:31:57,424 --> 00:32:00,518
How I wanted to believe
that moving here would make me happy?

610
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:03,516
Even the whole study abroad thing,
it was just another way to buy time

611
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:06,298
until I figured out
what it was I wanted to do.

612
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,276
- And what is that?
- I want to be a photographer.

613
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:13,138
I want to be an artist,
not spend my time studying art.

614
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,509
Look, rusty, school is
where you belong, but not me.

615
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:20,576
And if I want to do this,

616
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:22,690
I gotta do this for real.

617
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,464
You're dropping out.

618
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,143
So we'll just find you a job here,
you can get an apartment.

619
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:34,368
There's one in my building,
I was actually...

620
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,415
You know Grant's friend?

621
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:37,788
The photographer?

622
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:41,623
I talked to her earlier today.

623
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:46,456
Rus, this is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

624
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:52,545
She offered me an internship.

625
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:55,972
In New York.

626
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:06,191
Carry the one...

627
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:11,165
I'm ahead by four-hundred dollars.
And that's just from six alums.

628
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,366
I guess rich people are more comfortable
with cheating than with hypocrisy.

629
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,877
Not so fast. I got more

630
00:33:17,273 --> 00:33:18,884
alums to donate than you.

631
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,066
- So I'm going with the popular vote.
- You're changing the rules?

632
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:25,002
- I'm winning!
- Anyway, I can't forgive you.

633
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,128
That's not...

634
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:30,865
You know what? Forget it.
I'm done and I've had it.

635
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,071
With you, with everyone!
Because no matter what I do,

636
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:34,988
I guess I'll always be
the house slut.

637
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:41,352
What is wrong with Rebecca?

638
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:43,192
You floozy!

639
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:47,107
- Me?
- She must mean rebecca.

640
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:49,540
I just talked to Nate

641
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:52,446
and he told me
how you threw yourself at him.

642
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:53,448
What?

643
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,063
I want... No.

644
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:57,228
I demand a kitty passing!

645
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:05,525
You forced yourself on Nate.

646
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,237
With all due respect,
Mrs. McGovern,

647
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:10,603
Nate tried to squeeze us for 20 percent
of your donation to this house.

648
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:13,092
At least try to lie convincingly.

649
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,220
Sorry, he said 15 percent
because I'm so incredibly hot.

650
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,806
Someone has an awfully
high opinion of herself.

651
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:22,142
Oh my god, this is insane.
What is he to you, anyway?

652
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,655
What he is to me
is none of your business.

653
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:28,190
So yes or no,
do you deny kissing him?

654
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:31,777
Yes, I mean no...
Yes, I did kiss him.

655
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,887
So you admit it.

656
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:36,990
You're nothing
but a player and a strumpet.

657
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,034
I didn't know Casey
played the strumpet.

658
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,094
Never mind. I don't care what you think.
And I'm done kissing your ass.

659
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,625
If you don't trust me, I don't want your
money, I don't want you as my sister.

660
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:48,022
May I?

661
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,329
I don't remember half
the college boys I slept with.

662
00:34:55,188 --> 00:34:58,219
Although there was one Lambda Sig...

663
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,673
It was like he had
the hindenburgin in shorts.

664
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:06,687
You don't by chance have a point?

665
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:10,875
My point is that after the boys
in your life have gone,

666
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,277
you'll still have your ZBZ sisters.

667
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,155
- Not the one who kissed my boyfriend.
- Or the one who's a total hypocrite!

668
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,490
Neither one of you is holding pussy.

669
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,637
When all is said and done,
we're sisters.

670
00:35:21,762 --> 00:35:23,495
That's why you always used to say

671
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,459
"Sisters before misters".

672
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,115
- Is that like bros before hos?
- Sisters before misters, damn it!

673
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,388
That's why
we have founder's weekend,

674
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,922
to remind us that men come and go

675
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,491
but our ZBE family is forever.

676
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:45,235
And families should be honest
with each other and I...

677
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:46,625
We all,

678
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,202
spent the weekend trying
to get money from our older sisters

679
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:54,193
using all kinds of methods.
Because the truth is...

680
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,207
We're in trouble.

681
00:35:57,662 --> 00:35:59,531
We're not number one anymore.

682
00:36:00,112 --> 00:36:02,075
We're sort of fourth. Ish.

683
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:07,203
We were hoping to raise enough money
to make some improvements on the house,

684
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:09,541
throw some killer mixers
and eventually have

685
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:12,176
the best rush
this campus has ever seen.

686
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,213
Sisters before everything else.

687
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,602
It's a shame
that's so easy to forget.

688
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,718
I have to pee.

689
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:37,183
You want coffee, milk, soda?

690
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:41,256
- I got some leftover kettlewell corn...
- How about talking to me about tonight.

691
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:54,416
I can't believe
that you're really going

692
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:57,798
I helped you, and I encouraged
and supported you,

693
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:00,784
and now you're just gonna leave?

694
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,551
I'm sorry.

695
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,197
I'm sorry too,

696
00:37:05,817 --> 00:37:08,883
If this is how you get repaid
for being a good boyfriend.

697
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:14,237
You do stuff for someone
because you love them,

698
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:18,902
then they wake up one morning
and then they say "So long".

699
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:22,745
You've always known
what you wanted to do

700
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:26,066
and that's why I love
being with you because

701
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:29,698
you made me feel like one day
I'd figure out my thing, too.

702
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:34,543
And it's because of you that I'm finally
doing what's right for me.

703
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:43,994
Excuse me if...

704
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,255
- I'm not all smiley about it.
- Neither am I,

705
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,604
because the one thing
I don't want is for us to end.

706
00:37:53,218 --> 00:37:54,752
I don't think we have to.

707
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:58,723
I mean, plenty of people
do the whole long-distance thing.

708
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,638
What about
when I was gonna go to Europe?

709
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:05,264
There's a difference. If you were going
to Europe, you were coming back.

710
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:22,758
I think pussy-willow is dead.

711
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:27,055
I have the final tally.

712
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:30,933
How much did I won by?

713
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,692
Apparently, that kitty passing made

714
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:34,502
everyone come together

715
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:36,410
and we raised another 900 dollars,

716
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:39,472
but it became a popularity contest.

717
00:38:40,424 --> 00:38:41,735
They liked me more.

718
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,261
Then sober sister, it is.

719
00:38:46,011 --> 00:38:47,644
I want to know why you did it.

720
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:50,077
Why did you kiss him?

721
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,766
I was just lonely and drunk.

722
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,669
You're my best friend,

723
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,963
and you weren't around
because you were with Fisher.

724
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:03,090
So you were jealous of me?

725
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,413
I guess I wanted
what I couldn't have,

726
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,054
and I haven't had what I wanted
in a really long time.

727
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,533
What do you want?

728
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:12,219
To be happy.

729
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,684
But every single time,

730
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:17,535
something gets in the way.

731
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:21,324
You get in the way.
You know that, right?

732
00:39:21,937 --> 00:39:24,302
When life gets too comfortable,
I screw things up.

733
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:27,197
I'm comfortable
in the uncomfortable.

734
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,381
It's just what I do.

735
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,603
Forget sober sister,

736
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:37,208
That's for the pledges

737
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,526
I think we're good now.

738
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:44,009
- Really?
- On a probationary basis.

739
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:46,732
Because if you do it again,

740
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:48,677
you'll end up like pussy-willow.

741
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,319
For the house.

742
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,118
Does this have anything to do
with kitty passing?

743
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,467
Nate caved.

744
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:17,664
He told me he tried
hitting you up for money.

745
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,607
15 percent.

746
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:25,630
So if you know Nate lied,
why is he still with you?

747
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,590
I mean...

748
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:29,676
What exactly does he do for you?

749
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:42,034
You confessed?

750
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,909
Don't play dumb.
You sicced your two thugs on me.

751
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:46,624
My two what?

752
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,403
That Cappie guy.

753
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:54,732
Him and the ass in the iron man audi.
The two of them were waiting at my hotel

754
00:40:54,857 --> 00:40:57,162
and they told me
to stay away from you.

755
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,221
I guess I finally get to cash in
on my gotcha win.

756
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,097
It's too bad that's a
going-away party though.

757
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,184
Thank you so much for everything,
for always being there helping me

758
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,560
feel like I belonged.

759
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,979
I couldn't have
asked for a better big sis.

760
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:27,776
You'll have a lot of people waiting here
for you if you ever need us.

761
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,891
Enough of the schmaltz.
Come on.

762
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:32,072
Good luck in New York.

763
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,287
Put your money in your sock,
don't eat from a cart,

764
00:41:34,412 --> 00:41:37,369
and never ever trust anyone
remotely like me.

765
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:41,373
As I always say:

766
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,172
be cool, stay in school.

767
00:41:43,297 --> 00:41:45,069
I can't believe
she's actually going.

768
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:47,629
Nate left too.

769
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,297
He turned out to be a total jerk.

770
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,299
But you knew that already.

771
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,051
I still say he's doing the old lady.

772
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,014
Before he left he told me that
you and some guy in an iron man audi

773
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,183
told him to stay away from me.

774
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:03,527
Isn't that crazy?

775
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,023
What would I be doing with iron man?
He's not even a real guy.

776
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,692
Evan has an iron man audi.

777
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,609
Does he?

778
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,612
I'd be more likely
to hang out with iron man.

779
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,534
Rebecca an I are friends again.

780
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,433
Why?

781
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:22,205
Sisterhood.

782
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,288
Maybe it won't work out?

783
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:33,862
Maybe I'll be back in a month.

784
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,714
You never know.

785
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:37,487
You never know.

786
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:40,432
Stay here.
I wanna get a picture.

787
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,105
Don't worry.

788
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,440
You'll see her again.

789
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,674
Sure I will.
