1
00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:02,565
I do not want to go
to Yale a virgin,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,087
I have decided to lose my virginity
to you, tonight.

3
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,298
I don't know what your problem is.

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,884
- Why do you even care anyway ?
- Because I like you.

5
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:12,511
- What can I get you guys ?
- Two Cosmos.

6
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,930
- What you doing ?
- I care about you, too,

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,016
that doesn't mean
we need to be exclusive.

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,727
- You haven't been exclusive ?
- Love doesn't work !

9
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,980
You know why you don't believe in love ?
Because you're heartless.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,476
I have made a pretty big
decision myself.

11
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,401
This is a form
for declaring a major.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,875
I saw the form.
Why did you lie to me ?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,924
Why didn't you tell me you're
nowhere close to picking a major ?

14
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,242
I'm sorry. I screwed up.
But the truth is,

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,370
I'm not ready to graduate.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,465
Hi.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,717
Will you accept my a-pollen-gy ?

18
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,010
"A-pollen-gy ?"

19
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:56,215
It was either that or,

20
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:58,808
"please flor-give me."

21
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,340
I bought the flowers. I didn't
steal them from someone else's lawn.

22
00:01:03,465 --> 00:01:04,689
So what do you say ?

23
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:06,524
Come on, Case,

24
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,610
we've barely spoken since Mardi Gras
and now I'm apologizing.

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,241
Thank you for the flowers.

26
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:15,074
And how about the a-pollen-gy ?

27
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,534
Do you really mean it ?

28
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,411
Sure.
I'm sorry for our fight.

29
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,995
The fight ?
That's it ?

30
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,374
And anything else I may have done
recently, hence the flowers.

31
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,704
Can we just make up
and pretend this never happened ?

32
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:27,722
When I thought I might have had
a chance in DC

33
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,559
you told me you wanted
to declare a major, which implied

34
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:33,092
that you wanted to move forward
with us after graduation.

35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,345
But now that you don't,
I'm a little freaked out about us.

36
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:39,682
I have to get to class.

37
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:42,337
Cool !
Yeah, no, I'll just...

38
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:44,145
bring the flowers by later, then.

39
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:49,342
Your hair, it looks...

40
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,822
Like Madonna's Lucky Star
video, 1983 ?

41
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:53,971
Exactly !

42
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:56,830
I'm just trying out some looks
for '80s Night at Dobler's.

43
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,367
Are you going ?
Because

44
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:01,084
you should really come and dress as
Anthony Michael Hall

45
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,520
in Sixteen Candles.
Or in The Breakfast Club.

46
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:04,832
Or Weird Science.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,959
I might, but I wouldn't know
who to take.

48
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,933
You see, I'm kind of in this complicated
dating situation.

49
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:11,527
You see, there's Katherine

50
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:12,714
and there's Dana.

51
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,425
I'm sort of dating Katherine,

52
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,469
but Dana told me she likes me, too.

53
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:19,304
But if I'm gonna get into
another relationship,

54
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,515
I want to make sure
that I have the right match.

55
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,643
So how serious is it
with Katherine ?

56
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,480
She asked me to take her virginity,

57
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,184
but I turned her down.

58
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:34,028
What ? I left her a bunch of messages,
but I haven't heard from her yet.

59
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,996
You're never gonna hear from her because
she is never going to talk to you again.

60
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:41,410
You ran out on her when she tried
to lose her virginity ?

61
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,060
It wasn't because of her.
The circumstances were completely wrong.

62
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:47,166
She's gonna think you thought
she was fat.

63
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,684
She's so not fat.

64
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,945
It doesn't matter.
She's a girl.

65
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,798
She's mortified, and you blew it.
Case closed.

66
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,891
Can anyone tell me what movie
that was from ?

67
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,727
- A-heezy ?
- Can't Buy Me Love, 1987.

68
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,021
Yes !
Today we're looking at marketing

69
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,129
in the 1980s and how companies
started using movies to sell to teens.

70
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,946
Teens were finally recognized
for their legitimate buying power.

71
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,256
They also flocked to movies
that could be made on the cheap,

72
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:24,203
and all it took to market them was
one great pop song on the soundtrack.

73
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,573
Can anyone name one of these songs ?

74
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,581
Anyone ?

75
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,749
Anyone ?

76
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,084
Anyone ?

77
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,045
Bueller ?

78
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,421
Get it ?

79
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,969
Ferris Bueller...

80
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,797
So you're absolutely

81
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,179
positive that I blew it
with Katherine ?

82
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:45,266
Yeah.
But doesn't that solve your problem ?

83
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,344
You are free to date Dana.

84
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:49,395
She is perfect for you anyway.

85
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,729
She's pretty great.

86
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,309
What if she thinks

87
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,739
that I slept with Katherine
and I haven't talked to her

88
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:57,111
since she told me she liked me ?
I'm gonna go for Dana.

89
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:58,279
Oh, Rusty.

90
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:01,349
She thinks I think she's fat, too.

91
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,681
Yeah, probably.

92
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,842
-= 318 =-
"Camp Buy Me Love"

93
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,507
Kappa Team

94
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:17,381
Hello.

95
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:22,386
Are you OK ?

96
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,554
Yeah.

97
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:27,600
I haven't seen you in a few days.
How are you doing ?

98
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,339
You don't have to give me
that pitying look, like I'm some

99
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:33,124
kindergartener who came to school
with a maxi pad around her knee

100
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,858
'cause she thought it was a bandage.
And if that did happen,

101
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,193
it would be a totally
honest mistake...

102
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:40,362
- Your finger's stuck ?
- No.

103
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:41,889
Let me help.

104
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:49,151
Nothing happened with Katherine
after the Mardi Gras party.

105
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,291
Really ?

106
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,081
- No.
- Even though she's blonde

107
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:58,088
and leggy with high cheekbones
and a sure thing ?

108
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,715
Yeah. That's right.

109
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:03,919
What I'm trying to say now is...

110
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,640
Dana, will you go out with me
Saturday night ?

111
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:10,392
I'll have to think about it.

112
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,647
I'm just kidding.
Of course I will.

113
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,815
Great.

114
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:20,694
I'm sorry, Case.

115
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,331
I just don't get why someone as

116
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,784
smart and amazing as Cappie would
want to stay in college forever.

117
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,430
I understand wanting to party
and screw around for a while.

118
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:31,747
I've done plenty of that myself.
But I can't help

119
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,059
but wonder if maybe
you weren't right, Ash.

120
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,362
What if we are too different ?

121
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:37,893
And what if we're...

122
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,371
not going to last forever ?

123
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:42,883
No matter how much we try
or how much we love each other.

124
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:45,302
I don't want to be right about that,

125
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,509
so you need to address this
with Cappie, head-on.

126
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:50,739
how do I address someone

127
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,936
who says he might never
want to leave college ?

128
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,313
He can't possibly mean that.
That'd just be crazy ?

129
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,481
Would it ?

130
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:00,317
It's Cappie we're talking about here,
and he definitely has

131
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,611
his own way of doing things.
And...

132
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,486
didn't you kind of already know
that when you got back together ?

133
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:07,616
So why are you trying
to change him now ?

134
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,681
You're right.
I know.

135
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,245
I love Cappie,

136
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,384
and I don't want to change him.

137
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,523
But if we're on completely
different paths

138
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:19,086
and he stays here forever
we're never going to work,

139
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,000
which scares the crap out of me.

140
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,132
Then you need
to make him understand that.

141
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,477
Cheap beer
and The Political Economy.

142
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:31,340
Evan, this is sad.

143
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,598
I am behind in my reading,
and I can't afford good beer.

144
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,658
I guess the economy and I
are both a bit depressed.

145
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,826
About Rebecca ?

146
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,594
How could I have been so stupid ?

147
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,323
You know, buying her that necklace
with money I didn't have ?

148
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,951
I put my position in the house at risk,
not to mention my friendship with you.

149
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,705
And she slept with someone else.

150
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,583
- You have any idea who it was with ?
- No. I don't really care.

151
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,294
OK, I care a little.

152
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:06,094
God, why,
when beer is called "something's best",

153
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,635
- is it always the worst ?
- Good question.

154
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,875
Grant went to Michigan
to see Kylie Minogue,

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,556
so I'm flying solo this weekend.

156
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,225
How about we go to this '80s party ?

157
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,853
Everybody Wang Chung like a virgin !

158
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:21,482
Maybe if my jokes were better
she wouldn't have cheated.

159
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:25,030
Look, don't beat yourself up about it,
all right ?

160
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,112
Everybody knows
Rebecca Logan's got issues.

161
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,102
For what it's worth,
I got the impression

162
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:32,785
that she really did like you.

163
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,970
That's worth about
as much as a bottle of...

164
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:37,372
Sandusky's Best.

165
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:48,357
Hey, Katherine.

166
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:51,345
- I don't think you're fat.
- Nor do I.

167
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:53,780
Oh, well, good.

168
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,491
But you're mad at me,
though, right ?

169
00:07:56,616 --> 00:08:00,586
I see my failure to return all seven
of your messages has not gone unnoticed.

170
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:02,231
Rusty, I'm not angry.

171
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:04,258
- You're not ?
- Initially, I was.

172
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,765
It was very embarrassing.

173
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,195
But I realized you were right
to withdraw when you did.

174
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,415
The timing was completely off, and
for you to have the restraint to realize

175
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,912
that in such a passionate moment
really was the height of chivalry.

176
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,772
I'm completely mortified

177
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:18,471
by my actions,

178
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:19,832
and I'm hoping

179
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:21,959
that we can move past this.

180
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,260
Of course we can.

181
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:28,966
So I guess we got through
our first big fight.

182
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:32,344
You know what they say about
relationships they all have speed bumps.

183
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,993
- Relationships ?
- Furthermore, we should take it slow.

184
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:36,306
You know, no sex yet.

185
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,773
- Do you have plans tomorrow night ?
- No.

186
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,106
Great. We can go to
the Dobler's '80s party together.

187
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,859
That's nice. I never have any dates
for these Greek events.

188
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,838
I'm late for my hierarchy
and hegemony seminar,

189
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,990
so we'll talk details later.
I promise I'll call you back.

190
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,924
I know how much you don't want
to talk about this

191
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,838
But we have to : graduation,
our future, all of it.

192
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:06,631
We have to figure it out.
I mean, I am graduating in May.

193
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:09,214
And I might be leaving CRU.

194
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,601
But you might get into CRU Law
and we don't have to worry about it.

195
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,137
- But what if I don't ?
- But what if you do ?

196
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:18,012
Look, if you go somewhere else,

197
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:21,200
- then we'll just do long-distance.
- But for how long ?

198
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,854
For 20 years, until you graduate ?
How will that work ?

199
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,523
Graduation is on May.
Why can't we deal with it then ?

200
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,869
Because I'm not as good
at living in the now

201
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:32,701
as you. I can't feel comfortable
in our relationship not knowing

202
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:35,073
- where we're going.
- You might be going to CRU Law.

203
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,867
- What if I don't ?
- What if you do ?

204
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,202
My God, Cappie !

205
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,139
You have to accept you can't be
in college forever...

206
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:42,601
Surprise !

207
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,541
April ?
Tobias ?

208
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,501
What the hell are you guys
doing here ?

209
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,755
Too early for a philosophy quiz.
It's great to see you !

210
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:54,801
This must be Casey.
She's gorgeous !

211
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,004
Amazing eyes.

212
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:00,349
Who are you ?

213
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:06,396
These are my parents.

214
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,895
So this is where the magic happens ?

215
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:21,814
- Hurry up, Beav !
- Don't rush me.

216
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:25,892
- What color am I again ?
- Red.

217
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,017
Damn it !

218
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,670
So, guys, I have a little problem.

219
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,256
I seem to have found myself
dating two girls.

220
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:36,050
At the same time.

221
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,694
That's not enough ? You want a different
girl for every night of the week ?

222
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:44,101
- Way to be greedy.
- No.

223
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,406
I think two girls is one too many.

224
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,115
I think one girl's one too many.

225
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,776
I really need to figure this out.

226
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:52,569
Two girls liking me ?
Never happened before.

227
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,248
It's like a syzygy or something.

228
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,316
- Yeah, it is !
- No.

229
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,701
A syzygy is the alignment
of three or more

230
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,659
celestial bodies
along a straight line.

231
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:03,544
Never mind.

232
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:06,159
So, I need to figure out
which one is better for me

233
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:08,728
- and then go out with her.
- That sounds confusing.

234
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:12,087
- I say you just date them both.
- Never mind. Is Cappie here ?

235
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,256
Spitter.

236
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:15,924
There's nothing wrong
with dating two chicks.

237
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,165
You just need to make sure
they both know things are casual.

238
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,341
Keep saying the word "casual"

239
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,615
and make sure one never
finds out about the other.

240
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,354
- Lying helps.
- Beaver has a point.

241
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:28,052
How are you ever gonna figure out
which one you like more

242
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:30,294
- without dating both of them ?
- That's true.

243
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,107
You really think
I can pull that off ?

244
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:33,692
Casual.

245
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,856
Thanks, guys.

246
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:37,991
Beav, I think Pledge Snuggie
is your next move.

247
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,260
Pledge Snuggie,

248
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,283
leapfrog Pledge Slanket
and get kinged.

249
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,370
Great effort, pledge.

250
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:50,969
Let's get out of here.
I don't want to run into Rebecca.

251
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:53,064
She's not here.
She went to visit her mom.

252
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:54,689
- She did ?
- Yeah.

253
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,111
We don't have to study at the union.
We can stay here.

254
00:11:57,236 --> 00:12:00,177
I only have an hour 'cause I'm meeting
Cappie and his parents for lunch.

255
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,481
Cappie's parents ?

256
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:04,306
Yeah. They dropped in
for a surprise visit.

257
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:06,224
Sounds like April and Tobias.

258
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:10,023
They're pretty much the stereotype
of the flaky hippies who never grew up ?

259
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,491
Don't be such a snob.

260
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:14,274
They seem really nice
and Cappie adores them.

261
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,900
It explains a lot about Cappie ?

262
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm sorry.
It's weird for you to talk to me

263
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,656
about my relationship problems.

264
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,368
Are you and Cappie
having relationship problems ?

265
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,846
Never mind.
You can't be objective about Cappie.

266
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,776
There's too much baggage
between you two.

267
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:32,250
Fair enough, but I can be
objective about you.

268
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,462
Listen, you're never
gonna be the aimless

269
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,516
and groundless kind of people
that they are.

270
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,799
And it is, it's fun at first,
but it's not real, you know.

271
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,719
And with them here,
you're gonna get to see that firsthand

272
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,630
because I am pretty sure
they are still exactly the same...

273
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:49,350
irresponsible people
they were back at camp.

274
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:51,686
Good day to you.

275
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:54,518
- Deep-fried Divinity Square ?
- Yeah. Thanks.

276
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,903
Got the recipe from my church
potluck last week.

277
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,777
- Evan, you want one ?
- Yeah.

278
00:12:59,134 --> 00:12:59,903
Wait.

279
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,860
The violent predator
of Rusty Cartwright ?

280
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,080
The betrayer of Cappie ?

281
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,549
You'll get one
of my deep-fried snacks

282
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:12,374
when you pry it out of my cold,
dead hands.

283
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,293
This... this week sucks.

284
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,428
And does every ZBZ know
about Rebecca cheating on me ?

285
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:27,234
It really sucks to get cheated on,
doesn't it ?

286
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,713
You're right.
I'm sorry, Case.

287
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:32,227
I probably deserve it.

288
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:35,609
You know, truth is, though,
Rebecca was always upfront with me

289
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,816
about what she wanted
and I was the one that tried

290
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,443
to force the relationship
into something it wasn't.

291
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:42,983
Right.

292
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,199
- These maple bars are good.
- I knew you'd like them.

293
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,988
I love the smell of maple,
don't you ?

294
00:13:48,113 --> 00:13:50,686
Second only to the smell
of blue permanent marker.

295
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:53,593
- I saw Katherine earlier.
- You did ?

296
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:55,662
What did you say ?
What did she say ?

297
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:57,043
I didn't talk to her.

298
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,067
You know, I just sort of
feel bad for her.

299
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:01,868
Are you guys friends now or...

300
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:03,842
- No !
- No ? Why not ?

301
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:09,097
Because when I told her
that you and I were casually dating,

302
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,058
she was really mad.
She yelled a lot.

303
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,266
She told me to go suck on a lot
of different things. It was brutal.

304
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,617
Jeez.
I'm sorry to hear that.

305
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,553
But you know what ?
You did the right thing

306
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,853
and I'm sure she'll come
to appreciate your honesty

307
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:24,524
and the fact that you didn't
just string her along

308
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,199
only to dump her later.
You know, like some big fat jerk.

309
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:30,577
Right.
Like a big fat jerk.

310
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,419
We turned pledge checkers
into pledge chess.

311
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,476
We haven't figured out
how to play yet.

312
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:42,801
Chess is hard.

313
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:46,676
I know it's not exactly

314
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,762
a future-oriented activity...

315
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,284
I get it. I know.
I sound like a broken record.

316
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:54,309
Why don't we wait to talk about this
until after your parents leave.

317
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,895
- Sounds great.
- Here they are, honey.

318
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,231
- Mr. and Ms...
- Please. April and Tobias.

319
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,651
Sorry we're early. I always lose track
of the time when I'm baked.

320
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:05,028
- Tobias.
- I'm kidding.

321
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,490
I love doing that. People get
so freaked out by hippie parents.

322
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:11,042
Cappie, we just stopped for gas

323
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,073
and the attendant was
such an interesting guy.

324
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:15,497
When I told him I was visiting
my son and his lover,

325
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,279
he told me about this fantastic
campground just a few hours from here.

326
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:22,682
Apparently it's hidden away,
so no fanny pack-wearing tourists,

327
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,714
attracting bears
with their Twinkies.

328
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:28,301
So what do you say ?
We skip lunch and go camping.

329
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,595
It'll be like old times.
I brought my pan-flute.

330
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,663
I can make my bulghar burgers
and my soy-mores.

331
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:38,229
I don't really have
any equipment or...

332
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,647
It's OK. Guys, why don't we just
stick to lunch today ?

333
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,025
Beaver ! My brother
from another mother.

334
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,193
This guy !

335
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:48,738
It's your move, Cap.

336
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:52,412
Casey, I hope you don't think
we were being too pushy

337
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:54,035
with this whole camping idea.

338
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,509
We just thought it would be
the perfect setting for us

339
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,832
to have a serious conversation
with Cappie.

340
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,593
About what ?

341
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,712
Future stuff. We just have
some things we need to discuss.

342
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,922
The future ? Really ?

343
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,625
You know what ?
I am sure

344
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,677
that I can rustle up a sleeping bag
somewhere in the ZBZ house.

345
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,263
- Really ?
- Let's go camping.

346
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,205
Okay, which of these
do you like better ?

347
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:28,995
I'm sold on the jellies, but then
I watched Can't Buy Me Love last night,

348
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,045
and I was reminded
of the charm of ankle boots.

349
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,242
I was so born in the wrong decade.

350
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,957
I have no idea. I need to talk to you
about my dating situation again.

351
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:41,385
Perfect timing.
I spent all last night watching movies,

352
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,127
pretty much the complete works
of Molly Ringwald and then

353
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,994
Just One of the Guys and
Girls Just Want to Have Fun.

354
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,942
So I have watched many
complicated dating scenarios.

355
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,568
I am now an expert.

356
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,533
OK, then.
Here's one.

357
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:56,970
Do you think it's possible for a guy
to date two girls at once

358
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:59,139
without lying and being a jerk ?

359
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,353
I think you know how I feel
about that subject.

360
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:04,941
I know and I don't want to be
like Fisher, but it turns out

361
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,610
Katherine and Dana
both still like me.

362
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,445
Beaver says I should date them both.

363
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,530
- You asked Beaver ?
- Cappie wasn't there.

364
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,923
How else will I know which one is the
right choice without dating them both ?

365
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:19,788
Why can't life be easy,
like it is in those movies you watched ?

366
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,063
Eighties rom-com dating is never easy.
You might have to give

367
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:25,667
your underwear to a nerd,
have to dress up like a guy

368
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,001
and fall for your best friend
who thinks you're a guy.

369
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,632
This was before people
were allowed to be gay in movies.

370
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,967
On top of it all,
your parents forget your birthday.

371
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,653
- Does that sound easy ?
- No.

372
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:36,888
So, what do I do ?
I don't want to screw this up.

373
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,591
Rusty, your situation is easy.

374
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,038
Dana is the girl for you.

375
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:45,819
Katherine isn't the underdog girl
who dates the science nerd.

376
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:48,488
She's the imperious blonde
who dates James Spader,

377
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:49,943
the preppy jackass.

378
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,262
You're right.

379
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,640
I should stick with Dana.

380
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,158
It just feels right, when I'm with her.
That's important, isn't it ?

381
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,326
Of course.

382
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,037
So you know what you have to do now.

383
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:04,118
You have to tell
Katherine the truth.

384
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,293
I know.

385
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:14,405
It seems mosquitoes can't resist

386
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,574
my citrus vanilla body splash.

387
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:19,886
You're getting eaten alive. Thanks
for being such a good sport about this.

388
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,234
You sure you don't mind
missing the '80s party ?

389
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,868
- Not at all.
- I mean, really, the '80s were a

390
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:25,993
dark time.

391
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,357
Trickle-down economics, The Super Bowl
Shuffle earning a Grammy nomination.

392
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,891
I gotta say I was looking forward to
seeing you in that Madonna pointy cones

393
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:34,696
thingamajig.

394
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,573
Who says I didn't bring it with me ?

395
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:38,572
A joke ?

396
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,568
A promise of sex ?
Things are getting back to normal.

397
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:45,165
What say we get lost for a few hours
while looking for some firewood ?

398
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,616
And miss more stories
about little Cappie ?

399
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:48,710
Not a chance.

400
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,962
I'm very grateful
my girlfriend knows

401
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,213
that I wore hemp diapers
until I was five.

402
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,437
We didn't want to rush you, no matter
what that kindergarten teacher said.

403
00:18:56,562 --> 00:19:00,246
- That's why we started homeschooling.
- We moved around so much anyway.

404
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:01,927
Montana, Nova Scotia.

405
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,092
Then we got that job
with the theater company,

406
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:06,246
so we were all over New England.

407
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:08,001
Lived in a few ashrams.

408
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:12,229
Look, this is his first
grade picture.

409
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,145
My first grade picture was of a bunch of
little girls with Hello Kitty barrettes

410
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,213
and Disney princess dresses.

411
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,682
Well, this was taken in Vermont.

412
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,803
Then it was Panama,
and then Seattle.

413
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:28,989
A riverboat along the Mississippi Delta.
I felt like Huck Finn.

414
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,624
I can't even imagine.

415
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:34,672
We moved down the street when I was
in sixth grade and I cried for a year.

416
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,258
You can get used
to anything, so I did.

417
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:42,470
That was a great blast
from the past.

418
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,017
But, April, didn't you have something
else you wanted to talk about ?

419
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,811
Besides the past ?

420
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,191
Well, not just yet.
How about some music ?

421
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:55,756
Look.
Here she is.

422
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:09,086
Man. Is that Eddie Murphy's outfit
from Raw ?

423
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,741
Jealous ?
What are you wearing ?

424
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:15,255
- I'll just take my socks off.
- That's weak.

425
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:19,014
I don't know. Maybe I'm just not
jaunty enough for the '80s today.

426
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:22,207
I just keep thinking about
how I'm just the schmuck

427
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:26,146
who gave away that necklace, which is
now sitting somewhere in Rebecca's room

428
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:27,621
just taunting me.

429
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,639
Look, I just can't take it anymore.

430
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,584
We need to go retrieve
your manly dignity.

431
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,940
Rebecca's over you,
so now it's time you got over her.

432
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,880
- Like how ?
- Like we get that necklace back.

433
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,363
I'm not... I can't do that, all right ?
I'm taking the high road here.

434
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,494
But, I mean, if we were going to go
get it back, how would that work ?

435
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,072
We can't just walk up the stairs
at ZBZ, you know ?

436
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,905
No. See, I think I may have
someone on the inside

437
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,085
to get us into that boy-free zone.

438
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,547
- You in ?
- I'm in !

439
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:58,696
All right.

440
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,964
Schooled in manly dignity
by a guy in purple leather.

441
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,390
It's going to get dark soon.
Should we set up the other tent ?

442
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:09,299
What other tent ?

443
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:13,133
- Looks like there's just one tent.
- Awesome, awesome.

444
00:21:13,258 --> 00:21:15,064
All that body heat
will keep us warm.

445
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,442
Don't worry, we'll give you
two some private time.

446
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,610
Thanks.

447
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,126
Dinner is amazing, Mr...

448
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:25,238
- Sorry. Tobias.
- Thank you.

449
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,993
Some more soy-mores ?

450
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:28,865
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

451
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:33,309
Took me years to perfect those,
but the bulghar burgers are all Cappie.

452
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,011
He came up with the recipe one summer
when we spent the entire year at a...

453
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:40,423
- converted wheat silo.
- I was inspired by my surroundings.

454
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,817
He even got $1,000
in scholarship money

455
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:45,470
from the Wheat Growers
Society of America.

456
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,424
Really ?

457
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:49,420
You can get a whole bunch
of crazy-ass scholarships.

458
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:53,023
I mean, I got one for spelling,
one for being ambidextrous,

459
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,894
one for shaving "Stu's Steak Shack"
on the back of my head for two months.

460
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:01,141
As vegetarians, we weren't too happy
about that one, but we let it go.

461
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:05,031
He's such a smart kid. You know,
he has almost a free ride to CRU.

462
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:06,970
He is really smart.

463
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:10,307
I mean, he has taken so many
different types of classes.

464
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,289
Knowing Cappie, he probably has
enough credits to graduate already.

465
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,750
- Is that so ?
- Cappie, why the rush ?

466
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,922
Sounds like you're kind of
overextending yourself here.

467
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,654
Stay at CRU

468
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,507
until you're really ready to leave,
no matter how long that takes.

469
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,278
Don't feel pressured by some bourgeois
four-year construct.

470
00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:30,561
Learning can be a lifelong process.

471
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:32,016
"Lifelong " ?

472
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:33,694
Mom, Dad,

473
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,910
Cassey, I assure you I have
no intentions of rushing myself.

474
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,814
But, I mean,
how is that even feasible ?

475
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,774
Your scholarship money
is going to run out sometime.

476
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,698
We have an inheritance from
my father's free-range ostrich farm.

477
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:50,660
- He can stay as long as he likes.
- But why would you want him

478
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,704
to stay at a college forever ?
I mean, that's crazy.

479
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,599
We believe that life is about doing
what you as a person need to do,

480
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:59,335
not what society tells you to do.

481
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,629
I thought you were gonna
back off about this.

482
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,194
I can't.
So, excuse me.

483
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,833
- Hi, Katherine.
- Hey, Rusty.

484
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,605
We need to talk about our date.

485
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,979
Is it a matter of dress formality

486
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:24,415
or estimated time of arrival ?
Because I'm very prompt.

487
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,575
No.
I can't go out with you.

488
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:29,053
I'm sorry.

489
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,670
But I'm dating Dana.

490
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,258
Is it because I'm weird ?

491
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,093
No. Dana's weird, too.

492
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,362
OK. Is it because I'm a whore ?

493
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:42,462
- Because I threw myself at you, or... ?
- You're not a whore,

494
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,793
and no.

495
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:47,029
Well, I can't say that I'm not...

496
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:51,345
disappointed here, Rusty.
I thought I had truly found my match.

497
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:58,115
- I know how important that is.
- You know, I know I came on too strong,

498
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,118
but I was so excited about finding
a fellow amalgam like you,

499
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:03,798
you know, a Greek who's also a geek.

500
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:06,815
I thought...

501
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:11,361
that we had a unique
understanding of each other.

502
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:13,440
I know.
We do.

503
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:16,636
And I thought, you know,
how perfect, someone who

504
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:20,471
would really understand if I got caught
up at a four-hour chapter meeting,

505
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:23,296
and who would totally
not make fun of me...

506
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:26,547
when I get so excited about just...

507
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:29,086
cracking open...

508
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,135
a brand-new textbook.

509
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,639
I would understand all that.
It does make sense.

510
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,553
I'm sorry it didn't work out, Rusty.

511
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,768
Then I guess I'll be going
to Dobler's solo.

512
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,062
- Wait, I might be rethinking...
- Goodbye.

513
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Crap.

514
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,904
What the hell was all that about ?

515
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,977
I thought we agreed on putting a pin
on the future stuff for now.

516
00:24:53,102 --> 00:24:55,185
I thought your mother
was going to talk to you

517
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,174
about the future like a rational person
instead of condoning this idea

518
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,889
- you should stay in college forever.
- I don't see why it's such a big deal,

519
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:04,502
especially since you might
get into CRU law school.

520
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,670
- But what if I don't ?
- But what if I do ?

521
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:07,795
Please !

522
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,382
We can't do this again.

523
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,792
Is your mom playing Physical
on the pan-flute ?

524
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:18,307
Does she think we're
going to do it in here ?

525
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,820
Probably, yeah.

526
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:23,440
My God.

527
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:34,267
I love you.

528
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,559
And I want to be with you.

529
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:39,283
But I don't know how that can happen

530
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:41,164
if you never want to graduate.

531
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,250
And beyond that, I see
so much more out there for you.

532
00:25:44,913 --> 00:25:48,671
You have the potential to do something
extraordinary with your life.

533
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,098
So here we are again.

534
00:25:51,393 --> 00:25:53,301
You want me to change
and I don't want to.

535
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:00,071
You don't, do you ?

536
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:05,975
You're going to be
like your parents.

537
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,066
- That's what you want ?
- Maybe, and what's wrong with that ?

538
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,434
And what's wrong with growing up ?

539
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:29,345
Back up. Evan
Chambers is your friend

540
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,670
I'm supposed to help infiltrate ZBZ ?
No way, no how.

541
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:35,593
Get out of here.
I'm not afraid to use this spatula.

542
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,320
- Come on, Dale.
- How about some Christian charity ?

543
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,032
Don't use my faith as a
cheap ploy, Chambers.

544
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,169
And I'm not one of those wussy,
loving Christians, OK ?

545
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:47,688
I believe in a scary God who brings
hellfire to sinners like yourself.

546
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,306
Well, this is pointless,
so I'm just gonna go.

547
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:52,777
Rebecca can keep the stupid necklace.
I don't even care.

548
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,675
- Wait, Rebecca Logan ?
- Yeah.

549
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,114
Why didn't you say so ?
I'd aid and abet Satan himself

550
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,283
to bring down that icy temptress.

551
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,701
Welcome to ZBZ.

552
00:27:02,243 --> 00:27:03,243
Cool.

553
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:05,848
So what's the plan ?

554
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:09,418
'Cause we gotta sneak past the girls, so
maybe we need some kind of distraction.

555
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,905
I got that covered.

556
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,756
Hey, ladies !
Snickerdoodles in the kitchen !

557
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,938
Low-carb snickerdoodles !

558
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:23,474
Don't just stand there admiring me.
You've got five minutes

559
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,546
to sneak through the door,
before they realize

560
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:28,721
these are made with high-fructose
corn syrup. Go !

561
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,844
Who knew Rebecca
was such a minimalist ?

562
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,896
You know, when you have no soul
you don't crave the comfort

563
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:47,540
of sentimental knick-knacks.

564
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:53,364
- You can't even tell they're low-carb.
- Dale should go on Top Chef.

565
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,847
Fat-free potato chips, girls !

566
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,098
OK, let's go.

567
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,309
Guess what ?
They have a laxative effect.

568
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,120
She kept this from our first date.

569
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:18,587
- Why would she do that ?
- I don't know.

570
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:20,364
Let's get the hell outta here.

571
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,873
These snickerdoodles taste carb-y.

572
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,907
- Are they ?
- No.

573
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:35,814
Don't you lie to me, Dale.
This is my fifth one.

574
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,148
Would a loving Christian lie ?

575
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:43,717
Dale, the girls left the dining room
table a disaster.

576
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,558
- How impolite of them.
- Well, what are you waiting for ?

577
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,697
The table's not going
to clean itself.

578
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:52,622
No, it's not.

579
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,863
OK, I think I screwed up.

580
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,075
I dumped Katherine,
but now I think I shouldn't have.

581
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,777
Because breaking up with her
was like breaking up with myself.

582
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:10,476
The Greek-geek amalgam. I've never met
one before. What if I never do again ?

583
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:13,292
What if this is my only chance
at finding my perfect counterpart ?

584
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,604
- Wait, what about Dana ?
- I know.

585
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,465
If you really think about it, though,
isn't Katherine a better match ?

586
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,633
Hold up.

587
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,069
Maybe I've got this all wrong.

588
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:26,597
Maybe Katherine isn't the imperious
blonde. She just looks like one.

589
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:28,849
She is an underdog, too.

590
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,666
It's like in The Breakfast Club
where you find out Molly Ringwald

591
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:34,188
has low self-esteem
even though she's popular and hot.

592
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,708
Well, I don't think
any of that matters

593
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,679
because she's never gonna talk to me
again after what I just did.

594
00:29:39,804 --> 00:29:41,045
Not so fast.

595
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,158
The romantic comedy isn't
over until the credits roll.

596
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:47,827
And even then, sometimes there's
a funny part after the credits.

597
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:53,374
We have to find her,
no matter how impossible it seems.

598
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,662
Even if she's about to get married
or leaving for a semester at sea, or

599
00:29:56,947 --> 00:29:58,879
accidentally launching
herself into space.

600
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,882
I think she's just
at the '80s party at Dobler's.

601
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:03,956
Or that.

602
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,827
Yeah. Let's go !

603
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:07,939
Casey, wait up !

604
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:11,714
- Are you going to the bathroom ?
- There's a bathroom ?

605
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,444
Sure, you just duck behind a tree
and wipe with a leaf.

606
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,282
I don't really have to go.

607
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,352
I just wanted to be by myself
for a little while.

608
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:23,539
Actually I wanted to talk to you.

609
00:30:23,664 --> 00:30:25,531
Is everything okay
with you and Cappie ?

610
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:28,200
We had a fight.

611
00:30:30,443 --> 00:30:32,329
Anything that can't be resolved ?

612
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:37,859
For what it's worth,
I know it meant a lot to him

613
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:39,712
for you to come out here tonight.

614
00:30:40,563 --> 00:30:43,138
You're the most important
person in his life.

615
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:44,933
Thank you.

616
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,112
We moved around so much,

617
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:51,515
he had trouble bonding
with anyone other than us.

618
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,279
Sometimes I worry that it wasn't
the best thing for him.

619
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,536
The place he's lived longest
is the Kappa Tau house.

620
00:30:58,494 --> 00:31:01,207
Well, Cappie's turned out
to be such a great guy.

621
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:03,527
I'm sure you had a lot to do
with that.

622
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:05,325
Thanks.

623
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:07,565
But you're the one now.

624
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,900
You're his new family.
You, and those boys.

625
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:17,904
You have been a good sport.

626
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,712
I know there's a lot of other things
you'd rather be doing

627
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,062
than spooning
with a couple of aging hippies.

628
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:25,966
I could see that this is really not
your thing.

629
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,111
Well, that's kind of what Cappie
and I were fighting about.

630
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:32,723
It seems like his thing
and my thing are different,

631
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,678
and we haven't quite figured out
how to make that work.

632
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,927
Honey, he loves you for who you are.

633
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,758
You can figure this out,
and I really hope you do

634
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:45,637
because he's gonna need
you now more than ever.

635
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,946
What do you mean ?

636
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:52,076
Tobias and I are splitting up.
Tobias is telling him right now.

637
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:54,370
You're getting divorced ?

638
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,568
Oh no, hon.

639
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,037
We were never really married.
Except for that Navajo ceremony,

640
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:03,212
but that was really more
of a group love thing.

641
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,240
Anyway, we're going
our separate ways.

642
00:32:05,365 --> 00:32:06,906
But... why ?

643
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:10,534
We've been fighting a lot lately,

644
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,515
and Tobias has this great opportunity
in Austin and I'd rather stay in Maine.

645
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:18,060
I don't know.
Some things just stop working.

646
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:22,617
The funny thing is, as soon as
we accepted it was going to be over,

647
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:24,108
the fighting stopped.

648
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,944
The pressure was off.

649
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,783
But you guys seem to really love each
other. Isn't that worth fighting for ?

650
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:35,411
Not all relationships are meant
to last forever,

651
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,722
even when you're in love.

652
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:40,418
Some love stories are short stories.

653
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:43,589
But they are love stories
all the same.

654
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:54,138
Don't use these.
They have kind of sharp edges, OK ?

655
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,567
See you back at camp.

656
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,744
I'm gonna go do some yoga.

657
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,757
I guess '80s bad taste
extends to beverages.

658
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,358
Here's to the closing

659
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:26,170
of the Rebecca Logan
chapter of my life.

660
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:29,631
That was pretty convincing.

661
00:33:29,756 --> 00:33:32,259
Why are you still angsting ?
Is it that stupid ticket stub ?

662
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:36,656
I can't start trying to figure out
her motives again.

663
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:38,724
You know ?
It's too late.

664
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,606
Right. You need to move on,
all right ?

665
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:44,431
You gotta find another girl
to talk to. Like...

666
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:46,607
Like her.

667
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,195
- What ? Katherine ?
- Yeah

668
00:33:53,372 --> 00:33:56,801
I don't know.
She's a little... intense.

669
00:33:56,926 --> 00:33:59,495
You don't have to marry her.
Just talk to her.

670
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,029
Get back on your feet.

671
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,857
You know what ?
You're right.

672
00:34:03,982 --> 00:34:06,682
You're right. I'm just gonna
throw myself back out there.

673
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,296
All right.

674
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:16,057
Katherine !
You having fun ?

675
00:34:16,336 --> 00:34:20,091
I was going to say I'm not
really into parties, but I won't.

676
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:25,053
Based on recent events, I think
I need to be more of a people person.

677
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,650
Well, can I buy you a drink ?

678
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,779
A sloe gin fizz would be fine.

679
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,119
My God !

680
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:42,938
Rusty, I got so caught up
in your love story

681
00:34:43,063 --> 00:34:45,307
I forgot to put on my costume !

682
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,336
Really ?

683
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,616
There... Flashdance.

684
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:02,057
Look, there she is and she's alone.

685
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,566
Go talk to her !

686
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,895
Wait !
What are you gonna say ?

687
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:10,023
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna go off script on this one.

688
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,715
Improv. How '90s.

689
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:16,525
You're right.
You go, you see her,

690
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:19,290
you look her in the eye
and in that moment,

691
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:21,126
you just know.

692
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:23,517
Go.

693
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,587
Sorry it took so long.

694
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:35,794
The preppy jackass !

695
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:38,093
- What did you call me ?
- You heard me.

696
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:41,936
Now just excuse us.
I have to talk to Katherine.

697
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:44,599
You just called me a jackass, so...

698
00:35:44,724 --> 00:35:46,611
Rusty, look,
why don't you just back off.

699
00:35:46,736 --> 00:35:49,371
Evan's in a rough spot,
he sorta broke up with Rebecca.

700
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:53,417
So he found out
she slept with Beaver then ?

701
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:54,902
What ?

702
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:58,489
Beaver ?
That piece of crap ?

703
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,867
- That's my Bro you're talking about.
- Your brother can hardly stand upright.

704
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,804
Rebecca didn't think so.

705
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,957
Evan, what the hell !

706
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,569
You know what ?
You're right. I feel a lot better.

707
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:16,272
The preppy jackass strikes again.

708
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:49,779
Are you okay ?

709
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:51,377
Yeah.

710
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,211
Evan and I have kind of a history.

711
00:36:54,851 --> 00:36:55,906
Oh, dear.

712
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:58,757
Can I ask...

713
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:01,969
what you wanted
to talk to me about ?

714
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:06,609
I wanted to say...

715
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:13,843
Hi.

716
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:15,585
Happy '80s.

717
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:18,905
Hi.

718
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:22,300
Happy '80s to you.

719
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,542
OK, see you later, Rusty.

720
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,252
What happened ? Are you OK ?

721
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,462
Yeah.
Evan's a jerk.

722
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,255
But he stopped me
from making a mistake.

723
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,633
What do you mean ?

724
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:44,427
I looked into her eyes,

725
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:46,597
like you said.

726
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,599
I realized that I wanted

727
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,479
a girl who spits her gum out
accidentally,

728
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,826
and wears a maxi-pad
around her knee,

729
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,149
and bakes really good maple bars

730
00:37:57,529 --> 00:37:59,359
just to make me feel cozy.

731
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:01,528
A girl who that enough confidence

732
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,794
to turn me down flat

733
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:06,617
when I was dumb enough
to overlook her.

734
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:08,891
That doesn't even

735
00:38:09,016 --> 00:38:11,270
- sound like a real person.
- It is.

736
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,038
Katherine and I are a lot alike,

737
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:15,206
that's true.

738
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:16,331
But Dana

739
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:19,858
gives me something more.
She inspires me.

740
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,091
She's proud of who she is.

741
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,886
That's who I want to be.
That's who I want to be with.

742
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,934
Is that from
Adventures in Babysitting ?

743
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,394
It's not from anything.
That's how I feel.

744
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,856
But I already left Dana
a message breaking our date.

745
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,475
It's too late.

746
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,320
Maybe... not yet.

747
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,739
I have one more movie idea.

748
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:47,908
Come on.

749
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:07,682
Moi ?

750
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:20,245
So I guess you heard.

751
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,026
I'm so sorry, Cap.

752
00:39:23,855 --> 00:39:27,655
You know, looking back at the past day,
all the signs were there.

753
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,535
They weren't making out in front
of me nearly as much as usual.

754
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:40,252
I'm sorry if I made
everything worse.

755
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:43,714
But there's something
I want to talk to you about.

756
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:46,239
I'm really not in the mood
right now...

757
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:47,092
Wait.

758
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,677
Just listen, okay ?

759
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,600
I'm sorry I tried to change you.

760
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,323
I won't do that anymore.

761
00:39:57,968 --> 00:39:59,399
I can accept you,

762
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,883
just the way you are.

763
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:06,653
What about graduation ?
And May ?

764
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,739
We'll worry about that in May.

765
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,826
Dana Stockwell !

766
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:24,212
Crap.

767
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,632
We forgot the Peter Gabriel. See
if you can find something on the radio.

768
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:39,170
It's Rusty !

769
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:43,194
I made a mistake

770
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:46,655
and I'm really, really sorry !

771
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,621
We are back and now
with the weather...

772
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,906
- If you're there.
- Who're you Lloyd-Doblering ?

773
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:55,035
You.
Didn't you get my message ?

774
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:58,533
- Yeah. About captions ? I agree.
- What ?

775
00:40:58,658 --> 00:41:01,514
There was a lot of static,
but you said we needed to talk ?

776
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,710
It sounded like you like...
captions ?

777
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,047
I assumed you meant for the written
report for the grant project.

778
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,022
The...

779
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:10,509
Yes. That is what I meant.

780
00:41:11,224 --> 00:41:12,928
Captions will make

781
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,294
the illustrations so much clearer !

782
00:41:16,327 --> 00:41:18,767
Did you need to talk to me
about anything else ?

783
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:22,127
No.

784
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,489
That's the moment.

785
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,974
- Hey, Ash.
- Hey, happy camper !

786
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,800
Oh no, it was that bad ?

787
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:56,544
We... camped.
We ate. We talked.

788
00:41:56,825 --> 00:41:58,819
There was flute-playing.

789
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:01,042
And I finally woke up.

790
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,858
In a tent, right ?

791
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,708
Was it really uncomfortable ?

792
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:10,743
It was surprisingly comfortable
once I let go.

793
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,557
So, how are things with Cappie ?

794
00:42:15,946 --> 00:42:17,881
Well, we're not fighting anymore.

795
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,324
Great.

796
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:23,900
This whole time I've been trying so hard
to get him to wake up and face reality.

797
00:42:24,464 --> 00:42:27,055
But really, it was me...

798
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,588
who needed to face reality.

799
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,298
What do you mean ?

800
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:38,396
Cappie and I aren't

801
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:40,378
built to last, Ash.

802
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:42,818
We work here,

803
00:42:43,111 --> 00:42:44,319
in college.

804
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,480
And I don't think
we'll work anywhere else.

805
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,648
No.

806
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,101
You can make it work.
There's...

807
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:54,046
There's gotta be like,
a movie, or something.

808
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,365
Why did I put all my Dvds away ?
Where's St. Elmo's Fire ?

809
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,794
No, it's okay.
It's okay, Ash.

810
00:43:00,851 --> 00:43:02,287
I'm okay with it.

811
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:06,342
Cappie and I aren't a movie.

812
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:09,628
We're a short story.

813
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:13,005
But a really good one.
