1
00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:03,001
You really aren't clear
on the meaning of "no."

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:04,663
But I'm very good with yes.

3
00:00:04,788 --> 00:00:06,630
As in: "yes, tomorrow
night sounds great."

4
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:08,882
I thought if the two of
you could be friends again,

5
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:11,326
then maybe we could all go back
to the way things used to be.

6
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:13,779
We can't go back, but maybe
all three of us can

7
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:15,472
try to move forward together.

8
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:19,227
Get off!

9
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,825
Look at those jackasses.

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,568
We should go finish
what they started.

11
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:25,134
Easy, bro, easy, bro. Come on.

12
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,734
Zbz is constantly embroiled
in some kind of turmoil,

13
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,714
and no one likes
a dysfunctional drama case.

14
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,781
I would say zbz is ranked Fourth?

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,698
- Fourth?
- It's all part of the cycle.

16
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,031
If it really is a cycle,
then it's too late, right?

17
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:37,206
It's like fate.

18
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,497
As seniors,
we have to fight this cycle.

19
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,529
The truth is we're
not number one anymore.

20
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:43,412
We were hoping to
throw some killer mixers

21
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:45,244
and eventually have the best rush

22
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:46,940
this campus has ever seen.

23
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:49,574
I hate putt-putt.

24
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:53,064
And cute golf
attire is beyond even my powers.

25
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,995
Just keep smiling. We don't want

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,247
The sisters to figure out
how much this mixer sucks.

27
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,203
This mixer sucks.
I think they know.

28
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:02,332
It's 9:00am. On a thursday.

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,312
I should be asleep.
Nicole's asleep.

30
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,903
I can't even flirt with
the seven pi sigmas who

31
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:14,452
bothered to show up because
I have coffee breath.

32
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,686
They're not paying
attention to us anyway.

33
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:21,405
I remember the days when all
they wanted to hump was us.

34
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,290
I hate not being number one anymore.

35
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,160
I thought you were going to get us
out of this, president ashleigh.

36
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,760
I know our social
schedule isn't what it was,

37
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,938
but things are looking up.

38
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:33,559
And I'm working on
getting our prime table

39
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:35,312
at dobler's back from gamma psi.

40
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:36,459
We lost our table?

41
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:39,305
And may I remind you we had
a pinning ceremony last week?

42
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,544
Heather got pinned to
jeremy from kappa tau.

43
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:42,977
Hardly good news.

44
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,602
You sound like my parents!

45
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,048
I heard a few sisters
talking about de-activating.

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,264
One of them might've been me.

47
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:54,142
Fore!

48
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:56,621
But...

49
00:01:57,947 --> 00:01:59,535
But they haven't
heard the best part!

50
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,781
We are having a mixer this saturday.

51
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,059
At night.

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,416
With omega chi.

53
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,762
- We are?!
- Yeah, remember?

54
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:10,532
You and evan are
such good friends now

55
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:13,203
and you guys were talking about
how you missed the houses mixing

56
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:15,705
and came up with the idea?
It was brilliant!

57
00:02:16,076 --> 00:02:16,998
We did.

58
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:21,098
And they can't wait.
Omega chi and zbz, reunited

59
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:22,892
and it feels so good.

60
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,436
And you decided not
to tell us until now?

61
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,729
That's what makes it a surprise!

62
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,650
It's like our reintroduction
into the social top-ti

63
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,796
and I'll be in charge of making
our pledges hump-able again!

64
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,362
You should be thanking me.

65
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:48,063
We have three days to
pull off our reintroduction

66
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:51,333
into the social top-tier with
a mixer that doesn't exist?

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,917
Look at the happy faces
on all the children.

68
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,331
They're finally not
looking at me like

69
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,012
they want to kill me in my sleep.

70
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:09,257
What's up, guys?

71
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,321
New drinking game.

72
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,505
Every time jeremy snores...

73
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:24,453
- we drink.
- It's harder than it looks.

74
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,872
You have to stop drinking
at the end of the snore.

75
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,621
Or you get penalized.

76
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:33,170
You just said "penalized."

77
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,855
I Miss you guys.

78
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,127
Where did you go?

79
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,139
Oh, god...

80
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:41,191
Did you learn how to manipulate
space and time

81
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,592
so you could disappear
without us noticing?

82
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:45,508
I knew you could do that!

83
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:48,469
I might be a little bit buzzed.

84
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,863
Yeah, I've been so busy
with so much crap lately.

85
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:54,471
School, man, is so tough,
ex-girlfriend trouble...

86
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,159
I'm just in the mood to be
with my boys and cut loose!

87
00:03:57,964 --> 00:03:59,775
You're on the moon
right now, aren't you?

88
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,878
You're a hologram.

89
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,408
You're so buzzed.

90
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,002
Is cappie upstair?

91
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,158
It's your little bro.

92
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:27,303
Naked.

93
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:29,517
Get out of here, perv.

94
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,042
Greek 308

95
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,552
Greek Team

96
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:44,831
Fore!

97
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:47,546
We get it.
We're ranked number four.

98
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,095
No need to rub it in.

99
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,975
I think he was trying
to make a golf joke.

100
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,972
Some people appreciate
my sense of humor.

101
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:54,608
Some people appreciate crocs.

102
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:57,212
We had a golf mixer with pi sigma.

103
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,341
The old putt-putt blow-off?

104
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,643
We did the same thing
last year to tri-pi

105
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:05,260
after their president dumped dino.

106
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:07,885
Exactly. Which is why we need you

107
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,521
guys to invite us
to a mixer this saturday night.

108
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:13,360
- Do you guys have plans?
- Nothing set in stone.

109
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:15,855
We were thinking about
having a low-key weekend.

110
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,025
Think again,

111
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,443
because we're giving you
a chance to mix with zbz!

112
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,871
In the spirit of
reuniting old friends.

113
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:24,453
It would really mean a lot to
our house during a rough time.

114
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,159
Please, please, please!

115
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:34,416
Great! One more thing.

116
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,928
We kinda need you guys
to formally invite us,

117
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,449
tonight during dinner.

118
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:40,456
Maybe you could throw
in a little serenade?

119
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,968
- You don't have to...
- The girls will expect it!

120
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,717
No worries i would do it.

121
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:47,765
Awesome!

122
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,843
- Thanks, evan. See you tonight.
- All right.

123
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,267
And, watch out for those sand traps!

124
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,935
That wasn't funny at all.

125
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,427
- Thanks, case!
- No problem.

126
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:08,236
It was an accident.

127
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,899
It seems as
though you saw milady naked.

128
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,123
There's only one way to
restore the power balance. Come on,

129
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,084
drop trou.

130
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:19,480
He's right.

131
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:21,265
It's only fair.

132
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,085
Let's see the goods.

133
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:26,864
I'm really sorry.

134
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,513
Oh, my god, I'm not
at my breast right now.

135
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,229
- "Best?"
- Right!

136
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,045
And I came here to blow off
some steam with my big bro!

137
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,755
There's no one better to
do that with than cappie.

138
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,509
We're actually on our way
out to get something to eat.

139
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,982
- You should come with.
- I don't want to intrude.

140
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:44,734
No, don't worry about it.

141
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,656
I think I left my backpack upstairs.

142
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,656
Why don't you go get it?

143
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:53,400
Hurry up,

144
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:55,375
you don't wanna
be late for our threesome.

145
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,419
How cute is he?!

146
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,298
I'm on board with the threesome,

147
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,496
I just didn't think it
was gonna be with spitter.

148
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,614
He's so sweet and innocent.
I can't wait to corrupt him.

149
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:12,075
That's just what I thought
when I first met him.

150
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,675
Again: can you just assure me we're
not having sex with spitter tonight?

151
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,479
What would you say

152
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,555
if I told you that grant and I think
we're ready to tell the house?

153
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,138
I'd say go for it, man.

154
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:24,202
The guys love you and
the guys love grant.

155
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,659
Why should that change when you
tell them you love each other?

156
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:28,078
"Like" each other.

157
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:30,523
And that's what I'm
worried about. It's change.

158
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:33,001
People don't always
react well to change.

159
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,419
I'm assuming that's
why you told griffin

160
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:37,304
you joined the treble
makers acapella group

161
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:39,622
when he saw you in
your pink bow-tie.

162
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:42,628
Maybe we're over-thinking all this.

163
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:45,798
Maybe sexual orientation
and socio-economic status

164
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,591
aren't that big a deal in
the world. People are people.

165
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,328
Yeah, you know what?

166
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,994
This is only a big deal
if we make it a big deal.

167
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:55,432
We have the power.

168
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,402
Maybe you go first?

169
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,571
No, you've been gay way
longer than I've been broke.

170
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:02,044
You're up first.

171
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:06,090
Do you have a lot
of parking tickets?

172
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:08,767
I can't afford to. Why?

173
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,981
Forget to pay your bill, chambers?

174
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,148
And apparently you can't
cover a lease payment

175
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:21,994
with dobler's drink coupons.

176
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,500
And it looks like my
secret's coming out first.

177
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:33,335
Irish car bomb!

178
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,770
- Your turn, rusty.
- I'm underage.

179
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,732
He's not exactly good with
liquor. Hence the nickname, "spitter."

180
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,598
But he's not spitter tonight.
He's rowdy rusty.

181
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,125
Rowdy rusty.
All right, I love it!

182
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:54,021
You don't have to do this,
spitter, if you don't want to.

183
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,246
Go!

184
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:03,183
All right.

185
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,377
You did it!

186
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,162
Sort of.

187
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,123
Yeah. Good job, spitter.

188
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:13,382
Excuse me, rowdy rusty.

189
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:14,635
Now what?

190
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,639
No, I think that's quite
enough for one evening, rowdy.

191
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:20,578
Or...

192
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:23,268
See our waiter over
there ignoring us?

193
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:27,080
We asked for our check,
like, 30 minutes ago.

194
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,413
What a douche bag, right?

195
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,278
You want me to say something to him?

196
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,858
"Excuse me, pal, where's our check?"

197
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,950
We're going to dine and dash.

198
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,784
Spitter's not gonna dine and dash.

199
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,874
And as a member of the food
services industry yourself,

200
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,149
you should be sensitive to
the fact that this poor guy

201
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:46,092
probably works here three...

202
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,912
Wait up!

203
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,770
I'm sure most of you
guys have figured out,

204
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,266
I gave up my trust fund.

205
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,730
It is a really personal
situation with my family

206
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:09,358
but it's nice to know
my brothers have my back.

207
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:11,674
Even if I'm gonna have
to start hitting you up

208
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,520
for beer money from now on.

209
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,263
So any new business?

210
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,536
What's with this zbz mixer?

211
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,109
It's this saturday...

212
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:25,879
I know all that.
But why are we going?

213
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,895
Aren't they all about
mixing with those

214
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,885
kt losers this semester?

215
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:33,965
Yeah, that's true but come on...

216
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,510
- And this year, they kinda suck.
- And it's not like they're gamma psi.

217
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,929
And last year, they
dissed our pref invite.

218
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,306
I think we should go.
The girls could use our help.

219
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,600
They just want our help
so they can climb back up.

220
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,230
We're doing the mixer
because I said we are.

221
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,329
I'm president and it's done.

222
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:52,502
We know you've done half the girls

223
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,307
in that house, but that's no reason

224
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,368
the rest of us have to
waste a saturday on them.

225
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:59,393
Watch your mouth, trip.
You're way out of line.

226
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:02,035
I say we put the mixer to a vote.

227
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:19,512
As pledge class president,

228
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,928
I would like to formally
report that we are super excited

229
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,616
about the omega chi mixer!
Thanks for making that happen!

230
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:25,831
Just doing my job.

231
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:27,874
When are they officially
going to invite us?

232
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,754
- Any minute now!
- Great.

233
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:33,501
I hope it's any minute. Can you
ask fisher to hold on dessert?

234
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,447
He's already kept them
waiting 20 minutes!

235
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,822
They're sorority girls.
They can deal with hunger pangs.

236
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,946
Fine.

237
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,517
Sit up straight.
Shoulders back. Boobs out.

238
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:45,556
And heather, unbutton
your shirt a little.

239
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,252
It might as well be a turtleneck.

240
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:49,822
Why do I have to learn how to flirt?
I already have a boyfriend.

241
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:52,937
Not a good one. And this isn't
about finding a boyfriend.

242
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,804
This is for the sisterhood.

243
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:57,081
Saturday night we want to
leave the omega chis dying

244
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,613
for another mixer with
us as soon as possible.

245
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,599
We're set to starve the
girls for 20 more minutes.

246
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,759
Now where is...

247
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,479
everyone,

248
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:15,312
i'm sure this man needs no introduction,
and as for his brothers.

249
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:18,804
As for his brothers...

250
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,516
Actually it's just me.

251
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:23,075
Let's just get on with it.

252
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:26,000
Can I talk to you for a second?

253
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:30,164
Evan's just shy.

254
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:32,921
Cheesecake! Now!

255
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,070
What's going on?

256
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:41,753
I'm sorry, but the mixer's
not going to happen.

257
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:44,095
I really tried, but the brothers,
they voted it down.

258
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,471
What? Why?

259
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:47,150
They brought up last year's pref,

260
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:51,015
about how you guys dissed us, they
said zbz's just not a big draw anymore.

261
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,271
And you're not exactly gamma psi?

262
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:56,031
You're their president.
It's a party.

263
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:58,178
Order them to party with
a group of hot chicks.

264
00:12:58,303 --> 00:12:59,434
That's just it, Due to

265
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,465
a weird situation that's
recently come up in the house,

266
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,616
some of the guys have
been questioning me.

267
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:08,530
Why would they do that?
You're evan freaking chambers!

268
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,446
Yeah, it's funny you would say that.

269
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,662
Here's the deal.

270
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:14,459
I gave up my trust fund.

271
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,545
I didn't want
my parents controlling my life.

272
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,194
I haven't spoken to them
since. I'm broke.

273
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:22,681
So much for evan chambers.

274
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,132
- Seriously?
- I know, I'm an idiot.

275
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:28,723
It's probably the biggest
mistake of my entire life.

276
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,601
No, it's the bravest
thing you've ever done.

277
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,893
I can't believe it.

278
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:35,745
I'm so proud of you.

279
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,583
I wish some of the brothers
reacted the same way.

280
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,674
But coinciding with me not being

281
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,591
a "chambers" anymore, I
seem to have lost

282
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:46,247
a lot of my influence on them.

283
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:48,481
I'm sorry, but the mixer's off.

284
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:52,838
The girls took down that
cheesecake like coyotes on road kill.

285
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,117
What's going on with the mixer?

286
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:03,592
What do we tell the girls?

287
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,377
Their sugar
is gonna start wearing off

288
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,096
and they'll be demanding answers.
We can't say the mixer's off.

289
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,716
I just keep thinking
about what evan did.

290
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,877
Giving up all that money
on principle and then being

291
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,772
shunned by his own parents?
That must be so hard for him.

292
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,078
He's always felt the weight
of the chambers name.

293
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,843
I remember that being a dilemma.

294
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:22,171
But still, to actually
give it all up like that?

295
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:25,311
- I don't think i'd be able to do that.
- Oh, my god, snap out of it!

296
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,832
We're supposed to be figuring out how to
salvage the party here!

297
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:31,120
What's there to figure out?
There's nothing we can do.

298
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,537
We're not gamma psi.

299
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:35,689
What if we get gamma psi?

300
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,177
We make the mixer a four-pack.

301
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,593
Us, omega chi, gamma
psi, probably lambda sig.

302
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,933
And not just any
four-pack: a super-fancy

303
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,340
semi-formal four-pack!

304
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,514
Where we have champagne,
a band, twinkle lights!

305
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,220
- In three days?
- We have the founders' day money.

306
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,592
But why would we even want
to party with the gamma psis?

307
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:53,341
They stole our table at dobler's.

308
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,213
And apparently our social life.

309
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:56,770
Besides, they're kind of weird.

310
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,342
It doesn't matter if they're
serial killers. They're number one.

311
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:02,319
If we get them, we get the guys.
It worked for janet gunderson.

312
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:05,272
Your dorky friend with the
mono-brow in seventh grade?

313
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,354
She befriended me and became
popular by association.

314
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,836
Then I introduced her
to tweezers and she stolen my boyfriend.

315
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:13,348
See, it's perfect!
We are janet gunderson.

316
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:15,001
The gamma psis are 12-year-old me.

317
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:16,878
And we become number
one by association.

318
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,251
I don't think that's how it works.

319
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,430
What other options do I have?

320
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:23,895
You're the president.

321
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:31,068
I'm so hung over
and I don't even care!

322
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:33,027
Last night was amazing.

323
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:35,126
I did things I never
thought I would do.

324
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:36,786
You're not hung over.

325
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:38,564
- It's not spitter anymore.
- I know.

326
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,176
From the small amount of irish car
you managed to imbibe,

327
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,728
you're gassy from
the carbonation at best.

328
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:48,359
Fine. Maybe I didn't
succeed at the drinking,

329
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,865
- but I did do a dashing dine!
- It's "dine-and-dash."

330
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,325
Boys! I hate to interrupt
your girlish squabble,

331
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:55,975
but predators of
the deep is back on.

332
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:59,671
I've never watched so many
episodes of one tv show

333
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:02,948
since thatjoan of arcadia
marathon with my parents.

334
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,435
Did I say parents?

335
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,300
I meant my friends.

336
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:10,175
My cool friends.

337
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:12,625
And it was porn.

338
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,889
Don't you have art
history in ten minutes?

339
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:17,751
I was gonna head to women's studies.
We can walk together.

340
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,993
And don't you have a bar
mitzvah to work tonight?

341
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:22,794
I called in sick. And you guys shouldn't
be going to class either.

342
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,666
The next episode is killer whales.

343
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,270
- You can't Miss that!
- Killer whales!

344
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:30,212
- It's on.
- Like donkey kong! Jinx!

345
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,286
I just figured out why you two
are so perfect for each other!

346
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,609
She's like the lady
version of you. Lady cappie!

347
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:45,153
I'd like to think of you
as the male version of me.

348
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,192
She's a keeper.

349
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,810
She's a none of your other girlfriends
would blow off work for

350
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:52,677
predators of the deep.
Just don't screw it up.

351
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:57,830
That whale just ate that whole seal.

352
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,156
What was up with you
in yesterday's meeting?

353
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,137
Backing up j.p. And trip like that.

354
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:10,432
Since when did you
become so anti-kt?

355
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,389
I just think they're kind of obnoxious.
As do most of our brothers.

356
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:16,470
You're clearly biased
because of "that rusty."

357
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,073
"That rusty" is my best friend.

358
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:21,265
And evan's been a really
good friend to me, too.

359
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,621
He's been through a real
tough time lately, I just...

360
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:25,917
I don't think he needs all
that crap from the house.

361
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,699
It wasn't personal.

362
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:29,821
I'm sure it felt that way to him.

363
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,061
I just feel bad.

364
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,057
He's been so supportive of us
coming out soon, like we talked about.

365
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,050
Actually...

366
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:42,813
I've been thinking.

367
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,940
Things are good the way they are.

368
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:50,807
So sneaking around,

369
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:53,824
and coming up with excuses
why we're always together?

370
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,897
You don't think that's
holding us back?

371
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:58,736
I really like our
relationship how it is.

372
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:02,101
Besides, seeing the way
everyone gossips about evan,

373
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:05,108
I really don't want
to go through that.

374
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,101
Guess what?
I stole you a dining hall muffin!

375
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:24,910
What are you doing here?

376
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:26,891
Booktacular-ing.

377
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:28,665
We're readingeat,
pray, love this week

378
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,664
and thought we'd do
a little of all three.

379
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:34,050
I'm opting to partake in just the
eat part. Not that I don't love you.

380
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:36,156
What are you doing stealing
dining hall muffins?

381
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,901
- You know that's frowned upon.
- Don't you have a date with lana?

382
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:42,673
I did, but I've been rescheduling
shamelessly on daley here,

383
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,158
I really needed to make it up to him.
Sparkling cider?

384
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:48,626
It's non-alcoholic but the fizzies
get up your nose and it's fun.

385
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:52,583
You're just gonna blow her off?

386
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,583
It's not like she's
never flaked on me.

387
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,518
Our first date she kept
me waiting while

388
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:59,008
she prank-phone called her old boss.

389
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,553
For two hours.

390
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,628
Excuse me. I have to go
relieve some cider fizzies.

391
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:12,902
That girl is amazing
and he's flaking on her?!

392
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:15,008
He's gonna drive her away.

393
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,736
Is lana really worth
all the trouble?

394
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:20,670
Oh, my god, she's the most
amazing girl I've ever met.

395
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,833
For him, for cappie.

396
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:26,140
If she's so perfect for him,
why would he blow her off?

397
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,484
It's obvious! He's scared of
how much that he likes her.

398
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,544
But you know he'll never admit it.

399
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,631
I think we're gonna
have to go see lana

400
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,249
about this situation.

401
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,099
You're friends with cappie.
You're broke.

402
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,404
Any other secrets
you want to reveal?

403
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:49,478
I have a job that requires
me to wear a pink bow-tie.

404
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,536
Stripping at the other
gentleman's choice?

405
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:55,578
No, actually that probably
pays much, much more.

406
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,169
I'm a cater-waiter.

407
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,281
I have no car, I can't
pay my house dues.

408
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,281
I can't pay my house dues.

409
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,826
I should grovel to my parents
and get my trust fund back.

410
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:05,620
You can't start doubting
yourself now.

411
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,785
You did the right thing.
As your friend, I will help you.

412
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:11,906
- We'll figure it out.
- Well, can you help me figure out

413
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:13,926
how to get these guys
to take me seriously again?

414
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:16,776
Because apparently the only title
they care about is Chambers.

415
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,633
To think I believed that these guys

416
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,469
were doing what their president said
because they respected me.

417
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,883
Well, you know what?
Screw them.

418
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:28,017
- Just because a few jerks...
- A few is enough to make a difference.

419
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,146
So make a name for yourself that
has nothing to do with your parents.

420
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:32,814
Or their money.

421
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,066
You have friends
who really care about you.

422
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,611
I said coquette, not spastic.

423
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,393
Melanie, you look like
you're smuggling something.

424
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:46,396
This was on the porch!

425
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:49,038
It's from Natalie,
the Gamma Psi president!

426
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,290
There's a note, too!

427
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,628
Casey, can I see you in our room?

428
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:59,549
It's OK, Case. Presidential orders.

429
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:01,301
We'll talk more later?

430
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,440
"Thank you for thinking of Gamma Psi
in regard to this weekend's four-pack.

431
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:14,036
We regret to inform you
that we have a prior commitment.

432
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,590
But please consider Gamma Psi
in the future.

433
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:18,985
XoXo. Sisters in solidarity.

434
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,111
Gamma Psi."

435
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:24,046
You have to stop.
That's your fourth.

436
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:27,076
Then stop rereading the letter!
It's not gonna change their answer!

437
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:29,746
Plus, I'm eating the evidence.

438
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,740
There's no point
in eating the evidence.

439
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,480
The sisters will know we're not having
a four-pack if we don't have one!

440
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:39,161
We've been rejected twice.
We have to accept it.

441
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,593
No, we've been rejected twice
and no one can know about it!

442
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:45,678
The whole school knows about this party!
I hired a photographer to take pictures.

443
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:48,283
Pictures that will be
memorialized in hardback.

444
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:49,849
The yearbook, Casey!

445
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:54,437
Is Abby hiding in here?
She's late for her lesson

446
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,398
on how to drink seductively
from both a cup and a bottle.

447
00:21:58,115 --> 00:21:59,484
You'd better go find her then,

448
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,861
because this party is proceeding
as planned!

449
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,331
I can't be the one responsible
for running this house into the ground.

450
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:15,967
You're not responsible for running
this house into the ground.

451
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,169
It's the cycle, or fate or whatever.

452
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,381
Girls might deactivate if I don't do
something. This four-pack has to happen.

453
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,722
Please help me.

454
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:30,098
Let's make this work.
The Gamma Psis are reasonable girls.

455
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,350
They're so nice,
it's almost disgusting.

456
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,992
So if we appeal to them woman-to-woman,
lay our cards on the table,

457
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,563
maybe we can get them
to change their minds.

458
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:39,232
OK. That sounds good.

459
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,286
You could talk to Katherine.
She's a Gamma Psi,

460
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:43,861
maybe you can play
the panhellenic-solidarity card.

461
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:48,449
It's one thing for me
to ask Evan for a favor,

462
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,904
but I don't want to drag my brand-new
relationship with Katherine into this,

463
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:55,456
especially since I'm hoping she will
give me this panhellenic board position.

464
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,085
Let's take it straight to Natalie.

465
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,650
I also want to know
where they got these cupcakes from.

466
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:04,549
Because they're really good.

467
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,388
- Hey, it's Rusty...
- Seriously, Rusty?

468
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:12,657
You have to be planning this.

469
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:18,884
What are you doing here?

470
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:21,315
I know something happened
with Cappie.

471
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,286
I think I'm kind of done with him.

472
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:27,148
- Jackass blew me off.
- No, wait! That might be my fault.

473
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:29,050
I told him that joke

474
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,909
about how he shouldn't blow it
because you're so perfect for him.

475
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,327
That freaked him out.

476
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:38,166
- I don't date guys with issues.
- Someone without a college degree

477
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,761
shouldn't be so choosy.

478
00:23:40,757 --> 00:23:42,378
- Who is this?
- Please!

479
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:46,799
Can you give him another chance?

480
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,302
This isn't exactly a mystery, Rusty.

481
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:52,746
When a guy starts breaking dates
with you after things get physical,

482
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,099
it means he just wanted to hook-up.

483
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:03,137
I have a wedding

484
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,557
between a labradoodle
and a shih-tzu to cater.

485
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,301
Sorry, Rowdy.

486
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,218
It's cool.

487
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:19,296
She's all right.

488
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:22,037
I mean, Sheila had
a way better rack.

489
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:32,042
So did you hear we might be having
a four-pack with Gamma Psi this weekend?

490
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:35,082
You and Grant gonna go together?

491
00:24:36,614 --> 00:24:39,250
Yeah, I guess,
the same way we always go together.

492
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,687
Pretending like we're not together.

493
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,581
Maybe you should just go together.

494
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:45,471
Like for real this time.

495
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:49,711
Because, you're planning on telling
the brothers at some point, right?

496
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:54,628
What is this about?

497
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:58,517
All anyone can talk about is
how I gave up my trust fund.

498
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,332
Or they're questioning
everything I do, like Trip.

499
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,134
Trip's still pissed off about
how hard you hazed him during hell week.

500
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:05,746
I wouldn't take it personally.

501
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,570
Maybe I would.
But what are you saying?

502
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:11,634
That we should come out
so they'll talk about us instead?

503
00:25:13,215 --> 00:25:15,304
It sounds kind of obnoxious
if you put it that way.

504
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,389
Kind of.

505
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:19,160
But since you want
to come out anyway...

506
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:26,016
I don't know what I want to do.
But it's up to me to figure it out, OK?

507
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,489
ZBZs, what are you guys doing here?

508
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:48,173
You know, the usual:
chatting about global politics, and,

509
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:51,403
- a house-related leisure issue...
- We need to talk to Natalie about

510
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:54,491
- the world's most awesome four-pack!
- That too.

511
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:57,471
- We know about your prior commitment...
- There's no prior commitment.

512
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,514
That is what Natalie tells people
whom she doesn't want to mix with.

513
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:02,775
Did she send you
the little frowny-face cupcakes?

514
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:08,191
We were just wondering
if there was a chance you would

515
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,359
put in a word for us
about her changing her mind?

516
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,813
That's Natalie's ouevre.
I don't really do leisure issues, so...

517
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:16,415
Good luck.

518
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:21,245
What bakery did she get
those cupcakes... from?

519
00:26:23,452 --> 00:26:25,223
You liked the cupcakes?

520
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:26,806
I made them myself.

521
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:28,878
Secret ingredient:
a little bit of love!

522
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:32,839
What an honor to get a visit
from my two favorite ZBZs!

523
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:37,553
The honor is all ours! We're so bummed
to hear about your prior commitment.

524
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,931
Especially since it apparently
doesn't exist?

525
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:43,851
I was trying to spare your feelings.
I was being polite.

526
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:47,730
I didn't want ZBZ to spend that money
when I know my girls aren't gonna go.

527
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,926
- They wouldn't show up?
- Our gals are pretty selective.

528
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,393
They're always wondering,
"What's in it for Gamma Psi?"

529
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:56,781
The political stuff gives me
a tummy-ache, but what can you do?

530
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,907
You're fourth.

531
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:01,869
- Then, I guess there's no...
- There's got to be something we can do!

532
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:05,747
Anything! Do you guys
need a favor of some kind?

533
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,709
Like doing our laundry or something?
Paying our electric bill?

534
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,036
- No way.
- OK.

535
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,379
What? Really?

536
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,176
Yes. The electric bill.

537
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,632
Ash! We can't...

538
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,812
I got this.

539
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,636
We'll pay your electric bill
until the end of the school year.

540
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:19,971
What do you say?

541
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:21,931
What a generous offer.

542
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:28,104
And of course you will make sure
all your sisters show up tonight?

543
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,358
Of course.

544
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,445
And we can keep this little exchange

545
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:33,192
- between us?
- Of course.

546
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,547
Chocolate bunny?

547
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:54,227
Thank you for your service.
I salute you.

548
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:04,369
I knew it.
I knew you loved her!

549
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:08,144
Don't startle a man in a strip club.
What if I'd been in lap-dance position?

550
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,772
- How'd you know I was here?
- Beaver told me you were here.

551
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,652
This is an unclean place.
You shouldn't be here.

552
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,905
I have a friend and I want
to introduce you to.

553
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,323
His name is Jesus,
and he pays much greater dividends

554
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:24,327
than those dollar bills
in your underpants.

555
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:32,482
Why are you blowing Lana off? We talked,
and she's ready to give up on you.

556
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:34,378
- You talked?
- Yes. She had her shirt off.

557
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:37,715
That doesn't matter!
I know you're in love with her

558
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,880
and you can't stand it
or else you wouldn't be here.

559
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:43,095
You only come here
when your heart's broken.

560
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,306
I'm here because
I want to be around girls

561
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,099
no more complex than strippers,

562
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,821
who are really just nice girls
with bad dads.

563
00:28:50,973 --> 00:28:53,248
Tell me about your father.
Was he bad?

564
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,983
Because I have a very good father
I'd like to talk to you about.

565
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:00,071
This is what you do.

566
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:03,721
You did it with Casey because you were
scared you guys were too different.

567
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:06,369
But lady Cappie
is never going to give you

568
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:09,038
a hard time about the things
that make you.

569
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,625
And that's why I couldn't
let you do this.

570
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:14,794
Spitter, what did you do?

571
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,413
The name's Rowdy.

572
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,798
Rowdy takes matters
into his own hands.

573
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,321
She's here to give you another chance.
Hey, Lana.

574
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,763
Listen closely, spitter:
I don't want another chance...

575
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,937
Really? You don't like her?

576
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:52,655
This looks amazing!

577
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:56,085
Totally A-, very last minute.

578
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,769
With these lampy light things,
I hope we're not paying OC's bill, too.

579
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:01,936
I did what I had to do.

580
00:30:02,644 --> 00:30:06,058
And see, the yearbook photographer
is documenting all of it for posterity.

581
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:08,873
Oh, my god, is that a caricaturist!?

582
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:13,358
Look, I'm on the moon!

583
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,390
It's classy because it's art.

584
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:20,168
And he was also half-off
with the ice sculptures.

585
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:23,056
Ice sculptures? The founders'
day money is supposed to last us

586
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:25,517
- through next year's rush.
- But that's next year.

587
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:28,152
- This will get us back on top now.
- When I said you weren't running

588
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:29,910
this hous into the ground?
I was wrong

589
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,493
I'm the one everyone's gonna blame
if we start losing sisters.

590
00:30:32,618 --> 00:30:35,124
You asked me for help and then you
don't listen to my advice!

591
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,868
I'm the president. I have to do what
I think is right.

592
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,083
I'm going to go greet
gamma psi's president.

593
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:56,645
So, Tim, lacrosse sounds like
an interesting sport.

594
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,440
- What position do you play?
- Mid-fielder.

595
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:01,358
That's awesome.

596
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:02,651
See you around.

597
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,158
What was that?You have
something against mid-fielders?

598
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,294
You said leave them wanting more.

599
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,786
And I have a boyfriend!

600
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,377
This is how you leave them
wanting more. Watch.

601
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:33,724
You really wear a suit.
Most guys can't.

602
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:36,894
What are you doing?

603
00:31:44,608 --> 00:31:50,032
Sorry! Um, I was teaching the pledges
how to flirt. That was a demonstration

604
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:53,827
Great job.

605
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,572
Come on, heather, let's go

606
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:01,460
find another guy for you.

607
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:09,342
I don't know what's taking
them so long at the bar.

608
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:13,027
- I'm gonna go ask.
- No, wait, wait...

609
00:32:13,152 --> 00:32:14,916
Look how talented these girls are.

610
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:16,568
And limber.

611
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:18,686
What are they, cats?

612
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,128
Sure.

613
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:24,505
If you wanted to break up with her,
why didn't you just tell her?

614
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,155
Hey, I was doing the immature guy thing
where I blow her off and wait for her

615
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,107
to get the hint. It's worked for men for
thousands of years, because their friend

616
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:34,577
don't usually intervene
and screw it all up.

617
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,830
You sure you're not just driving her
away because you love her too much?

618
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:41,000
I think you love her too much.
I barely know her.

619
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:44,931
There is something.

620
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:47,841
I think I want someone a little less
flaky.

621
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,383
She's like you.

622
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:54,847
You see yourself reflected in her,
and don't like what you see.

623
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,558
- Are you growing up?
- You shut your damn mouth!

624
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,311
Cappie, if I can get rowdy,
then you can...

625
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:03,686
You guys having fun?

626
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,568
So far ten girls are coming with me
to bible study next week.

627
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,361
Or I just became their new pimp.

628
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:13,485
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

629
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:17,244
I'm not a dumbass. I know you
don't want me here.

630
00:33:20,697 --> 00:33:21,365
Wait.

631
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:24,001
I'm sorry.
Can you just tell her the truth?

632
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,685
No touching the girls.

633
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:30,132
Excuse me...

634
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,927
Viper. This is a misunderstanding.
She's not a girl.

635
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:33,969
Not a girl?

636
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,218
You're saying strippers
aren't real people?

637
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:38,015
I got news for you,

638
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,347
these women

639
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:41,366
are somebody's daughters.

640
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:44,730
Or mothers. Heck, I got a grandmother
here.

641
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,150
You better think about that,
pipsqueak.

642
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:49,860
The name's rowdy rusty.

643
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,029
Uh, rus, I wouldn't.
He's really...

644
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,783
And I'm not scared of your
pierced things and your tattoos.

645
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,571
Katherine? You're leaving?

646
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:11,423
My policy on parties is
basicaly a five-minute walk-through, but

647
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,192
I rather enjoyed the caricaturist
and thought he captured my likeness,

648
00:34:14,317 --> 00:34:16,041
so I stayed a little bit longer.

649
00:34:26,796 --> 00:34:28,990
You're lucky ZBZ paid
for an open bar.

650
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,653
Hey, trip, you're lucky you ever got
into omega chi in the first place.

651
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,056
Looks like you need a drink
as badly as I do.

652
00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:43,281
Oh, I am the talk of the party.

653
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:46,337
I didn't know how good I had it when
people were nice to me because of

654
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:47,334
my last name.

655
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:51,431
I don't even think i'd be omega chi
president if I weren't a chambers.

656
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:53,857
You have to give yourself
more credit.

657
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:57,761
And if it makes you feel any better, ZBZ
is going to be more broke than you are

658
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,909
by the end of this party.
What was ashleigh thinking?

659
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:06,118
She was thinking about how it feel being
president who's losing control of house

660
00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:08,225
Take it from me,

661
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:10,375
it can make you do some really
crazy things.

662
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,080
But it's the responsibility of
the president to have a cool head

663
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:16,155
and to do what's best for the house

664
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,824
But you're forgetting how it feels
to have that much responsibility.

665
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:22,446
Especially in a crisis when
it's your ass on the line.

666
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,458
I guess I'm still trying to figure out
how to be the president's best friend.

667
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:33,328
Cheers to that.

668
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:43,292
I just love caricatures, don't you?

669
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:47,352
Oh, my god, I totally love caricatures!
I knew it was a good idea!

670
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,332
Can I talk with you for a minute?

671
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:51,611
Not right now.

672
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:55,573
Natalie and I were just talking about
how much we love caricatures.

673
00:35:55,698 --> 00:35:58,781
Yes. But you two talk.
We're leaving now anyway.

674
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:01,366
- Leaving?
- But it's 10:30.

675
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,535
We said we'd come,
not that we'd stay.

676
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,065
Thanks again for paying
our electric bill!

677
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,929
Oops! That was loud.

678
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,298
You paid the gamma psis
to come to this party?

679
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,328
This is pathetic. I knew we shouldn't
have gotten involved with this party.

680
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:22,912
Come on, guys.

681
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:24,989
<i>Nice job.</i>

682
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:29,113
Should we take off?

683
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:30,854
This is kind of a disaster.

684
00:36:32,048 --> 00:36:33,565
So you're on trip's side?

685
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:35,611
It's cool. We can stay.

686
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,898
I may not have money anymore, Trip,
but I am still your president.

687
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:47,037
You may not be for long. You're turning
omega chi into a joke.

688
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,500
First by being dumb enough to give away
your trust fund, and now this slag-fest.

689
00:36:58,475 --> 00:37:00,217
Well, I guess it can't get
any worse.

690
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,080
Smile for the yearbook.

691
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:20,756
What the hell were you thinking?

692
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,107
You kissed my boyfriend!

693
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:24,700
That is not gonna work anymore.
We're really screwed.

694
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:27,494
How could you let us
be humiliated like this?

695
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:29,246
I know it looks bad...

696
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:32,943
Forget number four we'll be lucky
if we're top ten after this. And since

697
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:36,438
you spent all our money on this supid
party, we have no way of getting back up

698
00:37:36,563 --> 00:37:39,965
Give me one good reason why all of us
pledges shouldn't de-pledgeright now.

699
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:40,921
I...

700
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:44,356
I can't.

701
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:49,281
How can we have any faith in you
as our president?

702
00:37:50,996 --> 00:37:52,884
Because she didn't know
anything about it.

703
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,147
I did it.

704
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,466
It's my fault.

705
00:37:56,591 --> 00:38:02,074
I panicked and I offered to
pay gamma psi's electric bill.

706
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,239
Ashleigh didn't even know about it.

707
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,285
No, it's true. She's just covering for
me, because she's a good friend.

708
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,432
That's not true.

709
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:13,540
Ashleigh is the best president
we've ever had.

710
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,445
We need to rally behind her,
and move on.

711
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:24,711
So you slipped on a wet dollar bill
and fell.

712
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,872
You're still rowdy Rusty,
standing up to viper like that.

713
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:30,397
Yeah. And I got up after I fell!

714
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:32,100
Yeah, but then you fell down again.

715
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,028
Why was that dollar bill wet?

716
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:40,580
Have you thought about pledging
the JC House? Let me tell you about him

717
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:45,592
Hey, if I can stand up to a guy named
viper, you can break up with lana.

718
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:47,718
Maturely.

719
00:38:49,824 --> 00:38:51,328
It's not gonna kill you.

720
00:38:54,357 --> 00:38:55,619
Viper didn't kill me!

721
00:38:56,244 --> 00:38:57,624
<i>Jesus knows how to party.</i>

722
00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:59,294
<i>Dude makes his own wine.</i>

723
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:05,396
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

724
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:12,585
I guess I should explain why
I've been blowing you off.

725
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:14,895
Whatever.

726
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,812
We were just hanging out.

727
00:39:19,298 --> 00:39:20,941
Are we still, or not?

728
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:26,280
I guess not.

729
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:30,243
I thought this was what I wanted,
but I want, um, I want

730
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,660
someone... Different.

731
00:39:34,282 --> 00:39:36,039
All you college guys are the same.

732
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,670
Hook up with a hot townie for a while
before you realize you can't handle it.

733
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,806
Something like that.

734
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,232
Why do you care if I'm ok?
I'm the jerk that tried to

735
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:05,440
mess with your relationship
to benefit my presidency.

736
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:07,939
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

737
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:11,584
- I know you're feeling lot of pressure.
- Maybe I should just resigne

738
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,536
- before trip starts his coup.
- Don't give that jackass what he wants.

739
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,061
There's plenty of other guys in
the house that have your back.

740
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:18,107
Like me

741
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:21,134
Thanks man
And please know that when you do decide

742
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:23,590
to tell the house about grant,
I've got your back too.

743
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:26,436
I'm not sure that i'm going to be
telling the house anytime soon.

744
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:29,565
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm starting to wonder

745
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,428
if he's the right guy for me.

746
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,683
- Pizza?
- I'm buying.

747
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,783
It really does make
your nose tingle.

748
00:40:57,945 --> 00:41:00,415
I think I'm sticking with
sparkling cider for a while.

749
00:41:00,674 --> 00:41:02,084
Rowdy rusty's retiring.

750
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,628
He was too easily influenced by
hot naked ladies anyway.

751
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,067
And he made me behave like a grown-up
more than i'm comfortable with.

752
00:41:08,192 --> 00:41:09,811
I can't handle rowdy rusty.

753
00:41:09,936 --> 00:41:11,593
Let's just give the nicknames
a rest.

754
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,675
now that you're acting all mature.

755
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,847
Shut your damn mouth...
Again.

756
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:17,837
- slightly more mature.
- Thank you.

757
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:20,336
Now will you tell me? Why did
you go to gentleman's choice?

758
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,849
I like the lukewarm taco meat.

759
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:23,866
Come on.

760
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:25,232
Don't read into it,

761
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:27,716
You only go there when you're
thinking about a girl.

762
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:29,273
Last time it was...

763
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,368
I think I see where this is headed.

764
00:41:37,994 --> 00:41:39,446
Don't read into it, dale.

765
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:41,582
Come on, let's just do another shot

766
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,152
That was the longest night
of my life.

767
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:12,154
They kept us up talking about the state
of the house until four in the morning.

768
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:13,613
Girls talk a lot.

769
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,317
Should we get up?

770
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:18,076
I'm scared to leave this room.

771
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,813
I'm just gonna resign.

772
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:23,304
There's no reason you should take the
fall for me being a terrible president.

773
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:25,396
You can't resign.

774
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:29,914
Don't say it. Don't say that I souldn't
resign because i'm a great president.

775
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:32,757
I wasn't going to say that
you're a great president.

776
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,864
I was going to say that you can't resign
because that would only lead to further

777
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:40,640
instability. Which we cannot have. We'd
be playing right into gamma psi's hands.

778
00:42:41,412 --> 00:42:42,327
You're right.

779
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:45,437
And gamma psi seemed so nice.

780
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:48,226
With their cupcakes and their
bunny mascot.

781
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:52,333
Bunnies look cute, then they bite you
with their big sharp bunny teeth.

782
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:54,919
And they sleep where they poop.

783
00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:57,282
You can't trust a bunny.

784
00:42:58,246 --> 00:42:59,451
So what are we gonna do?

785
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:01,950
You won't mind taking my advice?

786
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:03,642
Are you kidding?

787
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,167
Let's discuss the facts.

788
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,545
Gamma psi targeting us for
humiliation is a good thing.

789
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,381
They wouldn't need to destroy us if they
didn't think of us as a threat.

790
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,843
- We're still in the game.
- We're still in the game.

791
00:43:17,259 --> 00:43:18,720
So let's go start playing.

792
00:43:22,896 --> 00:43:25,082
I'm gonna eat a frowny-face
cupcake for breakfast.
