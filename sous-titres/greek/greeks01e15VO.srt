2
00:00:01,193 --> 00:00:04,244
Are we just barnyard animals
blindly following our leader into

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,968
- a battle we don't even understand?
- You said we weren't gonna let

4
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:08,904
our houses get in the way
of us being friends.

5
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:11,347
- You did nothing to stop it.
- It was a prank!

6
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,985
Weren't you friends with Evan?

7
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:15,996
Evan Longoria and I roomed
together freshman year,

8
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:18,123
there were numerous factors
that led to our break up.

9
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,773
You take us down,
and you will go with us...

10
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,790
Bing.

11
00:00:22,103 --> 00:00:24,568
I need Frannie to make things right.

12
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:27,791
I've done my best to take
responsibility for my mistakes.

13
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:30,944
ZBZ rules prevent you from
moving in today.

14
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:34,323
You can't keep me on probation
for more than three months.

15
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:35,614
Tell the truth.

16
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,217
We kissed, but it didn't go any further.

17
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:40,909
I'm wearing your letters, I'm planning
forever with you. I love you.

18
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,187
No, you love you!

19
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,590
You love what I can do for you!

20
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,508
The Omega Chis are officially stripping
you of the title of Sweetheart.

21
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:51,027
The brotherhood
is not comfortable maintaining such

22
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:54,423
a close relationship between us
and Zeta Beta Zeta.

23
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,868
Fellow sisters,

24
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:02,348
welcome to the first meeting
of the post-Lizzie era.

25
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:05,090
Congratulations,
we're on our own now.

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,667
And you're probably wondering
what that means for you and the house.

27
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:11,298
That we can
finally wear skirts without Lizzie

28
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,319
reminding us how hard women
fought for suffrage?

29
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:15,866
Yes.

30
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:19,331
But some of the changes Lizzie
made were actually improvements.

31
00:01:22,662 --> 00:01:25,649
For example,
mandatory pledge study hours.

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,740
But...

33
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,510
we're not actually going to do the 50
extra philanthropy hours, are we?

34
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,030
75, and yes.

35
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:36,004
And pre-meeting roll call
and a little more attention to ritual,

36
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:38,035
- and...
- And are you ever gonna stop "and-ing"?

37
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,685
And there's one more change...

38
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:41,809
Right,

39
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,929
we're finally gonna have some real
Zeta Beta fun.

40
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:48,290
Girls, girls, I'm very disappointed.

41
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,946
We don't snap here.

42
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:51,402
We clap.

43
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,321
Isn't Casey doing a great job?

44
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,612
Beats our last President.

45
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:03,814
So tomorrow night
is the all-Greek ball.

46
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,460
The premier Greek event.

47
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,812
And, as you know,
this is the first one in two years.

48
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:10,993
I hope you've been skipping
desserts where you need to.

49
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:12,696
This is the place to show off.

50
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,099
Frannie,
do you have a question?

51
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,209
What?

52
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,316
- No. I don't have anything to say.
- I think

53
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,023
Tania just cleared her throat.

54
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:29,259
Great.

55
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:31,712
So why didn't we have one last year?

56
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,127
Well...

57
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,361
There was like this...

58
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,735
SNAFU thing at the ball two years ago.

59
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:40,793
Anyway...
Moving forward.

60
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,454
This is a big deal,
since every house,

61
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,502
Even alumni lobbied dean Bowman hard
for a second chance.

62
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:49,755
I expect nothing less
than our best behavior.

63
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,829
This could be

64
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:53,190
another step

65
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,858
toward getting the dean's
restrictions lifted.

66
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,014
Go, Casey!

67
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:06,314
Okay... So there is this all-Greek
ball this weekend.

68
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,510
And we're not going.

69
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,057
No!
Why aren't we going?

70
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,219
Listen to the name, spitter.
It's a ball.

71
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,802
Like a testicle.
I don't want to go to a testicle.

72
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:22,053
Sounded kind of fun before that.
All the Greeks partying in one place.

73
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,213
Yeah, sure.

74
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,341
If you're looking for a prom part II.

75
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:27,888
Well, I didn't have prom part I.

76
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,420
Why doesn't anyone want to go?

77
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,046
It's a long, boring story, Spitter.

78
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,082
But...

79
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,683
And meeting adjourned.
Adieu!

80
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,083
What, no one's gonna
tell me what happened?

81
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,742
No,
no one is.

82
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:45,892
And if you keep asking you know
what I'm gonna do? Yeah, you guessed it.

83
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:48,429
I'm gonna reinstate
the pledge diet plan.

84
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,774
You remember bacon grease
and butter burritos, right?

85
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,031
Never mind.

86
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,049
<i>First day of college.</i>

87
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,807
- Hey.
- Hey, nice puberty patch.

88
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,643
Hey, the ladies don't
complain about it too much.

89
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:04,858
Man, ladies?

90
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:06,944
When did you get a sense of humor,
master Chambers?

91
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:08,044
Shut up you.

92
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:10,085
- It's good to see you man.
- You look good.

93
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:11,628
- Look at this room.
- I know.

94
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:14,026
- How glorious is this room?
- It's not bad.

95
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:15,549
Man.

96
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,739
- Wait a minute. What are?
- Our R.A.

97
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:21,723
He is 21 years old,
and he is absolutely desperate for cash.

98
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,141
This is great.

99
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,886
- I just got this down the street.
- It's not bad.

100
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:27,766
This is gonna blow.

101
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:30,272
- To freshman year.
- To freshman year, my friend.

102
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:32,236
- You'll never learn.
- Son of a.

103
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:33,759
Why would you do that to me?

104
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,876
Over here
we have our flat screen television set.

105
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,617
Flat screen? Why couldn't we have
a flat screen at camp Kitchi Wa-Wa?

106
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,172
- Probably cause it was camp.
- Perhaps, yeah.

107
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:47,100
- The good old days.
- These are gonna be the good new days.

108
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,474
Clearly, vintage T-shirts, goatee.

109
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:51,561
This isn't exactly your style,
from what I recall.

110
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:55,113
I'm trying something new. I wanna be a
little more Evan a little less Chambers.

111
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,130
Sounds like a rich kid thing to me.

112
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,387
That's just what
I don't want it to sound like.

113
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:01,862
Starting tonight,
I'm gonna be my own man.

114
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:04,679
I'm gonna go rush some fraternities,
and you are gonna come with me.

115
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,516
- Fraternities?
- Yeah.

116
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,871
Aren't those a little
elitist and obnoxious?

117
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:10,518
They weren't in old school.

118
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,207
Playing theold schoolcard.
You know me very well.

119
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:15,341
Trust me, spending the next four years,

120
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:18,279
going to apartment parties
is gonna be so much better in a frat.

121
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:21,032
There's no girls at those parties,
it's a total sausage fest.

122
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:25,261
That is the single most motivating thing
you could have possibly said to me.

123
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:27,768
You'll be fine.
Listen, rush starts at six.

124
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,895
I'll meet you right here.
All right.

125
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,376
- Fine. I bet I'm gonna hate it.
- You will not hate it.

129
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,580
Is it true our Madam President
doesn't have a date for the ball?

130
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:49,626
Yeah.

131
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,874
Well, have you talked to Cappie yet?

132
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:54,899
Because he likes school dances
about as much as L.C. likes Spencer.

133
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,426
It's not a problem.

134
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,186
We made alternate plans.

135
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:00,492
So I was right.

136
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,614
Any luck with finding a date
for tonight?

137
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:09,167
Who says I need luck?

138
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:11,136
Of course.
So who is he?

139
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,067
Well...

140
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:13,351
He is a "she,"

141
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:16,129
and she's really hot
and her name is Casey Cartwright.

142
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,924
What happened to Hotmanistan?

143
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,191
He was stealing from his sponsor family.

144
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:23,212
They found money
in his stupid Fanny pack-istan.

145
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,910
It's not like boys are banging down
my door either.

146
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,013
But I bet a good number
of them will be dateless at the dance.

147
00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:30,309
We'll divide and conquer.

148
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,415
Or pull a Frannie and break up a couple.

149
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,575
Yeah, she's trying.
She seems friendlier.

150
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:37,033
Like the pit bulls
you hear about on the news.

151
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:39,745
One minute they're licking your fingers,
the next they're eating

152
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:42,433
- your little maltipoo.
- I don't think this new Frannie bites.

153
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,696
She doesn't even bark.
That's what scares me.

154
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:45,834
She's so...

155
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,169
Walking through the door right now.

156
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,001
Hey, Frannie.

157
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:51,566
Hey, guys.

158
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:54,601
The machines are down
at my apartment again.

159
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,568
All of them?
What happened?

160
00:06:57,503 --> 00:07:00,590
Some... rats gnawed through
the hoses at the back of the machines.

161
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:01,977
That's gross.

162
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,215
I know, right?

163
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:07,646
So I was wondering
if I could do my laundry here.

164
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,189
Sure.

165
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:13,116
Of course it's okay.

166
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,036
Thanks, Casey.

167
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,907
<i>I'm done with these two.</i>

168
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:19,932
Thanks.

169
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:28,466
I'm sorry. I think I've seen you
somewhere before. Are you on MySpace?

170
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:31,093
It's like this new friendster.
I'm totally obsessed with it.

171
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:33,699
I live on your floor.

172
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,171
- I'm... I'm Casey.
- I'm Ashleigh. Nice to meet you.

173
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:41,554
Is this your...

174
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:42,781
Red sock?

175
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:46,031
Looks more like a strawberry blond sock.

176
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:50,220
Not a sock! Not a sock!
It's a clump of hair!

177
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,640
Get it off me!
Hold on.

178
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:53,727
Hold on. Hold still, hold still.
Ok, Ok.

179
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:54,837
It's gone now.

180
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:55,866
It's gone now.

181
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:57,313
I am so sorry.

182
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:59,111
It's Ok.

183
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:01,316
Doing your own laundry sucks.

184
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:02,328
I know.

185
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,288
Yesterday I checked to
see how much it'd cost to overnight

186
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,901
my clothes back home
and have my mom wash them for me.

187
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:08,761
And?

188
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,073
It adds up.

189
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,219
My mom would probably just
send them right back.

190
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,288
I have a big family:

191
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:16,931
two sisters and a brother.

192
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:19,274
But they're awesome.
I miss them.

193
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,603
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

194
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:26,110
Not really.

195
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:29,539
So are... are you...

196
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:30,638
Are you rushing?

197
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,097
No, I'm good on time.

198
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,233
I meant a sorority.

199
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:39,938
Yeah. I was thinking about it.
Are you?

200
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,892
You should.
And we should be rush buddies.

201
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:43,804
Ok.

202
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:47,186
Ladies...

203
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:49,936
They shut the water off

204
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,139
at the Zeta Beta Zeta
house today Mark Jacobs...

205
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
Nice.

206
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:00,208
Could I borrow some of your detergent?

207
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:02,252
Yes. Sure.

208
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:03,921
I mean...
Please.

209
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:04,989
Thanks.

210
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:09,051
I'm so ready to mix with the Omega Chis.

211
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,012
Rush needs to be over like now.

212
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:13,555
The rush makes us the
best house in campus, Libbs.

213
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,996
Think about it.
We have the prettiest girls,

214
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:18,937
the best grades,
and the most awesome...

215
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,413
Social calendar on campus.

216
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,375
So how many girls we'll get tonight anyway?

217
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:40,965
As many as we want.

218
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,121
But...

219
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,315
Not everyone is Zeta Beta material.

220
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,283
It's about quality,
not quantity.

221
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:50,051
We can only take the best.

222
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,363
What's up, Calvin?

223
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,503
Let's see.

224
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,299
Your suit, Mr. Bond.

225
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:05,260
Thank you, pledge Owens.

226
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,570
So I see Tanner's warming up to you.

227
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:12,168
Yeah, yeah.
I....

228
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,803
Kind of liked it when
he was all uncomfortable.

229
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:17,236
- He can talk.
- It's like I said, man.

230
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,659
You give the Omega Chis a
chance to get to know the real you,

231
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,754
you can be one of the most
liked guys of this house.

232
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,864
You know, you're right.
I'm glad I'm here.

233
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,569
It's...
It's a much better frat than Kappa Tau.

234
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,083
Yeah, what the hell were you thinking?

235
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:30,649
I don't know.

236
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:33,542
<i>Do you use gel or a wax?</i>

237
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:35,634
Did we really almost
have that conversation?

238
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:37,187
And what was with that jock house?

239
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:40,210
I know. The... What is it? The...
the Lambda Sigs. Lambda Sigs, yeah.

240
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,816
They asked how fast
I could run the forty.

241
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,448
- What? You serious?
- They loved you.

242
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:47,827
I didn't even have to drop
the "Chambers" bomb once, man.

243
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,063
Yeah, you didn't have
to at Omega Chi either.

244
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,938
They were so busy sucking up to you,
I got to steal this.

245
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:55,492
Ok, now we're breaking the law.
What are you doing?

246
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,061
Come on, can we just go now,

247
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,952
- please?
- No, come on, Cap. Listen to me.

248
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,424
I swear, you just haven't
found your right fit yet.

249
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:03,552
I have found the right fit.
The dorm room.

250
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:06,607
Three squares a day, plus cable tv.
What more do you need?

251
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,057
Cappie, trust me, all right?
This is better.

252
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:12,217
Think of a fraternity as
four more years of camp,

253
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:15,588
all right? But this time, your cabin
is equipped with girls and beer.

254
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:18,573
Ok, but the last two came
equipped with'roid abusers,

255
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:21,275
and men with frosted tips.
Come on, Evs.

256
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:23,978
You got three invitations already.
What are you holding out for?

257
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:27,724
This one. Ok? This is the house
that I'm really interested in.

258
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:30,940
What do those letters mean again?

259
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:33,162
- <i>Kappa Tau Gamma.
- Kappa Tau Gamma.</i>

260
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,316
- One more.
- Let's do it.

261
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,088
- God! What? What is it? A spider?
- Scarier.

262
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:48,698
I'd recognize that chartreuse-colored
puffy pen writing anywhere.

263
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,681
A thank-you note
from Frannie for laundry privileges.

264
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,515
This seems harmless.

265
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,164
She's trying. She's making amends.
The whole...

266
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,106
Step 12 thing.

267
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,700
And she used really nice stationary.

268
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:11,704
- Look at the watermark.
- It's not harmless, Ash.

269
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:14,481
And this has nothing to do
with making amends.

270
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:16,880
First, she supports me at the meeting.

271
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,022
- Now this.
- It's harmless.

272
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:21,090
No, she's trying
to make me doubt myself.

273
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,492
It's payback for keeping her
on probation.

274
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:24,863
You don't know that.

275
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:28,165
Why are you defending her? It's not like
she was making your life any easier.

276
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,129
Frannie seriously lost
it last semester, no doubt.

277
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,000
But she wasn't always like that.

278
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,829
I was a ZBZ, you know?

279
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,369
Seriously?
So was I.

280
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:41,304
God.

281
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,330
I only date ZBZs.

282
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,564
Flat line.

283
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,245
Damn, we lost her.

284
00:12:51,377 --> 00:12:54,675
Seriously, she wouldn't have died
if she'd gone Zeta Beta.

285
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:56,137
Seriously.

286
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,427
What a shame.

287
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:01,397
You girls wanna go to Dobler's?

288
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:03,813
My God.
That sounds like so much fun. Right?

289
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:05,274
- Yeah.
- Sure.

290
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:07,599
Choices...

291
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,514
That's what being in
a sorority is all about.

292
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:13,534
Making those choices
that can change your life...

293
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,200
Forever.

294
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:25,615
Frannie is so awesome.
She ends everything with "right?"

295
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:28,309
It's so interesting, right?
My God, I just did it.

296
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:29,435
You did.

297
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,893
Beware the donut test.

298
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:36,979
Donut test?

299
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,106
My suite-mate told me
one of the houses determines

300
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,444
if you're right for them
based on which you eat first,

301
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,400
the donut or the ice cream.
This must be the place.

302
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:46,082
That's ridiculous.

303
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:50,462
- What are you supposed to eat first?
- She said the ice cream, but

304
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:52,709
she's kind of evil,
so she might have been tricking me.

305
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,047
Casey, right?

306
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,838
- Yes.
- This is for you.

307
00:13:58,225 --> 00:13:59,734
No, thank you.

308
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:01,010
Excuse me?

309
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:06,520
If this is the kind of sority that bases
their bids on the way you eat

310
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,725
a piece of deep-fried dough,

311
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,378
then I really
don't want to be here.

312
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:15,332
A girl who thinks for herself.

313
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:17,537
Threatening...

314
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:20,775
But properly trained,

315
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:23,458
potentially
a great asset to the house.

316
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:26,839
When I become president,

317
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,553
I'm so dropping this stupid

318
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,159
donut thing, anyway.

319
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,193
And I'm not gonna eat another one.

320
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:41,470
What are you looking for?

321
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,766
The student newspaper
from two years ago.

322
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:45,946
Do you know if they
have an online archive?

323
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:48,057
No, but easy there, Amadeus.

324
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:49,849
Next to the screen the keyboard...

325
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:53,105
The most fragile exposed
part of a computer. I know.

326
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:55,725
There's the Greek ball tonight.
You're gone?

327
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:57,503
None of the KTs are.

328
00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:00,389
Why? Is your U-Sag
group going to protest it?

329
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,251
I thought about getting
some picketers, but

330
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:04,156
then I decided to do something bigger.

331
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:07,800
I've decided to throw
the first annual U-Sag ball.

332
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:11,206
It's gonna be CRU's counter-programming
answer to your Greeks'

333
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:12,601
all-night bacchanalia.

334
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:13,998
Our dance ends at eleven.

335
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,723
It's gonna be a sin-free evening,

336
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,806
filled with non-alcoholic drinks,

337
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,005
line-dancing and subtle proselytizing.

338
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,461
Could be the first of many U-Sag balls.

339
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,089
- Dale.
- Do you wanna go?

340
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:28,179
I think there's a conflict
of interests or something.

341
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,031
Do you think Calvin would wanna go?

342
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:32,597
Calvin is happily back at Omega Chi,

343
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:35,562
and Omega Chi and Kappa Tau
aren't exactly on speaking terms.

344
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,245
So you stopped talking to a friend

345
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:39,274
because he joined
a different organization?

346
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:41,812
Right, like you've never
done anything like that.

347
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,882
<i>Hey, you should swing by my youth
boot camp</i> this weekend for a little

348
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:46,710
- pizza and soul winning.
- I can't.

349
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,408
My mom converts me to catholicism.

350
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:50,209
- I have to go to mess.
- Mess?

351
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:51,571
You're dead to me.

352
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:56,143
Well, not without a very good reason.

353
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:07,073
Are you sure you don't
wanna go to the dance?

354
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:09,035
It'd be my first ball.

355
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:11,810
I thought you didn't wanna go.

356
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:13,735
I changed my mind.

357
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:15,336
It's a woman's prerogative.

358
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:20,960
And I respect your right to choose, and
it's not that I don't wanna go with you.

359
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,026
I just. I don't wanna go to the dance.

360
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,637
I'm not a very good dancer.

361
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:34,481
Ok.

362
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,665
Do you now see why I've been
holding out for this house?

363
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,210
- An ice luge!
- A what?

364
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,460
Sally forth!

365
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,560
This ain't no joke
I'm about to give you.

366
00:16:57,721 --> 00:17:00,486
- Then give me hell.
- Where do you think I got this stuff?

367
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,482
- All right, say when.
- Okay.

368
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,323
Cap! Are you all right, psycho?
Are you okay?

369
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:27,039
Step back, he's gonna boot!

370
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:32,443
When.

371
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,277
The bottle's empty.

372
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,293
The bottle's empty!

373
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:44,889
- Hey, priceless, kid.
- Dude. I think I found my people.

374
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:46,341
Think you did, man.

375
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:01,667
Hey, man. I'm Evan.

376
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:04,803
Chambers.

377
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,681
You're related to Tom Chambers
of the Phoenix suns?

378
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:12,802
Actually
it's Jonathan Chambers.

379
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,309
Chambers International.

380
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:16,156
Yeah, I don't follow soccer,

381
00:18:19,107 --> 00:18:20,343
You know that guy?

382
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:22,314
Cappie?

383
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:24,814
Yeah, he's my roommate.
We're roomies.

384
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:28,367
Well, you guys should stick around,
check it out.

385
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:30,194
Ok, yeah. We will.

386
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,534
See you around, Todd.

387
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:33,215
- All right. Evan.
- Whatever.

388
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,561
Sure.

389
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,016
So congratulations on taking
home gold in the ice luge.

390
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:43,377
Yeah, I've been trying to hold on
to my amateur status for quite a while,

391
00:18:43,563 --> 00:18:46,081
just to hopefully make
it here one day and...

392
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,802
And now that I'm here
it feels pretty good. I'm real proud.

393
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:50,187
Good.

394
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:56,897
Would you excuse me please?

395
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,581
Think I see my gold medal.

396
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:10,568
Cappie.

397
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,816
- That's your name?
- Please, regale me with yours.

398
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,334
I... I'm Casey Cartwright.

399
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:20,968
Sexy alliteration.
Casey Cartwright.

400
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:23,129
Simple, yet elegant.

401
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:25,143
Want to do a body shot?

402
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:27,449
Someone's already getting me a drink.
Thanks.

403
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:28,795
In a cup? How boring.

404
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:31,589
Well, at least I get
to keep my clothes on.

405
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,831
Rarely a virtue in my experience.

406
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:39,639
And just for the record, I was hoping
you would do the shot off me.

407
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,353
I'll stick to the cute
guy with the boring cup.

408
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:46,701
Well, that's what
they said at Jonestown.

409
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:49,683
You really trust your
drink with a complete stranger?

410
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:50,983
Well, let's ask him.

411
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,372
- You know... Cappie?
- Evan's the guy?

412
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:57,606
Then I stand corrected.
He's the safest guy I know.

413
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:00,418
- Thanks. I think.
- You guys know each other?

414
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:02,569
- Yeah, we're roommates, actually.
- Right.

415
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,498
Can you believe someone
just left him on my doorstep?

416
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,583
I opened the door, there he was.

417
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:09,585
Looking for somebody
to take care of him.

418
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,006
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

419
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,314
- Well.
- My God. I love this song.

420
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:17,820
Come on.

421
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:19,929
Ok. What about your drink?

422
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:21,556
Just put it down and come dance.

423
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:24,703
I love college!

424
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:52,838
So I need a volunteer
to be sober pledge tonight.

425
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,878
I got it.

426
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,299
I'm dateless.

427
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,896
Unless one of you
guys wants to go with me.

428
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:06,632
- Excuse me, Joe?
- I told you, it's yo, Joe!

429
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,481
Like the cartoon, you know.

430
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,607
Snake eyes,
cobra commander, the baroness.

431
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:13,210
The baroness.

432
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:14,321
Nice pull.

433
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,376
She was hot.

434
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:16,527
Yo, Joe!

435
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:19,617
Got a test tomorrow.
Is it cool if I duck out early?

436
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:22,807
No, Chambers. Not until we finish
the pledge nicknames.

437
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:24,566
Let's see.

438
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:28,366
No need to bother with Cappie.
I mean...

439
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:29,912
He's so Cappie.

440
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,624
And the beaver...

441
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:35,453
Was a no-brainer following
last night's drunken exploits.

442
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:40,912
I could watch Beaver
inhale wood all day.

443
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:43,360
Which brings me to Chambers...

444
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,500
Aka "Bing."

445
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:50,289
I don't get it.

446
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,039
Is it like Chandler?

447
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:54,347
No.

448
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:55,469
Then why Bing?

449
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:58,740
Origin isn't important.
It's a handle.

450
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,071
And yours is Bing.

451
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:02,179
No.

452
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:05,086
No, you have to tell me.
Why am I Bing? What's Bing?

453
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:09,641
Well, when the brothers were
deciding who to honor with a bid,

454
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,326
there was some discussion.

455
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:14,657
You fell somewhere
between a bid and a ding.

456
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:19,783
- So I almost got dung out?
- Bingo!

457
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,342
No offense.

458
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:23,468
Hey, man. Don't sweat it.
You're in.

459
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,928
Of course you're in, Bing.

460
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,202
I mean, you guys
are like a package deal.

461
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,363
If he's in, you're in.

462
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:31,936
If you're in, he's in.

463
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,729
If he's not in, you're not in.

464
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:35,983
If you're not in, he's still in.

465
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,500
I'm heading downstairs for lunch.

466
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,409
Okay. I'll meet you there in a sec.

467
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:45,814
Favorite bracelet.
Where are you?

468
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:55,308
I've already been thinking about
all the experiences

469
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:57,341
we'll share together throughout college.

470
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,493
And I'll always be
here to protect you...

471
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,696
From boys,
who will always hurt you.

472
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:04,439
Proud

473
00:23:04,838 --> 00:23:07,819
to be your Zeta Beta Zeta big sis.

474
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:12,702
I love my ginormous lesbian big sis.

475
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:14,858
Casey Cartwright,

476
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:17,310
turn around and meet your new big sis.

477
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:22,323
Casey...

478
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,280
From the moment I saw you,

479
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:27,329
I knew you were the girl
I wanted as my little sis.

480
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,809
I see you at my med school graduation,

481
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,286
I see you at my wedding. And

482
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:34,833
I just know we'll still be
talking when we're ninety.

483
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,289
I think ZBZ founding sister,

484
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:39,153
Octavia Divoll Jones,

485
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:41,188
said it best when she wrote,

486
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:45,214
"sincere and unending friendship springs

487
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,220
from sisterhood steadfast."

488
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:49,346
I love that.

489
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,274
Because, when we're in need,
we don't abandon each other, Casey.

490
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:54,951
We stick together.

491
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:56,968
For all time.

492
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:00,893
Damn proud to be your
Zeta Beta Zeta big sis.

493
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:14,465
Hey...

494
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,736
I know you and Ashleigh
are going to the ball.

495
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:18,824
Right.

496
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,222
And if you want a pre-party,
it's two-for-one night at Dobler's.

497
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:23,342
Drinks on me.

498
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,126
Thanks.

499
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:30,793
But I don't think we can make it.

500
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:34,512
Ok.

501
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:42,016
You're leaving Kappa
Tau to pledge Omega Chi?

502
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,252
Yeah, I mean, it's done, Cap.

503
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:47,122
But it's Ok, man.
It's the right move for me.

504
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:49,170
But I only rushed because you did.

505
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,985
I know that, and look how
well it's turned out for you, man.

506
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:53,495
You're a superstar.

507
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:55,290
Come on, I'm just...

508
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,501
- Bing?
- Yeah, Bing.

509
00:24:58,617 --> 00:25:01,168
What, you can't be a part of something,
unless you're the superstar?

510
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,289
Let's be honest. It's not like you're
not enjoying being the golden boy.

511
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:06,207
So you're in different houses now...

512
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:07,438
Big deal.

513
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:08,928
Nothing has to change.

514
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,500
I just wanna understand why Evan's
decided to make a very, very,

515
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:14,330
very poor decision here.

516
00:25:15,795 --> 00:25:17,933
Omega Chi has a lot to offer me.

517
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:20,020
What, like starched collars
and sailing lessons?

518
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:21,797
And better athletics,

519
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:24,894
and alumni job assistance,
and an emphasis on academics.

520
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:26,290
Ok, who cares?

521
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:27,927
Dude, we're in college.

522
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:30,317
Just enjoy the six or seven years,

523
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:32,575
and don't worry about making contacts.

524
00:25:32,635 --> 00:25:34,051
Yeah, but then what, man?

525
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:36,065
Look, we're not gonna
be in college forever.

526
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,330
So much for having fun, Mr. Chambers?

527
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:40,580
- All right, you know what?
- I know, I know.

528
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,209
Why don't we get some hamburgers?

529
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:44,191
Hamburgers, yum!

530
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:46,960
Come on, guys.

531
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,047
Don't fight over something like this.
It's just the Greek system.

532
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,669
Don't let it ruin our friendship.

533
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,151
We're the three musketeers.

534
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:59,199
Hey... it's okay. It's totally fine.
I'm not. I'm not even hungry.

535
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,431
I got to study...

536
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:05,316
All right. Let's go.

537
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:09,116
Sorry.

538
00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:33,512
Are you going to the dance tonight?

539
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:36,624
Some of the other guys are, and I'm...
not.

540
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,547
Yeah, me too.

541
00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:39,774
Just chillin'.

542
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,620
- Yeah.
- Like a villain.

543
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:45,221
I can touch the ceilin'.

544
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:50,387
See you later.

545
00:26:58,502 --> 00:26:59,676
Here we go!

546
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:04,110
<i>And do... you...</i>

547
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,623
<i>wanna be a cave girl too.</i>

548
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:12,961
<i>Do you wanna be.</i>

549
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:23,730
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

550
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:28,524
It's getting late, Taylor Hicks.
Do you mind if we call it a night?

551
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:31,863
My adoring public needs me.
Just, just one more.

552
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:33,448
One more.

553
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,999
Fine. Thank you.

554
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,784
<i>Cappie! Cappie!
Cappie! Cappie!</i>

555
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:40,857
<i>All right, we'll do one more.</i>

556
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:44,982
- Hey, stranger.
- Stranger?

557
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,654
That's a bit dramatic.

558
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:47,690
Really?

559
00:27:47,727 --> 00:27:50,556
You room with my boyfriend,
and I've seen you like... what,

560
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:52,867
twice in the past six months?

561
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:55,843
Yeah. I've just been caught
up with Omega Chi pledging.

562
00:27:56,026 --> 00:27:57,026
It shows.

563
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:01,442
I mean, without you there covering for
Cappie, he's had to come up with new

564
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:05,314
and inventive excuses for flaking
on me to party with his bros.

565
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:07,959
Well, you know,
fun can be time consuming.

566
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:10,687
You created the Godzilla of partying
by taking him to Kappa Tau.

567
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:12,708
Trust me.
Trust me, Cappie...

568
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:16,195
He was already a monster.
I just pointed the way to Tokyo.

569
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:20,676
Come on, all right?
That's Cappie.

570
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:23,538
I mean, he's the life of the party.
It's what you signed up for.

571
00:28:23,816 --> 00:28:25,176
Glowing endorsement.

572
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,962
- No, he's a good guy.
- He's a great guy.

573
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:30,711
<i>You're behind the steering wheel.</i>

574
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:38,297
<i>Touching you.</i>

575
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:40,971
<i>- Touching me.</i>
- your collar's kinda...

576
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,830
- Man, is it?
- Yeah, here.

577
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:44,542
- Here, here.
- Ok.

578
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:57,973
Anyway... I'm not waiting around.

579
00:28:58,206 --> 00:28:59,459
I'm gonna go home.

580
00:29:01,752 --> 00:29:03,231
- I'll walk you.
- It's fine.

581
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,424
- Besides you're here with your friends.
- No, no, no.

582
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:07,783
No way.
I'm not gonna let you walk home alone.

583
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:12,240
I guess I could use someone
to fend off the crazies. Since

584
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,221
my crazy is...

585
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:16,150
Busy.

586
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,317
Again.

587
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:20,091
I'm gonna.

588
00:29:20,188 --> 00:29:20,988
Ev.

589
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,131
It's fine.

590
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:25,312
- You tried.
- I tried.

591
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:33,057
<i>Thank you. All right.</i>

592
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:34,962
<i>This next song goes out</i>

593
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:37,761
<i>to the most beautiful girl in the world.</i>

594
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:40,300
<i>No, no.
Not you, Beav.</i>

595
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,119
Ms. Casey Cartwright.

596
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:51,015
I got to get myself
ready for the ball, Ash.

597
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:53,324
Why am I looking for your lip gloss?

598
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:55,026
Because you borrowed it!

599
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:59,830
Last load, Case.
And then I'm out of here.

600
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,921
Sorry, Dino.

601
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:08,230
Let's get going.

602
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,383
What are you still doing here?
Where's Cappie?

603
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:17,850
Good question. He was supposed
to pick me up 30 minutes ago.

604
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:19,611
Unbelievable.

605
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:23,323
Well, would you like Dino here
to fetch you an escort from Omega Chi?

606
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:25,222
I know I would.

607
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,757
I want my own lousy escort.

608
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:29,129
If he ever shows.

609
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:31,959
Well, we'll wait with you
until he gets here.

610
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:33,746
We really should get going.

611
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:37,622
I'll meet you there.

612
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,445
Frannie, please.

613
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:46,853
Don't wait. It's okay. Really.

614
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:48,244
I'm fine.

615
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:50,476
Are you sure?

616
00:30:56,097 --> 00:30:57,097
Come on.

617
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,940
Where's Cappie?

618
00:31:05,527 --> 00:31:08,910
Did he think I'd sit at the ZBZ house
waiting forever for him?

619
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,102
I know you know where he is. Don't...

620
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,539
cover for him.

621
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,627
He went to get ready at the KT house.

622
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:18,163
What?

623
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:20,768
Pre-party?

624
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:30,520
I am so sick of this.

625
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,646
I'm competing for my boyfriend's
attention with a house full of 50 guys.

626
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:38,482
I could go get him for you.
Do you want... I'll get him for you.

627
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,610
Aren't you going to the dance?

628
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:46,949
- No date.
- Why not?

629
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:49,217
I just...

630
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:53,542
You know, I didn't want to go
with just anybody.

631
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:00,933
We could go.

632
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,386
As friends.

633
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:05,659
Cause I've got.
I've got a suit.

634
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:09,878
So you wouldn't have to waste
your beautiful dress.

635
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:21,275
I'll...

636
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:23,551
wait in the hall.

637
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,529
While you change.

638
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:27,846
All right.

639
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,409
Where's Cappie?

640
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,522
Don't lie to me, Sasquatch.

641
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,502
He's upstairs.

642
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,164
Big sis... in law.

643
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,622
I tried to stop her, but she scared me.

644
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:03,255
Why haven't you gone to pick up Casey?
She's been waiting almost an hour!

645
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:06,764
- Man. I'm such an idiot!
- Not the word I would use. Hurry!

646
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:07,841
Lady!

647
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:09,406
Take a pill.

648
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:12,806
If my IB says he'll get there,
sweetheart,

649
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:14,828
- he'll get there.
- Stand down, Joe.

650
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,872
Yeah, relax. Cappie's almost ready.

651
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:22,510
Why don't you do me a favor
and go pet some rabbits downstairs?

652
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:25,422
- I don't get it.
- Of course.

653
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:28,880
It's a literary reference anyone with
a high school diploma would understand.

654
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,252
Unless, of course, you're a dumb jock
who eats his way

655
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:35,237
through a public education system with
an eighth-grade reading comprehension.

656
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:36,626
And you...

657
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:39,603
What are you, like 45 now?
The war's over, honey.

658
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:41,732
No more hiding at college
to dodge the draft,

659
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:44,490
and a miserable future
of a minimum wage paying job.

660
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,249
I got nowhere else to go!

661
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,029
I got nowhere else to go.

662
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,283
You...

663
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,745
Well, if I was Casey, I would
have jettisoned you into the sun by now,

664
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:59,513
but she, for some reason
unknown to God or man,

665
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:01,625
actually loves you.
You have to get over there!

666
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:05,504
You're hurting one of the most amazing
girls. Believe me, you will regret it.

667
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,340
This is taking way too long.

668
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:11,554
Come on. We have to go.

669
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:14,445
- Should I wear the tie?
- I don't care.

670
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:18,433
Tell me what happened two years ago
at the all-Greek ball.

671
00:34:18,595 --> 00:34:21,555
Spitter, for the umpteenth time,
it's a long story.

672
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:23,980
Well then let me
make it shorter for you.

673
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:25,483
So I googled you.

674
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:27,593
Not a lot of Cappies on the web.

675
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,464
Especially ones
who attended camp Kitchi Wa-Wa.

676
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:32,781
- It's yesterday's news.
- What I didn't know

677
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:35,634
was the camp's
most prominent benefactors

678
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,993
were Jonathan and Mim Chambers.

679
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:43,751
- How did you...
- I'm really smart. This is what I do.

680
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:46,294
You've known Evan since you were kids,

681
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:49,089
your parents ran the arts
and crafts program at camp

682
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:50,501
and...

683
00:34:51,113 --> 00:34:53,760
- you rushed Kappa Tau together.
- That's all on the internet?

684
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:57,236
If you know your way
around a search engine.

685
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,446
I use a lot of boolean operators.

686
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:01,946
Like "and, or, not,"

687
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:04,097
and occasionally "near."

688
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:11,069
Will you please tell me what happened?

689
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:12,654
All right, fine.

690
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:15,824
I missed the beginning of the dance,
but when I got there...

691
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:31,857
We can't walk out on this song.

692
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:55,572
No more pre-partying
on the way over in the car, Ok?

693
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:58,042
That...
Look at that.

694
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:00,988
Hey, it's Bing.

695
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:09,412
No way.

696
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,136
- It's not what you think.
- I thought you had to study tonight.

697
00:36:13,196 --> 00:36:15,147
I didn't think it'd be a party with my girl.

698
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,254
I went to your room
and you weren't there.

699
00:36:17,314 --> 00:36:19,349
I just didn't want
to let her down, man, okay?

700
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,056
- That's all.
- Are you saying I did?

701
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:22,946
Are you saying you didn't?

702
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,893
Ok, everybody. Let's just back up.

703
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:28,480
I should have known you were gonna
leave KT for those white collar douches,

704
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,658
Didn't think you were
gonna make a move on her.

705
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:32,703
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you!

706
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:35,111
All right, blame me,
but this is about you.

707
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,495
You're still the same preppy tag-along
from camp who needs my help

708
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:40,220
to get into Kappa Tau.

709
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:42,285
I didn't need to have a makeover
to get in.

710
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:45,667
I missed that silver spoon-fed
Chambers we all know and tolerate.

711
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,750
You know, better than being
spawned by a couple of dead head losers.

712
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:28,895
You look...

713
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,956
stunning.

714
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:35,697
You look pretty dapper yourself.

715
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:38,482
It's <i>déja vu</i>...

716
00:37:39,272 --> 00:37:40,266
Sorta.

717
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,721
I've been thinking
about the past myself lately.

718
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:50,186
- You're here to pick up Rebecca?
- Would you kindly announce me?

719
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,332
Only two years late.

720
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:04,035
I think that's the most
I've ever heard her say to you.

721
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:06,703
- Shoulda heard her two years ago.
- What are you talking about?

722
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:09,260
Two years ago,
the night of the testicle?

723
00:38:09,364 --> 00:38:11,041
The night I allegedly stood you up?

724
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,730
She came and found me at Kappa Tau.

725
00:38:15,257 --> 00:38:16,507
I don't buy it.

726
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,224
She made Joe cry.

727
00:38:18,536 --> 00:38:20,830
I thought she was gonna disembowel me.

728
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,928
- Buying it a little more.
- It's true, Case.

729
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,362
She had your back.

730
00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:27,456
You really didn't know that?

731
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:33,956
What are you doing here?

732
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:37,304
Excuse me.

733
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:43,440
My lady, if you're not
against changing your plans,

734
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:46,493
I thought perhaps we might
attend this evening's Cotillion.

735
00:38:47,736 --> 00:38:50,615
- But you don't like to dance.
- But you like to.

736
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:56,411
I'll go change.

737
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:14,219
Ten more minutes and I'll be done.

738
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,770
You went to the KT house
the night of the Greek ball?

739
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:25,795
You're my little sis.

740
00:39:27,203 --> 00:39:28,576
What was I supposed to do?

741
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,028
If you're not doing anything,

742
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:45,719
do you wanna go to the dance
with Ashleigh and me?

743
00:39:49,947 --> 00:39:51,097
I'd love that.

744
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,357
Thanks.

745
00:39:58,278 --> 00:40:01,328
Don't do anything I wouldn't do
at your U-Sag ball.

746
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:04,187
It's free cinemax tonight,
so same to you.

747
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,557
What about Cappie?

748
00:41:31,895 --> 00:41:33,145
What about him?
