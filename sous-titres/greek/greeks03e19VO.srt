1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,375
Previously on Greek.

2
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,686
What are you doing ?
You haven't been exclusive ?

3
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:06,889
I'm not the kind of girl who's going
to have an ordinary relationship.

4
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:09,345
- Love doesn't work !
- Because you're heartless.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,886
- We found out she slept with Beaver.
- That piece of crap ?

6
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,456
- Rebecca didn't think so.
- What the hell ?

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,142
Dana gives me something more.
She inspires me.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,519
Cappie and I aren't built to last.

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,896
We work here,

10
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,506
in college and I don't think
we'll work anywhere else.

11
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:28,152
- What about graduation in May ?
- We'll worry about that in May.

12
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:42,291
Guys.

13
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,336
- Cap, this is Dana.
- Well, hello there, Dana.

14
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,547
We'll take three boxes of Samoas,
four boxes of Thin Mints...

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,258
- I'm not a Girl Scout.
- This is my girlfriend.

16
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:52,987
Can she get us cookies ?

17
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:56,685
These are my pledges,
the future of the KT house.

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,599
- Really ?
- Anthony Hopkins.

19
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,309
They've done a lot of crazy stuff,

20
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,561
like...
What have you guys done ?

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,190
- Were we supposed to do anything ?
- When Spitter was a pledge,

22
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,901
he stole a top-secret
weather thingie.

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,295
The Remington-Herzog
Atmospheric Destabilizer ?

24
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,055
- That was you ?
- That's how I made Vesuvius rain beer.

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,201
Then we put some farm animals
in Omega Chi

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,287
and we took over the KT house,
locking out the actives.

27
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,957
That sounds like a lot of work.

28
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,573
You need to step it up

29
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,253
and make your mark, or else
no one will remember you here.

30
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,146
Why do some of you guys have OX ?
I thought you were KT ?

31
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:32,717
I like my practice conditions
to be as real as possible.

32
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,812
Tomorrow's the IFC
Greek Gods of Golf Tourney,

33
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:36,745
where I will smite Evan Chambers.

34
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,681
Golf is just the beginning

35
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:41,507
of your secret master plan, right ?

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,560
Absolutely.

37
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,688
To lure them into my master trap,
I have master bait.

38
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:48,408
All in good time.

39
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:51,347
That's on a need-to-know basis,
and right now you don't need to know.

40
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:54,780
Get it. You can't talk about your secret
plan in front of me because I'm a girl ?

41
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,283
No. It's because you didn't bring me
any Thin Mints.

42
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,040
So now that he's gone,
what's your big secret plan ?

43
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,829
- I wish I knew.
- You guys are good.

44
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:10,463
God, we only have six weeks left

45
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,531
at CRU and in the ZBZ house.

46
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:15,753
I know. We're about to experience
a lot of lasts together,

47
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:18,508
like a last Spring Break
and a last finals.

48
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:21,800
Our last 10 : 15am on March 10th.

49
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,059
Our last 10 : 16.

50
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,207
Maybe my last six weeks
with Cappie ?

51
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:28,355
Right. Sorry.

52
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,131
That's the last of the lasts.

53
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,382
- When did Rebecca get back ?
- Last night.

54
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,614
And not to bring up lasts again,

55
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,201
but this very well could be your last
chance to be there for Rebecca

56
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,245
as her big sis. Looks like she's upset
that Evan broke up with her.

57
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:46,749
Or maybe she's fine.

58
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:47,632
Fine ?

59
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:51,307
A few days in Jackson Hole
and suddenly everything is fine ?

60
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,674
Rebecca.
How are you doing ?

61
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,259
Fine.

62
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:01,138
If you need to talk,
your big sis is here.

63
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,057
- For you.
- No, thanks.

64
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:07,094
I just thought
you'd be upset about Evan,

65
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,563
maybe even show
some real human emotion,

66
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,856
but, whatever.

67
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:13,776
Okay. Thanks for checking in
with me, big sis.

68
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:16,518
Have you seen today's paper ?

69
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:19,005
Those administration asshats
canceled Greek Week.

70
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,906
- What ? Why ?
- I'll summarize.

71
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,743
Some crap about budgetary issues,

72
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,135
more crap about moving fund
to next year's rush,

73
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,665
and total crap about no more
Blue Ribbon events.

74
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,539
But Greek Week was our last chance
to take down the GP before we graduate.

75
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:32,962
Without it, we finish...

76
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:34,296
Number two.

77
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,137
-= 319 =-
"The First Last"

78
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,783
Kappa Team

79
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,171
Hi, Natalie.
Isn't this Katherine's room ?

80
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,692
Sure is. I mean, ever since
you burned down our house.

81
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:57,531
So sorry to hear about the cancellation
of Greek Week.

82
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,072
I'm super bummed for you guys.
I mean, I had no idea

83
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,324
when I started the petition
to redistribute funds

84
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,577
to next year's rush
it would actually do it.

85
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,912
I guess now ZBZ will have
to go into rush number two.

86
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:08,892
Good luck getting the best girls.

87
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:12,585
And tell Ash to say hi to Pete for me,
if they're still dating.

88
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:14,295
Actually they're not.

89
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,871
Super bummed for Ash, too.

90
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:20,249
I was just as surprised as you.

91
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:22,172
But how can they cancel Greek Week ?

92
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:25,246
The boys get an extra event
with the Greek Gods of Golf,

93
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,300
and what, the sororities
are just done ?

94
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:30,811
We deserve one last chance
to win Blue Ribbon points.

95
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,380
- Isn't there something we can do ?
- I wish there were.

96
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:35,756
Unfortunately, events have to be
approved, voted on,

97
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:38,003
and scheduled months in advance.
It's in our bylaws.

98
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:39,128
However...

99
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,556
if someone

100
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,496
were to point out that traditionally
there was a Goddesses portion

101
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:46,941
of the Greek Gods competition
we might be able to have it reinstated.

102
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,663
So we would play... golf ?

103
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:51,027
No.

104
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:53,258
Let's say hypothetically
a beauty pageant portion

105
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:55,140
was taken off the calendar
in the 1960s,

106
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:57,033
I can only guess due
to women's liberation.

107
00:04:57,158 --> 00:04:58,796
But if someone were to petition

108
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:00,815
the president of Panhellenic,

109
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,052
we might be able to have
another Blue Ribbon event.

110
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,392
I'd like to propose

111
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,186
that we reinstate

112
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:14,530
a beauty pageant.

113
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,232
A beauty pageant ?
Are you crazy ?

114
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,076
An event to find a Goddess
should be much more geared

115
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,743
toward strength of character
and less about appearances.

116
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:23,733
But...

117
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,707
If we could update it
to modern standards,

118
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:28,077
I might be able to convince the board
to bring it back.

119
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,579
Why would you do this ?
Don't you want GP to win ?

120
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,843
Well, personally I would have preferred
to battle it out during Greek Week.

121
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,876
A victory achieved on a technicality
is far less satisfying.

122
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,630
But I'm going to Yale Law,
so moving the frick on.

123
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:44,346
I was thinking we could go
to Myrtle Beach for Spring Break

124
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,304
- with the rest of the house.
- Or we could do this.

125
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,515
Sebastian went last year.
He had such a blast.

126
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,940
I don't know.
I mean, a gay cruise ?

127
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,937
- It's kind of a singles thing.
- Not if we do it together.

128
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,455
But we're gonna have to put
the deposit down soon, so...

129
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,608
Cal ?

130
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,841
There's a Jehovah's Witness
here to see you.

131
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,682
I'm a Baptist, thank you.

132
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:06,652
It's like mistaking
a Methodist for a Lutheran.

133
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,076
- Guys.
- Let me know what you decide.

134
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,283
What's up, Dale ?

135
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,879
I got a favor to ask.

136
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,997
There's this young man
in my church group, Adam,

137
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:27,656
who has some difficult questions
that I'm afraid I'm not...

138
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,791
qualified to answer.

139
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,932
He thinks he might be like you.

140
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,475
Catholic ?

141
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,810
Gay. And...

142
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,943
after three months of talking
to the pastor,

143
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:38,873
he's still not giving in.

144
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,317
I see. You want me to talk
him out of making this choice ?

145
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,738
It's not a choice, Calvin.
For a gay guy, you're awfully ignorant.

146
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,991
No, he just, you know,
he's never met a gay person before.

147
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,156
- Hat he knows of.
- He just wants to talk

148
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,912
to a gay person and there's
nobody like that at our church...

149
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:56,248
that we know of.

150
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,585
Of course.
I'd be happy to help you.

151
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:00,857
Thank you.

152
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,005
I've never been on a cruise before.

153
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:06,175
These guys look like they're having fun,
on each other.

154
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:11,764
Cappie and I were talking

155
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,144
about his big revenge plans
against the Omega Chi, but...

156
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,956
You know,
I forgot some of the details.

157
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:19,597
What was the first part ?

158
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,815
Forget it.
He hasn't told me anything.

159
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,283
Grab that table.

160
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,781
Listen, I know you're mad at me

161
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,950
for punching Rusty and I just
wanted to say that I am sorry.

162
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,204
I was in a really bad place
over Rebecca cheating on me

163
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,539
and unfortunately
your brother took the brunt of it.

164
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,657
Wrong place at the wrong time.

165
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:40,667
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,963
I appreciate that, but you should
tell Rusty. He's right over there.

167
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,474
I just wanted to say

168
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:58,338
- sorry for hitting you.
- I don't accept your apology,

169
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,103
because three of my friends
had to leave CRU because of you.

170
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:04,174
You're the one that threw it in my face
about Beaver and my girlfriend.

171
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,943
I can't believe you guys put him up

172
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,414
to that just to get revenge
for those stupid expulsions.

173
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:10,549
- Is that what you think ?
- You crossed a line.

174
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:12,674
It seems to really bother you.

175
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:15,643
Too bad your humiliation
will continue

176
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:17,663
when Cappie kicks
your ass at golf tomorrow.

177
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,265
That's not likely because

178
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,875
Cappie picked up a wicked slice
when we played last semester.

179
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:25,420
Last semester ?
You mean freshman year ?

180
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,174
No, I mean last semester,
when Cappie and I buried the hatchet.

181
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:33,057
- You really didn't know.
- No, that is impossible.

182
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,297
Cappie's my friend.
He would've told me.

183
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:38,809
Sounds to me like maybe you two
aren't such good friends after all.

184
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:40,936
So, everything's good ?

185
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,572
Yeah, we're all good.
We're all friends here.

186
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,531
Guess who ?

187
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,243
What are you doing ?

188
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,096
I don't like guessing games

189
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:03,584
or public displays of affection.
I'm a very private person.

190
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,897
But I need a little PDA from my GF

191
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,101
NNT.

192
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,339
That's "Now'N'Then".
I made that one up.

193
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,008
Let's not label what we have,

194
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,177
or initial it, or...

195
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:16,108
speak about it out loud
with other people.

196
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,060
I prefer if we keep
this relationship

197
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,812
in the pantry for now.

198
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,942
All right.
You do admit it's a relationship.

199
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,068
That's...

200
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,167
- a start.
- Then it's settled.

201
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,331
What happens in the pantry

202
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:35,908
stays in the pantry.

203
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,166
"The pageant will consist of
an evening gown competition,

204
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,546
followed by a socially
relevant and intellectually

205
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,548
challenging Q & A".
So we have

206
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,104
to choose one member
to represent the house who

207
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:57,141
- exemplifies all the qualities of...
- I nominate Ashleigh !

208
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,347
I second that !

209
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,095
- I'm retired.
- Yeah, Ash has a pageant past.

210
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,934
I had a respectable career.

211
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,716
I was crowned Little Miss Perfect,

212
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:09,566
Little Miss Princess, Little Miss
Unincorporated Arapahoe County

213
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:12,461
before hanging up my dental
flippers at age six...

214
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:15,030
when the pressure got to me.

215
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:19,743
So...

216
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,003
I would like to nominate
Casey instead.

217
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:24,915
And I'd like to nominate

218
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:26,194
Rebecca !

219
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,297
- Can she even nominate ?
- I accept the nomination.

220
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,842
Really ?
Rebecca, you want to compete ?

221
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,959
- Why wouldn't I ?
- Well, given the whole Beaver thing...

222
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:40,897
It didn't hurt Vanessa
Williams career.

223
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,006
No, not... not that.

224
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:46,900
It's just probably best if you stay out
of the limelight due to all of your...

225
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:49,898
scandals.
We need to win. No offense.

226
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,664
All right. All those in favor

227
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:56,945
of Casey representing ZBZ
in the Greek Goddess pageant ?

228
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,157
OK, great !

229
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,333
This crowd has gone deadly silent.

230
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,377
Cinderella story, out of nowhere,

231
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:13,339
a former greenskeeper
now about to become...

232
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:15,257
the Masters champion.

233
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,639
Put down the club.
I gotta talk to you.

234
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,557
Certainly, Your Eminency.

235
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,779
I spoke to your buddy Evan.
Said you're quite the golfer.

236
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,507
- Gopher ?
- Golfer ! Something about your slice

237
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:32,733
last semester,
when you guys were friends.

238
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:35,989
Yes, Evan and I called a truce,

239
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:38,238
but that was last semester.
Everything's changed.

240
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,906
Were you guys friends when Wade
and the guys got expelled ?

241
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:46,371
You can't tell me about your friendship,
about your revenge plan...

242
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,832
- Trust me, Evan will pay.
- Tell me about your plan.

243
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:50,417
Ronald Reagan.

244
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,045
How does a dead president
help us get revenge on OC ?

245
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,152


246
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,397
Gee,
I wonder who could have done this ?

247
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,816
Jigsaw ?

248
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:18,861
Clearly it was the Omega Chi. They must
have done this so you wouldn't beat

249
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,622
- your pal Evan at golf.
- Ex-pal.

250
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:23,447
They never would have kidnapped us
if you hadn't dragged your feet

251
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:26,745
on your whole revenge plan.
I want to hear Cappie's master plan.

252
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:31,140
- Don't you trust me ?
- No, it's about me and Evan.

253
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:34,044
How many times do I have to get hit
before it's about me too ?

254
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,333
I don't know.
How many times has it been ?

255
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,715
I don't want to drag
other people into it.

256
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,933
Like Wade, Jeremy, and Ferret ?

257
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:44,508
Why don't you just stick
to the science and beaker stuff

258
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,805
- and I'll handle the revenge.
- In the meantime

259
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,851
I'll figure out a way to escape since
you won't share your plan either.

260
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:57,123
Beauty pageants require
contestants to answer

261
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:59,236
important questions
about difficult issues.

262
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,998
- While parading around in swimsuits.
- Not our pageant.

263
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:04,286
Katherine lifted
the swimsuit portion.

264
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:06,039
Why ?

265
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:09,715
Because we're promoting
"female empowerment," not bulimia.

266
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:13,430
My big sis and my ex.

267
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:14,918
So much for sisterhood.

268
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:17,906
Rebecca,
you can't expect me to pick sides.

269
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:22,551
You're right. You should be there for
Evan just as you've been there for me.

270
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,746
But I guess you've been
busy with the pageant.

271
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,596
Why are you so
against me competing ?

272
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,274
- You always have to be the hero.
- It's my responsibility

273
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,934
to get the house back on top.

274
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:32,643
What will you do next year

275
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:36,273
to validate yourself when there are
no ZBZ contests for you to win ?

276
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,371
And you, I know you're the one
who broke into my room

277
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:42,279
and took back the necklace.
I should call the cops.

278
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:47,117
But I won't.
So I guess that makes us even.

279
00:13:57,573 --> 00:14:00,637
So, Adam, Dale has told me
what's going on,

280
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,717
what you're feeling.
Let's talk.

281
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:06,459
I think I might be...

282
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:11,266
gay.

283
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,034
See ?
It's okay to say the word out loud.

284
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:18,440
- What makes you think so ?
- I saw New Moon six times.

285
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,484
Man, that Mormon bunk again ?

286
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,753
Yeah, that is definitely a sign.

287
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:26,266
You know, my pastor says
being gay is lonely,

288
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:29,059
like, you'll never find love,

289
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,911
or have a real relationship.

290
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,831
Well, no offense to your pastor,
but he's an idiot.

291
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,210
I'm in a really good relationship now,
with a guy who just came out, actually.

292
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,678
Just like that ?

293
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,834
He came out
and you found each other ?

294
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,174
No. You can't always count on that.

295
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,343
Usually it's a process.

296
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,531
You have to spend some time
figuring out

297
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:51,300
who you really are before you know
what you want in someone else.

298
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,850
And you and your boyfriend,
you both want the same thing ?

299
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,728
Why don't you bring
Grant to our next coffee,

300
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:01,816
so we can show Adam how happy
and gay and committed you are.

301
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:04,874
Sure.

302
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,948
Yeah, I know he would love
to show you how happy we are.

303
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:17,580
- "Saved By The Bell" !
- Been said !

304
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:20,755
- "The College Years".
- Damn,'90s TV tag is hard.

305
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,770
Excuse me.

306
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,883
I hate to interrupt while you're
curing world hunger and all,

307
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,011
but I haven't been able to reach
Rusty all day and I'm kinda worried.

308
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,014
- Haven't seen him. Try Cappie.
- I haven't seen Cappie either.

309
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,933
Two of your brothers are missing ?

310
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,518
Sounds like it.

311
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,602
- And your golf tournament is today ?
- Yeah, in like an hour.

312
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:42,315
Against your big rival
fraternity the Omega Chis ?

313
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,441
We hate them.

314
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:47,872
So isn't it just a little bit weird
that they're both not here ?

315
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:51,846
We don't have time for questions.
Cap and Rus have been kidnapped

316
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:52,883
by the OC.

317
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:55,787
- What's up with the OC ?
- We think they kidnapped Rus and Cap.

318
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,206
- We'll find them.
- Hurry, it's almost tee time.

319
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,332
- We don't have time for tea !
- Golf, Beav.

320
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:09,342
You know, I can't believe Rebecca
thinks I'm doing this for the credit,

321
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,301
or that I'm having
trouble letting go.

322
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:14,723
You need to stop worrying about that
and start worrying more about <i>smysing.</i>

323
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:17,445
- What ?
- Smiling with your eyes.

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,477
You look like a mime on drugs.

325
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,312
Casey.
I heard you were competing.

326
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:26,192
Would you like to meet your
competition ? This is Eliana Hernandez.

327
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,257
She's a very recent Gamma Psi
transfer from UCLA,

328
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:31,775
but grew up in Caracas, Venezuela.

329
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,949
We were gown shopping.
She's from warm climates

330
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:36,159
and her longest dress
was mid-thigh-high.

331
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:37,579
So against the rules.

332
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,789
We're just on our way
to the tailor now.

333
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,175
She won't need that.
She's so tall and thin

334
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,961
she could wear runway sizes.
Well, good luck tomorrow.

335
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,530
You're the one who's
gonna need the luck.

336
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,275
Venezuela almost always
wins Miss Universe

337
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,417
and California dominates Miss USA,

338
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,458
a Venezuelan-Californian
is virtually unbeatable.

339
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,295
I am all for shenanigans,
but I really have to pee.

340
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,228
Is it manly to pee down your leg
as long as you're not scared ?

341
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:15,537
Because I'm not scared, by the way.
How'd you do that ?

342
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,669
This stuff dissolves adhesive.

343
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,582
Looks like my beakers and my science
stuff came in pretty handy ?

344
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,965
- Say hi to Evan for me.
- Wait ! No

345
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,335
Rus ! Not funny.

346
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:30,255
Rusty, come on.
Rusty !

347
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,221
Who's holding that WD-40 now ?

348
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,472
Say it, Cap. Say it...

349
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:41,205
Fine !
You're holding the WD-40 now.

350
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,714
Come on, take this off.

351
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,227
- It's the Omega Chi.
- God, I have to pee.

352
00:17:58,714 --> 00:18:01,662
Rusty and Cappie,
we're here to rescue you !

353
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:04,133
Where'd they go ?

354
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:08,485
Are the brothers gonna get mad when they
find out it was us who kidnapped them ?

355
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,110
And then lost them ?

356
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,049
I think I peed a little.

357
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,779


358
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,368
Maybe there's a gas
station down the road.

359
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:27,688
- But you just went.
- So we can use their phone.

360
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:32,694
- I think it'll be faster this way.
- Well, I trust my instincts.

361
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,345
Is it really that big of a deal
that we go my way ?

362
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:38,467
- I mean, back there, who was holding...
- The WD-40, yeah, I know.

363
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,118
But I'm the president's house.

364
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,167
If I have to keep something from my
little bro for the sake of the national

365
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,623
/house security,
then you have to accept that.

366
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,001
Maybe I'm tired of being
your little brother.

367
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,801
- You'd rather be my little sister ?
- Fine. Go your wrong way.

368
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:53,757
- I'm gonna go mine.
- Fine ! But I'm more fine.

369
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:55,883
- Finer.
- The finest !

370
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:12,448
- How'd it go with that kid ?
- I told him

371
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:15,028
that you would come along next time.
I mean, if you can.

372
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,232
Sure, no problem.

373
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,365
So, what's the verdict
with the cruise ?

374
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:26,362
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't really want to spend

375
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:29,332
Spring Break with a bunch
of single gay strangers.

376
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:33,136
You'd rather spend it with thousands of
drunk homophobic straight dudes and...

377
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:35,539
girls with low self-esteem
and wet T-shirts ?

378
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:38,009
No, I would rather spend it with you

379
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,429
and our friends rather than...
spend a week on the gay Love Boat.

380
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,598
Fine.

381
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:46,059
Then maybe you should go
to Myrtle Beach, I'll go on the cruise.

382
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,651
Look, I didn't mean that.

383
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,155
Are you sure ? Because I'm
starting to wonder if you wish

384
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:03,233
you had the chance to explore
more of the single gay world

385
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:06,570
before settling down
in a relationship with me.

386
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,170
Never should have let your
brother wander off alone.

387
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,033
He couldn't have gone too far.

388
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:19,839
Unless the OC nabbed him again. Either
way, we're missing the golf tournament.

389
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:21,928
They'll have better luck
with your beauty pageant.

390
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,287
Maybe if we kidnap Eliana Hernandez.

391
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:28,091
She's Gamma Psi's pageant
contestant from Venezuela

392
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:30,477
who transferred to CRU from UCLA.

393
00:20:31,157 --> 00:20:33,272
A Cali-zuelan ?
You're screwed.

394
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,824
I mean, I'm sure you'll beat her.

395
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:39,769
Maybe I should let Rebecca compete,

396
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:41,957
so she can lose to that supermodel.

397
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:44,200
Serve her right
for being such a bitch earlier.

398
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,581
She's pissy 'cause she wants
to compete in the pageant

399
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:49,206
- and I didn't support her.
- Why not ?

400
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:50,665
Because...

401
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,283
scandals don't help
pageant contestants win.

402
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:55,627
They help them get on
Perez and Larry King,

403
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:58,130
and this is our last chance
to put the house back on top.

404
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,671
Are you sure it's not your last chance
to save the day ?

405
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:04,800
You've done so much for the house, maybe
you don't always need to be the hero.

406
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,175
There's Rusty.

407
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:14,280
Say it, Spitter.

408
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:16,616
Who has the low-emissions
vehicle now ?

409
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,782
- Yeah.
- Nice !

410
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:27,907
Why didn't Kappa Tau show up ?

411
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:36,192
Doodie !
Stop the match !

412
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,995
- You gotta clean the course.
- We're done, you jackass.

413
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,264
Still no word
on the Kappa Tau player.

414
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:43,050
Yeah, we're here !

415
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,960
- Everybody hold up !
- Stop playing ! Cap is ready.

416
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:49,751
It's too late.
Sorry.

417
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,309
Kappa Taus are disqualified.

418
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,948
The OC need to be disqualified.

419
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:54,678
- They kidnapped me.
- Yeah, right.

420
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,739
Don't try and talk your way out of this
with that fancy talk you got.

421
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:00,350
Obviously it was you.
We were transported in a black SUV,

422
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,218
just like the one Trip drives.

423
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:04,633
Like that one ?

424
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,868
No, but that's Dumptruck's.

425
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:11,494
My God.

426
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,790
We were kidnapped
by our own pledges.

427
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,578
We meant to get you back in time,
but when we got to the shed,

428
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,121
- you guys were gone.
- You made me miss the whole tourney.

429
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:21,756
We only wanted to make our mark,
like Spitter's pledge class.

430
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,549
Nice work, losers.

431
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,972
<i>Couldn't have done it
without you guys. Thanks !</i>

432
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:35,465
Chest out.

433
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:36,739
Chin up.

434
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,399
Chest out !
<i>Smyse.</i>

435
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:41,725
Chest out !

436
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,736
OK, so we need more <i>smysing.</i>

437
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,295
<i>Smyse</i> like you mean it.

438
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,285
- Gown in the house.
- Thank you so much for picking it up.

439
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,498
No problem. But I thought
you were supposed to wear

440
00:22:50,623 --> 00:22:54,026
- a floor-length evening gown.
- What did they do ?

441
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:56,538
They were supposed to take off
two inches, not two feet !

442
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:57,901
They said a little blonde

443
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,336
came in for new measurements.
I thought they meant you.

444
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,546
It was probably Natalie. This would be
a floor-length gown on her.

445
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,134
What are we gonna do ?
We're sunk.

446
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:09,422
I've a few gowns
that'd be perfect for this competition.

447
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:11,514
- Really ? From what ?
- From being rich.

448
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:15,100
I can win the pageant. I've been walking
around and fake smiling for years.

449
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:22,899
Forget it. Thought maybe you'd
finally give me a chance,

450
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,651
but... whatever.

451
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:27,152
Wait.

452
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,833
If you really want to do it...

453
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,701
then I guess it's all riding on you.

454
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,544


455
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:46,049
Testing... One... One...
two... two...

456
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,341
Hello, everybody

457
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,488
and welcome to CRU's Greek Goddess

458
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,842
of Brains and Beauty competition.

459
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,266
Now, this is not a night about skin

460
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,476
or swimsuits

461
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,103
and it's not about
the objectification of women !

462
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:06,778
We can just fill in those gaps here.

463
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:09,404
Come on forward.
Let's fill in the gaps.

464
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:10,865
Thank you, gentlemen.

465
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,122
Classic two-step heel plant.

466
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,889
With pivot.
She's a pro.

467
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,828
Come on, slip !

468
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:02,958
<i>Slut !</i>

469
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,522
- Tramp !
- Skank !

470
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:13,969
Shut the hell up !
Not cool !

471
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,048
Hi. Where's Grant ?

472
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:34,615
He will not be joining us today.

473
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,451
We're kinda having some issues.

474
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,169
What kind of issues ?

475
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,112
Well, we had a disagreement

476
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:42,705
over a gay cruise.

477
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,196
Calvin, please come with me
for a second.

478
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,491
- What ?
- You're supposed to show Adam

479
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:55,673
that being gay means you can be
in a healthy, committed relationship.

480
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,097
- I know, but...
- Whereas the gay cruise

481
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,312
- promotes promiscuity.
- Dale, that's not...

482
00:26:00,437 --> 00:26:03,681
I saw the pictures. All those shaved
calves and snug swim trunks.

483
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,660
You're supposed to help me,
not betray me like some gay Judas.

484
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:08,357
No, you asked me to help Adam,

485
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,611
who should know all the facets
of gay life not some idealized version

486
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,859
or the stereotypes. By the way, thanks
for your concern about me and Grant.

487
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,074
Come on !

488
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,048
It's possible that my relationship

489
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:26,337
with Grant may not make it
in the long run.

490
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:29,173
It's seem like
we want different things.

491
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,547
Or, they might make up tonight,

492
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,715
chastely.

493
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,725
Relationships are hard,
gay or straight.

494
00:26:38,203 --> 00:26:40,106
You can't hide your feelings
in the closet

495
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,060
and settle for something
that isn't right for you.

496
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,085
Which is part of coming out.

497
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:56,214
You let your brothers trash Rebecca

498
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:58,745
in front of the entire Greek system.
Real classy, Chambers.

499
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,895
- Look, I told them to stop.
- They wouldn't have started it if they

500
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,081
- weren't taking their cue from you.
- Maybe I did punch the wrong guy.

501
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,657
Maybe you did.

502
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:10,278
Jeez. You were the one
who stabbed him in the back.

503
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:13,145
He wasn't the one who slept
with your girlfriend.

504
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,120
You're gonna hit me again ?

505
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:16,788
Do it.

506
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,171
My face is numb from all
the other times anyway.

507
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:23,761
All right.

508
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,357
- Impressive.
- How can you be friends with that guy ?

509
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,373
Because I thought that he could change
and be the guy that I wanted him to be.

510
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,030
You don't trust me,
even though I always have your back.

511
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,992
Why won't you tell me
your plan for revenge ?

512
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,680
Because there isn't one.

513
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:44,980
- Seriously ?
- I have nothing, except for

514
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:47,847
- a small case of revenge block.
- You think I couldn't help you ?

515
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:50,252
I didn't want to disappoint you.
It had to be perfect.

516
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,960
I don't have perfect in me now.

517
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:54,964
But I know that. You're one of
the biggest screw-ups in the school

518
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:58,676
- Thank you very much, my friend.
- I also know that if I have a problem

519
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,333
I can always come to you.
I just wish you felt the same.

520
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:06,771
Quit being my hero
and start being my friend.

521
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:24,410
Boys can be so stupid and immature.
Don't listen to any of that.

522
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:29,109
I bet you didn't expect to see this.

523
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:31,584
I really wish you,
of all people, hadn't.

524
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:35,365
Well, it's nice to see
that you have emotions.

525
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,465
And tear ducts.

526
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,094
Why would you want to put
yourself out there like that ?

527
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:45,167
Because I wanted to show everyone
that I didn't give a crap

528
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:47,792
- about how people see me.
- Everyone ?

529
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,727
Or Evan ?

530
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,151
I mean, do you still care
about him ?

531
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:57,172
Yes.

532
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:00,549
And I hate that.

533
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:03,491
I just thought that because...

534
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,551
he's different and messed-up,
like me...

535
00:29:08,662 --> 00:29:10,220
that he'd get me.

536
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,190
It was stupid.

537
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:19,618
And now I'm screwing it up
for the whole house, too.

538
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,553
You were right.

539
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:27,782
You were a much better
choice for this.

540
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:32,149
This competition is supposed
to be about confidence

541
00:29:32,274 --> 00:29:34,074
and elegance and strength.

542
00:29:34,837 --> 00:29:37,942
The fact that you even went out there,
after everything that's happened...

543
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:43,281
I can't think of anyone who's
all of those things more than you.

544
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:45,199
You're the perfect choice.

545
00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:52,081
I don't think I can go out there
for the final question round.

546
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:53,457
You can.

547
00:29:54,202 --> 00:29:56,573
I know we've had our differences,

548
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:58,796
and sometimes,
you really have pissed me off.

549
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:03,884
But you're the future of ZBZ.

550
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:06,971
We may or may not win tonight,

551
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:11,456
but I know that ZBZ will be
number one again,

552
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:13,745
and when that day happens...

553
00:30:14,264 --> 00:30:15,896
it'll be because of you.

554
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:19,968
Now, go out there

555
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:22,486
and kick some Cali-zuelan ass.

556
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,626


557
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,946
Our next contestant is
a communications major.

558
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,339
We have Gamma Psi's
Eliana Hernandez.

559
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:46,512
Eliana, what is
your favorite class ?

560
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:51,020
I like English very much.

561
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:55,810
Thank you for me liking America.

562
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,397
Please note,
English is her fourth language.

563
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,940
Very impressive.

564
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:03,151
Moving on. Our next contestant
is a psychology major

565
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:06,438
with a political upbringing
and a passion for calligraphy.

566
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:08,463
We have ZBZ's Rebecca Logan.

567
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,583
ZBZ,

568
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:22,026
what is your take on the current debate
of healthcare reform in our country...

569
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:24,548
- This is rigged.
- Thank you, Katherine,

570
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:28,029
and thank you to the pageant organizers
and all those voting.

571
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,634
This is an issue that's been debated
to death,

572
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,057
which is where a lot of people
will end up without it.

573
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:37,188
And one that's been challenged with
a great deal of hypocrisy.

574
00:31:37,804 --> 00:31:39,204
But you know what ?

575
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,405
Let's focus
on that word : hypocrisy.

576
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,654
Here's an example :

577
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,588
How girls are held to an impossible
sexual standard.

578
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,100
How a girl can be called a "slut"

579
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:55,454
while a guy's applauded
for his conquests.

580
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:59,405
And when she wants to seem strong
through the name-calling,

581
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,668
she's a bitch.

582
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:04,255
And it's not just the guys
who are saying this, ladies.

583
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:07,264
But it's important
to call out such hypocrisy,

584
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:10,678
because we're not actually gods
and goddesses.

585
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:12,753
We're humans...

586
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:14,723
who make mistakes.

587
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:18,107
Hopefully we learn from them
and move on,

588
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:20,145
pulling ourselves back up.

589
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:23,023
Recently, I made a mistake.

590
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,853
But there's only one person here who has
the right

591
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,678
to speak to me about it.

592
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,580
As for everyone else...

593
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:32,658
I'm Rebecca Logan,

594
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,076
and I'm a ZBZ.

595
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,744
And I'm damn proud of both.

596
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:54,326
Thank you all for voting.

597
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:56,365
Didn't they all look fantastic

598
00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:58,142
and empowered ?

599
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,185
Now I, for one, am a firm believer

600
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,522
that we are all winners here,
but unfortunately,

601
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,553
that is not how a competition works.

602
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:07,500
I'd like start
by announcing the winner

603
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,533
of the Greek
Gods of Golf competition.

604
00:33:09,658 --> 00:33:11,322
The lowest score for this evening,

605
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:13,631
and this year's Greek God...

606
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,552
is Evan Chambers from Omega Chi.

607
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,466
And this year's

608
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:31,967
Greek Goddess...

609
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,646
is Rebecca Logan from ZBZ.

610
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:10,172
- Congrats. I thought what you said...
- Save it.

611
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,775
What do you want now, a hug ?

612
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,784
I want a chance to kick your ass
in golf. Night golf.

613
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:36,159
Why should I ?
I already won the IFC golf tournament.

614
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,534
By default. You didn't beat me.

615
00:34:40,776 --> 00:34:43,956
All right. Yeah, fine. I'll play.
What do we get if we win ?

616
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,625
Pickle's uncle's beach house
he lent us for the spring break.

617
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,627
- It's got eight bedrooms...
- No.

618
00:34:49,448 --> 00:34:51,421
- And if we lose ?
- We're not gonna lose.

619
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:54,823
- I know what I'm doing.
- And if you win, however unlikely ?

620
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,219
We get your house for 24 hours,

621
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,930
for the most badass party
and you're not invited.

622
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,144
Don't even, Chambers.
They'll trash our house.

623
00:35:02,758 --> 00:35:04,340
Pumpkinhead's scared.

624
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:07,293
Just listen to me this once, please.
Do not bet the beach house.

625
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:09,238
It's too late. That's a deal.

626
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,026
Good.

627
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:28,479
So you want to go...

628
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:31,283
check out
the whole golf death match thing ?

629
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:34,089
Actually, I was thinking about heading
over to Gentlemen's Choice,

630
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,477
just to grab a beer, if that's cool.

631
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,597
You don't have to ask me.

632
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,572
That's what you want to do.

633
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:43,932
I don't know what I want.

634
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:50,258
I think you do.

635
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:53,551
I think that you want to be single.

636
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,460
That's so untrue.

637
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,273
Come on, I don't even care
about that stupid gay cruise.

638
00:35:58,398 --> 00:36:01,909
Come on, Grant. This isn't about
the cruise or Gentlemen's Choice.

639
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,639
You came out of the closet right
into a relationship with me,

640
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,247
and, you think you missed out.

641
00:36:07,955 --> 00:36:10,100
You want to know what
it's like to be single.

642
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:15,330
Maybe.

643
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:16,381
A little.

644
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:22,504
I'm so grateful for everything you did,
helping me come out.

645
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:27,184
I love you.

646
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:29,767
I love you, too.

647
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:31,855
But I don't want grateful.

648
00:36:33,306 --> 00:36:35,206
I need to be with someone...

649
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,790
who wants to be with me...

650
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,230
just me.

651
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:43,523
Are you ready for that ?

652
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:48,789
I don't know what to say.

653
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,961
I think you just did.

654
00:36:56,738 --> 00:36:58,004
So that's it ?

655
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,133
I mean, we're breaking up ?

656
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,711
Yeah, I guess we are.

657
00:37:10,238 --> 00:37:11,691
This is so weird.

658
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,283
I just want to say...

659
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:19,746
thank you for everything.

660
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,090
You don't have to thank me.

661
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:23,215
Come on.

662
00:37:42,856 --> 00:37:43,899
All right,

663
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:46,641
so you guys ready to lose
that kick-ass Spring Break suite ?

664
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,892
Are you ready for 50 drunk Kts puking
and peeing in your house ?

665
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,393
Just in your room.

666
00:37:52,157 --> 00:37:54,362
All right, guys.
I have your balls.

667
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,941
The blue ball's yours, naturally.

668
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,251
Thank you.

669
00:37:59,423 --> 00:38:00,903
It's a one-shot challenge

670
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,280
with nine-irons.
The closest one to the hole wins.

671
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,566
Are you okay ?

672
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:07,871
Yeah.

673
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,536
Grant and I just broke up.

674
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:11,803
I'm sorry to hear that.

675
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,645
And it's...

676
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,442
in the water !

677
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:41,777
Really ?

678
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,102
Is it ?

679
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:45,406
No, I wish.

680
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,662
It's actually about two feet
from the pin.

681
00:38:56,194 --> 00:38:58,944
All right.
Well, if there are no objections,

682
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:00,671
I'd like Rusty to swing for me.

683
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,726
What you doing ?
You're the golfer.

684
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,046
You're my little brother.

685
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:11,646
You know how important this is to me.
You'll do the right thing.

686
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,742
Just be the ball, okay ?
Be the ball.

687
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:39,020
It's kinda hard when
you're talking like that.

688
00:40:05,473 --> 00:40:06,653
It's right there.

689
00:40:16,768 --> 00:40:18,573
Attention, ladies and...

690
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:19,499
ladies.

691
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,753
I would like to present you
with this year's Greek Goddess :

692
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,422
ZBZ's very own Rebecca Logan !

693
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:28,737
And since we're all here,

694
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:30,858
it is tradition

695
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:33,055
for the seniors to give
a gift to the house,

696
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,745
and we would like to
give our gift early.

697
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,522
Thanks to all of
your hard work this year,

698
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:40,256
and to Rebecca's win today,

699
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:41,956
our gift to you is that

700
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:44,413
ZBZ is once again
the number one house !

701
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:48,799
And we got you T-shirts !

702
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:50,739
So you can flaunt it !

703
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,334
Laura, I've been thinking.

704
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:06,750
I enjoy our time together,
but I don't want to hide it

705
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,629
behind graham crackers
and canned tuna.

706
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:12,094
You know, I want to take it
outside the pantry.

707
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,641
No.

708
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:19,857
Sorry.

709
00:41:26,205 --> 00:41:27,881
Excuse me, everybody.

710
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,701
Attention, please.
Laura and I will no longer be involved

711
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,740
in a semi-sexual relationship.

712
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:35,935
So, as of right now,

713
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,049
Dale Kettlewell's
back on the market.

714
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,508
All right, everyone gather around.

715
00:41:52,085 --> 00:41:53,218
Spitter, come here.

716
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:07,916
Look at your faces.

717
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,944
- What's going on ?
- We wanted Evan to win.

718
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,112
Seriously ?

719
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,489
- So you don't suck at golf ?
- I suck.

720
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,283
That was part of the plan.

721
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,936
So we wanted to give
them the beach house ?

722
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:20,248
Which we'll use

723
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,706
as the greatest revenge
KT has ever known.

724
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,168
Ladies and gentlemen,
as president it is my job

725
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,920
to nominate the one man
who can lead us to victory

726
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,047
and avenge our fallen comrades.

727
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:32,591
What ?

728
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,891
My friend...

729
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:40,557
and our new revenge chair,
Rusty Cartwright !

730
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,461
- Bring us to the promised land.
- Brothers...

731
00:42:57,198 --> 00:42:58,283
Phase one

732
00:42:58,451 --> 00:42:59,409
is complete.

733
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,878
Phase two :

734
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,666
Myrtle Beach.
