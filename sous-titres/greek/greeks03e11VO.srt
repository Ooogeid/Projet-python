1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:01,249
Previously...

2
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,836
Your final projects
were all so good,

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,304
that we need more time to
thoroughly evaluate each one.

4
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:10,384
As a result, we'll announce
the winner next semester.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,178
Enjoy your crickets, losers.

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,556
- The Omega Chis pranked us ?
- The old crickets down the chimney gag.

7
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,339
I poured my heart out to you
at the end of the world party

8
00:00:18,464 --> 00:00:20,811
- and you didn't come after me.
- But I'm here now.

9
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,231
What you guys need
is a common enemy.

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,150
We get our houses to
team up against him.

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,652
Bond over our hatred
for Huck together.

12
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:30,464
Guys, we can't hold this forever !

13
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,280
- They need our help up there !
- Run.

14
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,658
No, no, no, no !

15
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:37,497
- You planned this ?
- Yes ! We left you guys holding

16
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:40,665
- the cart and we called the police.
- I had to do it to get my house back.

17
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:43,708
And your solution was to get
three of my brothers expelled.

18
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:45,960
<i>I could really use
a friend right now.</i>

19
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,765
The judges scores are in.

20
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,894
The winner of this year's
SongFest is Gamma Psi.

21
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:58,098
The judges gave us 95,
95, 99 and a zero.

22
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:01,268
He also gave the Gamma Psis a 100.
We have our proof.

23
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,004
Did you remember
to blow out the candle ?

24
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,693
We the sisters of Zeta Beta Zeta

25
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:11,962
promise never to tell anyone
what happened tonight.

26
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,595
I'm telling you,
the hole has to be deeper

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,706
or it'll come up after
the first rainfall.

28
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,522
Please say you learned
that from a scary movie.

29
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,894
- Would you stop eating ?!
- I can't.

30
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:30,094
Guys !

31
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:34,769
Once we're done here,
we can put this behind us forever.

32
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,896
No, not there. There.

33
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,524
It's good to be back, right ?
Gotta love spring.

34
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,161
Fresh start, wipe the slate clean.

35
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:55,367
Yeah, and with all the stress
of burning down the Gamma Psi house,

36
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:58,242
I couldn't eat over winter break
so I look fantastic.

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,979
We don't know it was us, so...

38
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:05,540
Hi, Laura !

39
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:07,690
Is it brighter in here ?

40
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:10,279
The Gamma Psi house used to
block the sun this time of day.

41
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:12,150
We should get used
to the brightness.

42
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,491
That's what it'll be like
when they interrogate us.

43
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:18,041
- Did you tell anyone what we did ?
- I didn't tell anyone, a,

44
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,347
because we don't know we did
anything and b, we have a pact.

45
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,660
The pact.

46
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,778
Cappie ! Where are you ?

47
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:31,249
<i>I wanted to get a jump on the semester.
I'm buying my books.</i>

48
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:33,919
Really ? You do know that comic
books don't count, right ?

49
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,970
<i>Are you mad at me ?</i>

50
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:40,009
No, I just thought you'd
be here for a romantic

51
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:42,478
"I haven't seen you
in three weeks", kiss.

52
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:44,580
<i>And catch your cooties ? No thanks.</i>

53
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:46,831
You're so full of...

54
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,929
- Hello, Clarice.
- Oh, my gosh !

55
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:01,930
Oh, my gosh !

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,889
- I'm so...
- These are for you.

57
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:05,014
Thank you.

58
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:07,455
Oh, my God.

59
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,805
- Welcome back, Case.
- Hi.

60
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,656
Hi.

61
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:18,363
- Dale, I'm home.
- Hello ?

62
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:20,925
Excuse me...

63
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,511
Who are you guys ?

64
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:28,666
Look who's back !
I see you've met my interns.

65
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,127
- That's Todd and Tim.
- Actually, I'm Tim.

66
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,030
- Darn it, I keep doing that.
- You have interns ?

67
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,840
Yeah, they're freshmen who got
in touch with me after the break.

68
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,226
Apparently, they were dazzled
by my project 

69
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,845
and my performance at the Battle Bot
competition, and wanted

70
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,265
- to be part of Team Kettlewell.
- Word gets around ?

71
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,541
What can I say ?

72
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,602
They think I'm gonna win the Gary Wyatt
grant, 40 G's is a big chunk of cheese.

73
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,881
- When do you think we'll hear ?
- It could be today,

74
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:53,482
could be next month. All the officials
said was this semester.

75
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,650
This meatloaf's moldy.
Want me to throw it out ?

76
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,020
Or, we could take it to the lab,
determine its genus.

77
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:03,116
- Go crazy, fellas.
- I gotta get going to the KT house.

78
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,243
Rusty Wait.

79
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:06,620
Are we OK ?

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,081
No hard feelings, or anything ?

81
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:12,877
We're fine. It's just three of my KT
brothers got expelled last semester.

82
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,629
Really. Cappie didn't mention that
in his Christmas newsletter.

83
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,506
He did have a fantastic
date-nut bar recipe.

84
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,747
So I gotta go. My house needs me.

85
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:29,142
So who wants to learn the
chemical compound of dust bunnies ?

86
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:32,562
All right, come on.

87
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:37,095
- = 311 =-
"I Know What You Did Last Semester"

88
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,680
Kappa Team

89
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,802
- Home sweet home.
- Happy last semester !

90
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,723
Wait, why am I peppier than you ?

91
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:55,209
Are you worried about the
fire like everyone else here ?

92
00:04:56,268 --> 00:04:58,867
No, I wasn't until
you just mentioned it.

93
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:01,466
Sorry. What's wrong ?

94
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,599
- Fisher and I broke up.
- Wait ! What ? When ?

95
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,888
When we talked on Christmas,
everything was great.

96
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,640
It just didn't work out.

97
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,434
- Flowers.
- Do you want to talk about it ?

98
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:14,729
Flowers. Who are they from ?

99
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:17,289
- Cappie.
- And our front yard.

100
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:20,764
- Same old Cappie.
- Or, not.

101
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:24,073
Cappie and I talked
constantly over break.

102
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,253
He even called to wish
me a happy Boxing Day,

103
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:27,843
whatever that is.

104
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,119
I really think it's
going to work this time.

105
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:31,662
Then I do too.

106
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:34,548
It's an exciting way to
start out the new semester.

107
00:05:34,673 --> 00:05:37,887
You've got a boyfriend,
I'm single, we're arsonists.

108
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:40,046
We really need to stop saying that.

109
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,270
We don't know we're responsible.
Which is good,

110
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,509
because if we were,
we'd be totally screwed.

111
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

112
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,138
You girls seem nervous and guilty.

113
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:52,768
- We were just talking about the fire.
- Oh that ?

114
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:56,438
You're not nervous ?
You were the one that lit the candle.

115
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,741
We don't know that's
what caused the fire.

116
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,526
Why would I be nervous ?
When we were leaving the Gamma Psi house

117
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,655
I noticed how tacky the wallpaper was,
which made me think his house blows,

118
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,407
which reminded me to tell
Ashleigh to blow out the candle.

119
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,618
- Who wants to hit the bookstore ?
- You did not !

120
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,852
OK, let's not keep pointing
fingers at each other.

121
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:15,847
Says the woman whose idea it was to
go over there in the first place.

122
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:18,334
OK, you managed to
remember that correctly.

123
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,023
Fine, I will talk to Katherine

124
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:22,431
find out how the investigation's going.
We'll find out

125
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:25,488
we're not to blame and we can go on
with our lives. So can we just relax

126
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:26,863
and stay calm ?

127
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,518
Maybe we should
have a wake for Wade,

128
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,413
- help us get over the loss.
- What about Jeremy and Ferret ?

129
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:39,188
They're gone, too. And Heath.

130
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,607
Because "wake for Wade"
is faster to say.

131
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,860
- And it's alliteradation.
- Close.

132
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,930
We should do something
to memorialize the guys.

133
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:50,092
Or we could slaughter Evan
Chambers and the Omega Chis.

134
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:51,817
That would perk us up.

135
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,037
In due time, Beav.

136
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:58,708
What do you
think you're doing, pledge ?

137
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,044
- I was going to sit down.
- But Wade sat there.

138
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:02,790
Sorry.

139
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,258
Wade sat there, too.

140
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,369
Wade probably sat
everywhere in the house.

141
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,137
Then it looks like he's standing.

142
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:14,043
We should choose a replacement
for Wade as pledge educator.

143
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:18,562
Maybe we don't need
a pledge educator this year.

144
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,972
Why don't we initiate all of them, that
way we don't have to worry about it.

145
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:25,297
Jeremy loved initiation,
especially the secret knock.

146
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:29,725
Man !

147
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:32,325
I could be pledge educator.

148
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,336
No offense, Spitter,
but you're no Wade.

149
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,907
No, but I am me.

150
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,832
I feel terrible I wasn't there
the night Wade and the guys got busted.

151
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,702
Come on, gimme a chance.

152
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,036
All right, fine.

153
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,041
By the power vested in me,

154
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,551
I now pronounce you pledge educator.

155
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:02,221
- History of Pornography ?
- Come on. I need this to graduate.

156
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,899
It's the douchebags.

157
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,802
I guess the Cold War
with the KT house is over

158
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:12,975
'cause of that prank.
Now it's just open hostility.

159
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,869
Your boyfriend was involved too.

160
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,094
That maybe so.
But he wasn't president.

161
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:19,748
Listen, I didn't mean
for those guys to get expelled,

162
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,500
but I had to do something to
get control of the house back.

163
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,853
- You get that, right ?
- Yeah, I do.

164
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:28,123
It just wish that it hadn't
happened the way it did.

165
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:32,227
But, I guess the silver lining is
that Grant finally feels good enough 

166
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:35,046
with the brothers that he's ready
to come out to the house.

167
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,527
He decided to tell his
family over the holidays

168
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:40,102
so now we're gonna
come out to the house and finally have

169
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,904
a normal relationship.

170
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,406
- Congratulations, man.
- Yeah.

171
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:47,731
So what should we do for that ?
You wanna have like a...

172
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,313
like a brunch ? Or...

173
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:52,500
No, I think low key is better.
Don't wanna make a big deal of it.

174
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,899
But it's good to know
you're in my corner for sure.

175
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:56,074
Absolutely.

176
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:00,079
Forgot, Byzantine Architecture.
I'd rather have your class.

177
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:13,073
- See you around.
- Yeah.

178
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:19,213
We'll have the chapter meeting
in the ping-pong room of my dorm,

179
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:21,112
but we have to be out
by eight o'clock

180
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:24,229
because it's reserved
for a pizza pow-wow. OK, bye.

181
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,417
- Hi, Casey, how are you ?
- Good. How's it going ?

182
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,351
Just fantastic. The university here

183
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:32,655
put me in this dorm room without wi-fi,
skateboarding stickers on my bed

184
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,824
and a roommate who rages all
night and sleeps all day.

185
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:40,746
Angie, it is 4:00 pm.

186
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,956
Shut up, Mom !

187
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:47,760
I know you're here about SongFest.

188
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,838
And despite the fact
that my clipboard

189
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:53,733
and all worldly possessions are
nothing but a pile smoldering ash,

190
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,802
I am still looking
into the situation.

191
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,714
Actually, I came here
to see how you were doing

192
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,399
and to tell you how very,

193
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:04,144
very sorry I am about the fire.

194
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,339
That is very oughtful

195
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:08,941
of you, Casey.

196
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,735
Did they find out how it happened ?
Faulty wiring ?

197
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:12,903
Oily rags ?

198
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,364
No, they are still investigating.

199
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:18,057
Still ? Seriously ?

200
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,302
That's gotta be hard for you.

201
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:26,057
In the meantime, Pan-Hellenic
and IFC are organizing

202
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:29,711
a "Help Us Rebuild Our Castle"
Fairy Tale Fundraiser Ball

203
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,748
at the Canyon Lake Lodge.
So, I really hope we can count on ZBZ

204
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:34,508
to be there and give us support.

205
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,343
Anything to help Gamma Psis.

206
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:44,783
All right. Hey guys.

207
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,895
- Rebound.
- Shoot !

208
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,564
Shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot !

209
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,282
My kindergarten teacher
used to do that.

210
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,992
I'm your new pledge educator.

211
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,386
So, if someone could tell me
where Wade left off,

212
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,189
maybe...

213
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,873
Yeah, Marbles.

214
00:11:11,177 --> 00:11:12,838
OK. Any other questions ?

215
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:14,799
Anthony Hopkins.

216
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,968
Can you teach us how to make
a stink bomb for Omega Chi ?

217
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,972
Actually, my job is to
teach you about

218
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,394
KT history and how to steer you

219
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:27,728
through your pledgeship.

220
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,319
OK, hey, guys... guys.

221
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:39,238
I'd appreciate it if I could just get
a little ounce of attention.

222
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:42,951
There you go.

223
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,819
How'bout we find out
what the chalice means

224
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:48,090
on the Kappa Tau crest.

225
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:51,123
Go ahead with your little lesson,
Spitter.

226
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:53,503
They'll listen now. Won't they ?

227
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,379
- Won't they ?
- Yes, sir.

228
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:01,595
OK, so first order of business :

229
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,890
We're all gonna go to the
Gamma Psi Fairy Tale Ball.

230
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:08,435
So we can dress up and be reminded
of how we burned their house down ?

231
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,188
We don't know that.
They're still investigating.

232
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:15,672
Besides, fairy tales are such crap.
Sleeping Beauty was based on a story 

233
00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:18,695
about a girl who was violated
in her sleep and then ended up pregnant.

234
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,973
There's nothing sweet about that.

235
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:31,124
Hello, fireman, sir.
How can we help you here at ZBZ ?

236
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,536
I'm going to all the houses
to drop off fire safety pamphlets,

237
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,539
in light of what
happened at Gamma Psi.

238
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:39,175
So you guys are done
with the investigation ?

239
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,069
Yes, and we determined the fire
was started accidentally by a candle.

240
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:47,859
Look, I'm sure there are lots
of candles in that house.

241
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:50,909
Like in a bathroom. Or the kitchen.

242
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:53,031
There were.
But the one that started the fire

243
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:55,315
was in the common room.
Jasmine, I believe.

244
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,194
You ladies have to be careful
about these kinds of things.

245
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,655
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

246
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,940
- We burnt down a use !
- But he called it an accident.

247
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:14,115
Ashleigh, you're off the hook !

248
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,156
Casey, What do we do ?

249
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,967
No one knows we were there.
And no one's broken the pact.

250
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:23,218
So...

251
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,012
We're going to have
to go to that ball.

252
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:41,402
What's up, Cap ?

253
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,198
- Cappie, can I talk to you ?
- Can we do it later ?

254
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,798
I'm meeting your sister for costume
shopping, if I'm late

255
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:50,425
she'll make me go to this ball
as the least attractive dwarf

256
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,059
which is Sneezy, so...

257
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:53,915
Why'd you tell Beaver
to babysit me ?

258
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,912
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't get eaten alive.

259
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,548
Our pledges are cuddly,
but they are also vicious.

260
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:03,132
OK, they won't listen to me
if they don't think I'm in charge.

261
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,761
And I can't be in charge when you don't
let me. I need to do this my way.

262
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,764
- And what, exactly, is your way ?
- I'm thinking about getting a whistle.

263
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,600
Add some orange slices and you've
got yourself a youth soccer team.

264
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,602
Come on.

265
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:16,436
All right, fine. No more Beaver.

266
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,732
Welcome back.

267
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,409
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

268
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,040
- You put the picture out.
- Yeah, it seemed appropriate.

269
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,084
And there's another
photo op coming up.

270
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,456
There's this fairy
tale ball for Gamma Psi

271
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:44,095
and I was thinking we could go
as Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

272
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,198
People always thought they were
a gay couple in fairy tale land anyway.

273
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,259
About that.

274
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,094
I didn't exactly come out
to my family when I was home.

275
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:59,432
- But you said...
- I wanted to.

276
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:03,298
But... there was always a visitor,

277
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:05,802
and the game was on and...

278
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:08,777
I don't know,

279
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:11,618
it wasn't the right time.

280
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,560
So I guess there's probably
never gonna be a right time

281
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,428
to tell the guys either.

282
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:21,093
I'm just not ready yet.

283
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,501
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,518
That doesn't need to change
anything between us though, right ?

285
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:30,720
It kind of changes everything.

286
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,288
We've been together
for three months.

287
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:36,369
And what, we're just supposed
to wait another three months ?

288
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:44,674
I'm not gonna force you to do anything
you're not ready to do, but...

289
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:50,126
I can't stay in a relationship
that has to be a secret.

290
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,910
- What does that mean ?
- It means that as much

291
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,428
as it kills me...

292
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,000
I think it's over.

293
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:15,348
How about I go as the Big Bad Wolf

294
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,565
and you can go as the grandma ?

295
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,981
The whole reason sororities
throw parties

296
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:22,258
is so girls can look
hot and slutty, not old.

297
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,498
All right.
Well, how about I go as the...

298
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:27,258
wolf who blows down
the Three Little Pigs' houses...

299
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,202
Or, in honor of Gamma Psi,

300
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,822
is there a version where he burns
the houses to the ground ?

301
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:34,017
You know what ?
I don't think so.

302
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:36,739
You know, are we sure
we wanna go to this thing ?

303
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:38,237
Who wants to sit around

304
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:40,547
and listen to people talk
about a fire all night ?

305
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:44,461
You're right. I'm just go with the girls
and I'll meet up with you later.

306
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,024
That's not what I meant.
I'll go. I'll totally go.

307
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:51,885
Is everything okay ?

308
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,152
With us, I mean ?

309
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:58,183
- Totally. Yeah, it's all good.
- Good.

310
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,696
Honestly, I feel bad for them.

311
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,912
Could you imagine what it would be
like if your house burned down ?

312
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:06,262
You know what ?
I need some... some air so...

313
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:08,443
My God.
Oh God !

314
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,905
Actually, that's the devil.

315
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,140
- Yeah.
- My bad.

316
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,615
You know what ?
I really like this one.

317
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:17,368
I'm gonna go pay.

318
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:30,215
You're studying and classes
haven't even started yet ?

319
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,700
I'm reading about ways
to inspire young minds

320
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:36,765
in hopes of becoming
the new KT pledge educator,

321
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,005
since your house got
our last one expelled.

322
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,769
Hey, I had nothing to do with that.

323
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,009
I know.
But that Grant did.

324
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:46,071
I don't get why
you're with that guy.

325
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:48,525
Yeah, well,
it's actually why I'm here.

326
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,312
I was wondering if I could,

327
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,939
crash here until another room
in the house opens up.

328
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:55,787
You guys broke up ?

329
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:59,953
Let's just say we're driving
on different sides of the same street.

330
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,915
- So, can I stay here ?
- Yeah, of course.

331
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:07,085
You know, maybe it's for the best.
I never liked that Grant.

332
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,328
Yeah, Rus.
Thanks for having my back and all,

333
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:10,922
but... too soon.

334
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,718
I think there's this gay guy

335
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,348
in my Engineering program.
You want me to get his number ?

336
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:18,512
Absolutely not.

337
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,839
It's Evan.

338
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:35,379
- Hi.
- Hey, what are you doing here ?

339
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:38,199
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,020
- It was a little weird.
- It was a lot weird.

341
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:43,121
So, what I really wanted to say then

342
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:46,181
was thank you
for being there for me.

343
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,028
You know, that night.

344
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,633
You needed a friend, and I needed
what you brought to the table.

345
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,845
True, but I just wanted
to make sure we're cool.

346
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,558
Because unlike the first time
we hooked up, we're friends now so...

347
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,350
I would say having sex
makes you better friends.

348
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:07,937
So yes, we're cool.

349
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,660
- Excuse me.
- Careful, there's a lot of pixie dust

350
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:14,093
- and taffeta around here.
- Uh... Are you gonna go to the ball ?

351
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:16,524
I guess.
But it's all a bunch of nonsense.

352
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,103
Did you know the real reason
Rapunzel got stuck in a tower

353
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:21,498
is because her father tried
to sell her for food ?

354
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:22,557
That sucks.

355
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:24,704
Finally.
Someone who sees it the way I do.

356
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,295
So let's just take it all in.

357
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:33,741
Good.

358
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:37,175
Tell me what your first impressions
of...

359
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:38,676
Wade's room are.

360
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,980
- Anthony Hopkins ?
- It smells like dirty sheets.

361
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,683
And bong water.

362
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:47,094
That's good.

363
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,166
I'd like to praise you
for your positive attributes

364
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,399
and thank you
for your contributions.

365
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,486
What are you doing in here ?
Why aren't you in the basement ?

366
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,875
We're bonding as a unit
by brainstorming on a way

367
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,977
to honor Wade and the other guys.

368
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:05,370
So we came up to Wade's room
to soak up his essence.

369
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:07,870
- Maybe I can help.
- I think I've got it,

370
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:09,582
but thank you for your offer.

371
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,167
What I would focus on

372
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,128
is how much fun you guys had
when you were with Wade.

373
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:17,423
I think we're having
a pretty good time right now, so...

374
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,786
Did you know that once
when I was having a bad day,

375
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:22,011
Wade shaved his eyebrows

376
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:24,000
just to make me smile ?

377
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,057
You won't find someone like that
every day.

378
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,935
True, but all sorts of things
can make this guy smile.

379
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,187
What else, Cap ?

380
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:35,994
No !

381
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,212
Okay, shows over.
I'll just clean it up.

382
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:42,949
It's just a bunch of beer bottles.

383
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,327
From a trip Wade made around the world.
The world of beer.

384
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,580
So we're going to keep them
here forever ?

385
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,415
You know what ?
Everybody out.

386
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,500
From now on, keep your meetings
in the basement.

387
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,544
- Wade's room is off limits.
- Cap ?

388
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,112
Let's go, Spitter.

389
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,127
Today totally sucked.

390
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,275
Yeah, I almost destroyed
a costume shop.

391
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,058
I told Cappie it's because
I had too much coffee, but...

392
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,310
I don't know how long
I can keep this secret from him.

393
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:14,063
I want to tell him about the fire.

394
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,049
You can't.

395
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,907
But keeping this secret is creating
all this weirdness between us.

396
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:21,029
Casey, you started this pact.
You can't start telling people.

397
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,364
Especially Cappie.
He's the kind of guy you go to

398
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,624
if you want to start a fire.

399
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,202
I don't think that you can trust him
with something this major.

400
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,530
- That's a little unfair.
- Fine. Never mind.

401
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:34,598
First the flowers, now this.
Suddenly you're down on Cappie ?

402
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:36,939
I know you're in this blush
of rekindled love,

403
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,463
but you can't count on him.

404
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,548
What happens
when you break up again ?

405
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:41,664
When ?

406
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:43,760
I told you,
it's not like freshman year.

407
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:47,805
Why are you being so cynical, Ash ?

408
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,473
I'm being realistic.

409
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,708
I know in your mind,
it's going to last forever.

410
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,563
But I've been watching this dance
between you and Cappie for years.

411
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,357
Will they ?
Won't they ?

412
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,178
I just don't think you should
share this with someone

413
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:02,355
you're probably not even
going to end up with.

414
00:22:16,851 --> 00:22:19,252
Hey, invite the lady in.
Don't just stare at her.

415
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,349
My apologies, Casey.
My interns are scientifically adept

416
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:28,846
- but socially inept.
- Of course you have interns.

417
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,099
Case, what's up ?

418
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,953
I need advice about something.

419
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:36,570
Is it how to deal with Cappie
and his attitude lately ?

420
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:39,065
He's probably being weird
with you because of me.

421
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:41,581
So, remember when you were eight

422
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:45,077
and you took apart the TV to see
what it looked like on the inside

423
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:47,448
but when you've done,
we stopped getting channel 5 ?

424
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,148
You covered for me, you said channel 5
went out of business,

425
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:51,411
and mom bought it.

426
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,997
Then why did you wake her up
 to tell her the truth ?

427
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,874
I guess I didn't wanna keep something
like that from her.

428
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,750
But that wouldn't have hurt her.

429
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,711
But it would've messed up
our relationship.

430
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:04,131
We performed magic together.
It would have been totally awkward.

431
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:07,718
You mean more awkward than you
calling Mom your lovely assistant ?

432
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,806
Maybe you can help me with something.
I can't seem to get my pledges in line.

433
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,643
The sorority world is totally different.
We just give them presents.

434
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:20,063
I can't see puffy paint
making an impact on Dumptruck.

435
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,149
Cookies are up.
Take a few to go, Case.

436
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:29,866
They're so well-trained.

437
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,368
- I know.
- How did you make them to do that ?

438
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:35,997
Confidence. I know I'm the best,
therefore, they know I'm the best.

439
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:47,781
Where're you been ?

440
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:51,044
I've been thinking
about staying at Rusty's.

441
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:53,943
Just until another room
in the house opens up.

442
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:56,603
You don't need to move out.
We can divide the room in two

443
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,573
and put a piece of tape
down the middle.

444
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:00,270
And since your bed's by the door,

445
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,273
I'll come in and out the window.

446
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:05,355
Probably not a good idea.

447
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,386
I made you a copy

448
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,453
- just to remind you how much I care.
- Grant, I know you do.

449
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,872
I just wish you cared more about me

450
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,791
than about what
everyone else thinks.

451
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:22,810
It's not that simple.

452
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:26,421
Maybe I'm not ready
for my life to change.

453
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:29,741
I can't just close the door
on who I've always been.

454
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:34,387
And I wish you could see it as opening
a door to something more real.

455
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,318
Listen up, you numb-nutses !

456
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,237
Who the hell is this guy ?

457
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,957
I'm your worst nightmare.
Eyes forward !

458
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,560
Who said you can eat ?

459
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:00,318
Now, it's my understanding

460
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:02,721
that y'all been taking advantage
of Mr. Cartwright.

461
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:05,038
So let me make something
very clear to you,

462
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:07,985
if you think I'm scary,
you have no idea

463
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,049
what this man is capable of.

464
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,824
So it would behoove you

465
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:15,645
to start doing what he says.
Do I make myself clear ?

466
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,390
- Do I ?
- Yes, sir !

467
00:25:21,234 --> 00:25:22,934
Now we're ready to work.

468
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:26,815
Nobody said anything
about any pagan sacrifices.

469
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:30,319
It's Wade's. I just brought it for
back-up in case your way didn't work.

470
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,237
But now it's just used for effect.

471
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,574
Now, we're really
gonna get some work...

472
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:38,660
- My toe !
- That's effective, all right.

473
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,562
Nice twinkle lights.

474
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:47,127
Although, this did take you longer
than I expected.

475
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,830
My boyfriend was supposed
to help me. He's late.

476
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:52,592
- By forty-five minutes.
- Should never rely on a man

477
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,239
for anything other than procreation.
My mother told me that.

478
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,794
I hope this raises a lot of money
for your house.

479
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,173
I'm just having
a hard time feeling festive

480
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,510
because we found out that someone was
in Gamma Psi before the fire started.

481
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,345
How do you know ?

482
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,321
We lit a ritual candle
before SongFest,

483
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:09,941
and the last Gamma Psi out of the house
blew out the candle.

484
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,153
Maybe she's just saying
that she did because she feels bad.

485
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,056
Burning down a house could
make you feel pretty guilty.

486
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:18,847
- I imagine.
- I know she did because it was me.

487
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:21,572
I was the last person
to leave the house.

488
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,706
I know that candle was out.

489
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:26,331
Sorry I'm late.

490
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:28,275
I'm Casey's boyfriend, Cappie.

491
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,712
President of Kappa Tau.

492
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:30,819
Right.

493
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:34,257
Casey, remember my mother's advice.

494
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,574
- My, she's tall.
- I gotta go, Cap.

495
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:44,611
I thought we were hanging lights.
Yes, 45 minutes ago. It's already done.

496
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,633
Sorry, there was this thing
at the house.

497
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:48,813
Apparently your brother
cannot handle cutlery.

498
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,942
- You could've called.
- Look, I'm sorry.

499
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,007
It's been kinda rough
at the house lately.

500
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:55,195
Rusty said you haven't been
yourself.

501
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,020
- What's going on ?
- Just stuff, you know.

502
00:26:58,436 --> 00:27:01,160
Stuff ? Why can't you just tell me
when something's bothering you ?

503
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,247
Why ? Because you tell me nothing ?
Things have been awkward between us

504
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,999
- ever since you came back from break.
- I've been busy.

505
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,177
- Don't come tonight if you don't want.
- I will go if you want me to go.

506
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:11,845
Come if you want. Or not.

507
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,170
I'm sorry, I just...
I have to get back to the house.

508
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:31,898
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who's the hottest of them all ?

509
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:33,257
Still me.

510
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:36,833
Evil Queen,
you're standing on my hair.

511
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:40,774
Okay, we've got a problem.

512
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:42,894
The Gamma Psis know
someone was in the house.

513
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,439
They had a candle lit
in the common room before they left,

514
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,622
- but Katherine blew it out.
- What do we do ?

515
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,501
I can't go to jail. I am not going
to be someone's bitch.

516
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,122
Relax, Rapunzel.

517
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:56,674
If I learned anything from shredding
documents for my dad when I was a kid,

518
00:27:57,213 --> 00:28:00,219
it's that if they can't link you
to the crime, you won't do the time.

519
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,972
Rebecca's right.
They can't trace this back to the house

520
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:05,516
because they don't have any evidence
that we were there.

521
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,476
Sounds good, Case.
One question.

522
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,187
Is it bad that I still have
Katherine's clipboard ?

523
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,450
- What ? Why didn't you get rid of it ?
- Because it's proof we got cheated out

524
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:15,614
- of SongFest.
- It's also proof we were there

525
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:19,155
- the night the house burned down.
- I call top bunk in our cell.

526
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,701
- Fire trumps voter fraud.
- I'll just keep it in my dresser.

527
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,392
So when they show up
with a search warrant they'll find it,

528
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:29,128
and we can all go to jail ?
Don't you watch Criminal Minds.

529
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:31,497
I'll put it in the dumpster outside.

530
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,720
Trash is one of the first places
cops look.

531
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,046
Hello ?
Law & Order.

532
00:28:35,606 --> 00:28:39,130
- I will keep it in the trunk of my car.
- What if you get in an accident ?

533
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:41,677
They can get our DNA
from a single drop of sweat.

534
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:44,235
- Scrubs.
- Okay, girls !

535
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:47,975
On our way to the ball,
we'll put someplace no one will ever

536
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,295
find it and then
we will be done with it.

537
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,370
For good.

538
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,689
All right, look sharp, Dumptruck.

539
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,483
You've got big shoes to fill.

540
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,325
Wade and I were the Maverick
and Goose of the Allied Forces.

541
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,350
- Right.
- I'm going right.

542
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,316
Why aren't you guys
dressed for the ball ?

543
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:07,141
What good's a Pied Piper
without his rats ?

544
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,488
Cappie,
do you want to come with us ?

545
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:11,707
I'm not sure your sister
wants me there.

546
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,325
Yeah, she mentioned
things were weird.

547
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:18,172
- She did ?
- It's none of my business.

548
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,823
Hey, come on, guys.

549
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:21,967
Let's go.
Come on !

550
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:24,689
Before The Impaler cuts off
another one of our toes.

551
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,859
You guys don't have
to worry about that.

552
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:28,804
I hid the cleaver, all right.

553
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,946
We can't afford to lose
any more appendages.

554
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:33,854
Too bad we can't bail
on dressing up as rats.

555
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,235
If you guys don't want to go,
you don't have to go.

556
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,149
Sweet !

557
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:39,902
Yes, you do.
Yes, they're my pledges.

558
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,370
Look, Spitter...

559
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,429
You've given your all to these guys,
but you can't control them

560
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:51,122
- the way Wade did.
- Maybe I would if you'd support me.

561
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,440
- I've supported you.
- Really ?

562
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:56,961
Sending Beaver to babysit me ?
Interrupting my meetings ?

563
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,630
You're hiding Wade's cleaver.
You're undermining me.

564
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,360
You just can't take Wade's cleaver
and expect to be

565
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:04,548
as good a pledge educator as he was.

566
00:30:04,673 --> 00:30:07,763
I'm not trying to be Wade !
I'm trying to be me.

567
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:09,974
I took this job
because I love Kappa Tau

568
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,992
and I wanted the pledges
to feel the same way.

569
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:19,952
You know what ? Maybe I'm not
the right guy to be pledge educator,

570
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:22,736
but they deserve more
than what you're giving them.

571
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,966
Wade's gone.
Playing video games,

572
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,491
blowing off Greek events,
isn't the way to bring him back.

573
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,869
- Would you stop eating ?
- I can't.

574
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,090
Guys...

575
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,477
Once this is done,
we'll put this behind us.

576
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:56,827
Forever.

577
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:05,951
Nature creeps me out.
Let's get out of here.

578
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:17,875
- We came in this way.
- No, we came in this way.

579
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:19,543
I remember...

580
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:23,297
stepping over a log...
at some point.

581
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,897
That is the weakest Big Bad Wolf
I have ever seen.

582
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,865
And you're wearing a cape.

583
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,070
By the way, I think I can
probably move you into Marco's room.

584
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,614
So I can go from one
closeted gay guy to another ?

585
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:50,741
No thanks.

586
00:31:53,197 --> 00:31:54,203
Can we talk ?

587
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,300
Yeah.

588
00:31:57,752 --> 00:32:01,001
So, I've been thinking
about what you said.

589
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,760
And you were right.

590
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,423
I was too concerned about
what other people think.

591
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:10,395
But I'm more concerned
about losing you.

592
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,265
- You can't have it both ways.
- I know.

593
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,418
That's why I was wondering...

594
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:19,103
if you would like to dance.

595
00:32:20,178 --> 00:32:20,896
Here ?

596
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:25,109
There's no one dancing.

597
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,985
So who better to get it started
than two hot princes ?

598
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,394
You sure your ready for this ?

599
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:37,472
Yeah.

600
00:32:57,945 --> 00:32:59,495
What are they doing ?

601
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:02,271
Dancing.

602
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,330
With each other ?

603
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,568
They're your brothers.
Get out there and support them.

604
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:15,843
- Do you want to dance... ?
- With girls, yes !

605
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,316
Brilliant idea to try to navigate
by the stars, Rebecca.

606
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:50,568
At least I know Orion wears a belt,
not a scarf, Rapunzel.

607
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,800
Can we try to be nice
to each other ?

608
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,574
At least until we get to the lodge.

609
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,849
No one even knows we're out here.

610
00:33:57,295 --> 00:34:00,845
- Unless Casey told Cappie.
- I didn't tell Cappie anything.

611
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:04,217
- And it's probably for the best.
- What's that mean ?

612
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,633
You said it yourself, I can't tell him
about this. I have to be realistic.

613
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:10,286
Something's going on with him
and he won't tell me about it.

614
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:12,508
OK, I need to tell you something.

615
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,345
There's a reason
it didn't work out with Fisher.

616
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,392
- He cheated on me again.
- What ?

617
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,838
I went to go visit him
for New Year's,

618
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:25,869
where I met his family
and his friends.

619
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:26,897
And then...

620
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:30,693
I met his other girlfriend.

621
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,364
You deserve so much better.

622
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:40,938
- That son of a bitch.
- I'm so sorry, Ash.

623
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:45,207
- I just feel stupid.
- We should burn down his house.

624
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:52,300
I just don't think I was in the right
place to be giving you advice.

625
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:55,509
Just because Fisher's a jerk
doesn't mean you can't count on Cappie.

626
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,387
But stuff's going to keep coming up.

627
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:02,474
Hopefully not accidental arson,
but things happen in life.

628
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,313
If we can't...

629
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,271
share things,
what are we to each other ?

630
00:35:14,843 --> 00:35:17,743
- How long do we have to stay ?
- Five minutes.

631
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,185
Make it ten.

632
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:33,255
Your highness.

633
00:35:34,152 --> 00:35:36,514
I feared you'd been eaten
by a dragon.

634
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,178
Or, you know, just gone to Dobler's.

635
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:41,220
We had to do something first.

636
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:44,599
Let's go talk.

637
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:51,035
I know something's been bugging you

638
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,570
and you feel like you
can't tell me about it.

639
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,707
I've been a little preoccupied myself
and it took your brother,

640
00:35:56,832 --> 00:35:58,749
of all people,
to make me realize it.

641
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,777
Wade's gone and I was responsible.

642
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:08,123
I trusted Evan and got screwed.

643
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:12,289
And I keep pretending
that everything's the same,

644
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:13,514
but it's not.

645
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,301
And that sucks.

646
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,010
But the only thing that makes this okay
is that I have you to talk to about it.

647
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,556
- I'm sorry if I seem distant or...
- I burned down the Gamma Psi house !

648
00:36:25,053 --> 00:36:25,766
What ?

649
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,588
After SongFest, we went over there
to find Katherine's clipboard

650
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:31,855
but it was dark so Rebecca lit a candle
and then Fireman confirmed it was us.

651
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,255
We got away with it until Ashleigh
kept the clipboard

652
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,444
and you can't put it in your trunk
because of Scrubs. So we buried it.

653
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:39,828
And I lost my tiara !

654
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,045
- My God.
- I know.

655
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,616
Oh, there, there,
my little Firestarter.

656
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,104
It's not funny !

657
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:52,208
I'm wearing tights,
I think I know funny.

658
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,266
I know it may seem
like the biggest deal

659
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:59,291
in the world right now,
but it was an accident.

660
00:36:59,577 --> 00:37:02,927
And someday it'll just be
a really good story.

661
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm sorry about Wade and the guys.

662
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,480
But you know it's not your fault.

663
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,231
- It's Evan's.
- You know the Gamma Psis will be fine.

664
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,192
There's like a hundred bucks
in that wishing well.

665
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,456
99.25 $.
I had to get quarters for the laundry.

666
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:22,326
- Don't tell anybody.
- You stole from the wishing well ?

667
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,988
I'm not the one who burned down
their house, little lady.

668
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:30,701
You know, I thought,
when we got back together,

669
00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:34,360
everything would somehow
become magically...

670
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:36,295
easy.

671
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:38,694
Happily ever after ?

672
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:41,012
That is so boring.

673
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:43,375
This...

674
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:46,212
is much better.

675
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:18,663
My, what a half-assed costume
you have.

676
00:38:19,855 --> 00:38:21,676
The better to ask you to dance with.

677
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:22,929
Really ?

678
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:27,613
You know, there's too many
Cinderellas out there.

679
00:38:29,614 --> 00:38:31,214
Let's shake things up.

680
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:58,385
Do you know what I hate most
about fairy tales ?

681
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,545
They set up false expectations.

682
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,840
In the originals, Prince Charming
didn't always sweep you off your feet.

683
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,315
It's so unreal.

684
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,551
Like love.

685
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,620
The only time that ever works
is in the movies.

686
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,850
What's so great
about Prince Charming anyway ?

687
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,040
I'm gonna write a new fairy tale
where the Evil Queen

688
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:19,243
and the Big Bad Wolf come to town,

689
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:22,270
wreak havoc and ride off
into the sunset.

690
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:24,245
Sounds like a classic.

691
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:48,523
I'm gonna go before my Benz
turns into a pumpkin.

692
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:49,448
Later.

693
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:06,990
I know I'm not supposed
to be in Wade's room, but...

694
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,893
Don't worry about it.
I took things out on you

695
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:11,491
when I should've just...

696
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:14,286
listened to Norah Jones
and had a good cry. So, I'm sorry.

697
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:16,947
Thanks. What's the box for ?

698
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:19,958
I thought I'd start getting over it
by cleaning out Wade's room.

699
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,327
I don't think you'll need the box.

700
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,369
- When did you guys do all this ?
- We've been working on it all night.

701
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:35,057
It's been a real bonding experience
for the pledge class.

702
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,565
How'd you get them to do it ?

703
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,977
Seeing me yell at you
really made an impression on them.

704
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,979
And slicing off one of their toes,
probably.

705
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:44,357
- They got the room done, didn't they ?
- Is that Ferret's hair pick ?

706
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,153
- Are there any of his hairs on it.
- Spitter, can we clone him ?

707
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,280
And Jeremy's eyeliner.

708
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,533
You know,
his eyeliner is his legacy.

709
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,535
I wonder what mine will be.

710
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:59,289
- Marbles ?
- Excuse me.

711
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,122
That's something to be proud of.

712
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:03,747
Hey, my stethoscope.

713
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,355
- What are you doing here ?
- Well...

714
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,622
I was so bummed
about the guys getting expelled

715
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:13,848
that I bombed
every single one of my finals.

716
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,848
And now, they're not letting me
graduate until next semester.

717
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,077
The doctor's in.

718
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:25,043
- Sweet !
- Yeah.

719
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:30,861
- That's loud.
- It's good to see you.

720
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,959
You know, I'm wearing your boxers.

721
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,089
I think that's going to happen,
quite a bit.

722
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:46,362
So it's our first day out.

723
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:51,507
You think it's a little too soon
to maybe take a shower together ?

724
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:55,469
I guess not.

725
00:41:59,632 --> 00:42:00,558
What's that ?

726
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:05,475
- Well, I think it's a joke.
- I don't think it's funny.

727
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,149
Well, welcome to the other side
of the closet.

728
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,620
Do you know who did this ?

729
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:15,576
Tiaras. That's clever.

730
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,944
It's not clever.

731
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,580
If you want,
I can find out who did it.

732
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,283
No. This is for us to deal with.

733
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:28,552
If it's not a joke, then you and I
will handle it, together.

734
00:42:32,794 --> 00:42:35,065
I had to tell them
the meeting was over.

735
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,809
- The pledges can't get enough of me !
- That's great.

736
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:40,532
I'm glad I was able to help.
It's like I tell my interns,

737
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:42,970
when you've been blessed
with innate leadership skills,

738
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:45,045
it's your duty to share them.

739
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:48,815
<i>Hello, this is the Gary Wyatt
Foundation calling.</i>

740
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,574
<i>After weeks of careful consideration,
we have the final results</i>

741
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,695
<i> from the Innovation
in Engineering Competition.</i>

742
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,860
- They have an answer.
- I want you to know,

743
00:42:55,985 --> 00:42:58,240
I'm going to take you with me
all the way to the top.

744
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,309
<i>We'd like to congratulate...</i>

745
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,954
<i>Russell Cartwright
on being this year's</i>

746
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:06,583
<i>Innovation in Engineering
Grant recipient.</i>

747
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,070
Well done, Rusty.

748
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:20,341
Looks like you really dazzled them
after all.

749
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:22,598
Excuse me.
