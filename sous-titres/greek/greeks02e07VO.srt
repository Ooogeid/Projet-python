00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:01,737
<i>Previously on</i> Greek<i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:03,923
What the hell are you doing?

3
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:08,094
Evan isn't capable
of being a decent friend.

4
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:10,313
He is sneaky and manipulative

5
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:12,134
and you cannot trust him.

6
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:14,511
I need something more
than just fun.

7
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,603
- So, are we...
- Broken up?

8
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,271
Yeah. I guess so.

9
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:21,149
I move to overturn Rule 16A,

10
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,068
which states
that removal from office

11
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:26,196
precludes the removed party
from ever seeking that office again.

12
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,573
The only vote I care about
is for president,

13
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:31,826
and I'm happy to have you
challenge me for that fair and square,

14
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:35,679
because I cannot wait
to kick your ass.

15
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:41,865
Due to limited storage space,

16
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:44,098
we will now be deleting
our season pass

17
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,548
of Days of Our Lives.

18
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:48,486
- I'm very, very sorry, Beaver.
- I'll miss you, Marlena.

19
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:51,168
On to the next item
on the agenda.

20
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:55,907
I think we're at the elbow.

21
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:59,521
You know you need to moisturize,
Pickle. This is just disgusting.

22
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:00,758
Oh, right. OK.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,816
Dust off your tuxes, gentlemen,

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,442
it's spring formal season.
Which means next week

25
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:08,071
we'll be having
what we call at Kappa Tau...

26
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:09,656
The prom.

27
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:12,865
As president, appointing the chairman
of the prom committee

28
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,869
is one of my special duties.

29
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:17,946
Yeah. Duties.

30
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:20,834
I take this responsibility
very seriously.

31
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:24,378
Now, this chosen one must
possess organizational prowess,

32
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,216
an acute attention to detail

33
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:29,092
and the ability to tie balloons
without popping them.

34
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:32,137
Now, this year
one lone Kappa Tau stood out.

35
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:35,682
Shiningg like a lighthouse, guiding
our prom safely into the harbor.

36
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:39,147
Now, that one Kappa Tau is,
of course, none other than...

37
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,273
Excuse me.
My shoe's untied.

38
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,462
Let's give it up
for Rusty Cartwright.

39
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:00,457
Thanks, guys.

40
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:02,375
I'm gonna throw
the best prom ever.

41
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:04,669
So, we'll probably have,

42
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,881
- like, three subcommittees.
- All right! Meeting adjourned.

43
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,838
I can't believe I own
this many formal dresses.

44
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,558
- Who knew I was so fancy?
- Have you finalized the menu?

45
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,687
Maybe I should just
wear the white strapless.

46
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,230
But if I do, I can only
drink clear liquids.

47
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,463
- Did you confirm with the hotel?
- Yeah.

48
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,846
See, I would wear the silver halter,

49
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:31,378
but I don't have time
to shape my shoulders.

50
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,948
- Damn my credit crunch.
- You booked the DJ, right?

51
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:36,007
Oh, my God. Music!

52
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,787
- I knew I forgot something!
- What? Really?

53
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,756
No, not really!

54
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:43,461
This is not my first time
at the spring formal rodeo.

55
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,088
What's with all the micromanaging?

56
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,170
It's like I'm on
<i>The Apprentice</i>: Sorority Edition.

57
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,370
I just want everything
to be perfect.

58
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,091
Our formal is the last social
event before the election.

59
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:54,302
If it goes off without a hitch,
the sisterhood

60
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:58,264
will want to continue my reign
of terror-bly awesome parties.

61
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:00,487
Parties that won't be planned by me.

62
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:02,517
'Cause after this formal
I am done,

63
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:05,432
so next year I can actually
bring a date and enjoy it.

64
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,942
- Let's head down for dinner.
- You're definitely flying solo?

65
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,390
I'm juggling so many
logistical issues,

66
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,745
bringing a date would just
complicate matters.

67
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,825
Besides, I don't have a Max.

68
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:18,914
I know, but Max's

69
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,580
first ZBZ function is Spring Formal.
It's like he's just picked up

70
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,166
a ping-pong paddle and
I'm throwing him into Wimbledon.

71
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:27,462
Case, he's socially awkward.

72
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:28,711
Not "special."

73
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,799
And finally ladies,
allow me to introduce...

74
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,005
Hunter. He is a 6'1" junior
from Columbus

75
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,390
who plays lacrosse,
speaks conversational German,

76
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,552
and for the past three summers
worked as a greeter at Abercrombie.

77
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:44,477
Please list your top three

78
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:46,916
Omega Chi bachelors
in numerical order.

79
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:49,399
Evan and I will do
everything we can

80
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,651
to match you up with
one of your favorites.

81
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,570
Remember, ladies,

82
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,662
we are the top sorority on campus.

83
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:58,366
We deserve to be on the arms
of the finest men.

84
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:00,602
Your satisfaction is guaranteed.

85
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:03,100
I can vouch for that.

89
00:04:23,857 --> 00:04:25,979
Can I have
your attention, ladies?

90
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:29,857
I have your Omega Chi
formal dates.

91
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:31,858
Oh, wait, wait, whoa.

92
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,861
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

93
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,936
There were more sisters
than Omega Chis,

94
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:40,950
so three girls
didn't get matched.

95
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:46,272
Holly, Greta, and Reagan.

96
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:47,791
I'm so sorry, girls.

97
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,773
But the good news is,
Evan is throwing

98
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:52,962
this after-party at the Omega Chi
house for all of us.

99
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,019
Get ready to party till dawn!

100
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:04,057
So, Big Sis, what's the plan?

101
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,383
I don't know. I thought
I'd start with a bana,

102
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:08,645
- then move on to the yogurt.
- Come on.

103
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:11,522
I know you've got a scheme
to counter Frannie's boy bribery.

104
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:14,275
Not at all. I think it's political
pandering at its worst.

105
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:16,783
- It's shameless.
- Right? Thank you.

106
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:19,864
Rebecca, I got you
that soccer player you wanted.

107
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,452
Thanks, Frannie.

108
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:26,532
Anything for our little R-Lo.

109
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:30,833
You don't think this stunt will help you
in the election, do you?

110
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:34,545
Oh, my little, um, pit bull,

111
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,413
this will win the election for me.

112
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,152
Because you got
a few girls a date?

113
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,760
No, because Evan did.

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,595
I'm showing our sisters

115
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:45,890
that, when they vote for me,
they get a little extra bonus gift of...

116
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:48,601
of manly macho goodness.

117
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:52,119
This election is between us,
Frannie, not our boyfriends.

118
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,110
You really are a natural blonde.

119
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,739
No, it's OK. Thank you.

120
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,664
Hey, Dale, do you know
where I can rent a disco ball?

121
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:10,062
Try the Party Palace
over on Fourth.

122
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:12,605
Ask for Marvin.
Tell him old D-Dawg sent you.

123
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,697
He helped me trim
my last U-SAG ball.

124
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:19,690
- What are you planning?
- The K-T Spring Formal,

125
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,885
which means crepe paper,
balloons...

126
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:25,179
- Sounds like a prom.
- So I've heard.

127
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,849
- I didn't get to go to the prom.
- Dateless?

128
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,893
No, I had this Boy Scout
Jamboree that weekend.

129
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:34,272
Anyway, this formal's gonna be
my chance to make up for missing it.

130
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:35,940
I mean, there has to be a reason

131
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,735
why every teen movie
ends at the prom.

132
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:40,643
Usually because
that's when they decide to

133
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,905
give into temptation
and have premarital sex.

134
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:44,814
I don't think there will be
any of that.

135
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,116
It's a blind date.

136
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:49,328
Beaver set me up
with his cousin's...

137
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:52,081
sister's girlfriend.
He says she's cute.

138
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:54,721
Here. This is the picture
he sent me.

139
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:56,669
She's a cow.

140
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,589
No, she's the one
milking the cow.

141
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,175
Very impressive.

142
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,063
I've got the tux,

143
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:04,879
I've got the date.

144
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,679
The stage is set for a night

145
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,010
of epic romance, and I need some.

146
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,690
I mean, I started off this year
making out with a girl

147
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,271
while it rained beer,
and all I've gotten lately is crabs.

148
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,024
What did you say?

149
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:19,024
Abs.

150
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,152
Rock-hard abs.

151
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:24,122
From the sit-ups I've been doing
because of no dating.

152
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:38,920
Nice weather, huh?

153
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,714
Very low humidity.

154
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,928
Well, I shouldn't let
my heart rate drop.

155
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:49,347
Yeah, I'd hate to stand between you
and physical fitness.

156
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,311
Is that my shirt?

157
00:07:58,643 --> 00:07:59,899
Well, can I have it back?

158
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:02,693
Now?

159
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,500
It's kind of my lucky shirt.

160
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,323
Having trouble getting lucky?

161
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,391
- Cute.
- Tell you what.

162
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:13,183
You can have this back when
you return my travel toothbrush.

163
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:16,874
I hope I haven't stood
in the way of any overnight visits.

164
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:19,085
My itinerary's no longer
your concern.

165
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,503
How about we set up
a hostage exchange?

166
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:23,662
How do I know you haven't
thrown my toothbrush away?

167
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,204
How do I know you haven't
stretched my lucky shirt?

168
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,072
Lauren?

169
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:50,788
- Lorelei?
- Correct.

170
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,533
Personal information.

171
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,705
She is from Ta...

172
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,834
... ahassee. Tallahassee!
She's from Tallahassee, of course.

173
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:03,073
And she wants to be a...

174
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:10,761
Porn star?

175
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:12,471
- A plastic surgeon!

176
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:15,149
You can do this.
You memorized the Periodic Table.

177
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:16,971
I know you can handle
50 sority girls.

178
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:18,941
Tell me again
why we're doing this.

179
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,857
This formal won't be
all fun and games.

180
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:25,615
With the election next week,
we're in the middle of campaign season,

181
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,784
so we're gonna have
to work the room a little bit.

182
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:30,420
Think of these as handy helpers.

183
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,931
And if you get stuck, just bring up
current events or something.

184
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,245
Hey, there, Case.

185
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,542
You must be Max.
Evan Chambers.

186
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:44,774
Yes. Hi, I'm Max.

187
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,632
Well, you already knew that.

188
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,675
Right.

189
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,073
Well, Evan,
thanks for dropping by.

190
00:09:56,193 --> 00:09:58,184
- You might want to get
a reusable water bottle.

191
00:09:58,492 --> 00:09:59,310
Excuse me?

192
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,022
Your water bottle? They say
the average person uses

193
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:06,331
166 disposable plastic bottles
of water per year,

194
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,659
and that only about 20 percent of them
actually end up being recycled.

195
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:12,073
That's fascinating.

196
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,389
It's like, it's an environment thing.
Environment.

197
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,708
A current event, you might say.

198
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:20,467
Hey, you know, here I was,
just trying to stay hydrated.

199
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,501
I'll see both you guys
at the formal.

200
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:25,753
- Max, awesome meeting you.
- You... Yeah.

201
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:32,729
That was bad, wasn't it?

202
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,055
- Look, the thing with Evan...
- Maybe I should just skip the formal.

203
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:39,242
Really?

204
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:41,977
I'm just so worried
we're gonna go to the formal,

205
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:44,800
and I'm just gonna
embarrass myself.

206
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,275
Would you hate me if I didn't go?

207
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:53,783
Not if you promise to make it up
to me after the formal.

208
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,123
Please tell me
this is not your prom theme.

209
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:04,222
It is simple and romantic.

210
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:06,695
This is more tired than
my grandma after bingo.

211
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:09,064
You need something
more fresh and hip.

212
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,298
You need

213
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,067
"A Moment Like This."

214
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:14,860
It's more immediate.

215
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:18,431
Come here.

216
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:20,492
I need your objective opinion.

217
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,476
What do you think
of this formal theme?

218
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,807
I'm not even going
to ZBZ's formal, so...

219
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:27,449
- I'm probably the wrong person to ask.
- You're not going?

220
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:29,108
That means Casey needs a date.

221
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,904
Probably somebody that conveniently
owns their own tuxedo.

222
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,190
With tails.

223
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:35,885
It just... didn't sound
like that much fun.

224
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,809
Politics, small talk...

225
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,660
But there's so much more
than that.

226
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,052
You're both dressed
in your finest,

227
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,203
you take your date's hand,

228
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,167
you slowly lead her out

229
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:49,045
on the dance floor,
where under the twinkling

230
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:50,679
of the disco ball,

231
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,087
her head rests gently
on your shoulder.

232
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:58,095
It's supposed to be the most
romantic night of the year.

233
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,362
Or you can just stay home
and groom those sideburns.

234
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,352
The most romantic night
of the year and I told Casey

235
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:05,728
I didn't want to go?

236
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:08,901
After she went to all that trouble to
make everything so much easier for me.

237
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,108
- I'm such a jerk!
- Yeah, you really are.

238
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:12,943
The truth hurts.

239
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,987
But sometimes
it can set you free.

240
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:17,090
She deserves the most
romantic night of the year.

241
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,742
- I'm gonna give it to her.
- No, that's not what I'm...

242
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:25,748
I wanted to give it to her.

243
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,712
I would love to have a romantic
evening with Max. But...

244
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:34,605
Frannie's turning the formal
into a campaign event,

245
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,521
so maybe it's better
if he doesn't go.

246
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:39,387
At least I won't have to worry about
him. Am I a terrible person{\for even saying that}?

247
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,232
No, not at all.
It sounds like the formal

248
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,099
is gonna be work for both of us.

249
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:45,484
You manage formal
while I manage Frannie.

250
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:48,156
She's going big
with mass bribery, so...

251
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:49,777
I'm gonna go small.

252
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,232
You know, one-on-one.

253
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,651
I can beat her without
Evan Chambers on my arm.

254
00:12:58,025 --> 00:12:59,281
Max, hi.

255
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:04,113
I just... ran.

256
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:08,290
Just one sec.

257
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:13,003
I want to go to the formal.

258
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,631
I'm sorry if it seemed
like I didn't. I do.

259
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:18,801
I want to give you the romantic night
that you deserve.

260
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,580
There you go. I...

261
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,473
I want...

262
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:28,877
I'm just talking right now.
I don't...

263
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:31,028
I'd rather do this.

264
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:43,742
I gotta go.
I gotta get my tux cleaned.

265
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,526
So I will see you tomorrow night.

266
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,832
All right. Bye.

267
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:52,757
- Bye.
- See you.

268
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:57,372
He can go.

269
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:01,260
Can I get those flashcards?

270
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:21,205
What's going on?

271
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:24,537
- Didn't you get my text?
- Text?

272
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,869
We sorta cancelled our formal.

273
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:28,762
- We definitely cancelled.
- What?

274
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:30,705
But the upside is, we used the money

275
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:34,579
- to do our first informal, huh?
- But I rented my tux.

276
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:38,075
I'm sorry, but you know,
this is really more our style. Cheer up.

277
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:40,966
We're about to start the bouncing
man-boob competition, all right?

278
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,491
Let's bounce!

279
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,849
Is my date still coming?

280
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:51,435
I've been reading up
on prize-winning livestock.

281
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,953
My cousin's girlfriend said
her sister eloped with a butcher.

282
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:58,350
The whole family is shocked.
Come on, Spitter, bounce with me.

283
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:00,449
Come on, bounce!

284
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:12,854
Casey's at the salon,
getting her hair did.

285
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,101
Can I help you with something?

286
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:16,684
I need to borrow her car

287
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:19,072
so I can return my tux.
If I can get it back today

288
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,715
- they won't charge me.
- {\But i}Isn't your formal next weekend?

289
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:25,216
It was until Cappie cancelled,
and threw an informal,

290
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,098
complete with bouncy castle
and man-boob contest.

291
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:31,007
- Don't ask.
- I'm good.

292
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:34,603
I was looking forward to it, especially
since I missed my high school prom.

293
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:37,813
What?
You missed your prom?

294
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:39,857
I had this Boy Scout Jamboree...

295
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:45,305
That is so sad. You missed
the most romantic night of the year?

296
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,327
There is a reason
that every teen movie

297
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,197
- ends at the prom.
- That's what I thought.

298
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:54,915
You could go to the ZBZ formal.

299
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:57,608
- With whom?
- I know for a fact

300
00:15:57,728 --> 00:16:00,188
that there are three girls upstairs
without dates.

301
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,708
And blind dates are so exciting.

302
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:07,805
I love this! It's like
I'm the host of a new reality show.

303
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,323
I'm gonna make your prom dreams
come true, Rusty Cartwright.

304
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:18,439
Be here in tux tonight at seven.

305
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,399
Tonight at seven.

306
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,428
Your head is way too fancy
for your body. It's weird.

307
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,661
Like when they make
babies talk on TV.

308
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,162
Don't touch.

309
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,749
- The formal is tonight.
- Big date?

310
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:38,738
I'm taking Max.

311
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:40,574
Rusty's RA,

312
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:43,078
Mr. Super Science Smarty Pants.

313
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:45,094
He's a great guy.
I love it when he walks.

314
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,141
He turns his left foot
slightly outward.

315
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:49,261
- You {\guys }are still together?
- Are you jealous?

316
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:53,024
I can be jealous of your boyfriends.
It's in the ex-boyfriend bill of rights.

317
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,307
- I've read it.
- I think you two could be friends.

318
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:58,517
I'll admit, when you first meet him
he comes across as a little...

319
00:16:58,637 --> 00:16:59,990
Aloof? Weird?

320
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,764
- Defective?
- Distracted, but...

321
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,206
once you get tuned in to his frequency,
he's a great guy.

322
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:09,035
I am a little stressed
about the formal, though,

323
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,137
since it's one ginormous
first impression.

324
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:13,326
He's not a circus freak.
Or is he?

325
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:17,079
Does he have webbed feet and a tail
or a giant twin growing out of his back?

326
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,452
You know what formals are like.
It's all small talk and schmoozing.

327
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,554
- Nobody's better at that than...
- Me?

328
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,582
I was gonna say Evan,
but you were a close second.

329
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:28,174
Care to explain the toothbrush?

330
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:31,602
I'm just returning this to its rightful
owner. At your house, actually.

331
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,800
This is Rebecca's?

332
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,750
I heard about the break-up. If you
wanna avoid her, I can take it to her.

333
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:41,680
No, that's OK.
I have to go home and make it look used.

334
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:44,525
Besides,
she and I have things to discuss.

335
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,057
You're sleeping together.

336
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,050
No, we're not.

337
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,085
Sleeping together?

338
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:55,200
- Cap, bad idea.
- Come on. It doesn't mean anything.

339
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,259
You and I slept together
after we broke up.

340
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,913
Once you'd been cleansed.

341
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:02,084
I don't remember that.
Did I enjoy it?

342
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:05,203
I had to cleanse you from my system.
It took time.

343
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:06,773
Well, how much time?

344
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,194
Generally speaking, whatever amount
of time you were in the relationship

345
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:13,779
for that's how long it takes
to get over it.

346
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,299
Our case... six months.

347
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:20,664
So you're over me?

348
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:24,946
I'm under the gun.
I've got to go.

349
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:33,491
He's really smart,
like Bill Gates smart.

350
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,514
But with a much better face.

351
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:38,077
He's got this really soothing voice,

352
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:40,889
kind of lulls you to sleep.

353
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:45,079
He's got great dental hygiene.
Not a single cavity.

354
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,880
- Who is it?
- Rusty Cartwright.

355
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:49,605
Casey's little brother?

356
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,843
I can't decide
if that's sad or gross.

357
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:56,722
He's a pledge from Kappa Tau
named Spitter.

358
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,514
Well, I failed.
Your hair looks nice.

359
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,498
Thanks.
What did you fail at?

360
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,860
Finding your brother a date
to our formal.

361
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,374
- Why on Earth would you do that?
- 'Cause the KT's cancelled their formal

362
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:26,704
and when he told me,
he just looked so sad.

363
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:29,700
Like one of those puppies
at the mall pet store.

364
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:32,451
Just the thought is icky
and nasty and...

365
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:33,842
perfect.

366
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,429
If Max gets uncomfortable,
he can just talk to Rusty.

367
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:39,096
Just hang out with him.

368
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:42,601
Then they could sit at a table
and talk about lasers and jet packs.

369
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:44,769
Well, I didn't find him a date, so...

370
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,731
Really? You don't know
anyone else without a date?

371
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
What, me?

372
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:54,202
I mean...
It's not like he's a real date.

373
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:57,616
Plus, he can hold your lipstick and cash
so you don't have to carry a purse.

374
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,199
I don't know.

375
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,705
See? Mall pet store!

376
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:06,426
Fine, I'll do it.

377
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:13,817
- Cab's waiting.
- Can you hold my keys and my lipliner

378
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:15,874
- and my credit card?
- All righty.

379
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:22,246
See you there, guys.

380
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,883
- Let's go.
- My public awaits.

381
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:38,282
- You look stunning.
- Thanks.

382
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,769
You clean up pretty well yourself.

383
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:42,197
May I?

384
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:01,914
Pretty.

385
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,349
Right back at you.

386
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:08,395
- Where's my date?
- Right here.

387
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,982
What about the three girls?

388
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:15,110
My date cancelled so there was no way
I was giving you up.

389
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,545
Isn't this weird?
You're Casey's best friend.

390
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,158
You're going to the formal,
not having a baby.

391
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:26,455
- Well, then I guess this is yours.
- I'm not wearing that.

392
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:32,836
- So, is the cab out front?
- We're not taking a cab tonight.

393
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:35,464
- A limo?
- Even better.

394
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,352
Can you guys move your carriage?

395
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:08,961
All right, that's great. Bye.
Some good news.

396
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:13,126
Calvin's booked the best DJ
on campus for the after-party.

397
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,998
- Thanks.
- For what?

398
00:22:20,203 --> 00:22:21,218
For everything.

399
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:24,600
You know,
just consider it a campaign event

400
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,446
for the "Friends
of Frannie Morgan Committee."

401
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,316
You know you're gonna win.

402
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,283
It's not in the bag yet.

403
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,263
What about your campaign
for OC president?

404
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:35,921
It's a lot less interesting.

405
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,151
I'm running unopposed and
everyone thinks I'm president anyway.

406
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:43,373
We make a pretty good team,
Evan Chambers.

407
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,874
- We missed the dinner.
- Sorry.

408
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:55,882
I didn't realize
the formal was eight miles off campus.

409
00:22:56,002 --> 00:22:58,783
And I didn't think my camera flash
would spook the horses.

410
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,137
We're here now.
That's all that matters.

411
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,926
They didn't use the chair backs.
God, the whole decor is off.

412
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,308
You got the four-tier
chocolate fountain.

413
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:08,966
I did.

414
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,095
I struggled with the decision,
but the two-tiered just looked cheap.

415
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:15,688
Come look at the ice sculpture.

416
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:19,144
Would you mind if we made,
like, a quick round?

417
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:21,939
- I should make an appearance.
- Sure.

418
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:27,804
This is Beth W.

419
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:31,930
Have you met Max?

420
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:38,170
Casey tells me
you spent last semester in Italy.

421
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:40,020
Oh, my God. I did.

422
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,215
It was <i>buenisimo</i>.

423
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,847
The shopping in Milan is sick.

424
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:47,637
But it was really hard, too.

425
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,182
Being away from home?

426
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:52,531
No, being near all that <i>pasta</i>!

427
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:55,245
I don't know
how they're not all fatties!

428
00:23:57,592 --> 00:23:59,611
Max, this is my boyfriend, Brad.

429
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,084
Beth and Brad.

430
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:12,662
You're not...
You're not going to the formal?

431
00:24:13,238 --> 00:24:14,539
I cancelled my date.

432
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,216
I need a break from sorority events.
We have one, like, every week.

433
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,880
Here's your toothbrush back.

434
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:26,555
About the other day...

435
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:29,638
That was a huge mistake.

436
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,681
Right, yeah. Huge.

437
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:33,687
- Never to be repeated.
- Never ever.

438
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:35,177
Ever...

439
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,207
What kind of ice cream
are you eating?

440
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:45,118
Cookies and cream.

441
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:59,146
- That was fun.
- Fun.

442
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,131
Then really fun.

443
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,755
Then never done that before fun.

444
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:09,537
We're broken up.
We're not supposed to be doing this.

445
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:12,489
Why not?
It's sort of how we started.

446
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,516
Secret sex spies, remember?

447
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:17,085
That's true.

448
00:25:18,824 --> 00:25:21,982
Maybe the reason we don't work out is:
we try to make it more than what it is.

449
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:26,849
Yeah, maybe we should just be friends
who...

450
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,947
occasionally hang out naked.

451
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,021
Let's give it a shot.

452
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,431
Friends.

453
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:38,237
Freaky fun buddies forever.

454
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:52,273
I've always wanted to have sex
in this house.

455
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,050
Me, too.

456
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:58,292
Though I've always imagined it
in the kitchen.

457
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:01,040
Where's the kitchen?

458
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:07,262
So, the centerpieces were
my most controversial decision.

459
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:09,573
Why? They're cherubs.

460
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:13,700
Which some people think injects
religious symbolism into the decor.

461
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:17,314
But I just say little babies
with wings are cute.

462
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:19,841
Yeah, they are.

463
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:21,983
Come dance.

464
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,066
Rusty, come join us!

465
00:26:53,985 --> 00:26:55,158
Well, that was fun.

466
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:05,066
So, how did you and Betsy meet?

467
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,822
Well, that's a... long story.

468
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:10,006
Did you meet in AA?

469
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:12,451
Did you tell him?

470
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:16,888
- Supposed to be Alcoholics Anonymous!
- No, I did not tell him.

471
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:19,625
Vic, do not go near that bar!

472
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:24,907
I knew I was doing too well.

473
00:27:26,164 --> 00:27:27,691
Well, don't worry about it.

474
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,887
Let's take a break and have a dance.

475
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,177
One more, please.
You having fun?

476
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:47,002
- Thanks.
- No problem.

477
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:49,723
I'm just trying to enjoy the prom.

478
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:51,815
I mean, formal.

479
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:55,231
- And I'm stopping that how?
- I'm just saying,

480
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,693
I don't want to throw down with you.

481
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,699
OK. Well,
we won't throw down.

482
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:05,386
- What does that even mean?
- You don't remember?

483
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,197
Maybe I hit you too hard
with the pledge paddle.

484
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:11,529
Yeah, I do remember.

485
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,626
I remember you came at me
from behind and ambushed me.

486
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:16,930
It was pretty pathetic, really.

487
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,254
But of course,
you've topped that tonight.

488
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:23,455
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, you're on a pity date.

489
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,999
There's nothing pitiful
about Ashleigh.

490
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,700
No, you're right. There's...

491
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:30,253
I'm not talking about Ashleigh.
It's you.

492
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:32,218
You're Exhibit A.

493
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:35,091
Ashleigh's your sister's
best friend.

494
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,911
Exhibit B, look at her.
She's insanely hot.

495
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:40,206
Exhibit C, there's you.

496
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:45,561
Excuse me.

497
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,282
I'm just gonna return
to my lady.

498
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:58,318
Venice was pretty and all,
but it kind of smells.

499
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:01,002
- Really?
- Yeah, it was weird.

500
00:29:01,736 --> 00:29:04,359
But I loved riding
in the gondolas.

501
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:07,300
They're these little canoes
with these men that pushed

502
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,666
with these long sticks.

503
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:11,002
And you know what they do
while they're pushing?

504
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:12,537
Sing?

505
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,757
- My gosh, you've been there?
- Rusty!

506
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:33,042
Are you having any fun?

507
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:34,879
Sure.

508
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,187
I mean, I guess. No.
It's good to get out of my comfort zone.

509
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:40,280
Dance circle!

510
00:29:42,296 --> 00:29:44,328
- It's dance circle time.
- Dance circle?

511
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:47,296
Yeah, at formal we stand around in
a circle and dance.

512
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:49,203
I can't really explain it.

513
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:51,273
I'll take a breather.

514
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:04,424
Go, Evan.

515
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:17,575
Come dance. Right now.

516
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:23,615
Go, Max.

517
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,068
- I got her.
- What are you doing?

518
00:30:45,188 --> 00:30:47,202
- I can get it unstuck.
- What's hurting me?

519
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:58,315
You trying to untangle it
or rip it out?

520
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:00,331
I'm sorry.
It's really in there.

521
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:03,452
You know what, girls,
go and dance.

522
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:06,040
Don't worry about little old me.
I've been to many formals.

523
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,695
It's OK that Casey's boyfriend
ruined this one.

524
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,090
I think we need scissors.

525
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,705
You know what?
Will you do it, Heather?

526
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:18,254
Because you always trim your own bangs.
They look great.

527
00:31:18,788 --> 00:31:20,173
We've got it from here.

528
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:37,899
I'm really sorry.

529
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:39,744
I don't know what got into me.

530
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,738
No, that's not true.

531
00:31:42,264 --> 00:31:43,407
Evan got into me.

532
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:45,130
What did he say?

533
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,156
He said I was on a pity date.

534
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:53,472
I need help with damage control.
Can you hang with Max?

535
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:55,986
Fine. Whatever.

536
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:58,978
What's wrong with him?

537
00:31:59,238 --> 00:32:01,498
Prom isn't living up
to his expectations.

538
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,632
The prom?

539
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:04,647
That's why I wanted
to find him a date.

540
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,567
He missed his prom.
He had to go to

541
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:09,032
Gymboree with some Boy Scouts.

542
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:11,574
Rusty didn't go to prom because
he couldn't find a date.

543
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,108
He asked multiple girls
and they all said no.

544
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:17,881
That must be why what Evan said
upset him so much.

545
00:32:18,993 --> 00:32:20,274
What did Evan say?

546
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,453
I think that guy Evan wants you.

547
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:36,101
He's such an ass.

548
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,710
I can't believe Casey dated him.

549
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:42,672
- They dated?
- For almost two years.

550
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:50,850
Look, leave Rusty alone.
If you want to pick on somebody,

551
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,349
pick on me.
This is about us, not him.

552
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:56,087
Well, I beg to differ.

553
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,479
My issues with Rusty
are very much about Rusty.

554
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,289
- Don't be an ass, Evan.
- If I'm such an ass,

555
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:03,610
then why on Earth did you date me
for so long?

556
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:06,571
I mean, could it be that I'm the heir
to a media conglomerate?

557
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:09,669
Well, it's quite apparent
Frannie's only dating you

558
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,994
- for your winning personality.
- At least she's being honest about it.

559
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:16,890
You're better than this.
What happened to you?

560
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:21,146
You're right.

561
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:23,778
You are absolutely right.

562
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:25,884
I don't know.

563
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:27,759
I miss you, Case.

564
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:30,831
And I don't know what to do.

565
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:34,710
Losing you will be
my biggest regret.

566
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,622
That's what you want to hear, right?

567
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:47,153
I get it now.

568
00:33:47,915 --> 00:33:48,730
What?

569
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,009
I now get your issues
with Rusty.

570
00:33:51,857 --> 00:33:53,330
I thought I knew you best.

571
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:56,245
But Rusty's the one person
who knew exactly who you are.

572
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,095
I can't believe
I defended you.

573
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:02,585
That's my
greatest regret.

574
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,817
You know, actually...

575
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:06,963
Actually my greatest regret
is not being there

576
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,656
to see Rusty kick your ass
with the pledge paddle.

577
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:24,675
If Laura knew what we just
did in there, she would die.

578
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,547
What was with all those Precious Moments
figurines, anyway?

579
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,917
Who knows. I felt like
we were being watched.

580
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:32,316
I know.
I kind of liked that.

581
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:38,652
- Bed or floor?
- Bed.

582
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,671
I'm getting a little rug burn.

583
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,758
Wait.
Is this Casey's room?

584
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,105
Care to dance?

585
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:10,771
I don't think so, Ash.

586
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:13,431
Come on. Everyone has
to slow dance at the prom.

587
00:35:31,685 --> 00:35:33,348
You're pretty light
on your feet.

588
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,843
I've been
practicing in my room.

589
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:40,183
- It seems really stupid right now.
- Why?

590
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:45,249
I always expected prom
to be this big,

591
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,642
romantic rite of passage.

592
00:35:48,924 --> 00:35:50,562
But none of this seems romantic.

593
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:53,719
I beg to differ.
Did you see the napkin rings?

594
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:58,497
What's romantic about it is

595
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:02,390
being able to share it with someone
who's excited to be with you.

596
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,771
Which, apparently, is why
every stupid teen movie

597
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:08,351
ends at the prom.

598
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:21,881
Did I step on your toe?

599
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,591
I'm sorry about that, Max.
I had

600
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:57,491
to take care of some things.

601
00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:59,879
Here's your key
and your credit card

602
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:01,358
and your make-up.

603
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:04,659
I'm gonna go.

604
00:37:13,943 --> 00:37:16,117
I'm sorry. I haven't been
the best date tonight.

605
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:18,246
- With the election...
- Why didn't you tell me

606
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:20,246
that Evan Chambers
was your ex-boyfriend?

607
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:22,121
I didn't?

608
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,471
I thought I did.

609
00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:27,674
No. I'd remember
if you did.

610
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:30,096
My memory's
borderline photographic.

611
00:37:31,726 --> 00:37:33,826
Apparently, sorority girls
are the border.

612
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:36,039
I should have told you.

613
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:39,270
You dated for almost two years.
That's...

614
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,905
- a pretty big detail to leave out.
- It's just...

615
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,642
Evan is the big man
in the Greek system.

616
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:49,645
And I knew how nervous
you were about the formal

617
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:51,951
and I didn't want
to make you feel more insecure.

618
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,519
So, you were worried about me

619
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:56,763
feeling insecure?

620
00:37:57,461 --> 00:37:59,337
Or were you insecure

621
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:01,330
about being with me?

622
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:09,168
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:18,906
I'm gonna go.

624
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:23,898
Even though I hate to admit it,
part of me dated Evan

625
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:25,943
because of who he was.
But I'm determined

626
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:29,435
to not make that mistake again.
I love that you're a nobody.

627
00:38:30,695 --> 00:38:31,938
That came out wrong.

628
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,133
I promise.

629
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:36,067
I have all the right feelings for you.

630
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:39,701
I'm just saying
all the wrong things.

631
00:38:42,242 --> 00:38:44,292
Just tell me that
you want to be with me.

632
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:52,792
I want to be with you.

633
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:07,232
Come on. Let's go.

634
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,487
Don't forget your watch.

635
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:24,040
I'll be right back.

636
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,585
- Thank you.
- Casey told me you two used to date.

637
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:41,084
That's right.

638
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:45,523
I gotta ask.

639
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,018
How on Earth could you
ever let her go?

640
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:13,855
So, what did you think
of your prom?

641
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,612
It was definitely full of surprises.

642
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:23,779
That's the thing about prom.
You never know what's gonna happen.

643
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:25,751
Someone's always getting
too drunk

644
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:27,179
or

645
00:40:27,804 --> 00:40:28,845
breaking up,

646
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:31,421
making a fool of themselves
on the dance floor.

647
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:34,633
We're just lucky nobody
spilled pig's blood on us.

648
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:44,015
Tonight,

649
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:45,696
I had a great time.

650
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,917
- I did too, Rusty.
- And I've been thinking

651
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:51,911
about us.

652
00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:55,787
It would never work.

653
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:59,501
I mean,
you're Casey's best friend.

654
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,982
We're just gonna have
to let this go.

655
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:10,638
You are going to make
some girl

656
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:12,981
very happy.

657
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,332
You too, Ashleigh...

658
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:18,737
- I don't know your last name.
- Howard.

659
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:23,060
- Good night.
- Good night.

660
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,380
You know you're still
hung up on her.

661
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:38,415
And I'm still
hung up on you.

662
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:42,628
You are?

663
00:41:43,078 --> 00:41:45,078
Which is why we can't
do this anymore.

664
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:48,743
The sex or the friends?

665
00:41:49,629 --> 00:41:50,629
The sex.

666
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,567
Maybe the friends.

667
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:58,352
Well, for the record, I'd like to find
a way to be friends.

668
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:02,171
Why?

669
00:42:03,668 --> 00:42:04,873
What's the point?

670
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:12,379
Life is just more interesting
with you in it.

671
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:17,620
I need to get over you, Cap.

672
00:42:23,822 --> 00:42:25,296
I'll see you in four months.

673
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:27,508
Four months?

674
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:30,692
- Good night, Betsy.
- Out the back!

675
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:32,687
The back?

676
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,430
Run!

677
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,665
- Rebecca, what are you doing in here?
- Looking for Laura's robe.

678
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,287
Found it.
