1
00:00:01,586 --> 00:00:03,418
- You're off.
- Yeah, till the fall.

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:06,292
- Sophomore year.
- We are gonna be roommates again.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,438
What happened to you?
I was protecting the house.

4
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:12,758
From Rusty.
He started this and I ended it.

5
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,085
Like I said, he and I are even.

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,873
I'm starting my own sorority.
In fact, I rented the house today.

7
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,939
- Let's go, girls!
- Becks,

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,187
shall we?

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,002
I got accepted to grad school.
Caltech in California.

10
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:30,345
I just got a job.
I'd have to be in DC in two weeks.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,624
I need to take this internship for me.
That sounds selfish.

12
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:35,909
- I'm the one leaving.
- Do what's best for you.

13
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:38,552
It's not best for us, though.
Dr. Lewiston?

14
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:41,004
This is Max Tyler from CRU.

15
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,250
- How's your dilemma?
- I'm going to Washington.

16
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,379
You are?

17
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:55,864
I had so much fun
with you guys this year.

18
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,952
You were the nicest group
of campers I've ever met.

19
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:00,768
I'll see you next summer.

20
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,457
OK, Pine Saplings.

21
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,309
It's time to go home.

22
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:09,494
Grow into big strong trees.

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,946
- I'm gonna put it in your nose.
- Dylan, not again!

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,709
Put the pebble down.

25
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,922
- You OK?
- Yeah. Thanks, Rusty.

26
00:01:20,187 --> 00:01:21,423
Good save, Cartwright.

27
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,917
I guess you could say when it comes
to little boys I have the touch.

28
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:29,964
That's not what I meant.

29
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:32,184
Last day, son. Keep it together.

30
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:35,468
All right, Pine Saplings,
gather round, gather round.

31
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:40,007
Little Pine Saplings, take a seat.

32
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:41,264
Dylan, sit.

33
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,201
You boys may be leaving today,
but remember this:

34
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,392
Camp Tiny Pine

35
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:53,532
is not just a place, but a feeling.

36
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:57,067
A feeling that takes root
in your heart.

37
00:01:57,412 --> 00:02:00,670
So wear your evergreen
friendship necklaces

38
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,784
close to the trunk to remind you

39
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,248
of the special time
that you had here.

40
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,624
Now go out there

41
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:09,181
and proudly spread your seed.

42
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,121
I'm really not sure
what's wrong with me today, sir.

43
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:23,705
Not funny.

44
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:52,924
Casey, the door.

45
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:02,056
Wait.
I have to... Hold on.

46
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,664
- Sorry.
- What?

47
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:06,227
- Do I need to do something?
- No, I have a code.

48
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,312
I've never been so happy
to see someone in my entire life.

49
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:15,537
Let's hope that lasts the whole
11 hour car trip back to Cyprus.

50
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,227
And that's 11 hours not including gas,
food, bathrooms...

51
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:20,682
It could be 11 years.

52
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,329
So, you ready to start
a whole new year together?

53
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,399
Am I a horrible person
for being partly glad

54
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:48,058
your Caltech grant money fell through
and you're stuck at Cyprus with me?

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,175
I could never describe you
as horrible.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,230
Even though that part
that's glad is way,

57
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,524
way bigger than the other sad
for you part?

58
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:55,750
I forgive you.

59
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,530
All that stuff I told you
bout the summer,

60
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,726
let's just keep it between us, OK?
I don't want anyone else to know.

61
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,410
Not even Ashleigh.

62
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:07,705
Your secret's safe with me.

Here we are.

67
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:44,784
You gonna get out?

68
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,797
Totally.

69
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,368
You having second thoughts?

70
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,296
Change is good. It's just...

71
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:01,201
The thought of disappointing Ashleigh
kind of scares the crap out of me.

72
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,554
You're back, you're back!

73
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:07,962
Seatbelts!

74
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,383
OK, Casey and I have
a lot of catching up to do,

75
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,019
so you can just do
your manly unpacking thing.

76
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,926
I missed you so much!

77
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,637
- OK, OK, so tell me.
- Did you?

78
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,392
It took 44 summer campus tours.

79
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:28,219
But I did it.
I am no longer Credit Plus' bitch.

80
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,623
OK, I want to hear all
about Washington

81
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:34,832
because months
of emails aren't good enough.

82
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:37,933
But before that we have
two major house things to discuss.

83
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,634
First, OK,
I changed the rush balloons

84
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,383
from pink and white to all gold.

85
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,509
What the hell?

86
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:45,781
You're right. I knew it.

87
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:48,398
The bling-bling thing
is totally played out.

88
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:50,557
This is a sorority,
not a Beyonce video.

89
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,839
Why is Rebecca getting out
of Frannie's car?

90
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,437
Welcome back, Case!

91
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,232
You look tired.
Long drive?

92
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:01,564
Rebecca, what's going on?

93
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:04,864
We couldn't find parking
in front of our house.

94
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,982
That was the second major thing.
Rebecca called last night

95
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:11,589
and she's defecting
to the Iota Kappa Iota house.

96
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,304
"Icky?"

97
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,627
Iota Kappa Iota.

98
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,252
Or the I-Kaps.

99
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:21,480
Or the "Ickies."

100
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,345
Rebecca, you chose us.

101
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,719
We initiated you last semester.

102
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:29,186
And I changed my mind.
See you, girls, around Greek Row.

103
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:31,677
Forget about stupid old Rebecca.

104
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,810
With the Dynamic Duo on the job,
ZBZ will be unstoppable.

105
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:42,334
Summer!

106
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,745
You promised to wear your Speedo.

107
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,700
I just want to show
these guys my new room.

108
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,186
I finished the redesign.

109
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,922
- Hey, new guy.
- This is my boy, Andy.

110
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:01,836
He and I used to play
high school football.

111
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm a freshman.

112
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,187
And the Titans' number
one high school recruit.

113
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,004
But before you get any ideas,
so he'll be pledging Omega...

114
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,636
Don't say it.
You know how I feel about the "C" word.

115
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,563
Popsicle?

116
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,229
What flavor is this?

117
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:24,762
Beer.

118
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,496
Freshmen.

119
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:33,035
You three have a fantastic time
and remember, here at Kappa Tau,

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,206
summer isn't officially over

121
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,581
until the fat professor
hands out the syllabus.

122
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,808
Hit the water slide.
Come on, guys.

123
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,468
They're exactly
like you described them.

124
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,475
You even called the water slide.

125
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,763
Yeah, the KT's are nothing
if not obvious.

126
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,968
These are my brothers
you're talking about.

127
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:56,137
You're crazy if you think
you can get any work done here.

128
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,766
Sure that pledge paddle last spring
didn't leave any lasting brain damage?

129
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,487
- I still can't believe that happened.
- I'm in a really good mood right now

130
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:06,464
and I don't want to talk about Evan.
Pretty much ever again.

131
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,951
So how are you gonna get
work done living here?

132
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,274
Just wait till you see the oasis.

133
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,425
This is nice, Rus.

134
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,589
Let the belching contest begin!

135
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,449
It's almost freakishly quiet.

136
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,020
Acoustic foam panels
in the walls and the ceiling.

137
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,712
Come on.
I might even come here to study.

138
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:39,600
See? I can have it all.

139
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,735
Full time honors engineer...

140
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,371
full time Kappa Tau brother!

141
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,733
Full time honors engineer.

142
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,950
Full time Kappa Tau brother!

143
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,406
Engineer, brother, engineer...

144
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,951
OK, first on the agenda should be rush,
but as we all know,

145
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:02,874
we have a little situation
to deal with.

146
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,668
Since some of our officers have...

147
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,294
chosen a different path,

148
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,383
we need to fill
the following positions:

149
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,530
Standards Chair.

150
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,096
I nominate Ivy.

151
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,930
She has such a strong moral center.

152
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,849
Done.

153
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,822
But as for the all-important
Rush Chair, Case...

154
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:27,894
Really?

155
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,152
Rush Chair is really
important this year,

156
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,676
since we need twice the number
of pledges to fill the house,

157
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,907
thanks to Frannie.
So I think we need someone

158
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,021
with experience and someone I like.

159
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:38,887
Laura for sure.

160
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,511
Yeah, she can be abrasive...

161
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,634
You realize I'm right here?

162
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,963
... but it's all in good fun
and she is definitely experienced,

163
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,545
not to mention crazy organized.
Have you seen her closet?

164
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,922
All the hangers are
two finger spaces apart.

165
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,288
Two and a half.

166
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,680
And I accept.

167
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,866
What? I didn't even...

168
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,677
OK. So, Rush...

169
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,327
Here's what I'm thinking.

170
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,935
Let's cut down on decorations.
We'll tell everybody...

171
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,883
I can't believe you found
a vacant house on Greek Row.

172
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:16,156
This place is just so much awesomer
than the ZBZ house.

173
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:18,484
It's a work in progress.

174
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,911
And look. A ghost!

175
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,082
Hello, gals.

176
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,305
Sisters,

177
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,722
meet Joan, our landlady.

178
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,466
She lives all the way upstairs
and keeps to herself...

179
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:35,901
mostly.

180
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,680
Although we've agreed
as a condition of the lease

181
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:43,633
that Joan can, very occasionally
and after giving notice,

182
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:45,439
mingle with us.

183
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,688
Very occasionally.

184
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,114
I was a Tri Pi myself, you know.

185
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,441
Back in the day.

186
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,308
I will never forget

187
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,655
the Sputnik mixer with Lambda Sig.

188
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,925
I let Eddie Bailey
put his hand right here...

189
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,036
That's wonderful, Joan.

190
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,914
Why don't you go upstairs and
make yourself another round of gimlets?

191
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:12,530
Don't worry about her, girls, OK.

192
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:16,209
Not even that old tramp
is gonna stop Iota Kappa Iota

193
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:19,183
from being
the very best house on campus.

194
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:21,873
I guarantee it.

195
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,430
As tenants of our model apartment,
keep the unit neat

196
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,553
and presentable for tours.

197
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:31,148
But you two look tidy.

198
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:32,663
It's only me.

199
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:35,652
- He's here for moral support.
- Moral support.

200
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,450
I don't know about living
in a model apartment, though.

201
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:40,534
This is all I have left.

202
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,452
Off-campus housing close to CRU
usually books by spring.

203
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:45,615
In exchange you'll pay reduced rent.

204
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:52,081
- Sounds like a good deal.
- I'll give you a chance to look around.

205
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,371
- Thank you.
- OK.

206
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,511
You sure this is what you want?

207
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,414
If there's one thing
I learned last summer,

208
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:01,553
but I have to make
my senior year count.

209
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,231
- You can't do that in a sority?
- Last year,

210
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,721
two girls nearly came to blows
over whether Cameron Diaz

211
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:09,199
looks better blonde or brunette.
And yes,

212
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:11,594
those two girls were
Ashleigh and me.

213
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:15,400
We had a similar situation
in the dorm.

214
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,173
Not Cameron Diaz,
but a pretty heated scuffle

215
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:21,448
over the elastic properties
of Mr. Fantastic versus Plastic Man.

216
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,332
Yes, it was between me and Rusty.

217
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:25,035
Sorry, this is not about me.

218
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,828
This is about you and your dilemma.

219
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,996
Which is about to be solved.
Come on.

220
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,312
What are you guys doing?

221
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:51,341
What are you guys doing?

222
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,857
Basic rule on a construction site:

223
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,193
never startle a man
with a power tool.

224
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,954
It's a construction site?

225
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:04,408
We are constructing a loft.

226
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,911
It's 3:00 in the morning.

227
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,956
The boys and I
just finished our nightly...

228
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:13,553
morningly, 1:00 a.m. power naps.

229
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:15,502
- Morningly.
- Morningly. So we're using

230
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,553
our time constructively

231
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,007
to turn this room into a quad.

232
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:21,550
Quad?

233
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,945
Cappie, you cannot turn
my oasis into a quad.

234
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,756
Where the hell are
Ben Bennett, Pickle

235
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:32,789
and Arrowhead supposed to sleep,
the shed?

236
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:34,626
They're not animals, Spitter.

237
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:36,308
Now where's my stud finder?

238
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:38,483
Stud finder, please.

239
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:42,529
You found me. I'm a stud.

240
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,418
Seriously, I need a stud finder.

241
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:00,255
Morning, Dale.

242
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,672
You're lucky I got here when I did.

243
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:05,302
I had to fight off some surly civil
engineer to get this spot.

244
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,100
I told him to build a bridge
and get over it.

245
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:12,100
I can't believe engineers camp out
to get their textbooks early.

246
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,825
Sophomore year's most competitive.

247
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,245
You've got core requirements,
organic chem.

248
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,356
About a third of the class
usually drops out.

249
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:20,901
You look terrible, by the way.

250
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,426
I mean really bad.

251
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:26,157
My Kappa Tau oasis turned back
into a very loud desert.

252
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,683
But you know, I have to learn
to adapt to their unique schedule

253
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:31,786
if I want to have
the full experience.

254
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:33,074
I guess.

255
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:35,115
Why are you eating a corn dog?

256
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:38,700
It's breakfast on a stick.
It's sausage and cheese

257
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:41,963
wrapped in a chocolate chip pancake
with maple dipping sauce.

258
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,583
Part of the KT meal plan.

259
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,987
You better get your act
together before classes start.

260
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:47,815
You can't count on me
to carry you again.

261
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,029
I might need to lean on you
this year a little too.

262
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,691
- Is that right?
- It is right.

263
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:54,051
I'm not gonna get any help
from my new roommate, Peter.

264
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:57,103
He's ghostly pale, got this weird,
implacable accent.

265
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,397
He speaks English but
he's not American, you know.

266
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,834
He's unnervingly polite.

267
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,501
He wrote me a thank you note
yesterday for making my own bed.

268
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:05,612
Who does that?

269
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:28,817
Room 314, Megan Song.

270
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:31,575
Mainline Philly, voted Most Photogenic,
senior year.

271
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:39,407
I'm Frannie Morgan
and this is Rebecca Logan.

272
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,708
We're here to welcome you to CRU.

273
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,304
Thanks.

274
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:46,961
Are you guys my RA's or something?

275
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,862
You are so cute.

276
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:55,497
We're with the brand new
Iota Kappa Iota sorority,

277
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,208
and we're here to invite you
to our ultra-exclusive, top-secret,

278
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,233
pre-rush lake party
with the Omega Chis.

279
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:04,151
- The hottest guys on campus.
- Cool! But wait.

280
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:07,340
I thought we weren't allowed
to talk to you except during rush.

281
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,343
Can't you get in big trouble
with Pan-Hellenic for dirty rushing?

282
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,553
That would be
if we were an ordinary sority.

283
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:15,001
Iota Kappa Iota isn't affiliated
with Pan-Hellenic,

284
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,891
so we don't have to abide
by their rules.

285
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,893
But if you're not Pan-Hellenic,

286
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:21,290
then how do you do
all the fun stuff like Greek Week?

287
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,175
Not to worry.
The moment rush is over,

288
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,077
we'll petion Pan-Hellenic
for membership.

289
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:28,435
Besides, consider how unfair it is
that sororities can't have co-ed parties

290
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,396
and alcohol like fraternities can.

291
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,282
It's so patronizing
and sexist, right?

292
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,553
We won't have that problem. We're local.
No nationals to worry about.

293
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:38,788
We can have all the fun
of a fraternity but without the mess.

294
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:41,054
- Sounds awesome.
- I know, right?

295
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:43,068
- See you at the lake.
- Thanks.

296
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,131
Great.
The whole women's lib crap.

297
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,065
I'm happy to see
you've come to your senses.

298
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,175
Me, too.

299
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:00,060
Thought you were getting a single.

300
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,978
Case, you're back.

301
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,509
Believe it or not,
I'm really excited to see you.

302
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,634
I missed you.

303
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,152
Aren't we cute.
Mom sent a package...

304
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,759
with homemade snickerdoodles.

305
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:18,370
Why does she even try?

306
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,622
So, tell me.

307
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,709
- How was Washington?
- It was incredible.

308
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,081
So much fun. Learned a lot.

309
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:30,256
Are you aware that is how you used
to describ going to church?

310
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,289
It was incredible.

311
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:37,323
I guess it left me feeling
like what I really need right now

312
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,093
is to expand my horizons.

313
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,935
Not go back to the same old
sorority business.

314
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,260
Wait a minute.

315
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,606
You're seriously down
on ZBZ right now?

316
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,143
I can't be the ultimate
sorority girl forever.

317
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:50,725
That's not real life.

318
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,623
You'll know when you're a senior.

319
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:56,352
Nothing will stop me from being
a dedicated Kappa Tau brother.

320
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,569
- How was the internship?
- It was incredible.

321
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:14,217
So much fun. Learned a lot.

322
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,791
See you around.

323
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,181
What's with her?
Sunburn?

324
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,600
D.C. tourist overload?

325
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,631
Stalked by the engineered ex?

326
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:27,135
Ex? No, they're still going out.

327
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,718
Max was gonna go to Caltech,
but he lost his grant

328
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,052
so he's gonna go
to grad school here instead.

329
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:33,938
Incredible. So much fun.

330
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,199
Pep log. Think fast.

331
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,542
Wade got a whole case for ten bucks.

332
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,458
Going out of business
at the Meat Hut this summer.

333
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,914
Does pepperoni expire?

334
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:47,242
We hope not.
That's what we're banking on.

335
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,305
KT brothers don't ask, they eat.

336
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,671
- Now chow down. It's almost 2:00.
- What's at 2:00?

337
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:54,883
Afternoon nap.

338
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,553
- I didn't know took so many naps.
- Haven't you ever noticed how...

339
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,680
quiet the house is at certain
times of the day?

340
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,352
I figured you're all in class.

341
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:07,437
What? No, but yes, we nap.

342
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,148
Napping is essential
for healthy brain development.

343
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,216
- Isn't that for more, like, babies?
- Exactly.

344
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,481
Beaver hit his 14 month
developmental milestones.

345
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,528
I can drink from a straw.

346
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:21,327
Doesn't all that napping make it hard
to sleep through the night?

347
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,911
How do you get up for classes?

348
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,873
Morning classes?

349
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,508
You are on fire today, Spitzafrenic.

350
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:48,353
I just heard the most horrible rumor
in the history of rumors.

351
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,024
That sounds bad.

352
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,511
The "Ickies" are having
a pre-rush recruitment party

353
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:57,237
at Canyon Lake this weekend
with the Omega Chis.

354
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,550
She can't dirty rush like that.

355
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,096
At least not so blatantly.

356
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:04,085
Technically,
it's not considered dirty rushing.

357
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,552
Until they're in Pan-Hellenic
she's allowed to do it.

358
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,248
That's so not fair.

359
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:10,324
Good.
I'm really gonna need your help.

360
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,090
Now we can use your new
D.C. style scheming.

361
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,348
Right.
Let me think about it.

362
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:25,663
How come you haven't unpacked yet?

363
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:27,961
Just busy.

364
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:29,509
I guess.

365
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,565
And why didn't you want
to be Rush Chair?

366
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:41,091
There's something you're not telling me,
isn't there?

367
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,493
Ash, I'm moving out
of the ZBZ house.

368
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,589
I found an apartment and I...

369
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:50,935
I signed the lease today.

370
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,252
Why didn't you tell me?

371
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:57,005
I was afraid I'd change my mind.

372
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,340
- You should change your mind.
- I love living with you.

373
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:01,781
I can't imagine not being here.

374
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:03,887
And maybe that's a problem.

375
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:05,635
I just feel like...

376
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,558
I want to try having some distance
from the house

377
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:09,952
for a little while.

378
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:12,270
I got so wrapped up in it last year.

379
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:16,816
I need to be somewhere

380
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,920
without so many distractions
so I can focus.

381
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:24,116
If I want a career in politics,
I need to get serious.

382
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,831
I'm sorry, Ash.

383
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:55,272
What's this?

384
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,525
A few modifications
to the Kappa Tau lifestyle schedule.

385
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:01,200
I know, change is scary,

386
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,636
but this schedule will help
all the brothers

387
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:07,677
achieve the full Kappa Tau experience
at an enhanced comfort level.

388
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,645
Eliminate the 1:00 a. M. Nap?
Vegetables?

389
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,289
Good luck getting anyone to sign up.

390
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,959
I'm just worried about my...

391
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:16,395
Our health.

392
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:18,239
And our course load.

393
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:21,381
You're the only Kappa Tau
who has a course load.

394
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:24,444
Cappie, I want to live
like a real Kappa Tau brother,

395
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:27,040
but I wasn't expecting
to live in a quad.

396
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:31,493
And don't you find the diet
of the smoked meats constipating?

397
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:32,976
Really, I don't,

398
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:36,146
but I learned a little bit more
about you and I sympathize.

399
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:38,398
- Maybe we can...
- Listen, Spitter,

400
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,442
I'm sorry, pal, but naps and meats,
they gotta stay.

401
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:45,056
But it just so happens
there's one single left.

402
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:53,705
Evan, I don't think
you met my friend, Andy.

403
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:57,333
No introduction necessary.
I know who this guy is.

404
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,336
Mr. 4.0, valedictorian,
runs a four-three-40.

405
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,987
I'm Evan Chambers.
I'm the president.

406
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:06,032
- O'Toole, grab this guy a beer.
- You got it.

407
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:07,854
No water slide?

408
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:11,139
- No, man, that's the KT's.
- You want to have a seat?

409
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,911
What were you doing at the KT house?

410
00:23:16,036 --> 00:23:19,204
I was there to see Rusty, and before
you start I told you, back off him.

411
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:21,524
And I told you I got
a little carried away.

412
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:25,036
I know it may sound
like a rich kid sob story,

413
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:27,196
but my family stuff
kinda got to me last year.

414
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,771
And now it doesn't?

415
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,169
I'm back.

416
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:32,869
I'm ready to focus on rush.

417
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,873
Everybody really wants this Andy guy.
The Lambda Sigs won't rest

418
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,958
until they get
the number one football recruit.

419
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,517
- Bring him here.
- Don't worry about it.

420
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:43,421
He didn't play ball
with the Lambda Sig.

421
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:46,382
Trust me, he's far too ambitious
for the Kappa Taus.

422
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,128
It's as good as done.

423
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:49,624
All right.

424
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:50,887
One more thing.

425
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:53,890
If you mess with Rusty again
I will have to kick your ass.

426
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,476
- Rich kid sob story or not.
- Peace.

427
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,582
Would you like to play?
'Cause you look.

428
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,575
I'm fine. Thanks.

429
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,678
You need to get that out of that...
There you go.

430
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,425
- Now I've lost my place.
- You don't need a place.

431
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,531
Classes don't start for a week.
That's seven days of sleeping,

432
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,303
eating, drinking beer,

433
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,348
watching the entire series
of <i>Full House</i> on DVD.

434
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,517
- That's all you did this summer?
- Of course not.

435
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:41,020
I also watched Jon and Kate Plus 8.
It's amazing how they make it all work.

436
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,564
You realize we're graduating
this year?

437
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,246
You speak for yourself.

438
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:48,320
Even you have to grow up eventually.

439
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,060
Agreed, but there are several
developmental stages

440
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,782
between infancy and old age.

441
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,743
There's no reason to turn yourself
into a grandma before you have to.

442
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:59,333
What are you worrying about?
You finished the world's most incredible

443
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:00,623
fun internship, right?

444
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,902
It sucked, didn't it?
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

445
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:09,576
It sucked.

446
00:25:09,787 --> 00:25:11,801
But now I know
what real life demands.

447
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:14,814
I need to buckle down
and get serious.

448
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:17,223
And that means I don't get
to play this year.

449
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,360
Let me get this straight.

450
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:22,799
You make yourself miserable now,
hoping to be better prepared

451
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:24,438
for the misery to come later?

452
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,444
That's not what I meant.

453
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,863
You know you're gonna
end up dead someday.

454
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,988
- Thanks, now I feel so much better.
- You should.

455
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,893
You're going to die, no matter what.

456
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:36,826
Hence the phrase, "Life is short,
so make the most of it."

457
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,180
Guess what?
College is short too.

458
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:40,788
And so is senior year.

459
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,517
Soon we'll be graduating/dead, so...

460
00:25:44,312 --> 00:25:46,294
play hacky sack
while the sun shines.

461
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,086
- That's actually strangely profound.
- I know. Right?

462
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,848
Can I ask you a favor?

463
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,590
A favor you say?

464
00:26:00,715 --> 00:26:03,352
I thought Max was on favor duty.
I heard you guys got back together.

465
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:07,315
The only bright spot of my summer.

466
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,986
But this favor is more you.

467
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,945
It falls under the "play hacky sack
while the sun shines" category.

468
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:15,416
Excellent. Hit me.

469
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,579
Beaver, this isn't the bathroom.

470
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:45,291
That's not Beaver.

471
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,068
Possum!

472
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:56,085
You stay away!

473
00:26:57,258 --> 00:26:58,907
This is supposed to be a single.

474
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:07,757
Go away!

475
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:25,142
- You sleep in a shed?
- Crap. What time is it?

476
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,927
It's 11:00 a.m. You can thank me later.
I've got bigger problems.

477
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:30,052
Like this.

478
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,275
My roommate is canadian.

479
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,653
How am I supposed to sleep at night
with some foreigner.

480
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,646
Waving his alien flag
in what's obviously an act

481
00:27:38,771 --> 00:27:40,433
of anti-american aggression?

482
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,561
You put up the flag when...

483
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:45,172
Do this for me. Don't think about it,
do it. Say this word.

484
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,789
"A-b-u-o-t."

485
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
"Aboot."

486
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,378
- He got to you too.
- You just misspelled the word "About."

487
00:27:55,022 --> 00:27:57,174
All right, I'm sorry.
I thought I lost you there.

488
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,504
Listen, until I can get
this mountie-loving, moose-smelling

489
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:03,620
hockey fan deported, can I bunk
here with you for a little bit?

490
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:06,798
I'd prefer to sleep
on the left side with two pillows.

491
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,971
I may not be bunking here
much longer myself.

492
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:10,813
There are possums
living in the shed.

493
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,442
I thought I smelled the dung
of a mid-sized marsupial.

494
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:18,747
But if I don't live in the house,
I may miss out on a huge chunk

495
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:20,659
of the kappa tau experience.

496
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:23,630
- I won't even feel like a real brother.
- Why?

497
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,561
You moved off
the honors engineering floor.

498
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:29,672
- You're still an honors engineer.
- If I keep sleeping until 11:00,

499
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:30,943
I won't be for long.

500
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:38,504
Welcome, ladies.

501
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:39,815
You should know

502
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,690
you are part of an exclusive
group of young women

503
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:46,098
who embody what we're looking for
in our brand new sisterhood.

504
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,291
A sisterhood that will enjoy
all manner of greek fun,

505
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,897
some not even possible
at a traditional sority.

506
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:57,706
This was a brilliant idea, Case.
And not just 'cause it gave me an excuse

507
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:59,578
to wear my camo booty shorts.

508
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,733
Maybe, you could live
in that stupid apartment.

509
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:06,758
And keep a room at the house...

510
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:10,748
I know,
but I'll take your scheming brain

511
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,222
whenever I can get it.

512
00:29:12,347 --> 00:29:14,254
Red eagle, are you in position?

513
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,165
<i>Roger that, heaving bosom.</i>

514
00:29:17,698 --> 00:29:20,290
I never should have
let him pick my code name.

515
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,524
Mixers are a highlight
of sority life.

516
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:27,217
And if I'm not mistaken,
you're about to see a preview

517
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:30,309
of just the type of guys
we will be mixing with.

518
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:32,260
Ladies, may I present

519
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,523
the <i>creme de la creme</i>
of cyprus-rhodes men.

520
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,449
Wait.
These are not the guys I meant.

521
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,277
There's been a mistake!

522
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,939
Free beer!

523
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:06,345
- What are you doing here, cap?
- What are you doing here?

524
00:30:12,564 --> 00:30:13,561
I'm so sorry!

525
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:22,520
Madame president,
I believe our party awaits.

526
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,617
You better be dead or in captivity.

527
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,786
- Thanks for your concern.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

528
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:33,347
I'm trying to be sensitive,
but this is ridiculous.

529
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,623
<i>We're lost.</i>

530
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:37,153
This party bus driver's
a complete moron.

531
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:38,645
I'm sorry.

532
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,302
Not half as sorry as I...

533
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,962
<i>Put that freshie down right now!</i>

534
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,392
Hey, there.

535
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:02,026
I'm Ashleigh,
president of Zeta Beta Zeta.

536
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,224
And I'm Casey.

537
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:06,614
Unfortunately, pan-hellenic rules
preclude us from talking to you now,

538
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:10,415
because we're a real sority,
but we can't wait to meet

539
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,436
you all during rush next week.

540
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:14,534
We'll definitely be there.

541
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,003
I'm so glad you're my sister.

542
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,008
OK, they're gone.
You can let go.

543
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,389
- You are playing with fire.
- We know.

544
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,846
That's how we make s'mores.
Let them eat their s'mores.

545
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:37,963
We'll crush them during rush.

546
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:41,962
I misjudged you. I never thought you'd
be clueless enough to go with frannie.

547
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,654
You were clueless enough to think
I gave a crap about ZBZ

548
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,071
- in the first place.
- Couldn't have said it better myself.

549
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,770
I can't believe I felt sorry for you

550
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:51,014
because of your dad
screwing over your family.

551
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:54,787
- Now you've done the same thing to us.
- Let's not make this personal.

552
00:31:55,302 --> 00:31:56,703
Come on, let's go.

553
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:02,674
You know, just forget about them.

554
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,867
The important thing is,
the awesome twosome pulled it off.

555
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:08,642
The awesome twosome
is pretty awesome.

556
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:13,655
And you're breaking it up.

557
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:18,283
Ash, I want to tell you
the real reason I'm moving out.

558
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:22,065
Remember how I said
my internship was so amazing?

559
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:24,430
Like, I got to research a bill?

560
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:27,278
It was amazing.
I was so impressed.

561
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:29,304
It was a starbucks bill.

562
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:32,199
My boss got overcharged
for his latte.

563
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,479
That still sounds math-y.

564
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:39,427
My internship was
a complete failure.

565
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,284
The other interns came

566
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:44,695
armed with years of knowledge.

567
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:48,575
I came armed with subtle highlights
and the ability to make up a cheesy skit

568
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,883
about almost anything.
And worst of all,

569
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,180
they called me Elle Woods.

570
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,801
All the other interns thought
I was some stupid sorority girl.

571
00:33:00,653 --> 00:33:02,890
And nothing I did proved them wrong.

572
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:07,403
- So, they underestimated you.
- But think about it.

573
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,635
Elle woods was the only one
in that courtroom

574
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,868
who knew you can't wash out
the ammonium thioglycolate

575
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:14,658
in a perm for 24 hours.
It helped her catch a murder.

576
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:17,095
I know.

577
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,345
But maybe there's a way that

578
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:23,709
we can find you your space to focus
right there in the house?

579
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:28,213
I'm tall but I can make myself really,
really small.

580
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,743
And cute.

581
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:45,087
- My butt fell asleep.
- Come on. Let's go find this party.

582
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,539
I'll catch up.
I left my sweatshirt on the bus.

583
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:05,525
Nice work, Jeremy.

584
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,999
They're hijacking our bus.

585
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:17,917
Hurry up, guys, hurry up!

586
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,871
Has anyone seen Andy?

587
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:48,419
Proving once again
that crime does pay.

588
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:51,588
And having a brother with a class C
commercial drivers license.

589
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,881
Thank you, Jeremy.

590
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:58,011
- The Omega chis can suck it!
- They can and they will, Ben Bennett.

591
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:08,188
I just had an epiphany.

592
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,315
Man, did it get on the seat?

593
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:19,646
Kappa Tau house is just
like camp tiny pine.

594
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:21,744
Not because of all the flies.

595
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:25,166
Because Kappa Tau is not a place.

596
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:27,416
It's a feeling.

597
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:30,402
It's a feeling
that's taken root in my heart,

598
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:32,921
even if I never eat
another pepperoni log.

599
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:38,104
I'll be a Kappa Tau
no matter where I live.

600
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,189
No matter where I spread my seed.

601
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,470
Nap time.

602
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:13,420
I'm moving out of Kappa Tau, cap.

603
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,215
Congratulations.

604
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,761
Where are you gonna spread your seed?
You got another place lined up?

605
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,315
I hadn't thought that through.

606
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:33,262
It's good to be back
in good old calhoun hall.

607
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,318
- It's good to have you back.
- You really don't mind being here

608
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,849
instead of caltech?

609
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,904
I don't get it.
You had the grant

610
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:45,326
and then caltech
changed their minds?

611
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:48,872
Caltech didn't change
their mind. I did.

612
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,335
- You changed their mind?
- I changed my mind. About going.

613
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,248
I turned down the grant
so I could stay at cru with Casey.

614
00:36:56,373 --> 00:36:59,068
She doesn't know. You can't tell her.
I don't want her to feel some...

615
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:00,676
kind of obligation.

616
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:03,095
You're really not gonna tell her?

617
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,020
A slumber party involving
my brother, my boyfriend and...

618
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:21,036
- How disturbing.
- Rusty and dale are having some...

619
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:22,941
roommate trouble.

620
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,798
I met a guy down the hall who
was looking for a new roommate.

621
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,078
Canadian guy.
He was so nice.

622
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:34,660
This canuck is relentless.
Did you tell him I was in here?

623
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:36,751
You're a good girl.

624
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,407
Let's go to the new apartment.
I don't know

625
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:45,679
when I'm gonna be able
to get these guys out.

626
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,805
About the new place,

627
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,269
I've been reconsidering it.

628
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:53,894
What?

629
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,956
Welcome to titan tower apartments.

630
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,081
Thanks.

631
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:01,653
I'll admit I was taken aback
when you added

632
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,447
two gentlemen roommates.

633
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:07,803
But these two look responsible,
not to mention charming.

634
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:12,497
I should go.

635
00:38:13,614 --> 00:38:16,335
You know where to find me
if you need... anything.

636
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:19,765
Anything at all.

637
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:31,654
Cougars love me.

638
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:34,963
Not that I have a problem
with older women.

639
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:38,190
Listen guys,
my name is on this lease.

640
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:41,360
Sheila thinks I live here and even
though I don't, I'm responsible.

641
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,236
Think of me as your second landlord.

642
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:46,451
I'm totally cool with that.
I have no problem being your submissive.

643
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:48,253
Being... being submissive.

644
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:49,284
To you.

645
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,752
- I'm happy to have somewhere to live.
- I told you we'd be roomies again.

646
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,176
I'm not worried. He'll show.
Let's go.

647
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,139
Sorry I'm late.

648
00:39:12,694 --> 00:39:14,416
I just woke up from a nap.

649
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,144
No worries, man.

650
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,272
We thought maybe those Kappa Taus
were holding you hostage.

651
00:39:19,952 --> 00:39:21,239
They were cool.

652
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:25,153
And your boy Rusty made
a pretty inspiring speech on the bus.

653
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:28,323
I kinda cried.

654
00:39:36,763 --> 00:39:38,083
Excuse me one second.

655
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,551
I never found you at the lake.

656
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:50,220
You finally came by to make sure
I was alive?

657
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,611
I knew you were alive.

658
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,753
I was thinking
I could make it up to you.

659
00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:59,730
Take you out for a nice dinner.

660
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:04,067
- You really want to make it up to me?
- Of course.

661
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:07,471
I hate to ask this, but...

662
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:11,867
I need a rent check.
For the house?

663
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:16,378
Of course.

664
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,070
Show me the filthy remark about Frannie
and then let's get out of here.

665
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:27,720
I hate north campus.

666
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,968
Which stall is it again?

667
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:37,768
Rebecca, You could have chosen
the handicapped stall!

668
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,728
Keep it down.
This is a secret meeting.

669
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,814
- Why is this traitors' turnskirt here?
- Rebecca's not a traitors'turnskirt.

670
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:46,007
Not for the reasons that you think.
She didn't deactivate ZBZ.

671
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,651
I'm a mole at Frannie's house.

672
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:50,749
Rush spy! She's gonna help us, Case.

673
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:53,477
She's the one who told us
about Frannie's top secret lake party.

674
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,453
Rebecca and I talked over the summer
and I wanted to tell you,

675
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,938
but you know what a gossip I am.
I can't keep shameful secrets.

676
00:41:00,063 --> 00:41:02,574
I even told you about
my crush on dean bowman.

677
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,500
And now I've just told Rebecca. See?

678
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,098
Seeing you guys go all Hasselbeck
and O'Donnell on each other at the lake,

679
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:11,718
I realized I had to come clean
or things would split screen.

680
00:41:13,547 --> 00:41:16,585
- We are all still sisters.
- You expect me to trust her?

681
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,030
I'm trusting you
and you kissed my boyfriend.

682
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:22,781
You broke up with him and you slept
with my boyfriend last rush week.

683
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:24,898
At least I didn't know
he was your boyfriend.

684
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,024
Ladies, please.

685
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:29,861
Can we at least, for my sake,
try and be "frenemies?"

686
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,397
And with this pink tank top,

687
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:46,914
I hereby declare you,
Casey Cartwright,

688
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,471
officially moved back into ZBZ.

689
00:41:49,596 --> 00:41:51,206
Now complete with...

690
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:54,764
focus space!

691
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,979
See, you can live in the house
and still be serious.

692
00:42:01,874 --> 00:42:02,853
Thanks, Ash.

693
00:42:04,048 --> 00:42:05,438
No more keeping secrets.

694
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,857
And no more crazy surprises,
like Rebecca in a bathroom.

695
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,007
- I still think you can't trust her.
- If you're worried about Rebecca

696
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:13,613
maybe you need a bigger role.

697
00:42:13,738 --> 00:42:16,255
Like becoming my new rush chair?

698
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:18,978
You made laura rush chair.

699
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,788
I can dismiss her
on grounds of incompetence.

700
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:24,249
Did you see her at the lake?
If that is the best she can do

701
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:27,627
faking sisterly love,
she'll never make it through rush week.

702
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:30,172
Rush chair, that's a big one.

703
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:31,733
I know.

704
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:34,713
It sounds so...

705
00:42:35,171 --> 00:42:36,171
fun.

706
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:40,182
No need to turn myself into grandma
before I absolutely have to.

707
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:41,351
So...

708
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:48,794
Before all the warm fuzzies go away,
the warm fuzzies go away,

709
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:51,355
- I have one last thing to confess.
- What?

710
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:56,380
In exchange for ruing Frannie's party
I promised our first three mixers

711
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:57,994
to the Kappa Taus.

712
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:59,338
Don't fire me!

713
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:02,446
You're lucky you're my best friend.

714
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,900
I am.
