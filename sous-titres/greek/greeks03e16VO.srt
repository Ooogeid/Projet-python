1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,584
Previously on Greek.

2
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:04,462
How could you possibly imagine,
that we have anything in common ?

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,297
- I just thought...
- We did.

4
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,643
I wanna be as brave as you.
Maybe explore a little.

5
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:10,898
I thought it would look
really good on you.

6
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:13,374
- Let's try it, shall we ?
- Is that from Evan ?

7
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:16,154
- It's a keepsake I can keep forever.
- Think that was his idea ?

8
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,185
- Have you seen Rebecca ?
- She was gonna step out get some air.

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,932
- If we go upstairs ?
- Why do you wanna go... ?

10
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:22,927
My God !

11
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:24,398
I just miss you.

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,610
Now you're double dating with Evan
and Rebecca instead of me and Cappie.

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,070
- Have fun.
- You, too.

14
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,641
If anybody knows his way
inside the beltway, it's Joel.

15
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,813
We mostly hire people with post-graduate
degrees for legislative aide jobs.

16
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:37,203
- What about law school ?
- I'm gonna go to law school.

17
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,832
That's great. And I've made
a pretty big decision myself.

18
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,541
This is a form for declaring a major.
Wait, this is blank.

19
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:53,262
Hey, Cap, I hope you don't mind. But
I moved some of your stuff off your desk

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,184
and put it over there.

21
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:57,398
I have a desk ?

22
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:59,356
Is that your personal statement ?

23
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:02,766
Your second draft was great. Although,
I preferred the font on your ninth.

24
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:05,082
OK. Well,
It has to be perfect, given my

25
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:08,352
OK grades and not-so-OK
practice LSAT scores.

26
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:11,493
Georgetown,
Stanford and CRU all place

27
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:14,563
great importance on
the personal statement.

28
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:18,278
I get it, all right ?
I'm dealing with future stuff, too.

29
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:20,788
Like thinking about
declaring a real major.

30
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,396
If I get into CRU law, which would be
ideal because it's a really good school

31
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:27,536
and it's here and you find
a major that you love,

32
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,904
maybe we could end up
graduating at the same time.

33
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:32,224
- Isn't that crazy, right ?
- The craziest.

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,732
Done in seven years.
I'll be like Speedy Gonzales.

35
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:37,861
Maybe I should study Spanish,
or Espana as they say.

36
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,658
If you need help finding a major, I can
always go through your transcripts.

37
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:44,145
No, no, no, no.
I want you to focus on law school.

38
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,355
Asking for help isn't a bad thing.

39
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,859
That's why I'm so glad that Joel agreed
to read this and give me feedback.

40
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,061
Joel...

41
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,320
the Orgy Guy ?

42
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,991
Can we call him Joel the guy who is
going to help Casey get into Law School?

43
00:01:57,311 --> 00:02:00,358
I don't know, Orgy Guy gives
him a lot more personality.

44
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:03,497
Or personalidante,
as they would say.

45
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,503
All right. Bye, Cap.

46
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,049
Pull !

47
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,238
And... pull !

48
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:20,806
Dumptruck, guys,
what are you doing ?

49
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,267
Those go in the Dumpster.
But this is way more fun.

50
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:25,561
- And more fast.
- And no one lives in that house.

51
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,049
And since Jeremy left,

52
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:30,024
no one lives in the Dumpster.
So let's use it.

53
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,338
Mornin', Spitter.

54
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:34,528
- Why so grumpy ?
- These guys won't use the Dumpster.

55
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:37,198
- I miss Jeremy.
- Yeah.

56
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,657
- You have a major, right ?
- Did you pick one yet ?

57
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:42,759
It's a big commitment.
I was thinking about archeology.

58
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:45,581
- I've always liked Indiana Jones.
- Did you see the last movie ?

59
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,458
Good point.
How about astronaut ?

60
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:48,918
That's not a major.

61
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,129
- Looks like I'm back to square one.
- You probably have a lot of options.

62
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,869
You just need to focus.

63
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:57,325
That's the problem. See, I'm not
a fan of the focus-y stuff, you know ?

64
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:04,099
Hey, Mr. Spitter,
I think Dumptruck might be dead.

65
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,108
Any of this belong to you boys ?

66
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,406
Never seen it.

67
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,406
No big deal,
but there's a lot more over there.

68
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,368
if you all worked together,
you could clear it out in an afternoon.

69
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,994
Wait.
Who are you ?

70
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,329
Your new neighbors.

71
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,078
-= 316 =-
"Your Friends and Neighbors"

72
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:35,631
Kappa Team

73
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,441
Hey, stranger !

74
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:49,186
How was your big date with Pete ?

75
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,479
It was amazing.

76
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,446
Tell me.

77
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:53,706
I want to,
but I'm running late for a potato chip

78
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,692
focus group for
my retail marketing class.

79
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,235
Sounds salty.

80
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:00,614
And I volunteered us to do nametags
and cups for the dorm reunion.

81
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,201
Crap ! The freshman dorm reunion, right.
I'll get cups from the KT house.

82
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,247
Guess whose roommate
is gonna be there.

83
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,997
- Yours ?
- No, but

84
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,891
it turns out Janine's freshman 15

85
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,792
is now a two-year-old named Toby.

86
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
No way !

87
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,589
- So Sunny's going to be there ?
- She never liked me.

88
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,487
So...

89
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:19,948
name tags.
I have this focus group until three.

90
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:23,592
- How about we do them at four ?
- I'm meeting Joel at four. Six ?

91
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:26,495
- I have dinner with Pete.
- And including your making out...

92
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,017
How about ten ?

93
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,394
Pledge bonding.
We're doing kitty collages.

94
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,507
And I have class all day tomorrow.

95
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,315
Tomorrow night ?
7 : 30 ?

96
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:36,150
7 : 30 nametags.

97
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:37,687
Great.

98
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,812
Along with all the details
on your date with Pete.

99
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,573
How can smelly, old people

100
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,559
just move in next door ?
Isn't that illegal ?

101
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:50,223
I thought you said after
that fraternity disbanded in the'80s,

102
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:52,124
no one lived there
anymore it's cursed.

103
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,751
It is.
By us.

104
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,358
Our Mardi Gras party is next week,
which means Ma and Pa

105
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,422
Poopy-pants are gonna
be pooping on our party.

106
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,868
I think we are overreacting
a little bit.

107
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:03,482
The Hilgendorfs seem
like reasonable people.

108
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,021
What ?

109
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,724
We had a very interesting conversation
when we were cleaning out their yard.

110
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,018
Professor Hilgendorf
is a music historian.

111
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,394
He's faculty ?

112
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,003
Rusty, trust me, this is bad.

113
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,690
They're gonna want us
to be neighborly, respectful,

114
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,222
quiet.
That's not us.

115
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,886
We need to get them gone.

116
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,230
- How about a haunting ?
- Where are the chains at ?

117
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,156
I think we could get along
with them.

118
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,367
Good fences, good neighbors ?

119
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:29,370
I'll take care of it,
and you can concentrate on your major.

120
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,170
Guys. Against my better judgment

121
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,036
Spitter is going over there to make
nice. So someone start a pool to see

122
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,865
how long I have until I get
to tell him "I told you so."

123
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,471
Cap, I did something,

124
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:49,348
and I feel kinda bad about it.

125
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,892
Well, you seem extremely upset.

126
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:53,644
I had sex with Rebecca Logan !

127
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,284
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:57,846 --> 00:06:00,424
I broke the bro code.
If you want to hit me, I understand.

129
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:02,529
Wait.
Is this like last year

130
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,863
when you "had sex"
with Wonder Woman ?

131
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,367
I'm still not convinced I didn't.

132
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,750
Remember the rope burns
when the guys were teasing you

133
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,463
- with the Lasso of Truth ?
- Yeah, OK. But...

134
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:16,291
I'm still 75 to 25 percent
sure I had sex with Rebecca.

135
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,559
I was drinking...

136
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:20,546
Why don't you just keep this to
yourself until you're absolutely sure.

137
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,924
We wouldn't want Wonder
Woman to get jealous?

138
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,192
Let's go get those chains.

139
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,178
You look pretty cheery for a guy
who lost his date last night.

140
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:48,143
Rebecca left me a message.
Apparently, she had food poisoning

141
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:50,283
and she ran out
so she wouldn't throw up on me.

142
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:52,161
You sure she didn't see you dance ?

143
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,155
Funny.

144
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,080
With the extra time
I had this morning,

145
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,707
I was able to finish the last
of my law school applications.

146
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,519
- Let's celebrate.
- Looks like you already are, man.

147
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:03,451
- What's up with Club Calvin ?
- Well.

148
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:05,466
I'm making a gay-list.

149
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,558
A what ?

150
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:08,476
It's a playlist of gay music.

151
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,843
Does this have to do
with Grant's new...

152
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:11,972
look ?

153
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:13,901
Yeah, a little.

154
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,914
It's just that I've been surrounded
by so much

155
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,854
straight in my life, I've never opened
my eyes to see what else is out there.

156
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,715
Seeing Grant sort of explore this new
world has motivated me

157
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,222
- to do the same.
- To boldly go where

158
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,361
ten percent of men have gone before.

159
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,152
Yeah. Seriously.
Stop dancing.

160
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:33,087
Evan, I was looking for you.
I was going through the receipts from

161
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:36,663
the party and there's like $500
missing from the petty cash.

162
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,730
- I think someone stole it.
- Wait, like a guest from last night ?

163
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:44,546
No, the cash box is hidden.

164
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,007
Only a brother would
even know to look for it.

165
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:49,301
It sounds like we have
a thief in the house.

166
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:57,605
Damn.

167
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:01,658
I hate when my human sexuality
study group finishes without me.

168
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:03,732
What can I say ?
You came late.

169
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,751
So...

170
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:10,197
I heard the craziest thing today.

171
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,241
Beaver thinks he had
sex with you last night.

172
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,327
He told you ? My God, you guys
gossip worse than sority girls.

173
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,830
He was right ?
Was this Chambers-inspired ?

174
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,499
Did he sleep with a townie ?
Get a few of your sisters expelled ?

175
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,377
He bought me a necklace
for Valentine's Day.

176
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,832
And you didn't like it ?
No, it's beautiful.

177
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,152
A silver, teardrop pendant with a
diamond...

178
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,428
that I'm not wearing. It's just,
he's being romantic and buying me gifts

179
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,618
and it's all very sweet and overwhelming
and something I'm not used to.

180
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:40,227
Well setting aside the possible personal
attack and considering you and I dated

181
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,535
and that Evan is a first-class ass-hat,
shouldn't you be happy

182
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,157
that you're being wooed ?

183
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,360
Unless you really like him and that
freaks you out so you're messing

184
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,654
- all this up on purpose.
- What ?

185
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:54,308
Spring break ? Wet T-shirt contest ?
"I'm beneath you" ? Ring any bells ?

186
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,327
Don't confuse your old feelings about
me with the way I felt about you.

187
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,315
OK, maybe I don't like getting too
comfortable. What can I say ?

188
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,504
Well, you can say how Chambers took it
when you dumped him. Did he cry ?

189
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,959
- Why would I dump him ?
- Why wouldn't you ?

190
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,759
Look, I like Evan.
And as much as it might bother you,

191
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:16,270
I do care about him. I just don't
want things to get so serious.

192
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,630
That doesn't mean I'm ready
to throw in the towel.

193
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,528
If you're not gonna dump him,
aren't you worried he's gonna find out

194
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:23,068
- about Beaver ?
- Not really.

195
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:24,980
Who's gonna believe Beaver ?
You didn't.

196
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,926
Good point.
Just promise me one thing.

197
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:30,499
- I won't hurt your brother.
- Please, he had sex, he's fine.

198
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:32,403
If you decide to tell Evan,

199
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,200
just let me know.
I'd like to be there for that.

200
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,846
Just text me about it.

201
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,266
Well, it's a little...

202
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:45,834
dry.

203
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,004
Dry can be good.
Like a martini.

204
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,174
It reads like your resume in paragraph
form. It won't distinguish you from

205
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,722
- the thousands of other applicants.
- Thousands ?

206
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,804
And I bet they started working
on this last fall instead of last month.

207
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,857
If it makes you feel any better,
I always planned to go to law school and

208
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,809
I didn't know what to
write for mine, either.

209
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,854
- How'd you figure it out ?
- The Backstreet Boys.

210
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,481
I can write about them.

211
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,149
It wasn't just about them.

212
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,792
I couldn't understand how the Supreme
Court had made such a bad decision

213
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,800
on this voting rights case,

214
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,824
and then I remembered that

215
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:18,742
I took my ex-wife

216
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,245
to a Backstreet Boys
concert for our first date.

217
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,303
Another bad decision

218
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:26,166
and a connection between
me and our nation's highest court.

219
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,251
Ex-wife ?

220
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,876
Sorry, none of my...

221
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:32,338
We got married a week
after graduation,

222
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,892
I started law school
and she started working.

223
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:38,178
Somewhere between trusts
and estates and cyberlaw,

224
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,556
- we found ourselves on different paths.
- I'm sorry.

225
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,822
Don't be. The older you get,
the more you realize

226
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,388
some people should be
around your entire life

227
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,315
and others should just
make an appearance.

228
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,070
So...

229
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:55,658
I should

230
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,907
find a personal connection
between myself and the law.

231
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:04,454
I stole a pair of earrings from
Claire's when I was in seventh grade.

232
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:09,084
Misdemeanor. Now, if you have ever been
charged with murder or arson...

233
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,336
Charged ?
No. No, no.

234
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,505
No !

235
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,089
No charging.

236
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:17,426
- So when are your applications due ?
- Friday.

237
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:21,266
Then I hope you've got a lot of time to
do some thinking in the next few days,

238
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,140
because you got some work to do.

239
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,971
So far, so good
with the Hilgendorfs.

240
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:37,264
I had the pledges sweep their porch,
clean their gutters

241
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:38,905
and wire their surround sound.

242
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,326
Which just leaves me
with my major major problem.

243
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:44,210
Have you thought about English ?

244
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,955
That's a great idea.
I already speak it.

245
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,124
Right ?

246
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,793
- Professor Hilgendorf.
- Nope.

247
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,045
Call me Tom.

248
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,315
Margie made these to thank you boys.

249
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,428
- Free food !
- Free food ? Where ?

250
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,904
Listen, I also wanted to talk
to you about your fence.

251
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,699
I think it's kind of strange,
the way it abuts our house.

252
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,443
You got beer pong.

253
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,362
Why ?
Is it too loud ?

254
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:21,353
Welcome to the best part
of the neighborhood, Tom-o.

255
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:22,616
Eye candy.

256
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,452
That's my daughter.

257
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,246
Her name is Hannah.
And she is 16 years old.

258
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,671
Sixteen.

259
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,626
- I repeat, sixteen.
- Thanks, Dad.

260
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,793
That was mortifying.
Mom said dinner's ready in ten minutes.

261
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,047
I better get going.

262
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,882
- Enjoy your meatloaf.
- I will.

263
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,967
Also, can I ask you guys

264
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:43,762
to rein in the noise after 10 pm
on school nights ?

265
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:46,747
- That sounds sort of reasonable.
- You know what ?

266
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:50,340
Here's a few other simple
requests that you shouldn't mind at all.

267
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,976
"Noise curfew of midnight on Friday
and Saturday, lawn free of alcohol,

268
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:59,152
furniture and debris,
no foul language at any time ?"

269
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,334
Thanks, guys.

270
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,521
- Who had six hours ?
- That'd be me.

271
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:07,686
Someone pay the man,
because, Spitter,

272
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:10,872
I told you so !

273
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,876


274
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:18,540
Last night, I emailed Rusty to thank him
again for Valentine's Day and I also

275
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,925
included a link to a very fascinating
clip about a high-speed robot hand.

276
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,428
But do you think that that
was too forward of me ?

277
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,506
And how long do you think I should
wait before I take the hint ?

278
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:31,718
I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for
you to discuss your brother in terms

279
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:33,812
- of romantic liaison ?
- Always.

280
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:36,983
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm really stressed.

281
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,485
Maybe we should get a cup of coffee
and discuss what's bothering you.

282
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,357
And about these feelings I'm having.

283
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:44,410
As fun as that sounds,

284
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,242
I really need to work
on my personal statement.

285
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,470
Maybe I could come over
and brainstorm some ideas.

286
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,289
I was recently accepted
into Yale Law.

287
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,344
Congratulations !

288
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:55,672
That'd be great.

289
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,429
- You don't mind ?
- Of Course not.

290
00:13:57,554 --> 00:14:00,578
 While we work, I could ask you some
hypothetical questions about dating ?

291
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,133
We could pretend
I'm not talking about your brother.

292
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:08,468
Bite me, A.

293
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,681
- Who you calling an A ?
- You, you R.

294
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,729
What the H is an R ?

295
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,854
I think it's the same as a Q.

296
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:20,590
Well, this turned out well.

297
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:24,279
Come on, Cap.
What's the harm in a few rules ?

298
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,570
Well, one, most Kts can't spell,

299
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:29,826
and two, this is a fraternity house.
At least it used to be.

300
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,014
I'll go over there
and talk to Tom again.

301
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,002
What, so he can assign
a dress code ?

302
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:37,393
No, this is when we fight back,
this is when we play dirty,

303
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:39,377
this is when we make them pay.

304
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,519
We cannot go to war
with a faculty member.

305
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:43,394
We will all get expelled.

306
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,092
Wait a minute.
We can Borg him.

307
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,202
I'll get Heath.

308
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,263
Absorb him

309
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,932
into our collective.
If he feels like he's one of us,

310
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:56,436
maybe he will relax the rules.

311
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,583
You know,  that oddly makes sense.

312
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,575
And maybe he could help
you pick a major. He is faculty,

313
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:05,403
and the one thing old people love
to do more than anything else

314
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,113
is give advice to kids.

315
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,658
Z...

316
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:11,117
S...

317
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,680
I bet I know who stole the money.

318
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,646
Don't want to be elitist,
but hello ?

319
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:18,708
- Housekeeping ?
- Everybody, calm down.

320
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,619
Let's not turn this
into a witch-hunt.

321
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:22,837
I bet it was Trip.

322
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:25,966
He's the first to blame everyone else
so he can throw suspicion off himself.

323
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:28,343
What am I supposed to do,
just let us get ripped off ?

324
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:32,250
No one's saying do nothing, Trip.
There's no reason to turn on each other.

325
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,350
Does it really matter who took it ?
It's only 500 bucks.

326
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:38,645
Maybe Grant took it. Can't be cheap
to change your look overnight.

327
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,022
Maybe crazy Natalie tricked you
into stealing it for her.

328
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,149
What did I just say
about turning on each other ?

329
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,695
Guys, what I meant is maybe we can all
 pitch in a little cash and cover it.

330
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,721
- Problem solved.
- It's not about the money.

331
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:51,292
- It's the principle.
- Maybe it was Chambers.

332
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,369
- He needs money the most.
- After everything Evan's been through

333
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,760
with the house,
you think he'd steal the money ?

334
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:58,235
Maybe it was you.

335
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:02,085
So much for avoiding a witch-hunt.

336
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:11,469
So Tom, what does
a music historian actually do ?

337
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,078
I mostly just listen to music.

338
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,182
Boring classically classical stuff ?

339
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,022
Well, I have spent
the last three years

340
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:21,855
working on Richard Strauss'
Die Agyptische Helena.

341
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:27,250
- Talk about driving a man to drink.
- Yes ! That's true.

342
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,951
- Do you have any ?
- Take mine.

343
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:30,530
All right.
Thank you.

344
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,757
You know, in my day,
we used to play a game

345
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:36,953
that combined eight-ball
and beer pong and gambling.

346
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,705
- Monkey-Hump ?
- Yes !

347
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,166
- I'm undefeated.
- Are you ?

348
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:42,626
So am I.

349
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,372
Borg-ing commenced.

350
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,674
You know, Tom...

351
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,752
We were just talking about Cappie

352
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:54,684
having so much trouble
picking a major.

353
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,485
As a professor, you might be able
to give him some advice.

354
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,851
Maybe you can discuss it
while you guys Monkey-Hump.

355
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,187
I'd be more than happy
to help you with that.

356
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,719
It's on.

357
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,541
Can I help you with something ?

358
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,085
No, thanks.

359
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,230
- That was weird.
- I know. She said thanks.

360
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:36,138
So I will go grab all the nametag stuff.
We have so much catching up to do.

361
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,062
- The... ?
- For the dorm reunion ?

362
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,058
My God !
I totally forgot.

363
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,852
You probably forgot
to pick up the cups, too.

364
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:44,771
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:46,690
Joel blew apart

366
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,734
my personal statement and I've been
trying to come up with a new topic.

367
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:52,487
That sucks.
You should've told me.

368
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,720
Maybe I can help.
It's all about marketing yourself.

369
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:59,127
And who knows more about marketing
or yourself, than me and myself ?

370
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,746
I know what your personal statement
should be about. Hi, ZBZ.

371
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:07,656
Katherine is helping me,
and she already got into law school !

372
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:11,124
- Awesome !
- The ban on sexual discrimination

373
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:13,133
was added to the Civil
Rights Act of 1964

374
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,249
by a senator who wanted
to defeat the bill.

375
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:17,637
- But the bill passed, right ?
- Yes, it did.

376
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,468
But just as justice
triumphed over cynicism,

377
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:23,185
you do not let the negative
stereotypes of sority girls

378
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,353
dissuade you from achieving

379
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,624
- visionary objectives.
- That is perfect !

380
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:29,073
Right, Ash ?

381
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:30,358
Yeah.

382
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:33,737
So I'll just go do those nametags.

383
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,322
Looks like you guys
got this under control.

384
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,578
Don't forget the cups, Case.

385
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:43,663
Right.

386
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,518


387
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,083
Thanks for the cups, Rus.

388
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,258
No problem.

389
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,763
You have a second ?

390
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:59,545
You wanna see this awesome video
of this robot hand ?

391
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,420
That Katherine sent you ?

392
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:04,711
She's kind of cool and interesting.

393
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,940
I wish everyone felt that way.

394
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:10,064
- I think Ashleigh's jealous of her.
- Then I can't help you.

395
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,002
Guys don't get jealous. That way,
we have more time to invent things

396
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:16,237
- and cure diseases.
- And start wars and light farts ?

397
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,254
Well, thanks, Rus.
Big help.

398
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:21,326
Where's Cappie ?
How's his major hunt going ?

399
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,760
I think I may have found him
an academic adviser.

400
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:24,662
Great !

401
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,276
I don't want to sound like
one of those nagging girlfriends

402
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,325
and it's not like I'm worried
he's gonna end up being...

403
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,377
one of those 40-year-olds guys
still partying at the KT house...

404
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,005
I'm starving !

405
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:39,928
Gotta get up !

406
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:42,263
Oh, man...

407
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:48,144
That's not his academic adviser,
right ?

408
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,207
No. That's...

409
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,232
Pickle's dad.

410
00:19:57,245 --> 00:19:59,841
David Sedaris is doing a reading
on campus this weekend.

411
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,658
- You wanna go ?
- Sounds fun.

412
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:06,621
That was pretty gutsy of you,
taking on Trip.

413
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,290
Why ?
Evan's my big brother.

414
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,532
Haven't you thought
maybe he stole the money ?

415
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:14,415
- He's broke. He needs the cash.
- And he has a job.

416
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,155
As far as I know, he's not investing
in home hair products

417
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,758
and velvet suits.

418
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,562
- So now you think that I did it ?
- No, I'm just merely pointing out

419
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:26,287
why we shouldn't be
throwing around blame.

420
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:27,851
Hi, guys.

421
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,975
- What are you doing ?
- Waiting for Evan.

422
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,607
No, to the couch.

423
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,653
- Redecorating.
- Let us know if you find $500 in there.

424
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:42,367
Hey, feeling better ?

425
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,993
Yeah, must've been one
of those 24 hour things.

426
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,819
- I'm really hungry now.
- Okay, let's go.

427
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,903
So we shouldn't be throwing
blame around, even though last night

428
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:54,168
you were pissed that someone
stole from their brothers ?

429
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,911
I don't like any of it, OK ?

430
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:57,773
The money was stolen on my watch,

431
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:00,848
so everyone's looking at me
to fix the situation.

432
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:04,304
Maybe there's a way we can solve
both problems at once.

433
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,640
Get the money back and not
publicly humiliate anyone.

434
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:14,274
Tom didn't go home last night ?

435
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,720
No, he told Margie he was up all night
grading papers.

436
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:18,934
You're a genius, Spitter.
I think we Borged him.

437
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,941
He dropped the curfews and told us not
to worry about the house-butt problem.

438
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:25,670
So mission accomplished, right ?
You can send him home.

439
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:27,571
No way, I made him
an honorary pledge.

440
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:29,846
He came as Tom.
Now, he's T-Bag.

441
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,565
So did T-Bag help you
with your major ?

442
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,473
I found out what old people love more
than giving advice : being young people.

443
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,173
I can't believe I Monkey-Humped you
twice last night.

444
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,091
Do you guys ever do keg stands ?

445
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:45,053
Hi, there.
Have you seen Tom ?

446
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,526
No, we haven't, Mrs. Hilgendorf.

447
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:51,184
May I say that blouse
brings out the color in your eyes ?

448
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:54,020
And the lemon bars... to die for.

449
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:55,855
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

450
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:59,400
And if we see Tom, we'll be sure
to tell him you came by looking for him.

451
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,070
Of course.
Have a nice day.

452
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,407
Dude, thank you.

453
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,096
She would've had my ass.

454
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:10,495
And not in a...
Like in a good way.

455
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:13,706
It's the least I can do for the best
academic adviser at CRU

456
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:16,167
Do you wanna watch sports all day ?

457
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,378
Okay !
Let me get my beers !

458
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:24,926
- What's up, guys ?
- When's the old dude leaving ?

459
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,928
Because if I wanted to spend time
with a guy

460
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,639
old enough to be my dad,
I'd go home and hang with my dad.

461
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,244
He's not doing too much
for Cappie at this point either.

462
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:34,560
You invited him here,
so make him go.

463
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,146
How ? Cappie already made him
an honorary pledge.

464
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,274
You're Pledge Educator.
Just haze him until he quits.

465
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:45,088
Pledge T-Bag ?
Yes ?

466
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,698
Give me five ?

467
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,784
These are mine.

468
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:52,453
Pushups ?

469
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,039
Hazing ! Fun !

470
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,416
Okay, let's do them !

471
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,596
- Five more ?
- OK. Wait a minute.

472
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,516
Shouldn't all the other pledges
be doing this with me ?

473
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,229
Sorry, guys.
Ten from everyone.

474
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,978
Come on, you guys !

475
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,030
Yeah.

476
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:28,614
Good.

477
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,658
I'll prepare the SOUF.

478
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,161
What's that ?
What's the SOUF ?

479
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,330
Smoothie Of Unidentified Fluids.

480
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,916
And you're gonna love your costume.

481
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:47,278
You should probably
start getting ready.

482
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:50,178
Can I meet you there ?
I just want to read through this again.

483
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,806
I thought "Gamma Psi"
figured it all out for you.

484
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,535
Katherine has really smart advice.

485
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,540
She's already gotten
into Yale Law and...

486
00:23:59,665 --> 00:24:02,054
she knows what the admissions
committees are looking for.

487
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,815
But does she know you ?

488
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:06,173
I gotta tell you,
when I think of Casey Cartwright,

489
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:09,298
I'm not reminded
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

490
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,617
Well, it's a good thing you're not
on the admissions committees.

491
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,659
Why is it even called a personal
statement, if it's just a bunch of BS ?

492
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:19,707
Look, I don't care
if it's BS or personal.

493
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:23,503
I just want to get into law school
and with Katherine's input, I will.

494
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:26,377
You're sure about that ?

495
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:30,895
I'm so sure,

496
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:33,888
I am going to go with you
to that reunion.

497
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,007
Great.
Don't forget the cups.

498
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:38,062
Again.

499
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:41,726
No dust.
Anywhere.

500
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:45,198
Beaver, did you find
any jewelry in your room ?

501
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:46,323
Leave.

502
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:48,945
A silver necklace ?

503
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,572
Why would that be in my room ?

504
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:54,659
I think I lost it when we...

505
00:24:56,937 --> 00:24:57,987
You know...

506
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:03,084
God, you're gonna make me say it.
When we had sex.

507
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:06,212
We did do it !
I bet Wonder Woman really happened, too.

508
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,674
Don't worry.
You were way better.

509
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:14,891
What, I'm serious.

510
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:18,057
You're charming
when you're not trying so hard.

511
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,434
Wanna go upstairs
and lose your earrings ?

512
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,903
And now you're back.
Come on, help me find my necklace.

513
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:30,903
How's it going, Pledge T-Bag ?

514
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,129
- What do I clean next ?
- You wanna play some beer pong ?

515
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:36,868
He was just about to clean
underneath the pool table.

516
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:38,744
Oh, you guys !

517
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:43,791
So I think Tom has helped me
decide what to major in.

518
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,168
- Really ?
- Yes.

519
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:46,993
I wanna major in Tom.

520
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,128
I want to be having that much fun
when I'm elderly. He's awesome.

521
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:53,509
No, he isn't.

522
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,762
He's creeping everybody out. Not to
mention, no girl will ever set foot

523
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,901
in Kappa Tau once they know we're
recruiting senior citizens as pledges.

524
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,667
Untrue. Girls love it here.
Look.

525
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:06,397
What ? That's Dumptruck.
And who's he with ?

526
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,225
Dad ?

527
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:13,946
You're drinking ?
What is this ?

528
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:16,031
I can't find my necklace.

529
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,259
- Noise disturbance !
- Huck ?

530
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:20,703
Oh no, campus cops.

531
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,540
- Officer Huck.
- Hucky !

532
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,209
The old Huckster !

533
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,670


534
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:42,183
There were supposed to be little
sparkly stickers, but I ran out of time.

535
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:46,355
I couldn't do it all by myself. Kinda
like you and your personal statement.

536
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:49,321
Well, this'll be a fun
walk down memory lane.

537
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:52,046
I'm gonna go put these
by the punch bowl.

538
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:54,576
My God !

539
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:58,574
And Ashleigh ?
Is that you ?

540
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:00,405
It is.
Hi, Sunny.

541
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,823
Well, I haven't seen you guys
in, like, forever !

542
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:05,713
- What have you been up to these days ?
- Ashleigh was just talking

543
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:08,626
about how she made
these nametags all by herself.

544
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,128
So cute.
And what about you ?

545
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,464
Well, she's applying to law school.

546
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,634
It's a visionary objective and nothing
will stop her from achieving it.

547
00:27:19,553 --> 00:27:21,504
You two really stuck together.
You know...

548
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:24,724
I've lost touch with almost everyone
from the dorm.

549
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,365
- We've been roommates.
- That explains it.

550
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,434
You can't help be friends with
the people you live with. Kind of like

551
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,814
how we were all friends because
the university randomly

552
00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:36,195
assigned us to Pierson. It's not like
we had a ton in common or anything !

553
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,449
I guess that's why reunions
are so awkward.

554
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:43,588
If you wanted awkward, you should've
been at the ZBZ house last night.

555
00:27:43,713 --> 00:27:45,705
Casey was under some serious
mind control.

556
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:48,768
- Were you playing Ouija ?
- All she was doing

557
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:51,669
was helping with my statement,
which is the key to my whole future.

558
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,463
Which evidently is more important
than your past.

559
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,739
What is your problem ?
Why are you so jealous ?

560
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:59,385
This isn't about Katherine.
And my problem is

561
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:03,557
that we're not on the same page at all
anymore and you don't even realize it.

562
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,163
It was great to see you both again.

563
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,424
If Huck finds out
we have a 16-year-old girl

564
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:22,873
hanging out at the house with alcohol,
we'll be kicked off the Row.

565
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:25,411
And my dad'll get fired
for partying with students.

566
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,066
Relax, it's just Huck.

567
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:30,100
We've Dewey and Anthony Hopkins
keeping him occupied inside.

568
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:32,348
We'll just walk our
Hilgendorfs out the back gate

569
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:35,223
and in through their front door,
all right ?

570
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:38,959
Open it !

571
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,728
Over the fence.

572
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:45,487
Who's going over the fence ?

573
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,984
One, two, three.

574
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:52,313
- Up, up !
- This was a bad idea !

575
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,732
A lot of broken glass there.

576
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,902
- It seems quiet to me.
- That's because you're a civilian.

577
00:28:58,296 --> 00:29:00,346
Every night, I train my ears...

578
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,405
to detect a pin drop.

579
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,009
By dropping pins.

580
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,937
And that was not a pin.

581
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:17,017
What are they doing ?

582
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,744
Tai chi.

583
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:30,114
And exhale.

584
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:31,519
Namaste.

585
00:29:31,965 --> 00:29:33,015
Breathe in.

586
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:36,482
What ?
I took a Learning Annex class.

587
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:44,406
Hey, guys !
You forgot to unhook the latch.

588
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,736
I just landed in the garden.
Our tomatoes are doing great.

589
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:52,873
Mom's home !

590
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,492
Maybe she won't be
that angry with T-Bag...

591
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,296
T-Dad... your dad.

592
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:00,897
Are you kidding ?

593
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:03,797
If she finds out, she'll divorce Dad,
send me off to boarding school

594
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:05,886
- and shut your house down.
- Okay, plan B.

595
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,454
Rebecca, you and Beav stall Mom.
We'll get them upstairs.

596
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:12,079
I'll open a window.

597
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,383
This is not a part of Plan B.

598
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:17,558
I didn't hear anything about...

599
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:20,901
What's up ?

600
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,433
We are giving whoever did this
a chance to return the money

601
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,971
- without all the finger-pointing.
- Everyone gets an envelope,

602
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:28,993
which we all have to place
in a sealed box in the Chapter Room.

603
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:31,495
Whoever stole the money can return it
without anyone knowing.

604
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,530
And as long as it's returned,
there's no need to punish anyone.

605
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,055
Makes sense to me.

606
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,262
Mrs. Hilgendorf, hi !

607
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,670
I'm Rebecca Logan,
ZBZ's Welcome Wagon.

608
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:53,845
- I'm Beaver, and I'm with her.
- Trying too hard.

609
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,793
Watch your head.

610
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:59,190
So, what were Rebecca and
Beaver doing upstairs ?

611
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,400
Taking cultures for her bio class.

612
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,951
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think they slept together.

613
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:07,323
- They did ?
- Leave it alone, Spitter.

614
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,659
- This looks like my house !
- That's because it is.

615
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,869
That's my bed.

616
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:16,147
- We're gonna put you in bed.
- Good idea. I'm tired.

617
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:19,293
- Let's get you in there.
- Guys, I'm really tired.

618
00:31:23,112 --> 00:31:24,882
We should, like, grab a movie.

619
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:27,468
- Stay away from my daughter !
- Dad !

620
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:34,642
- He's all tucked in.
- Spray him and get out of here.

621
00:31:39,073 --> 00:31:41,789
We could use Rebecca and Beaver
to get back at Evan

622
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:44,118
- for getting the guys expelled.
- We're gonna get back

623
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:46,105
at all the Omega Chis for that
and when we do,

624
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,531
we won't need to drag
anybody else into it.

625
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:51,528
We gotta lose the costume, guys.

626
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:53,711
Get his hat !

627
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,915
Sorry, did you say
your name was Beaver ?

628
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:00,251
It's short for "The Beaver."

629
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:02,795
If you'll excuse me...

630
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,340
Look up here !
Look up here !

631
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,184
That was the signal.
We gotta hurry up.

632
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:10,881
Just a call...

633
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,253
It's a... welcome.

634
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:15,596
Good night.

635
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,128
That's Rebecca's necklace.

636
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,807
- Are you OK ?
- No !

637
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:35,138
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

638
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:42,543
Time to go to bed.


639
00:32:44,978 --> 00:32:47,722
Hi, Mom.
Dad came down with the flu.

640
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,561
And there are two of
us in this friendship.

641
00:32:50,686 --> 00:32:52,816
So it can't be all my fault, right ?

642
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:56,010
- It's possible, but not very probable.
- I know !

643
00:32:56,962 --> 00:32:58,475
I mean, yes, I have

644
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,122
been a little focused on law school,

645
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,400
but she's been dealing
with other stuff, too.

646
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:06,525
Who's to say which one of us turned
the page when the other wasn't looking ?

647
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,703
I've never been on
the same page with anyone.

648
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:12,082
I joined GP only for the networking
connections after college. But Casey,

649
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:15,159
- I do consider you to be...
- On the same page ?

650
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,161
I was gonna say a friend.

651
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,442
So we're friends ?

652
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:25,461
Yes and I was thinking that maybe one
day we could be the kind of friends

653
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,546
- could read each other's...
- Minds ?

654
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,214
I was gonna say books.

655
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:30,617
Right.

656
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,552
But I think it takes a little
bit to get on the same page.

657
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,888
Have you read the recent
works of Alice Munro ?

658
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,978
- The recent works ?
- No.

659
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,440
This is a first edition.

660
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:48,150
I just wrote my name on the inside
cover so you know who to return it to.

661
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:51,111
Thanks.

662
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:57,227
And I'm sorry that you
and Ashleigh have grown apart.

663
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:59,702
But it happens to a lot of people
at the end of college.

664
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:03,468
Maybe some people should
be around your entire life,

665
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:06,001
and others should just
make an appearance.

666
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,866


667
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:25,050
I forgot the smell.

668
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,511
Dryer sheets and...

669
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:29,126
and...

670
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:30,776
Mold.

671
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:33,638
Yeah.

672
00:34:35,905 --> 00:34:37,783
Well, Sunny seemed sunny.

673
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,625
No one should smile that much.

674
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,329
She's gonna need Botox
by the time she's 25.

675
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,789
Or a lobotomy.

676
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,294
I can't believe this
is where we met.

677
00:34:49,664 --> 00:34:52,975
- And where we met Frannie.
- You had to say the "F" word.

678
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:58,204
How different would college
have been without this ten-foot,

679
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,338
poorly-ventilated and moldy room ?

680
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,057
Things were a lot easier back then.

681
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,935
For us.

682
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,625
Yeah, we were freshmen.

683
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,679
Our biggest concern was whether
or not the dryer was eating our socks.

684
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:13,449
And now ?

685
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:14,945
Now...

686
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:17,920
we both have a lot more going on.

687
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,181
Boyfriends in different houses,

688
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:22,185
schedules that demand our attention,

689
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,955
plans after graduation
that are changing our priorities.

690
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:28,228
We'll have to work harder to...

691
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:29,918
stay on the same page.

692
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:32,794
We never had to work at it before.

693
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:35,118
I know.

694
00:35:36,098 --> 00:35:37,098
I know.

695
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,432
Do you think that Sunny was right ?

696
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,157
We're only friends
because of geography ?

697
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:49,289
Maybe that's why we became friends,

698
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,482
but I don't think it's
why we stayed friends.

699
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:55,068
You don't think
that we're growing apart ?

700
00:35:57,527 --> 00:35:58,947
I think we're growing up.

701
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,941
Ash, I don't want to live in the past.
Not with you.

702
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,398
- Because if we did, we'd still be...
- In this laundry room ?

703
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:14,296
Well, I can still read your mind.

704
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:19,234
So who...

705
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:21,720
is Alice Munro ?

706
00:36:22,453 --> 00:36:23,484
You know...

707
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:25,224
no clue.

708
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:34,918
But we got away with it,
that's something.

709
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:37,528
Not really.

710
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:40,155
Guys, I'm a 40-year-old man

711
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,741
and I just had to rely on
a bunch of guys in their twenties

712
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,910
to rescue me
and my 16-year-old daughter.

713
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,078
I'm 19.

714
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:48,405
Way to rub it in.

715
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:50,791
- Sorry about hazing you.
- No.

716
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:53,338
No reason to be.
You guys are great.

717
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,471
I just don't think
I'm supposed to be here.

718
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:57,548
- But you're T-Bag.
- No.

719
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,584
I'm just Dad,

720
00:36:59,947 --> 00:37:01,857
and sometimes Professor Hilgendorf.

721
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:04,776
No offense, but that's depressing.

722
00:37:05,198 --> 00:37:07,933
Yeah, to you, it is.
But I like my life, really.

723
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,023
And while it was fun to play around,

724
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:12,312
I belong on the other
side of the fence.

725
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:17,233
- What about the rules ?
- Forget about that.

726
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:19,319
College is not supposed
to be about rules.

727
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,637
You guys have your fun.
As a matter of fact,

728
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:24,658
have a lot of fun and I will live
vicariously through you.

729
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,124
Well, Tom, the table's always open
if you want to get Monkey-Humped.

730
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:31,069
No, I think I'm gonna
retire undefeated.

731
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:33,000
Too bad you won't.

732
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,733
Come on, tell me the truth.

733
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,498
You're gonna miss all this,
aren't you ?

734
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,854
Yeah, I'll miss it.

735
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,180
But it's never
the same after you leave.

736
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:49,766
The truth is you can't go back.

737
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:52,045
So enjoy it while you can.

738
00:37:57,144 --> 00:38:00,152
Sorry Tom didn't turn out
to be much of an adviser.

739
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,155
You know, Spitter,

740
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:06,325
he actually made a lot of sense.

741
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,861
And our books are balanced.

742
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:26,683
Great.

743
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,765
OK. Well,

744
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:30,886
that ends that.

745
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:33,242
No...

746
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:34,770
not quite.

747
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,814
You see, Grant didn't trust you,
but I did.

748
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,410
I told him he was wrong to
think you stole that money.

749
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:42,319
I told Trip that, too.

750
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:44,696
What you getting at ?

751
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:47,054
I trusted you.

752
00:38:50,273 --> 00:38:51,745
I marked the envelope to prove

753
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,622
that you didn't steal the money.

754
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,617
I need to buy Rebecca present.

755
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:03,966
- I was gonna pay the house back.
- Forget it.

756
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,438
I don't even care.

757
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:10,430
This isn't an excuse,

758
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:15,435
but I've been surrounded by money
my entire life, including here.

759
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,030
I guess I'm still
getting used to it.

760
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:22,713
It's like you said,

761
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:25,112
living in the straight world.

762
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,209
Please tell me you
didn't just compare me

763
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:31,159
listening to Lady Gaga to you
being a thief and a liar.

764
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,954
No, that...
That's not what I meant.

765
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:37,807
Cal, I'm sorry.

766
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:41,294
I just hoped you could understand.

767
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,491
I just don't think you understand.

768
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:46,216
You gave up that trust fund up

769
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,130
because you didn't like what
that money was turning you into.

770
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,646
I'm just starting to think
the money wasn't the problem.

771
00:39:55,954 --> 00:39:57,524
Well, you're not expelled.

772
00:39:57,758 --> 00:39:59,891
We live to party another day.

773
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,446
Thank you, by the way.

774
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:03,821
And...

775
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:08,148
you're welcome.

776
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:12,191
Why is there hair in it ?

777
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:15,168
That's the hair of
a champion Monkey-Humper.

778
00:40:18,562 --> 00:40:20,571
Don't you think you're giving Evan
the wrong idea

779
00:40:20,696 --> 00:40:23,295
by keeping that when you
don't feel the same way he does ?

780
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,004
Evan knew how I felt about
that stuff from the start.

781
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:30,750
And I don't want to get
so serious with him.

782
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:33,805
Or with anyone, for that matter.

783
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:37,875
It's easier and I'm just
not that kind of person.

784
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:41,519
Why is it so hard to just keep
everything casual and fun ?

785
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:45,400
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.

786
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,973
I'm the one angsting here.

787
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:49,361
I'm just not sure I'm ready
to graduate and leave here

788
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:51,578
and become the Hilgendorfs.

789
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:54,144
The whole idea is...

790
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:57,321
soul-sucking and kind of scary.

791
00:40:58,728 --> 00:40:59,706
I hear ya.

792
00:41:00,368 --> 00:41:02,079
So, what about you and Casey ?

793
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:05,293
I thought you didn't want
to be anywhere she isn't.

794
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,973
Well, if she gets into CRU law,
then it won't be an issue

795
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,415
for a while.

796
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:11,970
And if she doesn't ?

797
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:15,029
I don't really know.

798
00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:17,099
But I can't figure it
all out today, Becks.

799
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:20,056
So I'm just gonna hang here
and enjoy the sunshine.

800
00:41:21,322 --> 00:41:22,979
Sounds like a plan to me.

801
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,147
Oh, yeah.

802
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:27,908
Sounds like quite a laundry room.

803
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,364
The Backstreet Boys
were already taken.

804
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:35,068
And you never found the sock ?

805
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:39,954
No, but I realized that legal precedent
isn't all that different from nostalgia.

806
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,165
The law builds on the past

807
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,515
and I wouldn't be who I am,

808
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,320
if it weren't for that laundry room.

809
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:49,191
And if I had dated
a girl who preferred

810
00:41:49,316 --> 00:41:52,730
U2 to the Backstreet Boys,
I might not be divorced.

811
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:54,446
It's an interesting theory.

812
00:41:54,571 --> 00:41:56,801
Interesting,
as in "this girl belongs in law school"

813
00:41:56,926 --> 00:41:58,765
or "this girl belongs
in a Laundromat" ?

814
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,268
I think you know the answer to that.

815
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:04,104
Thank you.

816
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:10,438
Thanks.
