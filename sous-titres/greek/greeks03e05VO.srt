1
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:03,246
I'm just so bored with the pledges.

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:05,754
I'm a senior.
I should be doing something more.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,382
{\pos(192,230)}You turned down an opportunity
to work with Dr. Larsen.

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:11,533
I'm intrigued but it could
just mean you're stupid.

5
00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:13,649
I'd rather take a chance
working on my own project.

6
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:16,143
- I'll sponsor you.
- Does this mean we're a team?

7
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,795
- How's your bank account zero?
- You remember my parent problems?

8
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,458
I gave up my trust fund.

9
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,482
I didn't kiss Evan at the party.
I kissed Fisher.

10
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:27,231
- What?
- You really screwed up.

11
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:30,020
- I'm not used to giving second chances.
- And you won't regret it.

12
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:31,145
I hope not.

13
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,624
Hey, Treena!
Watch it!

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,696
And are you sure about that top?

15
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:44,918
Looking fierce, Ash.

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,171
Sexy fierce or scary fierce?

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,533
- Kind of both.
- Great!

18
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:54,152
I'm meeting fisher for our first
official it's-only-coffee date

19
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,979
since'the incident,'and I want
to look hot, but also threatening.

20
00:00:57,104 --> 00:00:59,349
Like, cheat on me again
and I will cut you.

21
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:02,454
So, what are you doing tonight?

22
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,647
Do you have a date? With who?
The cute guy from yoga?

23
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:08,490
Relax.
Panhellenic booked a career advisor

24
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:10,991
to speak to us about
our plans after graduation.

25
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:12,535
Sounds fun.

26
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:15,331
Fall's almost over.
Finally.

27
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:18,576
We have one more semester
until graduation. The clock's ticking.

28
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:22,122
And cute yoga boy's cuteness is
cancelled out by how much he sweats.

29
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,630
- Excuse me!
- What the...?

30
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:26,280
Is the entire house in here?

31
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:31,866
Hey Betsy, wasn't there a pledge
mixer with pi sigma tonight?

32
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,347
It got cancelled.
Their pledges have poison ivy.

33
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:36,848
Again? Isn't that why
they cancelled last time?

34
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:39,125
No, the last time
they had poison oak.

35
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:42,293
Wait a minute...

36
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:45,732
- What is that?
- I think it's the...

37
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:47,439
We're all gonna die!

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,536
- You ready?
- Ready.

39
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,808
Hastings and I made
this in the lab today.

40
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:13,618
It's a new bio-based polymer made
from renewable sources,

41
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:15,397
- which means...
- Yay, Earth!

42
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,485
Maybe you'll save
the world tomorrow.

43
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,193
It must be nice to know what
you want to be when you grow up.

44
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,019
What did you want to be
when you were little?

45
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:45,628
A princess,

46
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:47,662
then a Ballerina,

47
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,706
and then John Elway.

48
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:52,545
He's a football player.

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,838
I knew that.

50
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,831
What about now?

51
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,781
I don't really know.

52
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:03,942
So far the gotcha game has been the most
exciting thing I've done school-wise.

53
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,951
I wish I had something, though.
I don't know.

54
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:10,263
Something long-term to look forward to.

55
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:14,115
It might make school feel
a little bit more worthwhile.

56
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:18,976
Yeah. But we're good, right?

57
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,518
What? Of course!

58
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:23,615
We're beyond good. We're like...
Really good.

59
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:39,924
Looks like a false alarm.

60
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,324
Sprinkler malfunction.

61
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:44,013
It's a pretty old setup.
Think about getting a new one.

62
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,917
Thanks.

63
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,025
Sorry.

64
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,170
Hot fireman is right.
We should do that.

65
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:57,330
Yeah, I did look into getting a new one.
But I figured it

66
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,655
could wait until next year.
Hey, I'm working with a budget here.

67
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:03,741
It was between a new sprinkler system,
or the new flat-screen Tv.

68
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:05,680
And you chose the Tv?

69
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:09,573
I didn't know it was between our safety
or dancing with the stars in high-def.

70
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,430
Someone should really
get the pledges inside.

71
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,958
Fine, you're still mad at me.
The pledges are making a scene,

72
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,537
and not in a good way
like Betsy naked in the bushes.

73
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:22,103
I'm fine!
I'm just a little chilly!

74
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,266
See? They were blown off for another
mixer, so they stayed in for mud masks

75
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,861
and a Tv series about old
people having old people sex.

76
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,984
- Watchingprivate practice?
- With amazing clarity!

77
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:48,289
Maybe I should get them inside
and have a chat with them.

78
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,234
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

79
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:53,541
Maybe you should do that.
They're almost as embarrassing

80
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,230
- as that girl in curlers.
- OK, fine. Keep ignoring me.

81
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,664
But you can't ignore the fact
that our pledges suck.

82
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:04,159
I am on it.

83
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:10,264
-= 305 =-
"Down On Your Luck"

85
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,526
I'm really excited about this project.

86
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:21,038
I'd work on it 24/7 if I could,

87
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,574
but that might upset Jordan.

88
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,999
- She's my girlfriend.
- Hand me sample four-a.

89
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,501
And I don't know what's going on lately,

90
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:38,711
but Jordan,

91
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,027
my girlfriend,

92
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:41,842
seems a little down.

93
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,342
I don't think she's
very excited about school.

94
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,303
You know what she said last night?

95
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,182
Please god, kill me now.

96
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,393
She asked if we're good.

97
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,576
Of course, we're good!

98
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,438
We're great!
She knows that.

99
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,023
But I guess I should show her.

100
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:00,906
Pin her!

101
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,563
- Sir?
- Pin her, or flag her, or whatever

102
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:07,649
the hell it is you frat guys do,
and shut the hell up!

103
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,790
Technically that would be
a lavaliere,

104
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,666
but that's actually
a really good idea.

105
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,796
Stop

106
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:23,048
talking!

107
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:36,894
{\pos(192,220)}Hey Chambers,
looking for a cheap massage?

108
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,323
{\pos(192,230)}I know a great place right off campus,
you'll be very happy with the ending.

109
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,265
{\pos(192,230)}Unfortunately,
I'm looking for a new job.

110
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,531
{\pos(192,230)}I could put a word in at the massage
parlor. You have strong hands

111
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,090
{\pos(192,230)}with the softness of someone who
hasn't labored a day in his life.

112
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:50,735
Funny.
But you know what's not?

113
00:06:51,438 --> 00:06:54,603
I may not be able to pay house dues,
let alone my tuition next master.

114
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,291
{\pos(192,230)}I can't get a job around campus because
word would get around that I'm broke.

115
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,573
{\pos(192,230)}- You still have that car, right?
- Yeah, I know.

116
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,437
{\pos(192,230)}You're gonna tell me to get rid of
the car if I'm so strapped for cash...

117
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:06,658
{\pos(192,230)}Not a chance! That car is
your only remaining redeeming value.

118
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,136
{\pos(192,230)}Here's one.
Sperm donor.

119
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:13,746
{\pos(192,230)}Someone of your pedigree could earn
three times as much as I have...

120
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:15,585
{\pos(192,230)}...would.
As much as I would.

121
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,434
{\pos(192,230)}Know what they say, find a job you love,
it's hardly work at all.

122
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,724
{\pos(192,230)}- If you're gonna be an ass about it...
- I'm sorry, i'll be serious.

123
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,455
- Thank you.
- Here's another one...

124
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,150
"part-time cater-waiters.

125
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,911
{\pos(192,230)}Work when you want.
Perfect for students. Paid in cash."

126
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,035
{\pos(192,230)}A waiter? I don't know.

127
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,923
{\pos(192,200)}I hated that last job.

128
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,675
{\pos(192,200)}You're not gonna get hired for
much else with a resume consisting

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,626
{\pos(192,210)}of your last name
and having soft man-hands.

130
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,441
What about the massage parlor?

131
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,708
{\pos(192,220)}Nice. Ask for diamond,
tell her Cappie sent you.

132
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,660
No, I meant cause you...

133
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:52,668
{\pos(192,230)}- Yeah, you wanna give me that?
- Yeah...

134
00:07:56,732 --> 00:07:57,972
We never spoke.

135
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,974
{\pos(192,220)}You guys are great.
The best.

136
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:06,244
{\pos(192,220)}But it might help to put
forth a little more effort.

137
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,175
{\pos(192,220)}You know, getting out,
being a little more social.

138
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:13,403
{\pos(192,220)}Instead of staying in for mud
masks andprivate practice.

139
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:15,785
Yes, Abby?

140
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:18,329
We were supposed to
have a mixer with Pi Sigma.

141
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,858
We can't dwell on the past

142
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,043
when we have so much to look forward to.

143
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,837
Like the lambda sig pledge calendar.

144
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,185
Each year they organize a photo
shoot for all the pledge classes

145
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:32,005
of all the sororities, assigning
each one a different month and theme,

146
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,220
with the best picture
going on the cover...

147
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:37,807
Abby? Do you have
a question about the calendar?

148
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,192
No, but I would like to know
what happened with

149
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:43,364
the Pi Sigma mixer we were supposed
to have last night.

150
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:47,444
I'm not sure. I'm sure we can
get it back on the books soon.

151
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,444
So the calendar,

152
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:53,840
We always get July, the best month
of the year, for the best house.

153
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,492
You'll all be wearing bathing suits,

154
00:08:56,617 --> 00:09:00,522
so, Linda, you might want
to do a little extra, waxing.

155
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,100
Then, after the photo...

156
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,348
Yes, Abby?

157
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:08,709
Is there going to be a party?
I'm just curious

158
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,509
because we haven't been to one in weeks,

159
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,771
and that's the reason most
of us joined a sority.

160
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,344
Of course there's
going to be a party.

161
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,578
I was just getting to that.
However,

162
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:21,572
that's actually not what
being in a sorority is all about...

163
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:23,394
- But it's a part of it.
- Yes, but...

164
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,022
A part we haven't been seeing.
For the record.

165
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,359
We could always throw
another party with the KTS?

166
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,027
And that's another thing.

167
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:34,405
Shouldn't we socialize with somebody
else other than the KTS for a change?

168
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,427
- They're kind of losers.
- Hey, my boyfriend's a KT

169
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:40,735
No, actually, Abby has a point.

170
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,580
Not about Rusty.
Not entirely.

171
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:45,082
But you should be mixing
with other fraternities,

172
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:48,949
and this calendar is a great way
to get to know the lambda sigs.

173
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,047
So they won't cancel mixers
with you in the future.

174
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,945
OK, meeting adjourned.

175
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:09,106
What is it?

176
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:12,777
It kind of freaks me out when you
walk in here and stare at us with

177
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:17,032
- that serial killer smirk.
- I want to lavaliere jordan.

178
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,716
What? I thought you guys
would be happy for me.

179
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:24,247
I knew this day would come.
Just not so soon.

180
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:26,259
Beaver, get the book.

181
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:35,478
The dictionary?

182
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,302
I don't know what lavaliere means.

183
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:40,681
Ever notice that kts
don't do much lavaliering?

184
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,283
Yeah, because I thought you guys
are a bunch of commitment-phobes.

185
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:48,326
True. But it's also because of...

186
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:50,438
Dramatic pause...

187
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,317
... the curse.

188
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:54,244
What curse?

189
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,911
It started with the first
recorded kt lavaliering

190
00:10:57,036 --> 00:11:00,920
on october 7th, 1871 at the
university of chicago...

191
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:04,662
The day before the
great chicago fire.

192
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:07,832
What? Come on.

193
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:10,848
In 1912, a kt brother
lavaliered his girlfriend,

194
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:13,484
then took her on a
celebratory cruise...

195
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:15,529
... aboard the titanic.

196
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:18,759
Which left from england,
so that makes sense.

197
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,646
The last known kt to
lavaliere was in 1986.

198
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,060
The brother was so excited that
he went home to tell his entire family

199
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,101
... in chernobyl.

200
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:30,903
Chernobyl? Seriously?
You really expect me to buy all this?

201
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:33,543
I don't really buy it, either.

202
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:36,971
Careful, beaver!
We must not speak ill of the curse,

203
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,575
or it will wreak its
vengeance upon us all.

204
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,326
See for yourself.

205
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,183
Chapter three is about lavaliering,

206
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:46,626
with notes in the margins
from kts who have tried And failed.

207
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:49,958
Along with a recipe
for a vegetarian lasagna.

208
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:52,223
We need to try that when he's done.

209
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,608
We need to talk about the pledges.

210
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,354
I already talked to the pledges.
Why are you so worried?

211
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,241
The guy from lambda sig is here...

212
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:07,983
Good. I was wondering when
they'd come over to talk about july.

213
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:10,501
Hi there, I wanted to ask you,

214
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,980
is the fourth of july
a little overdone?

215
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,649
Should we do a more generic
beach theme this year?

216
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:18,228
Like surfing? Or mermaids?

217
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:20,315
We didn't get july.

218
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:24,080
- Wait?
- You're november.

219
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,822
Be sure to be at this location

220
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:28,046
for your photo session
tomorrow morning.

221
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,714
We'll see you then.

222
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,632
Wait! There
must be some mistake. Zbz is july.

223
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:35,475
We're always july.

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,430
Sexy bathing suits,
flags, sexy bathing suits.

225
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:41,079
Flags.

226
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:43,507
Yeah, november is just turkeys.

227
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,554
And sweet potatoes,
and green bean casserole.

228
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,225
How do you dress up
as sexy green bean casserole?

229
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,474
Relax, it's not a big deal.

230
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,384
{\pos(192,230)}The pledges got november,

231
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:01,907
{\pos(192,230)}and your pledge educator seems
to think it's not a big deal.

232
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,169
{\pos(192,240)}Which I also find to
be a very big deal.

233
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:08,815
{\pos(192,240)}What's up?

234
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,311
{\pos(192,240)}You didn't hear all that?
About the pledges getting november?

235
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,415
{\pos(192,240)}November?
How'd that happen?

236
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,106
{\pos(192,240)}Fine. Keep ignoring me.

237
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,455
But we shouldn't just
roll over and accept this.

238
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,338
I'm doing the best
I can with the pledges,

239
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:22,672
we have to be honest. We didn't
get the pick of the litter

240
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:24,927
during rush because of
frannie and the ickies.

241
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:26,480
You have to try harder.

242
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,837
Or get someone who has the
stomach to kick a little ass.

243
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:31,189
That's a great plan, frannie.

244
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,252
Can you please explain
to ashleigh that I believe

245
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:36,163
I can do better if
she lets me show her.

246
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:38,956
You've been trying to prove
yourself since'the incident'

247
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,986
and you can just stop.

248
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,782
I don't understand how you can let

249
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,030
like the state of the
pledges go so quickly,

250
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:50,443
yet hold a grudge
against me for so long.

251
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:54,227
You don't understand
how I could hold a grudge?

252
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:56,183
When your spring break
video came out,

253
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:58,253
When you almost kicked out
by the house who stood by you?

254
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,027
And what did you
do for me in return?

255
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:01,916
You kinda stabbed me in the back.

256
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,134
I'm sorry if I'm
more upset about that

257
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:06,904
than some stupid calendar.

258
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:11,183
We got november.
So what? Life goes on.

259
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,701
I knew you could hear me.

260
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,359
You can't hate her forever.

261
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,407
I can until I graduate.

262
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:26,801
Then, I never have to see her
or pretend I can't hear her again.

263
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:32,412
So what about the pledges
and the calendar?

264
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:35,072
I'll kick their asses.

265
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,249
Gently.

266
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:44,167
The part where it says name
is where you fill in your name.

267
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,466
Yeah, I think I got it.

268
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:48,803
Sorry, I assumed you'd never filled out
a job application before.

269
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,499
OK. Just so we're clear...

270
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:58,325
Dibs.

271
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,723
I'm lana.

272
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:02,428
Ron said you have a check for me?

273
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:08,431
Picking up your check?

274
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:13,161
And then my kids.

275
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,661
From school.

276
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,374
I have three of them, total brats.

277
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,500
Are you just saying
that so I'll leave?

278
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,194
If I said no, would you leave?

279
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:24,067
No. I love kids.
I practically still am one.

280
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,243
- Hi, I'm cappie.
- Here's your check.

281
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:28,472
Thanks.

282
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,021
Sa ya.

283
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:34,222
Say hi to the kids for me, lana.

284
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:41,809
What are the odds you're looking
to hire two cater-waiters?

285
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:48,882
Teddies!

286
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,907
Can we get a couple?

287
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:52,632
Please, can we?

288
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:55,254
You know those say
omega chi on them, right?

289
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,414
Target practice with
heath's crossbow.

290
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:03,220
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a lavaliere

291
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:06,411
- with the letters kappa tau gamma.
- Kappa tau gamma?

292
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,175
We haven't sold a
kt lavaliere in years.

293
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,111
I don't even think we have any here.

294
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,034
Could you check in the back please?

295
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:33,931
It's the only one we have
so I hope you like it.

296
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,454
It's good.

297
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,499
Curse shmurse.

298
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,793
It's perfect, I'll take it.

299
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,248
And the teddies.

300
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,114
And the shirt.

301
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:56,287
We need to get to work on our costumes
for the lambda sig calendar.

302
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:59,413
But first, there's been
a slight change of plans.

303
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,545
We got november instead of july.

304
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,981
It's no big deal!
And not a reflection of your worth.

305
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,634
Not entirely. Yes, abby?

306
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,460
I thought you said
we always get july?

307
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:11,112
In the past, yes.

308
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,379
You can just speak, abby.

309
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:15,832
I'm confused. You said
july was the best month,

310
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:17,984
which went to the best house.
So does that mean.

311
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,802
You guys, it's just a calendar.

312
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:21,814
But the calendar is
a representation of us.

313
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,699
If we want to be the best, we have to
show everyone what we're made of.

314
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,536
And that's exactly what we'll do.

315
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:32,633
It's not so much the month,
but what you do with that month.

316
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:36,169
Zbz made july the best,
so we'll just do that with november.

317
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:39,264
Are those our costumes?

318
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:41,851
From asister act
rush skit a few years ago.

319
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,396
We're dressing up as
nuns for the calendar photo?

320
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,729
That's what the'best
house on campus' does?

321
00:17:46,854 --> 00:17:49,220
Shouldn't we just skip it
rather than embarrass ourselves?

322
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:52,719
No. And it's not nuns.
Black and white robes?

323
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:54,310
Thanksgiving?

324
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:56,508
Anyone thinking what I'm thinking?

325
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,600
Sexy pilgrims!

326
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,702
Can I ask you a question?

327
00:18:05,827 --> 00:18:08,487
And this is purely hypothetical,

328
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:12,541
but what would happen if
a pledge who was unhappy

329
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,162
with things, outside of zbz,

330
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,079
were to take a
semester off pledging?

331
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:20,097
Would she be able to come back?

332
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:22,960
- Which girl? Abby?
- I can't really say.

333
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,759
It would be terrible
to lose any of the pledges.

334
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:29,899
Maybe not abby.
But the answer is yes.

335
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,599
A pledge has to
fulfill two semesters

336
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:34,462
but they don't have
to be consecutive.

337
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:36,172
OK, thanks.

338
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:44,289
41 to 57,

339
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:46,693
42 to 58!

340
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:49,281
- 59!
- What are you doing?

341
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:51,751
Wing street wing-off.
Beaver's crushing it.

342
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,916
Check the bones!
I see meat!

343
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,338
And... Time!

344
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:59,351
Beaver defends his title
as chicken wing champ!

345
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,200
Congrats, beav.

346
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,392
So, this book is really outdated,

347
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,889
but it says I need to serenade her.

348
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,980
Then, there's this whole
tied to a tree thing...

349
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,982
What? Tied to a tree?

350
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,133
Can you guys help me figure out

351
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,256
- how to do this lavaliering ceremony?
- I don't know, man.

352
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:21,093
- The curse kind of freaks me out.
- There's no curse.

353
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,078
Would you be my lavaliere-bearer?

354
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:26,537
- What's a lavaliere bear do?
- Bear-er.

355
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:29,500
You hold the lavaliere until
i'm ready to give it to her.

356
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,378
- In a bear costume?
- No.

357
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,256
Just hold on to this
until I ask for it.

358
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:40,096
We should burn that book.
It's nothing but trouble.

359
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,210
What? No way, man.
This is kt history right here.

360
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,398
Come on, your getting
wing sauce all over it.

361
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:48,278
Tasty wing sauce.

362
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,811
Give me the book, heath!

363
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,279
Where's the lavaliere?

364
00:19:58,643 --> 00:20:00,364
I think it's in beaver.

365
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:05,430
No! That's the only one!
Stick a finger down your throat!

366
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:08,072
Dude, gross. We'll just
wait for beaver to pass it.

367
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,666
Pass it where?

368
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,834
Don't you see?

369
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,277
It's the curse!

370
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,304
Beaver's being punished for helping!

371
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,292
I'm outta here, man.

372
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,651
Funny, I pulled that same split
in my pledge calendar picture.

373
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,399
- You guys totally ripped us off.
- Gosh no.

374
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:45,075
We meant it as an homage.

375
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,811
Homage my ass, that's just stealing.

376
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,513
No, really, we were
so honored to be july

377
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,655
after zbz had it year, after year...

378
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,434
We know how long we've had it.

379
00:20:57,695 --> 00:20:59,588
Sorry about november.

380
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:02,719
- Not exactly a cover month.
- Not until we do it.

381
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:05,863
You're right. I'm sure
you'll be great. Good luck!

382
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,855
Where's your costume?
And where are the others?

383
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,274
They're not coming.

384
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,837
Sorry, katherine.

385
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,536
I thought I was going to
be late for panhellenic.

386
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,145
{\pos(192,230)}You are late, actually.

387
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,883
{\pos(192,230)}My appointment feeding the homeless
ran a few minutes over.

388
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,489
{\pos(192,240)}Moving on...

389
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,384
{\pos(192,240)}I was just dealing with
some unruly pledges.

390
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:40,044
{\pos(192,240)}Because of november?

391
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:43,154
{\pos(192,240)}- You know about that?
- I am the president of panhellenic.

392
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,632
{\pos(192,240)}You should probably explain
to them why it happened.

393
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:48,217
{\pos(192,240)}I think brutal honesty is
always the best policy.

394
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:50,016
Maybe you should explain it to me?

395
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,052
Do I really need to recount
to you zbz's last few years?

396
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:55,775
There was the incident with
that undercover reporter girl,

397
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,857
frannie being ousted
because she lied,

398
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:59,958
you, losing half your
house to the I-kaps,

399
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,707
which led to, as you pointed
out, an unruly pledge class.

400
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:05,637
Zbz is constantly embroiled
in some kind of turmoil.

401
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:07,636
And no one likes a
dysfunctional drama case.

402
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,742
Zbz is slipping.

403
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:12,632
Zbz is not slipping.
We just won the gotcha game.

404
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:14,800
Which gave you five more
blue ribbon points,

405
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:17,470
which still places your total
well-behind my house, gamma psi,

406
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:20,682
and just below the tri-pis.
Your gpa is down half a point,

407
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,085
not much philanthropy,
you were not invited to the

408
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,786
omega chis six pack party.

409
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,898
If I had to guess, I would
say zbz is ranked... Fourth?

410
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,389
Fourth?

411
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:31,797
- ... ish.
- Ish?

412
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:34,466
It's not entirely unexpected.
It's impossible to stay on top.

413
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:37,480
Gamma psi was fourth once, now
we're the top house on campus.

414
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,431
It's just all part of the cycle.

415
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,068
What cycle?

416
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:46,948
After the meeting, go back to your
house and look at the composites.

417
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,753
Has beav birthed the lavaliere yet?

418
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,423
Not yet.

419
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,585
He's been eating
a lot of fiber though.

420
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,264
This is my tenth bowl.

421
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,686
Pledges!

422
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,772
I doubt we'll want
to hear this. Come on.

423
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,931
Maybe there is a curse.

424
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:35,367
Maybe I should just get
jordan some flowers.

425
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,721
Or a card with a nice poem on it.

426
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,130
Poem cards suck.

427
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,461
And the point of a lavaliere
is to show you care.

428
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,920
You should go ahead and do
it if you really want to.

429
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,133
I can't now, anyway.

430
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,930
The lavaliere, which the doctor
says is making its way through

431
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:53,500
beaver's lower intestines,
was the last one in the store.

432
00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:01,063
Here.

433
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,858
You have one?

434
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,311
Why do you...

435
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,535
No, cap... I can't.

436
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:17,147
Sure you can.

437
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,951
It wasn't meant for me,

438
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:22,543
but maybe it was meant for you.

439
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:26,236
I'll talk to the guys, tell them
to lay off the whole curse stuff.

440
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:28,924
If there even is one?

441
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:31,356
I became a little suspicious myself

442
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,970
when I noticed the kt aboard the
titanic was brother dicaprio.

443
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,851
What's with the pink bow-tie?

444
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:41,793
Just feeling fancy today.

445
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:43,517
Why? Look OK?

446
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:52,030
What type of fish is that?

447
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,160
That is sea bass?
Would you like to try some?

448
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,469
What kind of sea bass?
Chilean sea bass?

449
00:24:58,594 --> 00:25:01,499
Japanese sea bass?
European sea bass?

450
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:04,050
I don't really know.

451
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:06,273
I didn't catch the accent.

452
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:11,376
Why don't you do your job
and find out for me, OK, chief?

453
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,481
How'd you get put behind the bar

454
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,907
while I'm stuck serving
steamed asparagus

455
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:24,449
and some kind of sea bass to moron
in polyester suits with half my iq?

456
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:26,872
I don't know, probably
because I said on my application

457
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:28,792
that I went to bartending school,

458
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,259
then spent two summers
in jamaica mixing drinks

459
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:33,405
at flanagan's cocktails and dreams.

460
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,714
I need two screwdrivers, a
sidecar and a sparkling water.

461
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,684
Sure thing, lana. Coming right up.

462
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,576
Sidecars.

463
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,688
Is there a problem?

464
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:09,275
Just trying to remember
which bottle has the sidecar in it.

465
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,944
Awesome. I'm surrounded by morons.

466
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:14,655
I was just saying the same thing.

467
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:16,407
Dude! Dibs!

468
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:19,994
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be on chilean sea bass?

469
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:21,609
Thank you.

470
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:25,670
- Sidecar.
- Move over.

471
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:32,034
Gonna start over.

472
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,589
Orange juice.

473
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,399
Are you watching?

474
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:43,034
What?

475
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:46,877
I'm just... happy to be here.

476
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,340
Fourth? Ish?

477
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:54,538
She's not even here anymore
and Frannie is still screwing us over.

478
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:57,615
Maybe it's because we blew off
the Omega Chis for pref?

479
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,560
Maybe boys do define us!

480
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:05,377
Have you ever noticed this before?
They jump from 1985 to 1990.

481
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:07,274
Where are the late '80s?

482
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:13,545
Here are the missing composites.

483
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:18,922
One of the gap years.

484
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:26,978
Maybe these girls were hot
back in the '80s?

485
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,447
No, that's ugly in any decade.

486
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,009
No wonder they're not on the walls.

487
00:27:32,388 --> 00:27:34,360
Had they invented acne cream yet?

488
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,965
Or nose jobs?

489
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,764
Are we on the brink of heading
into the gap years?

490
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:44,536
What are we supposed to do about it?
If it's a cycle, then it's too late!

491
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:46,022
It's like fate.

492
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,581
So we do nothing?

493
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:50,710
- Well, I mean, we are...
- Graduating.

494
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:58,008
If we want to be the best, we have
to show everyone what we're made of.

495
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:01,636
And we promised the pledges
that ZBZ would be awesome for them too.

496
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,962
We can't use up all the cool years
and leave them with the sucky ones.

497
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:07,059
You're right.

498
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,426
As seniors
we have to fight this cycle

499
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:11,480
for the future generations of ZBZ.

500
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:18,825
Hi, I'd like to make
a reservation, please.

501
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:21,517
19:30.

502
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:23,787
Cartwright.

503
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:27,597
It's a special occasion.

504
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:30,903
OK, thanks.

505
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:35,900
Just a minute. Be right there.

506
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:40,249
Hey, Jordan.

507
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,429
OK, I have some news.

508
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:46,438
I think it's good but

509
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:48,361
I wanted to tell you in person.

510
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:53,043
- I've been acting kinda weird lately.
- I hadn't noticed.

511
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,941
I've just been feeling
kinda unfulfilled?

512
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:58,986
Just seeing how excited you are
with school.

513
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:03,366
I don't have that.
But then it hit me.

514
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:04,735
Rome.

515
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:09,257
I was thinking of how much
I love the art and I love the history.

516
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:11,580
And it's like... Yeah.

517
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,667
That is where I need to go.

518
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,211
- To rome.
- Yes!

519
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,507
So I went
to the study abroad office,

520
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:20,615
and I begged
for a late application and...

521
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,829
They put me on the wait-list.
Isn't that awesome?

522
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:25,529
Wait. What?

523
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:27,473
Rome?

524
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,350
I thought you'd be excited for me.

525
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,019
- Excited for you to leave?
- It's just one semester.

526
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,979
And I haven't even gotten in, yet.

527
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,390
Yeah. Right.

528
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:39,110
Never mind. I'm happy for you.

529
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:52,426
Well, I hate working.

530
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:53,910
Well, duh.

531
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,518
That's why it's called "Work".
It sucks.

532
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:59,125
{\pos(192,200)}Unless you're
a race car driver or...

533
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,673
{\pos(192,200)}A pool hall hustler or...

534
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,945
{\pos(192,200)}A fighter pilot,

535
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,189
{\pos(192,200)}or...

536
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,370
Who am I kidding?
I'd still rather be playing video games.

537
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:11,007
I feel trapped.

538
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,259
Just like I did with my trust fund.

539
00:30:13,384 --> 00:30:14,421
Only now I'm...

540
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:15,905
... trapped and broke.

541
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:19,775
I don't know if I can do this, man.
I may not have the fight in me.

542
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,570
I almost punched a guy in there
because he asked for more gravy.

543
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:24,647
That sounds like
a worthy fight to me.

544
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:28,568
I'm just afraid

545
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:30,388
that I'm gonna end up

546
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:32,735
begging my parents
for my trust fund back and

547
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,498
I really don't want to be that guy.

548
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,262
You know, my father always says,

549
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,138
"Anything worth having
is worth fighting for".

550
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,071
My father's a pacifist
but that's not the point.

551
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:45,885
The point is, you need to figure out
what it is you want and fight for it.

552
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:47,207
Work for it.

553
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:49,386
Kind of like
how I'm working my ass off in there

554
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:51,809
to get Lana's phone number,
and she is not making it easy.

555
00:30:52,578 --> 00:30:54,667
- But I'm still fighting.
- Right.

556
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:02,026
- We should probably head back inside.
- Yeah.

557
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,174
How will anyone ever get
their steamed asparagus

558
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,929
if I'm not there to dish it out?

559
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:11,377
- Why does asparagus smell so bad?
- I don't think it smells that bad.

560
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,970
Well, not now but later
when you're done with it.

561
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,000
Thank you all for coming.
I'm sure you've heard by now that

562
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,044
the pledges missed the photo shoot.

563
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,463
Because we didn't want
to embarrass ourselves.

564
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,883
But we're not here to place blame,
or to come down on you for it.

565
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,625
We've recently learned

566
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:30,679
that ZBZ has been slipping
in the ranks.

567
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,844
Slipping?

568
00:31:32,245 --> 00:31:32,932
How?

569
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,561
We might be fourth.

570
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,688
Ish.

571
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:44,001
Hell to the no!
I am not in a number four house!

572
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:46,174
It's the pledges' fault
for skipping the photo shoot!

573
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:48,220
It's Casey's fault
for not leading the pledges!

574
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:50,032
It's Ashleigh's fault as president!

575
00:31:53,774 --> 00:31:55,040
Ladies, ladies.

576
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,568
It's nobody's fault,

577
00:31:56,693 --> 00:31:58,298
it's all part of the cycle.

578
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,225
Apparently a house goes
through good and bad years, and...

579
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,128
Well, we've been complacent.

580
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:07,066
So used to being on top
that we didn't see the signs.

581
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,677
But we're not about to lie back
and let our beloved ZBZ

582
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:12,805
fall down the social ladder.
We are gonna fight this.

583
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,891
We're gonna start by getting the pledges
on the cover of that damn calendar.

584
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:24,650
- Does this mean you're getting us july?
- It's too late for that, so

585
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,902
we'll just have to kick ass
with november.

586
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,442
Hand me that tray of samples.

587
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:40,153
I took your advice,
I was going to lavaliere Jordan.

588
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:43,762
But then she told me she's thinking
of studying abroad next semester.

589
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:46,974
You think that's kinda weird
she didn't tell me earlier?

590
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,766
What are we, girlfriends here?
Are you gonna start braiding my hair,

591
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:52,928
or doing my nails while we dish
on each other's relationships?

592
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:54,881
- Do you want me to?
- No!

593
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,225
Let's make this clear. I'm not
interested in your personal life.

594
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,706
You told me to lavaliere her, I thought
you'd want to know what happened.

595
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:05,559
Yes, please. I'm dying to hear.
It's all I've been thinking about.

596
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:08,558
Between my wife's snoring,
and an enlarged prostate

597
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:11,112
that forces me to get up
and urinate a dozen times,

598
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:13,712
plus pondering the trials
and tribulations of your love life,

599
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:15,970
- I could hardly sleep last night.
- Me either!

600
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,841
Should I still try and lavaliere her

601
00:33:17,966 --> 00:33:20,311
even though she could be gone
next semester?

602
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:24,627
Personally, I wish you'd just break up
with her so we can get to work.

603
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:27,184
But you'll come in sobbing
like a soiled baby.

604
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:30,377
So yes, I think you should do it,
then never mention it ever again.

605
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,093
What if she says no
because she's leaving?

606
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,466
You're a scientist, Cartwright.

607
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:39,276
Variables are the only constants
in the world.

608
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:43,424
Wait, are you talking
about the experiment or my girlfriend?

609
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:57,139
You think we'll really get the cover
with that tiny camera?

610
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:59,730
I asked everyone,
it's the best one I could find.

611
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:02,790
- With a lot of mega-pixels or whatever.
- Thanks for doing this,

612
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,708
and sorry we bailed on you before.

613
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,670
- It was kind of my idea.
- I figured it was.

614
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,092
But it's OK, Abby.
We're glad you're here now.

615
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,743
Hey, I heard we need a camera.

616
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,757
It was a graduation present.

617
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:18,896
That's a fancy camera.

618
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:20,805
Lots of mega-pixels?

619
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:23,741
It's a 12.3 mp digital slr.

620
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:26,397
It can shoot up
to 4.5 frames a second.

621
00:34:27,252 --> 00:34:28,399
And the mega-pixels?

622
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:29,983
Never mind.

623
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:33,201
Thanks for bringing it.

624
00:34:34,221 --> 00:34:35,630
Great, let's do this.

625
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,159
All right! OK, everyone!

626
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,495
Now, everyone look like
you're having fun!

627
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,393
Come on! Have fun!

628
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:48,717
Come on! Fun!

629
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,273
Maybe...

630
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:54,466
Do something. Actually do something.

631
00:34:55,017 --> 00:34:56,093
All right, smile.

632
00:34:58,338 --> 00:34:59,596
Do you want me to help?

633
00:34:59,995 --> 00:35:02,426
Please. I don't know
what else to tell them.

634
00:35:03,986 --> 00:35:05,310
Pair up everybody.

635
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,746
Photography is hard.

636
00:35:09,214 --> 00:35:12,924
I guess, if we don't get the cover,
we got some good publicity out of it.

637
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:22,119
Boys.

638
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:26,984
Look, they're all paired up. So now,
it has a nice cultural message, too.

639
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:45,067
What's up?

640
00:35:53,272 --> 00:35:55,261
Don't worry, spitter. Don't worry.

641
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,750
What are...

642
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,588
According to the book,
this is KT tradition.

643
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:03,980
Cappie told us you lavaliered Jordan.
Curse or not, we're there for a brother.

644
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:06,705
Sorry.

645
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,968
Hey, Lana, we were thinking
about grabbing a drink

646
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,514
- after this, if you'd like to join us.
- I'm having a drink right now

647
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:27,583
{\pos(192,220)}Cool. That's awesome. But

648
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:31,271
{\pos(192,220)}I was thinking we could sit and talk,
get to know each other outside of work.

649
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,066
Have a little team building seminar
of our own, if you will.

650
00:36:34,964 --> 00:36:35,901
I won't.

651
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:40,656
Tips come out to $46 each.

652
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:42,366
$46? That's it?

653
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,582
On top of the $100 flat fee
you're making.

654
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:47,688
That's $30 an hour
for doing the work of a monkey.

655
00:36:47,813 --> 00:36:49,915
And you didn't have your ass
grabbed everytime.

656
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,291
That's what you think.

657
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:55,212
- I'll see you guys next time.
- Actually...

658
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,256
I'm afraid it was
a one-night stand for me.

659
00:36:58,508 --> 00:36:59,799
Yep, I just quit.

660
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,802
I leave for Top Gun school tomorrow.

661
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:04,661
Just needed to make enough cash
to repair my F-16.

662
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,183
- And $46 covers it?
- Turn signal was out.

663
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:12,604
OK. I've been cute and charming all day,
and you've given me zero hope,

664
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,983
but I'm still fighting. What's it take
for a guy to get your number?

665
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:18,892
Funny thing is, Maverick,

666
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:21,321
all you really needed
was the staff phone sheet.

667
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,460
Too bad you quit.

668
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,400
I'll see you guys later.

669
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:33,804
It'll cost you.

670
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:45,804
Oh, my God. Rusty.

671
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,214
What happened?

672
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,133
And they know I have asthma!

673
00:37:50,258 --> 00:37:52,041
Did the Omega Chis do this to you?

674
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,198
It was the KTs.

675
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:58,025
- Who did that to you?
- It was this dumb calendar thing.

676
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,860
Your own brothers? Why?

677
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,849
Apparently it's KT tradition

678
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:04,249
to tie a brother to a tree

679
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,068
or a pillar

680
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:07,664
when he...

681
00:38:09,401 --> 00:38:11,663
After he lavalieres his girlfriend.

682
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,786
They thought you lavaliered me?

683
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,085
Because I was going to.

684
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,663
At dinner tonight.

685
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,242
But you didn't...

686
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:23,521
Because of the whole
study abroad thing.

687
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,824
After you said all that,
I was afraid you might turn me down.

688
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:30,266
Rusty, the fact that I'm thinking
of spending a semester abroad

689
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,018
has nothing to do
with my feelings for you.

690
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:39,900
Then...

691
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,192
Jordan, will you wear my lavaliere?

692
00:38:44,897 --> 00:38:46,035
I would love to.

693
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,992
It's in my right pocket,

694
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,513
you have to grab it.

695
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,151
Just reach in there.

696
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:59,127
That's not it!
Just kidding. That's it.

697
00:39:04,965 --> 00:39:06,777
Oh, my gosh. It's beautiful.

698
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:08,155
Thank you.

699
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:18,979
OK, can you cut me down now, please?

700
00:39:29,006 --> 00:39:31,086
Hey, boys.
Sorry we missed the shoot,

701
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:33,480
but I think we might have
your new cover.

702
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,969
It's hot and has a message.

703
00:39:42,104 --> 00:39:43,213
It's really good.

704
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,748
- Too bad it's already being made.
- You lie!

705
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,348
We have to turn it around pretty fast
in time for the party tonight.

706
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:53,685
They're being printed as we speak.
You mind if we keep this, though?

707
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,644
- You're right, it's pretty hot.
- Then who did the picture for november?

708
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:01,820
There it is.

709
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:10,824
Sorry, we thought it'd be funny.

710
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,258
But now it just seems...

711
00:40:14,272 --> 00:40:15,684
No, it's still pretty funny.

712
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:24,825
I just got an e-mail
from the study abroad program.

713
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,548
You open it.

714
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:29,009
You open it.

715
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:30,620
No, you open it.

716
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,534
Fine. Forward it to me.

717
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,187
I can't open it.

718
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,259
- But you said you would.
- I know, but I can't now.

719
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:45,230
OK, fine,

720
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:47,012
I'll open it.

721
00:40:49,228 --> 00:40:51,494
There's an attachment,
and I don't have the program.

722
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,978
Fine! I'll just do it.

723
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,009
Wait, I don't know what that means.

724
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:02,418
You look sad, but...

725
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,795
It could be because I'm leaving.

726
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,323
You didn't get in.

727
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:08,693
The program's full.

728
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:14,218
It was probably
a stupid idea, anyway.

729
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,808
Get this out of here.

730
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:32,375
OK, seriously.
Where are our pledges?

731
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:35,033
If they're at home watching
Private Practice, I'll kill 'em.

732
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,329
They must be upset
about not making the calendar.

733
00:41:38,157 --> 00:41:39,222
We're done for.

734
00:41:55,624 --> 00:41:57,305
I thought a lot about what you said,

735
00:41:58,299 --> 00:41:59,432
and you're right.

736
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,553
It was terrible what I did,
and I can't apologize enough.

737
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:06,106
But I'm hoping you'll forgive me.

738
00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:16,579
You were right,
we did need to do something,

739
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,239
and despite our severe senioritis,

740
00:42:20,364 --> 00:42:22,330
we can't leave the house
in bad shape for you.

741
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,084
If you'll excuse me, I have to go close
out my tab and meet up with Fisher.

742
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,466
She's back with Fisher
and I'm still in the dog house?

743
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:36,776
That's so not fair.

744
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,893
I'm so happy you guys made it!

745
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,358
And in costume!

746
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:47,261
We figured we'd show them
what the calendar is missing.

747
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:48,398
Look, Abby,

748
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,082
I know I've been a little
disconnected lately

749
00:42:51,207 --> 00:42:52,818
and I promise to do better.

750
00:42:52,943 --> 00:42:55,572
But I'm glad you've been
a pain in the ass about it.

751
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,116
- I'm a pain in your ass?
- In a good way.

752
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,327
If I were in your shoes,
I would be, too.

753
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:10,003
We may be november,

754
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,340
but I'm glad to see
we're still july in spirit.

755
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,926
I know, right? Screw the cycle.

756
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,386
We're ZBZ, damn it.
