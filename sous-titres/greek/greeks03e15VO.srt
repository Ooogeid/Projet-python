1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,848
I know who started the fire.

2
00:00:02,973 --> 00:00:06,464
I did. But it was an accident.
Maybe someday you'll forgive me.

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:07,882
For burning my house ?

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,817
The Greek softbalt tournament is
this weekend since we're partnering

5
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:13,679
with a fraternity,
I'm ready to meet a fun new guy.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,370
- Who is the lucky girl ?
- Rebecca.

7
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,478
We can go for a coffee
or a movie or something simple.

8
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:21,979
Maybe after coffee

9
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,023
it'll be love at first sight.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,109
You're Casey Cartwright.
You can do anything you want.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,862
That's how I know you're gonna
go to Washington and be amazing.

12
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,155
- What about...
- Graduation ?

13
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,615
You'll never leave here.

14
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,983
I don't think I can be
anywhere that didn't have you.

15
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:43,000
So how did we get here, my peeps ?

16
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:47,458
How did Saint Valentine's beheading lead
to some whacked holiday about love ?

17
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:49,006
A-How.

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,758
Chaucer.

19
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:52,977
Joshuurr ?

20
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,553
For reals.

21
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,263
According to Chaucer,

22
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,573
Valentine wrote a love-letter,
signed "From your Valentine,"

23
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:01,998
that the greeting card
companies have turned into

24
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:03,979
a billion-dollar-a-year industry.

25
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,606
Cards for grandpas,

26
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,774
for dogs,

27
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,111
there are even cards for people
who don't buy cards.

28
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,320
Probably because they're too cheap.

29
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:14,448
David...

30
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:16,992
But I digress.
We'll pick this up next week.

31
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,664
Don't believe the hype.

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,726
Professor Clarissa sure has
it in for Valentine's Day.

33
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,656
Why can't she celebrate with her
friends ? That's what I'm gonna do.

34
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:29,398
- How do you know her friends ?
- I mean my friends.

35
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,164
It's still a great holiday

36
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:34,802
even though I've never actually
celebrated with a girl besides my mom.

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,341
That's the spirit.

38
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,603
So who's the lucky...

39
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,021
friends.

40
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:41,228
Your brothers ?

41
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:44,271
No, they all have dates to
our "Shot through the heart" party.

42
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:49,385
And Calvin has Grant.
Cappie and Casey.

43
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,258
Dale ?

44
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,133
No.

45
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:54,774
He's taking that retainer girl
to a party his church is hosting.

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,785
The theme is "Celibate good times,
come on".

47
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:00,493
Which leaves me one friend...

48
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:01,537
Thank God.

49
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,817
Because being alone
on Valentine's Day would suck.

50
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:10,723
I am going to the Omega Chi

51
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:12,891
Date Dance with this guy, Pete.

52
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,247
We've only been dating,
like, two weeks, but,

53
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,902
he hasn't shown any
Fisher-like behavior, so...

54
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,802
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

55
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:22,536
Because this year,
no matter what anyone says,

56
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,769
I'm going to have
the best Valen-time ever.

57
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:30,704
Nice.

58
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:33,411
The Cupid Range is a good start,
pledges,

59
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,497
but I want to see
a lot of foofy decorations

60
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,949
to get our dates in the mood.
Lacy hearts and other crap.

61
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,785
And a keg of premium beer, too.

62
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:41,732
Got it.

63
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:44,747
Fancy.
Is this the KT house ?

64
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,197
It's Valentine's Day.

65
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:49,197
And since it's our first one
since freshman year,

66
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:52,338
- I thought get you something special.
- Like you did freshman year ?

67
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,406
Exactly.

68
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:55,508
What happened ?

69
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,490
Your gift to me was
a bottle of vodka.

70
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,887
Which you drank and promptly puked up.
Remember ?

71
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,766
Actually, I don't remember anything from
that night, I'll take your word for it.

72
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,101
I just don't want
a repeat of freshman year.

73
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,539
Then I will humbly request
a do-over,

74
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:11,482
because I'm going to get you
the greatest gift ever.

75
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:18,239
That's OK, Cap.
You're just not a, you know,

76
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:21,033
box of chocolates
and roses kind of guy.

77
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,993
- Like Evan ?
- Not just Evan.

78
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,500
- I'm your worst boyfriend ever ?
- That's not what I meant.

79
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,290
Yes, it is. But you're thinking
of old drunk vodka Cappie.

80
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,627
Not the new and improved Cappie
with V-Day Kung Fu grip.

81
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,548
What's the new action
figure Cappie do ?

82
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,051
He gets you the most romantic
gift of your entire life,

83
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,971
and then dances on the graves
of Valentines past.

84
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:45,567
OK then,
Kung Fu-Valentine-Cappie...

85
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,893
I guess everyone
deserves a second shot.

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,264
Good shot.

87
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,457
Grant ? What's going on ?

88
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:12,989
Nothing, just give me a minute.

89
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:20,605
What... the hell ?

90
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:23,929
You're not supposed to be home yet.

91
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,808
My class was canceled.
I didn't mean to walk in on this.

92
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,603
I'm bleaching my hair
for our date party.

93
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:33,230
I've always wanted to do
ever since I came out.

94
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,691
The strip's for the pores...

95
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,808
and...

96
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,707
The trays are for teeth whitening...

97
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,547
And the newspaper ?

98
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:43,032
Wait, I don't really want to know.

99
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,159
I'm shaving my chest and my neck.

100
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,497
And a little bit off
the top of my feet.

101
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,248
- Good to know, Frodo.
- I can't do this

102
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,872
in the communal bathroom.
It's way too embarrassing.

103
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:56,711
So... we don't have
separate rooms and...

104
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,201
I get it.

105
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,592
I'm gonna let you
get some private...

106
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:11,060
There are only 60 Valen-Titan Bears left
for our Children's Hospital fundraiser,

107
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,605
so I want us all to work very hard to
find these little guys a home, OK ?

108
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,316
No one wants to be alone on
Valentine's Day, right Mr. Teddy ?

109
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:20,522
Lastly, if any of you do not
have Valentine's Day plans,

110
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:23,354
you are welcome to join me
for single ladies'chocolate fondue

111
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:24,990
in Pierson's Hall.
Anyone ?

112
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:31,622
Dismissed.

113
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:35,334
Hi, Katherine.

114
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,391
Yes, ZBZ ?

115
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:37,524
Yes, hi.

116
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:42,074
I was thinking I could volunteer to sell
the rest of the Valen-Titan Bears.

117
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,329
- To help you out ?
- That won't be necessary.

118
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,929
- But you just said we...
- No. I've got it. Thank you.

119
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,233
Are those from Pete ?

120
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,831
I'm supposed to serve food,

121
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:03,315
not pick up deliveries from
your would-be paramours.

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,864
That's right,
run to it, you succubae.

123
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,342
So who's the most loved this year ?

124
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,135
You are, of course.

125
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:12,287
By Cappie.

126
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,957
He told me a...

127
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:21,839
I just came from a Panhel meeting
with Katherine. She still hates me,

128
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,870
made worse by the fact that she's
spending Valentine's Day alone.

129
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:27,052
Which is why I have
to find her a date.

130
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,331
No, you don't.
What if you set her up on a bad date ?

131
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:31,740
Beaver, anyone ?

132
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,209
We burned down her house,
it couldn't get much worse.

133
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,484
But if I find her an awesome guy,

134
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,690
then she will totally appreciate
me and we can be friends again.

135
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,525
So who do we know, who do we know ?

136
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,075
That's not taken ?

137
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:44,833
No one.

138
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:46,240
Wait !

139
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:48,365
Wait...
Rusty does not have a date.

140
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,205
I think he's OK with it. Mom sends
him conversation hearts though.

141
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,163
- Who else ?
- No, think about it.

142
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,393
Katherine and Rusty are both Greeks.

143
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:58,542
They are both smart and awkward.

144
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,159
Maybe their shared oddness
could cancel each other out.

145
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,883
- I haven't even agreed with you yet.
- No.

146
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:08,328
It's my invite from Pete.

147
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:10,015
"You caught my eye."

148
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,556
Get it ?
Because we met at the softball game.

149
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,766
It's a good thing he's
rich because that's lame.

150
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,311
And here comes Evan.

151
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,229
I wonder what he got you.

152
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,530
It's a little buddy.

153
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:27,096
He wants to know if you'll
go to our date party with me.

154
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:29,948
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- Yes on the bear. No on the party.

155
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,950
Valentine's Day ? Really ?

156
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:35,999
A day to celebrate love with meaningless
cheap candy and trinkets made in China ?

157
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:38,296
Excuse me,
the bear is made in Chile.

158
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,502
And it's a party.
It'll be fun, we can make fun of people.

159
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:43,796
I do like making fun of people.

160
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,659
- What time should I pick you up ?
- I'll think about it.

161
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,051
Having an all-access pass
to your boyfriend's life this soon

162
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,477
kinda kills the magic.

163
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,056
It's like for straight guys
when Megan Fox speaks.

164
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,503
Are we becoming one of
those gay married couples

165
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:07,278
that host dinner parties
and watch Bravo ?

166
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:12,364
Alright.
What's going on, Rus ?

167
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,952
I've decided to find a date
for Valentine's Day,

168
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,664
- I'm looking for a girl to ask out.
- Now ? It's in two days.

169
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,928
I've had years of
Valentine's Day loneliness.

170
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,500
No. Look, the expectation
will kill you.

171
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:25,712
It's bad enough
I have to have my first out date party

172
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,063
with Grant on Valentine's Day.
The last thing you want

173
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:30,843
is to surround yourself
with a bunch of people in love.

174
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,553
It's better than being alone.

175
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:36,186
Here goes.

176
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:40,624
Hi, you don't know me,
but I'm Rusty.

177
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,927
- Hi, Rusty. Tabitha.
- Nice to meet you, Tabitha.

178
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,733
I hope I'm not being too forward,

179
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,261
but my fraternity's having
this date party on Saturday...

180
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:53,709
You're asking me on a first date
on Valentine's Day ?

181
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,338
Well, I saw you...

182
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:57,826
I thought you were pretty and

183
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:59,065
this is for you.

184
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:02,324
"Lick my..."

185
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,061
Oh My God !

186
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:06,747
Perv.

187
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:17,542
My mom must've accidentally bought me
the X-rated brand.

188
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,457
Or the box was meant for your dad.

189
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:22,471
Traumatic, either way.

190
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,636
Well, I gotta say,
much points for the gift.

191
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,735
Well, I gotta say I'm excited
to have you as my date.

192
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,279
I'm excited to be had.
As your date.

193
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,114
Hey, guys.

194
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,750
So, Pete, the Omega Chi
Date Party is this Saturday.

195
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,123
- Why haven't I heard from you ?
- Because I'm taking Ashleigh.

196
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:45,378
- But you said we were going.
- You did ?

197
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,759
We talked about that,
when we dated last month.

198
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:51,604
But I just assumed you understood
we weren't going out on Valentine's Day

199
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:53,467
- after we broke up.
- We broke up ?

200
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,908
- This is how you tell me ?
- Yeah, I figured when I said,

201
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,266
I think we should see other people,
that you got that.

202
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,759
Well, I do now, Pete,
because I don't date cheaters.

203
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,401
I can't believe she just called me
a cheater.

204
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:13,934
Neither can I.

205
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,042
Taken...

206
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:19,450
married...

207
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:20,953
incarcerated...

208
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,928
No. I'm sorry you can't make it.
Good luck with the surgery.

209
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:28,502
A C-Section ?
How old are these phone numbers ?

210
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,629
Hopefully older than nine months.

211
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,298
- Have we gone through all the phones ?
- Except for Pickle's.

212
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,739
He knows a lot of girls
from the 900 area code.

213
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,286
I should have listened to my professor,
who was smart enough to realize

214
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,700
- that Valentine's Day sucks.
- I get it, Rus.

215
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:44,977
There's a lot of expectations.
Like finding the perfect gift.

216
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,995
You think Casey would like
a used cell phone ?

217
00:10:48,244 --> 00:10:50,020
You know what... forget it.

218
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,542
Why should I care
that I'm alone on February 14th ?

219
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,404
Because society and the greeting
card industry tell me not to be ?

220
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,447
Are you saying that
because you don't have a date ?

221
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,242
I mean it. I'm over it.
I'm over the hype. I'm finally free.

222
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:04,219
Hi.

223
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:07,541
Ash told me about your problem,
and I think

224
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,713
I found you a date for your party.

225
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:11,910
My friend Katherine
is available and...

226
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,938
you were the first person
I thought of.

227
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:15,549
So what do you say ?

228
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,843
I think you're too late,
because he just said...

229
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,910
No, I'm in.
I love Valentine's Day.

230
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:21,930
What ?

231
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:31,189
What's Katherine like ?
I'm not being judgmental, but...

232
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,451
Down, boy. You're going to find out.
Katherine wants to set up a pre-date

233
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,361
- tonight at Dobler's.
- A pre-date ?

234
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,531
Don't worry. Casey and I'll be there in
case you screw up. Her words, not mine.

235
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,990
So, Katherine...

236
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,660
She was at Greek softball.
She's tall, she's pretty.

237
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,885
- That's good.
- Let me finish.

238
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,332
Stern. The word
"Nordic" comes to mind.

239
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:51,599
- I think I can handle that.
- I hope she's easier than your sister.

240
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:53,074
Try pleasing her.

241
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:56,437
Rewind. Try finding
the perfect gift for her.

242
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:58,497
Get her something from the heart.

243
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:00,311
It's just about the two of you.

244
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:03,871
Imagine Casey, imagine the perfect gift
and then make it happen.

245
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:06,724
Nice. That's the Spitter I want to see
at Dobler's tonight.

246
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:15,390
So... What does one wear
to a KT Valentine's party ?

247
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:18,679
Same thing you wear to any other party.
They're not cavemen.

248
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:19,841
All of them.

249
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:23,197
Well, I can tell you what I wore
when I went with Cappie.

250
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,203
Think tiny and wicked.

251
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:27,375
Seems like it would fit you.

252
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:31,439
So, why are you buying a dress ?
I thought you were anti-Valentine's.

253
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:35,543
I agreed to go to Evan's date party.
He got me with his big puppy dog eyes.

254
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:36,753
He does that.

255
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,889
Why am I even buying a dress ?

256
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:42,709
My date's probably just
another Fisher in worsted wool.

257
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,917
Don't let Natalie the angry inch

258
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,890
spoil your next date with Pete.

259
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,394
But she totally got in my head.
It's like I'm dating Eddie Cibrian.

260
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,260
But am I LeAnn Rimes or his wife ?

261
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,025
No. Natalie is a deceptive
little trickster.

262
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,192
Need I remind you of
the electric bill debacle ?

263
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,112
- You're still sensitive over Fisher.
- Because you made out with him.

264
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,155
- What's your point ?
-  Right, Pete deserves a first chance.

265
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:09,744
Case, I bet you're getting lingerie
for Valentine's Day.

266
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:12,834
OK, I get it.
You guys used to date.

267
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,293
Look.

268
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:19,549
Hi, Cap.

269
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:24,136
Don't you love this place ?

270
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,305
Nice try. Lingerie is more
of a gift for you than for me.

271
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,986
What ? It's for Beaver.

272
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:32,185
Because...
Beaver likes to feel pretty.

273
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,635
And since you're not having
to buy a gift for anybody,

274
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,487
maybe you shouldn't talk. Because it's
not easy finding the perfect gift.

275
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:40,992
Please.
How hard could it be ?

276
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,555
Well, let's find out. You versus me,
to see who can get the other

277
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,097
the most romantic gift.

278
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:49,117
Unless you're too scared I'll
outromanticize you or something.

279
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,037
The only thing
I'm scared for is you.

280
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,087
- Game on.
- If you think this is a game

281
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:56,042
- you've already lost. See you tonight.
- Not if I see you first.

282
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:11,016
- Porn site crash ?
- Worse, shopping.

283
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:13,768
I convinced Rebecca to come
to our Valentine's party,

284
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,777
and now I want to show the girl
who claims she doesn't believe in love

285
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:19,733
- how much she means to me.
- You're missing your trust fund.

286
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,884
You know, she's the first girl
that doesn't make me feel

287
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,655
like I'm the evil guy
that everyone else thinks I am.

288
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:27,639
She gets my background and...

289
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:30,017
why we are the way we are.

290
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,287
She deserves something special.

291
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:34,570
Speaking of...

292
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,144
Thanks, man.

293
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:39,336
- That's really sweet.
- It's for Grant.

294
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,880
Can I stash it here
until the party ?

295
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:46,788
- You can't hide it in your room ?
- The room where secrets go to die ?

296
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:49,429
We see way too much as is.

297
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,138
I'm already worried
that the brothers won't be OK

298
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:54,309
with us out together
at a date party.

299
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,618
I'd say that any problems
they might have had,

300
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,563
you took care of
at the softball game.

301
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:03,095
So the only problem now is Grant
and I becoming boring.

302
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,321
Great. Hopefully,
that won't happen to you two.

303
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,864
I doubt it.
Rebecca lives for surprises.

304
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:17,405
This is it. Success tonight
means my first Valentine.

305
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,042
It's like I'm reliving
first grade through you.

306
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:33,108
This is my brother, Rusty.

307
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,184
- So excited to meet you.
- Me too.

308
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,591
Would you guys stand back-to-back ?
Just real quick.

309
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,761
- I want to see something.
- Anyway...

310
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,400
Rusty here was awarded
an engineering grant.

311
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,945
Katherine is president of Panhellenic
and, quite possibly, America one day.

312
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,072
- That's great.
- Yes.

313
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,710
Goals are great.

314
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,121
So Casey tells me
you're studying Poli Sci.

315
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,800
I do, yes.

316
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,216
So...

317
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,956
Why is Political
Science called "Poli Sci,"

318
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,429
and Polymer Science isn't ?

319
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,724
Because, politics isn't
an actual science.

320
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:21,313
Or is it ? I don't know.
You tell me.

321
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:26,398
All I know is, that there
are no beakers in politics.

322
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,241
So are you excited
about Valentine's Day ?

323
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,100
Yes.

324
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:44,628
Speaking of Valentine's Day,

325
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:47,881
Casey and I are battling to see
who can get who the best gift.

326
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:51,676
And today I came up with some
ideas that are gonna blow you away.

327
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,682
Good luck with those ideas, because
I found you the perfect gift today.

328
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,598
You did ?

329
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,817
Seriously ?

330
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,041
Casey tells me you're a Gamma Psi.

331
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,146
Do you like living in a house ?
I mean, did you ?

332
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,131
Yes.

333
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,285
Your house was probably
cleaner than ours.

334
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,121
Once, when I was a pledge,

335
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,903
I had to clean what I thought
was a quarter-pound of hair

336
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:19,036
out of a shower drain,
but it was just a rat.

337
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:26,168
You guys really both like to study.
Maybe you could talk about that.

338
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,159
Yes.

339
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:43,103
Oh, no !
It didn't go well ?

340
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,220
It was the worst pairing since
Drew Barrymore and directing.

341
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:47,995
I can officially kiss my friendship

342
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,276
- with Katherine goodbye.
- You still have me.

343
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,111
We won't be at the same party.

344
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,405
- I know.
- And...

345
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:56,446
I lied to Cappie about
getting him the perfect gift.

346
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,829
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Laura said, "Head on up, bitch."

347
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,708
No, that's fine. I was just going
to show off my new dress, anyway.

348
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:09,174
- It's eclectic.
- Thank you.

349
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:14,134
I know what this is about.

350
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,429
Yes, we need to discuss
this Rusty incident.

351
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,787
How could you possibly imagine

352
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:21,099
- we'd have anything in common ?
- I just thought...

353
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,018
Why did you think
that we'd get along ?

354
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,687
- I'm so, sorr...
- Because we did.

355
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,357
He's so suave.

356
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:31,860
- Really ?
- Yes and handsome.

357
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,169
- You don't have to be polite.
- No. But, really, so...

358
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:37,906
Give me the deets.
Does Rusty work out ?

359
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:41,342
I think he did... once.

360
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,179
Listen to me, I'm prattling on like
a schoolgirl. I had so much fun.

361
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:48,376
- He did too, right ?
- How could he not ? It's you.

362
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,044
So Valentine's Day is a go.

363
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,079
I'm being selfish but I can't think
of anything else but tonight

364
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:55,508
and the connection that we made.

365
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,761
I am so lucky to have
a friend like you.

366
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,539
I am gonna go prepare. But I
will call you about my wardrobe.

367
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:04,959
Well...

368
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:09,858
Hello ?

369
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,066
- What's all this ?
- Comfort food.

370
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,987
I've accepted my fate
as Valentine's Day washout.

371
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,197
Did you get that
non-stick food I asked for ?

372
00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:21,325
Sometimes Bridget
eats with her retainer in,

373
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,619
and kissing her is like
eating lunch twice in one day.

374
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:32,795
- How long you been there ?
- Long enough to taste my lunch twice.

375
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:34,483
No, I was just goofing.

376
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:37,466
We're not an item.
Bridget's Catholic.

377
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:38,842
Good luck with that.

378
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,095
That reminds me... this is for you.

379
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,847
But don't read it in front of me.

380
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:45,224
How...

381
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:47,100
could I ?

382
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,068
So... good news.

383
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,612
You can still have a date
to the KT party if you want,

384
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,533
Katherine totally likes you.
She thinks you're hot.

385
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,493
- Really ?
- That's what I said, too.

386
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,885
- After Dobler's ?
- At least you'd have a Valentine

387
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,539
this once... excluding Mom.

388
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,870
At least Mom can hold a conversation.
I'd rather have no memories than bad ones

389
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:14,516
- with one-word-answer girl.
- At least that word was "yes".

390
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:16,547
A lot of guys would be
happy to hear that.

391
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:18,007
Look Rus,

392
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:20,931
I'm trying to get back on her good side.
We had a falling out.

393
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:24,012
Things got... heated.
Please ?

394
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:29,726
OK. For one month's
free access to your car.

395
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,480
I get you a date and you
blackmail me ? Forget it.

396
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,348
Fine, then you date her.

397
00:20:37,564 --> 00:20:40,404
Just pretend to like her. OK ?

398
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,440
Don't you have a little wheel
you should be running in ?

399
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,925
I'm sorry about the other day.
Pete hurt me really bad

400
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,246
and I don't want to see
you get hurt, too.

401
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:57,082
- That's what these boys do.
- Why should I believe a girl

402
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:59,785
who hooked up with a theater
major to win SongFest ?

403
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,052
Because we're in different houses
doesn't mean we can't be sisters.

404
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,090
As president of the
number one sorority,

405
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:08,460
I want you, president of the number two
sorority to know that we can be friends.

406
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:10,310
And we, at the number one sorority,

407
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,145
want you, the number two sorority,
to know I don't believe you.

408
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,731
Pete's called me every day
for the past two weeks.

409
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:20,707
How do I know this is the real Pete
and not you assigning his name

410
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:22,282
to another number ?

411
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,159
It's Pete. Look, sorry
I've been calling you so...

412
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,184
Don't let him hurt you, too.

413
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:35,287
So this year,
I dug deep down in my heart,

414
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:37,322
and made Casey three presents

415
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:40,059
for us to choose from that
no one else could get her.

416
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,570
Prepare to be amazed.

417
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,470
- Nice.
- Right ?

418
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,699
I raised it from a young sapling,

419
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:50,391
which I think will show
Casey my budding maturity.

420
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,810
- When you say "buds" ?
- It's not that kind of plant.

421
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,828
Yeah, I don't get it. Next.

422
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,279
A God's Eye with ZBZ colors.

423
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,148
Because I appreciate
her sorority allegiance.

424
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:06,282
- And I'm a big kid. Get it ?
- I'm just not feeling it, Cap.

425
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,452
I mean, I understand it,
but it doesn't get me here.

426
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:10,958
OK. All right

427
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,584
A macaroni necklace.

428
00:22:17,456 --> 00:22:20,032
I don't think you're
supposed to cook the macaroni.

429
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,444
- I must've missed that week at camp.
- May I ?

430
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,470
Of course. Yeah, Bon appetit.

431
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,886
Great, the party's in
an hour and I have squat.

432
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,848
And now I have to go get ready.

433
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
It's good.

434
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,201
Do you want to walk down together ?

435
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,023
No. I'm going to get
dressed in the bathroom.

436
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,072
What ?

437
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:47,588
Look...

438
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:50,326
I'm sorry if I've come off
as a jerk lately, it's just...

439
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,599
No, things have been
a little unromantic.

440
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:56,068
And I want to spice them up.

441
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:59,905
Evan may have mentioned
your conversation to me.

442
00:23:00,456 --> 00:23:01,906
I want a real date.

443
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:04,924
Special. Maybe a surprise ?

444
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:08,454
I can't wait to be surprised.

445
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,770
Good.

446
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,944
You look amazing.

447
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,238
Thanks. Can I see your cell phone ?
Mine's dead.

448
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,114
Sure.

449
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:34,005
So, have you talked
to Natalie lately ?

450
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,247
Yeah. I've called her
a bunch of times, actually.

451
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:39,468
Wait, why ?

452
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:42,661
Because she has my history textbook
and she won't give it back.

453
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,381
Well, here's your cell phone back.

454
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:53,973
For you.

455
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:05,781
It's...

456
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:09,081
It's way too beautiful.

457
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,704
I feel like I'm gonna turn on the news
and see some dead rich girl.

458
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:14,973
Nah, I dug the ditch pretty deep.

459
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:18,946
I had some money put away.
It's no big deal.

460
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,486
This looks like a big deal.

461
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:22,811
Well, I saw it

462
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,832
and thought it'd look
really good on you.

463
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:27,965
Let's try it, shall we ?

464
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:32,427
There you go.

465
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:37,579
Thank you.

466
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,827
You guys are leaving now ?

467
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:51,357
- Have fun.
- You too, Case.

468
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,540
Want to exchange gifts now ?

469
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:04,162
I think gifts are better left

470
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,337
to the end of the evening.

471
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,798
If I can find her one by then.

472
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:11,659
Where is she ?
Let's get this over with.

473
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,820
No kidding.

474
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:24,814
Stop drooling.

475
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,109
Hi. You look amazing.

476
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,327
You look very dapper yourself.

477
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:31,946
Moving on ?

478
00:25:43,574 --> 00:25:45,251
Looks like the pledges did me proud.

479
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:51,487
- I'm nervous.
- Because we're at a KT party ?

480
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:54,044
- No, because of Rusty.
- Really ?

481
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:55,913
You keep saying that.

482
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,300
- How spirited of them.
- Jell-O shot ?

483
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:06,355
- Of love ?
- Thank you.

484
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,841
Pickle.
Who's your date ?

485
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:15,156
I'd like you guys to meet
Mrs. Joanne Fletcher.

486
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:20,077
How sweet, he brought his mom.

487
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,826
That's not his mom.

488
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,201
So you want to shoot some arrows ?

489
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:39,068
Yes.

490
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:47,010
I have to admit, I didn't think
you'd want to go to a KT party.

491
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:48,480
It didn't seem like you.

492
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,813
- No offense.
- None taken.

493
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:54,933
I have to admit I didn't think I'd find
a Gary Wyatt Grant winner at KT either.

494
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,731
It was a little intimidating.

495
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:59,824
Really ? Is that why you kept giving me
one-word answers at Dobler's ?

496
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:03,829
It's the quickest way to get to know
someone. You let them do all the talking

497
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,748
And I liked what I heard.

498
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,960
I was a Boy Scout.

499
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:21,846
Holy crap.

500
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,278
I made it to the Olympic trials
when I was 11.

501
00:27:24,403 --> 00:27:28,144
There aren't too many overachieving
Greeks like you here at CRU.

502
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,106
I guess I am somewhat of an amalgam.

503
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:33,558
Let me show you.

504
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,264
Happy, VD.

505
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:08,059
What's up ?
I feel like I never see you anymore.

506
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,437
I know. You're all holed up
with Grant all day.

507
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:12,662
- So, you guys good ?
- I think so.

508
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,630
We certainly see
a lot of each other.

509
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:18,069
Sometimes too much.
But we're working it out.

510
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,426
I get it. The perils
of living under the same roof.

511
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:23,339
Of course, in my case
it was because Fisher was...

512
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:25,660
CRU's version of David Letterman.

513
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:27,580
Hey, guys.

514
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:31,802
My God !
You look hot.

515
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:35,618
Thanks, Ash.
Cal ? What do you think ?

516
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:37,907
I think you look...

517
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:39,674
- spicy.
- Right ?

518
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,055
I know it's not me,
but I'm kinda diggin'it.

519
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,971
Could be more where this came from.
I'm gonna get us some drinks.

520
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:54,895
Stop it. I know
what you're thinking.

521
00:28:55,596 --> 00:28:57,473
This is like the same thing
as Michael.

522
00:28:57,598 --> 00:29:00,946
- Michael would never wear that.
- You asked for a surprise,

523
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,177
and you got it.
So enjoy your...

524
00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:05,202
spicy hot out-and-proud man.

525
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,347
God.
It's Tinker-Hell.

526
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:13,656
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey there.

527
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,031
Get me a drink.

528
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,793
She's after Pete.

529
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:19,381
She's like a little
Valentine parasite.

530
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,439
Nice work, Tony Hopkins.

531
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:31,374
I stole it from the Lamda Sig house.

532
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:34,171
All right, here.
Keep the change.

533
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:40,450
Well, you look confident.

534
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:42,446
Are you prepared to lose all control

535
00:29:42,843 --> 00:29:45,782
and attempt to ravage my body
right here on the dance floor ?

536
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,523
Let's see what you got.

537
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,705
Seriously.

538
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:53,496
It's tragedy
plus time equals comedy.

539
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,665
It reminds us
of our first time together.

540
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,128
And takes us back to
younger, simpler days.

541
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:01,504
Yeah, it takes us back to the time
you bought me vodka for Valentine's Day

542
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,288
and drank it and threw up.

543
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:05,261
On me. Left that part out earlier.

544
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:08,411
But... thanks for the vodka.

545
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,080
It's a callback.
I get it, it's funny.

546
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:12,548
Gotcha !

547
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:17,356
Actually, it's tragedy plus time
plus you falling for it.

548
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:19,322
Because vodka equals

549
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:21,924
- not my real gift.
- So this is not your real gift ?

550
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:24,292
This ? No ! Hell no !

551
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:27,450
I will give you your real gift...

552
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:29,065
later on.

553
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,222
Then I'll give you
your gift later, too.

554
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:32,079
Great.

555
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:38,668
Hey, you two.

556
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:42,089
You can cut the crap, Nat.
I know why Pete called you.

557
00:30:43,512 --> 00:30:46,218
No, Ash. I just wanted to apologize.

558
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:50,389
I went too far at the Student Union
and I'm truly, truly sorry.

559
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:51,848
It's just...

560
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:55,561
The worst thing that ever has happened
to me, happened on Valentine's Day.

561
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:58,361
God. It was so horrible.

562
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:01,230
It was Valentine's Eve.
I was nine years old.

563
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:04,567
Me and Mom were decorating the tree,
waiting for Dad to come home from work.

564
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,655
A couple hours went by.
Dad still wasn't home.

565
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,972
So Mom called the office
and no answer.

566
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:13,036
So the police began a search.

567
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:15,872
And four or five days later...

568
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,640
You tried to light a fire,
and you noticed the smell,

569
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:21,754
the firemen came and they
pulled out your dead dad.

570
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,653
That story is from Gremlins.

571
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:26,322
The only reason you're telling
it is because you are one.

572
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,525
So don't feed her after midnight
or she'll turn uglier.

573
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,661
Ash...
Chill out.

574
00:31:32,717 --> 00:31:35,183
Why don't we go get you some water ?

575
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:46,048
Can I admit something ?

576
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:49,205
This is my first
Valentine's date ever.

577
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:52,255
It's mine, too.

578
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:57,804
I rarely date.
Or go to parties.

579
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:02,525
I got into Yale Law School.

580
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,376
You must be excited.

581
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,319
And terrified.

582
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:10,166
I've lived my whole life for the
future at the expense of the present.

583
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:14,291
So now I have to fit the entire
college experience into one semester.

584
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:18,562
And I want to be more
than the geeky smart girl.

585
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:22,219
- Is that sad ?
- Why do you think I rushed KT ?

586
00:32:22,344 --> 00:32:24,358
I want to be more than
the geeky smart girl, too.

587
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,430
I mean, guy.

588
00:32:30,544 --> 00:32:34,090
I think Casey sometimes worries
about it in the opposite direction.

589
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:37,526
That she waited too long
to find something beyond ZBZ.

590
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,129
It's sweet of you to think of her.

591
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:42,064
And though I'll never admit it,

592
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:44,967
I think your sister's doing
a fine job of catching up.

593
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:47,036
I guess we all have regrets.

594
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:50,233
I don't think I'll regret this.

595
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:00,476
I am so glad I changed my
mind about a second date.

596
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:03,289
- What ?
- What.

597
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:06,436
Casey said that you had a great time

598
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,068
on our first date.
Was she telling the truth ?

599
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:11,317
Yeah.

600
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:14,619
- Well, I mean, sort of...
- Clearly not.

601
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,066
She convinced you how ?

602
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:18,900
Did she express pity for me ?

603
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:21,821
Appeal to your sense of charity ?
She belittle my chocolate fondue,

604
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:23,984
because I could tell
she thought it was lame.

605
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:26,409
Casey loves fondue.
She really likes you, too.

606
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,070
But... you don't ?

607
00:33:29,195 --> 00:33:31,213
I do, and I'll prove it to you.

608
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,482
I'll tell her that I don't
want her car.

609
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,284
She bribed you with her car ?

610
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:37,500
Am I that pathetic ?
And what are you ?

611
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,156
Some brother-whore to be bought
and traded like a commodity ?

612
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,518
Casey, hi. Great !

613
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,161
Did you offer your car to Rusty
to date me so we could be friends ?

614
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,691
- Katherine, look, I thought...
- I need to breathe.

615
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,541
I wanted us to be friends
because I respect and admire you.

616
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,812
- And I just want you to be happy.
- Me, too.

617
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:56,908
Forget about what brought us here.
Just think about what is going on now.

618
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,228
I'm thinking.

619
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,664
Why don't you just give me one
reason why I should forgive you.

620
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:04,792
Heads up !

621
00:34:05,218 --> 00:34:06,168
My gosh !

622
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:16,010
First a fire, now this. Katherine's
gonna think we're trying to kill her.

623
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:19,723
- Are you ?
- I'm the one she's going to hate.

624
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:21,974
Just when I think I kinda like her.

625
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,060
Really ?

626
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,313
- What are you doing here ?
- Drama, Rus.

627
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,981
Had to bring Bridget in.
There was a...

628
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:30,296
accident.

629
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:33,125
Involving her retainer.

630
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:37,116
She's gonna be fine
but I'm gonna need some stitches.

631
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,245
Thank God !
You're OK !

632
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,121
"Tis only a flesh wound".

633
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,707
Monty Python.
That's funny.

634
00:34:44,888 --> 00:34:46,834
"We are the Knights who say Ni".

635
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,463
I've got you on strong pain killers.
A good thing the arrow was blunt-tipped

636
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,797
or you'd be spending Valentine's Day
in the morgue.

637
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,383
Like the real Valentine.

638
00:34:54,564 --> 00:34:57,802
I bet you'll never forget the first time
you were struck by Cupid's arrow.

639
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:59,470
Actually it was Pickle's.

640
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:00,872
He said he was sorry.

641
00:35:00,997 --> 00:35:03,683
Casey, you went to all this trouble
to be friends with me ?

642
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:08,105
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

643
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:09,398
So, thank you.

644
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:12,686
- Ni.
- I'll walk her home.

645
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,410
Yeah...

646
00:35:16,107 --> 00:35:19,449
That's probably the strangest injury
you've had all night, right ?

647
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,668
Not really.

648
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:34,213
You OK ?

649
00:35:34,404 --> 00:35:37,301
I can't find my boyfriend.
Have you seen him ?

650
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:42,430
What's your problem ?
He's freaking beautiful.

651
00:35:42,612 --> 00:35:45,627
I know.
I just prefer my men handsome.

652
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,766
What's the difference ?

653
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:50,865
When I came out that one week
I wanted to listen to Indigo Girls

654
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,776
and wear no makeup. Grant's
experimenting with the lifestyle.

655
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,194
- Big whoop. It's natural.
- So I'm overreacting ?

656
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:58,520
You are a pretty uptight gay.
Lighten up.

657
00:35:58,645 --> 00:36:02,367
If you want it to work,
it's something you're gonna have to do.

658
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,002
Or I could just buy him
a really fancy necklace.

659
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:07,199
- Is that from Evan ?
- I've decided I like it.

660
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:10,959
- It's a keepsake I can keep forever.
- I think that was his idea.

661
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:15,005
Really ?
He said that ?

662
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,323
More or less.

663
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,855
He says that you get him
more than anyone else.

664
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:23,851
I think he sees a future with you.

665
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:26,016
I hope it works out.

666
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:30,441
I'm gonna go get some air.

667
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:39,411
Can I talk to you for a second ?

668
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:40,280
Alone ?

669
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,470
What ? I'm not doing anything.

670
00:36:43,306 --> 00:36:46,703
- Except hurting inside.
- She's really upset.

671
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,081
Seriously ? How are you buying
this whole martyr act ?

672
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,166
I'm the good one.
She's LeAnn Rimes.

673
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:53,960
She burned down my house.

674
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:57,214
Yeah, Ashleigh didn't think
we deserved to win SongFest,

675
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,591
so she snuck in and set it on fire.

676
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,555
Nat, that's just crazy.

677
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:06,026
- What ?
- What ?

678
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:07,666
I mean... yeah.

679
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:10,184
That is a total lie, Natalie.

680
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:12,405
Kinda like the one where you said
that we paid

681
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,857
for your electric bill last semester.
Yeah everyone, that is a lie, too.

682
00:37:16,413 --> 00:37:17,859
No. That's the truth.

683
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,546
You know it, Ashleigh, tell them !

684
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,948
- What ? That you're crazy ?
- You're lying.

685
00:37:23,146 --> 00:37:25,409
You're all lying.
I know what I'm talking about.

686
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,195
I'm not crazy, damn it.

687
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,037
Could someone walk her home
so she doesn't hurt herself ?

688
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,365
- Come on, Natalie, I'll walk you home.
- Hands off me, Carrot-top.

689
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,669
Carrot-top !
That is harsh.

690
00:37:37,694 --> 00:37:39,339
Good luck with that, dude !

691
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:45,596
Sorry I didn't believe
that Nat's crazy.

692
00:37:46,382 --> 00:37:48,779
It's just that when she called me
a cheater

693
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:52,143
I felt bad and it kinda hurt
that you didn't trust me, either.

694
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:54,645
I just didn't want
to be hurt by you.

695
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:57,566
How about we promise
not to hurt each other ?

696
00:37:57,747 --> 00:37:59,197
I'm good with that.

697
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:02,987
Where were we ?

698
00:38:04,354 --> 00:38:05,404
Right here.

699
00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:30,056
I thought you bailed.

700
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:36,771
I was here, doing this.
Surprise.

701
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,991
You are just full of surprises.

702
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:42,276
So is the ensemble too much ?

703
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:45,529
I once dumped a guy
for being too foofy.

704
00:38:45,902 --> 00:38:48,200
- OK, too much.
- No wait. I'm not done.

705
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,744
I don't want to be an uptight gay.

706
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,372
All right ?

707
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:57,835
I want to be as brave as you.

708
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,502
Maybe explore a little.

709
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:02,880
With you.

710
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:17,186
Sorry.
Have you seen Rebecca ?

711
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:20,773
Yeah, she said
that she was gonna get some air.

712
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:24,986
Carry on.

713
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:41,269
- Angie. This is Rusty.
- Hi.

714
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:45,672
Your skin is so soft.

715
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,598
God, I am so sorry
you were struck by an arrow.

716
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:56,851
That's what I get
for dating a bad boy.

717
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,483
I don't know if you've noticed
but sometimes I'm socially awkward

718
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:08,905
and I don't really know
what to do... or to say.

719
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,473
I haven't noticed.

720
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:14,531
I'm sorry that I wasn't much
of a Valentine.

721
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,872
That was the least suckiest
Valentine's Day I've ever had.

722
00:40:18,822 --> 00:40:19,672
Me too.

723
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:32,751
Thank you.

724
00:40:46,957 --> 00:40:48,007
Hi, Beaver.

725
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:51,907
Wait up.

726
00:40:56,461 --> 00:40:59,411
- How about we go upstairs ?
- What's upstairs ?

727
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:01,106
Your room.

728
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:03,581
I know that.
But why you wanna go...

729
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:05,310
my God.

730
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:16,847
Yeah, they turn off
the Slushee machines at midnight.

731
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:19,101
I was thinking
we could exchange our gifts.

732
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,867
- Here ?
- No better time than the present.

733
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:23,104
Present. Get it ?

734
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:25,852
OK. Me first.

735
00:41:32,444 --> 00:41:33,531
"Look up".

736
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,967
Just what I always wanted.

737
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,158
You were so right.
It's really hard to buy a gift.

738
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:47,420
I totally cracked under the pressure.
You're off the hook from this day forward.

739
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,880
Well, that's good.

740
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:52,550
Because I don't think I could top
what I did this year.

741
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,904
Bringing me to the Quickie Mart ?

742
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,928
It's not just any Quickie Mart.

743
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,764
You and I came here once
freshman year for snacks.

744
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,800
I thought it looked familiar.

745
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:05,177
You were buying all this food
and I was wondering

746
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:07,071
if you got high
when I wasn't looking.

747
00:42:07,196 --> 00:42:10,040
And when I asked you
about it, you said :

748
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:12,110
"I want to stock the fridge
in your room",

749
00:42:12,235 --> 00:42:14,905
because you knew I was lazy
about going to the cafeteria

750
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,115
and you didn't want me to go hungry.

751
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:21,252
- Do you want food ?
- And you were at the register, paying.

752
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:23,777
You tucked your hair
behind your ear,

753
00:42:24,536 --> 00:42:27,016
looked back at me and just...

754
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,489
smiled.

755
00:42:35,057 --> 00:42:38,007
This is where I first realized
that I loved you.

756
00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:41,132
And I've loved you every day since.

757
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,022
My God.

758
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:48,607
That's my gift.

759
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:50,405
My God.
It's perfect.

760
00:42:58,648 --> 00:42:59,545
So, I...

761
00:43:00,816 --> 00:43:03,516
- I guess I kinda won ?
- Yeah, you so won.

762
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:10,311
Yes !

763
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,460
Suck it, Valentine's Day !
