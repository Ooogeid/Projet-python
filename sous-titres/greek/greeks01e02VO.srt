00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,005
<i>Previously on Greek

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,179
Rusty Cartwright. I'm a freshman.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,205
I'm Casey Cartwright.

4
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:05,949
Tomorrow night, we are gonna host

5
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,713
over a thousand girls for rush.

6
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:09,518
Daughter of our fair state Senator.

7
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,456
She's coming here this fall,
and she's rushing.

8
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:13,199
Land Rebecca Logan

9
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,076
and you can be the heir to my throne.

10
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:17,611
- I'm Dale. You gotta be pretty smart
- Dale, nice to meet you.

11
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,805
- to get the engineering program.
- How'd you knowt?

12
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,497
This is the honors engineering floor.

13
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:23,322
I want to rush a fraternity.

14
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:25,024
You're not fraternity material.

15
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:27,342
No one knows you here.
You can be anyone you want.

16
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,614
I want to be a Kappa Tau.

17
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:30,788
Let's go, pledge.

18
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:32,018
You're Casey's little brother.

19
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,008
- How'd you know?
- I'm her boyfriend. I'm Evan.

20
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:36,378
You know this doesn't mean I'm gay
or anything.

21
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:39,331
We're not gay. We were just drunk.

22
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:41,449
- The reason I broke up with you...
- I dumped you.

23
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:42,603
Hey, Crappie.

24
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:44,101
The name's Cappie.

25
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,130
I saw Evan...

26
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:51,710
- I don't know...
- with another girl.

27
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:53,063
They were gonna have sex.

28
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,848
Casey, i'll make it up to you.

29
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,961
Sweetie, we're even.

30
00:00:58,694 --> 00:00:59,843
Think about it.

31
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:05,706
Was there ever a time
when radio stations

32
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,283
actually played music?

33
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:09,994
Almost makes me want to listen to NPR.

34
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,349
I said I want to listen with NPR.

35
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:18,854
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

36
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,105
Evan stuff?

37
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,471
Things are great with Evan.
Why wouldn't they be?

38
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:25,342
I just assumed it would take a girl
more than a couple of days

39
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:27,187
to get over the fact
her boyfriend hooked up

40
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:29,465
with one of her pledges as her
younger brother watched.

41
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,225
Look, what happened between

42
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,995
Evan and Rebecca Logan
on rush night sucked

43
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,125
a lot.

44
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:36,479
But it's behind us.

45
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:37,864
So we're totally fine.

46
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:40,364
Especially with what
we've gotta do tonight?

47
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:42,628
- Business as usual.
- <i>This is WGOD.</i>

48
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,058
<i>You're listening
to inspirational recordings...</i>

49
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,220
Son of a...

50
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:49,117
<i>Only on Cyprus... the gospel."</i>

51
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,369
<i>Heavenly music for life</i>

52
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:52,840
<i>and... after.</i>

53
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,700
You want to hear
an interesting tidbit of info?

54
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:57,183
Absolutely. Anything.

55
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,422
All right.

56
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,454
This school in Florida had to shut down
one of their fraternities

57
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:03,745
for hazing after one of pledges
was forced to...

58
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,482
break several laws against both God
and nature

59
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:07,985
during cinco de mayo last year.

60
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,393
Those fraternities sure sound like fun.

61
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:12,863
This isn't hazing. This is just laundry.

62
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,005
That's probably how it started with
that poor cinco de mayo boy.

63
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,328
You can't let a few bad apples

64
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:18,909
ruin the bunch. If that were the case,

65
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,716
no one would ever join
the catholic church.

66
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:22,012
That's exactly why I'm baptist.

67
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,036
Hazing is just

68
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:26,717
this small part.

69
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,380
It's running errands,

70
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:29,825
helping out around the house,

71
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:31,467
an occasional prank or two

72
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:32,552
maybe.

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,646
I feel like...

74
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:35,529
I don't know. I'm earning my keep.

75
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:37,133
Like I belong.

76
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:38,651
Whatever helps you sleep at night.

77
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,676
Speaking of,

78
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:40,734
physics, 9 a.m.

79
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,396
I hope I can sleep tonight.

80
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:47,068
Just so you know, I'd never force you
to do anything

81
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:48,853
you didn't want to
to prove yourself to me.

82
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:49,899
Thanks, Dale.

83
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,343
- For tonight, could we not...
- It helps me sleep.

110
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,121
Sorry, guys.

111
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,232
I was at the student center
across campus.

112
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:41,238
No problem, pledge Owens.

113
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,729
I will have to ask you to drop
and give me 20, though.

114
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,955
Are you serious?

115
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,074
All of you!

116
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:50,014
The success of one brother

117
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,501
is success for everyone.

118
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:52,923
And the failure of one

119
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,336
affects us all.

120
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,597
I am your pledge master,

121
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,280
brother Chambers.

122
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,259
And it is my duty to instill in you

123
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,631
the ideals we honor here.

124
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:01,786
Self-improvement.

125
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:03,450
Leadership.

126
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:04,640
And dedication.

127
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,406
And part of dedication

128
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:07,876
is punctuality!

129
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:10,491
The hardcover you'll feel
dropping on your spine

130
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:11,754
is the Omega Kal pledge book.

131
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,528
You will be tested on it.

132
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:16,154
Now initiation
is not intended to humiliate.

133
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,729
It's purpose is to take you

134
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,921
from the boys you are now

135
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:22,167
and challenge you to become real men.

136
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:25,082
You all have one hour...

137
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,917
To melt these blocks of ice.

138
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:32,365
Yeah, there is a catch.

139
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:34,043
Do it naked.

140
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:36,976
Let's go!

141
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:39,397
Come on. You heard him.

142
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,915
Remove your blindfolds!

143
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:55,373
Greetings!

144
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:57,240
Four score

145
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:58,368
and seven years ago,

146
00:05:58,748 --> 00:05:59,754
our forefathers

147
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,913
who... Art in heaven,

148
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,056
hallow it be their name,

149
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,983
brought into this continent

150
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,626
Kappa Tau Gamma.

151
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:10,721
Though we walk

152
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:12,556
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

153
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,044
we fear nothing.

154
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:15,439
And neither will you.

155
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,064
As tonight...

156
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:20,098
You all become men!

157
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:23,720
Not in the way you might be thinking.

158
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:26,079
We do not have hookers,
which isn't to say we didn't try.

159
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,186
Regardless...

160
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:30,281
You all have been brought here before us

161
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,874
to participate in a ceremonial
rite of passage.

162
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:35,200
It derives from a secret

163
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:36,670
spartan ritual known as

164
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:37,914
Cryptea.

165
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:41,154
Where a boy is sent out into the wild...

166
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:45,034
To live off the land, fight for his life
while protecting his village.

167
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:47,797
If he wasn't devoured by those...

168
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:50,001
Gnarly looking wolfy things.

169
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,030
Then he returned to the village...

170
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,203
A man.

171
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:56,939
Isn't that the beginning of 300?

172
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:58,009
We did it first!

173
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:02,563
You must stay out here all night.
You cannot sleep.

174
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:06,246
Also, the spartan boys had to wear
their battle clothes for 24 hours.

175
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:08,478
They were out there for months.

176
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:09,852
Silence!

177
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:18,219
You guys gotta do some light gardening,

178
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,077
'cause the weeds are getting
kind of bad.

179
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:21,864
And to be one with the earth,

180
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,797
which was something else they did back.

181
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,733
We'll see you in the morning
when you're men.

182
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,492
Be well.

183
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,433
- Hey, I'm Rusty.
- Rusty, right?

184
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,596
Yeah, Ben Bennett.

185
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:44,179
Cool name.

186
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,574
So what's your major?

187
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,389
Undeclared, I guess. Yours?

188
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:49,969
Polymer science.

189
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,144
Bummer.

190
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:01,225
Okay, so tomorrow is our
annual pledge scavenger hunt.

191
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,211
Meet me in the quad. Then thursday
is our big sis, little sis revealing,

192
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,591
where you'll learn
who will be your big sister.

193
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:09,979
Let's eat.

194
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,376
These girls are so awesome.

195
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:13,641
I love every one of them.

196
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:15,817
My Gosh, you guys!
This is like the best night ever.

197
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:18,270
My mom was a ZBZ,
and she's so proud of me.

198
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:21,911
You get some food.

199
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:23,564
We're so happy you're here!

200
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:26,316
Except that one.

201
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,364
Legacies.

202
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:29,599
- Didn't understand a word she said.
- Like it matters.

203
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,276
I'm still a proud prez. You handled
the whole situation so well.

204
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:36,226
Look around. Someday
this could all be yours.

205
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,968
Oh, here's our crown jewel now.

206
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:43,220
I am so excited to be here. I feel like
you all can take such good care of me.

207
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,962
Casey, why don't you go show
Rebecca her new room?

208
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,316
Fine.

209
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,369
So here it is.

210
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:55,350
You know, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

211
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,129
It's much smaller than imagined.

212
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,602
It's the only room we have left.

213
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:01,349
You know, we normally can't allow
freshmen to live in the house.

214
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:04,133
I know that I'm a campus celebrity,
which is so weird just because

215
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,459
my dad's a senator and rich
and famous and whatever, but

216
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:08,531
please... No special treatment.

217
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:11,667
- Except for your own room in the house.
- And maybe my own tivo?

218
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,820
Check out that room, it's huge!

219
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,146
Yeah, this is my room.

220
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:19,095
And speaking of things that are mine...

221
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:22,973
I found you sort of had sex
with Evan Chambers.

222
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:25,253
I did, rush night, and it was amazing.

223
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:26,547
Okay, please stop talking.

224
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:27,821
Here's the thing.

225
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:29,612
Evan Chambers is my boyfriend.

226
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,265
How awkward for you.

227
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:36,878
Are you guys breaking up?

228
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,256
Anyway...

229
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:42,281
I just wanted to say that

230
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:45,859
at Zeta Beta for a sister to hook up
with another sister's boyfriend,

231
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:48,317
it's considered bad form.

232
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:50,560
Well, I had no idea he was
your boyfriend at the time.

233
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:51,790
Of course.

234
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:54,159
And I'm just offering some advice

235
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:55,767
in the spirit of sisterhood.

236
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:58,353
Maybe you want to take some time
to get to know a guy

237
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,612
before you hook up with him.

238
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,874
Like, see if he's in a relationship.

239
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:06,031
Interesting.
That's some pretty great advice.

240
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:08,746
You must be pretty perfect to dole out
that kind of advice.

241
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:09,952
I'm not saying I'm perfect...

242
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,288
Well, we agree on something.

243
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:13,258
Because I know I'm not perfect.

244
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,443
- Let me rephrase...
- No, I get it.

245
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,519
I hooked up with your boyfriend.

246
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:20,339
And I'm sorry for you about that.

247
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:23,004
But I'm not gonna apologize
to you for doing it.

248
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:26,642
Can I offer you some sisterly advice?

249
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:30,391
Maybe you should spend
a little less time on your sisters,

250
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:32,371
and a little more time
on your boyfriend.

251
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,582
- Thanks for the advice.
- No, thank you.

252
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:41,984
I've learned a lot.

253
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:48,420
And I was totally chill. I was like,

254
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,577
"you might wanna be a little
more careful."

255
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:51,890
and she was like "back off."

256
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:53,403
"And by the way, I'm totally happy

257
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,477
dressing like Donna Karan's
skanky little sister."

258
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:59,973
I know, right? Verbatim almost.
And now I have to live with her.

259
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:01,513
And be nice to her.

260
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:02,992
And she's evil.

261
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:04,872
Well, you know, she's not active yet.

262
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,286
We could bounce her out.

263
00:11:06,443 --> 00:11:08,476
Are you kidding?
Frannie'd never let that happen.

264
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:11,457
Yeah, but people leave,
they quit... If they're pushed too hard.

265
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,421
I like that.

266
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,042
And sometimes accidents do happen.

267
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,628
- I'm not gonna kill her, Ash.
- No, not kill.

268
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,106
Injure.

269
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:24,177
No, no, this is good.

270
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,536
It's easy.

271
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,442
We'll run her ragged and make her quit.

272
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,219
Rebecca Logan must go.

273
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,146
Thought you might need those.

274
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,778
- Hey, good job on the weeds.
- Crap.

275
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:44,589
- Awesome back here.
- I was the only pledge who fell asleep?

276
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:46,965
Looks like you got off easy.
Usually on the first person

277
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:48,917
who falls asleep, the pledges tend to...

278
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,038
What happens usually?

279
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:55,014
That person gets the most sleep.
You've got some mud.

280
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,010
- They dye your feet?
- Good one, guys.

281
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,511
Because they care, buddy.
Because they care.

282
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,694
When I mentioned my major, this one guy
looked at me like I was terminal.

283
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,892
They don't know you.
Just give 'em some time.

284
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,731
Yeah, just the first week.

285
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:14,082
In a month, this'll all be behind me.

286
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:15,718
Yeah, you betcha.

287
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,480
Atta boy.

288
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:26,109
You know, we haven't spent
any time together lately.

289
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,874
- We're okay, right?
- Of course.

290
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,804
We've both been busy.

291
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:35,433
Yeah, well, you do what you gotta do.

292
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:37,901
If you want, you can come tonight

293
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:39,563
- and hang with me at Dobbler's.
- Done.

294
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:44,231
- Wait, is that your brother?

295
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,864
- Rusty, are you sleepwalking?
- Oh, my God.

296
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:49,708
Hey, Case. Evan.

297
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,702
People can see you.
People can see you standing near me.

298
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,746
That is typical Kappa Tau crap, man.

299
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:58,068
What, this? No, this was an accident.
I fell down some stairs.

300
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,655
And cut two holes
in the butt of your jammies.

301
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,433
I was holding scissors.

302
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:10,114
Hang in there. First week is
always the worst,

303
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:12,323
because that's when
classes are the easiest.

304
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:13,390
Class.

305
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:16,260
- What time is it?
- It's almost 9:00.

306
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:20,374
What? Oh, my gosh! I'm screwed.
I gotta go. I'm screwed!

307
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:27,042
His feet were blue.

308
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,505
Has class started yet? Why are there
so many people?

309
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:47,545
No, you can't sit there.

310
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,684
- Why? This is the only seat left!
- It's saved.

311
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:50,761
For who?

312
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:53,064
For that guy. Hey, I saved your seat.

313
00:13:56,464 --> 00:14:00,806
If everyone could take their... You!
This is a university classroom,

314
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:05,099
- Not a homeless shelter. - I'm sorry.
I'm not homeless. I'm in a fraternity.

315
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:07,432
I like you better homeless. Sit.

316
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,851
The brain surgeons at the registrar's
office overbooked this class.

317
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:18,243
We have 100 seats and 124 students.
But that's not a problem for me.

318
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,100
It's a problem for you.

319
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,835
90 problems for you.

320
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:24,819
Your first problem set,

321
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:28,379
which I want completed and in my hands
no later than 9 a.m. thursday.

322
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:32,222
Work in groups, work alone,
I don't care. Based on results,

323
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,816
100 of you will stay. 24 of you will
find something else to do.

324
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,175
Maybe kill some more
brain cells at the frat house.

325
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,444
You have 20 things on or around campus
that you have to find

326
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:52,488
and take pictures of with your
handy dandy ZBZ cams.

327
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:55,184
Might be something like a picture
of the football stadium.

328
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:58,029
Or a picture of you making out
with a football player.

329
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,109
Football player?
I love football players!

330
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:01,754
I want to date football player one day.

331
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:04,419
Okay, you have until 7:00 p.m.

332
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:06,830
to complete your lists and haul ass
back to Dobbler's.

333
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,882
If you do not make it by then,
you will not remain

334
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:11,309
in the running toward becoming
america's next top Zeta Beta.

335
00:15:11,436 --> 00:15:12,451
Questions?

336
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,696
No. Okay, go!

337
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:23,010
Wait, I think I have
a joke list or something.

338
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:24,207
What?

339
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,760
"Panther. Middle-aged hooker.
Male faculty member shirtless."

340
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,444
Let me take a look at that.

341
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,872
Two puppies wearing hats.
The lists were passed out randomly.

342
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:40,345
And no special treatment, right?
You're just one of the girls now.

343
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:43,960
They're all doing their own lists.
It might get weird if we gave you

344
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,083
your own room and then gave you
an easier list

345
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,740
because you can't do the one you have...

346
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:49,551
I can do it.

347
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,185
Of course you can.
You're Rebecca freakin' Logan.

348
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,311
You can totally do this. Kick ass!

349
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,595
I thought she was gonna quit right then.

350
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,619
She'll never finish the list.

351
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,920
I thought the first week
was supposed to be easy.

352
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:10,150
Why can't he just find a bigger room?
Why do we have to do this?

353
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:12,342
Because he's teacher
and we do as we're told.

354
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:15,165
But this is ridiculous.
He's testing us on concepts and theories

355
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,460
he hasn't even taught us yet.

356
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:20,935
I mean, "microscopic and macroscopic
aspects of deformation and fracture."

357
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,836
No, I've heard of that before.

358
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:26,851
"Spinodal decomposition
and martensitic reactions?"

359
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,161
That was something to do...

360
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:32,846
with the morphological changes in...

361
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:36,158
- Something.
- Hey! Why don't we work together?

362
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:37,642
'Cause I don't need to.

363
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,361
"Molecular foundations

364
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:44,685
"of polymer viscoelasticity
pertaining to the Rouse-Bueche theory

365
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,200
and the Boltzmann
superposition principle"?

366
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,273
- We should get started tonight.
- Great.

367
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:54,930
No, I can't. I can't tonight. I have to
be at the house every night this week.

368
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,771
- Happy failing.
- We can just split it up.

369
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:01,665
I can get my half done in my spare time.

370
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:07,205
Amen.

371
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:10,019
I'm gonna try to have
faith in you, Rusty.

372
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,043
Good luck, man.

373
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,414
I'm not homeless!

374
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,836
Hey, you know, not that I'm not
enjoying your company,

375
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,005
Ashleigh, but when are you done?

376
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,546
'Cause I was thinking
we could grab dinner

377
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,856
and we'd go back to my house.

378
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:34,408
We still have one girl left.

379
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,383
Okay. Who?

380
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,032
Rebecca Logan.

381
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:47,447
I think I need another lemon drop.

382
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:12,217
- Case, I didn't see you down there.
- Heading out?

383
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:14,171
Another night of debauchery
with the pledges.

384
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,096
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

385
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,241
I don't know exactly
what you guys do over there.

386
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:23,198
- You never heard about the goats?
- Just go easy on Rusty, okay?

387
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:25,543
He's new to all this, I wanna
make sure he's not going

388
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,199
to be scarred for life.

389
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,470
Did you really come down here
to talk to me about Rusty?

390
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:32,888
Whom until last week didn't exist?

391
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,873
My relationship with Rusty
has changed since last week.

392
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,508
Seems like a lot of relationships
changed last week.

393
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,126
Here you go.

394
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,476
- You don't have to buy me a drink.
- It's okay, I didn't.

395
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:48,862
I put it on your tab.

396
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:53,101
What's taking so long over here?

397
00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:55,165
I was just not buying
your girlfriend a drink.

398
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:57,908
Don't you have your own girlfriend
to not buy drinks for?

399
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:00,073
It's just not as fun, I guess.

400
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:10,271
This is ridiculous.

401
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:13,015
Can we be mature and just say
what we're all thinking?

402
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:18,363
How the hell could they
cancel Gilmore Girls?

403
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,838
Unclench, Evs. Casey and I were just
talking about the pledges.

404
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,748
We saw the work you guys did on Rusty.

405
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:27,788
Let me ask you. What exactly is the
point of that form of hazing?

406
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:31,529
- Our own amusement.
- Well, you're doing them a lot of good.

407
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,961
We don't have to train our pledges.
They already rock.

408
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,659
Are you implying that your pledges
are better than our pledges?

409
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,042
You're right. I'm sorry. Let me clarify.

410
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,047
Our pledges could kick
your pledges' asses any day.

411
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:45,363
- Is that a challenge?
- Guys, come on.

412
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,428
What kind of competion
are we talking about here?

413
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,329
Who's got the most J. Crew V-Necks?

414
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,340
Wait, you might have us there.

415
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:53,339
- We could kick your ass at anything.
- Really?

416
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,570
Yeah, we could.

417
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,849
Excuse us.

418
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,322
- Rebecca's not coming.
- She quit?

419
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,056
She got busted by campus security

420
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:03,025
for sneaking into the men's faculty
locker room.

421
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,055
Are we in trouble?

422
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:17,256
Okay, guys, tonight's
new rite of passage

423
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:20,431
will begin shortly. We're just waiting
on the sensel, who's...

424
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,041
Stop everything!

425
00:20:23,544 --> 00:20:24,628
Nice kimonos.

426
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:26,642
Big news.

427
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:29,861
Our pledges have been challenged
by the nimrods over at Omega Chi

428
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,446
- We're gonna destroy 'em!
- What's the game?

429
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:33,649
Something fair.

430
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:37,327
Something classic.
And old... family favorite.

431
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,046
Beer pong.

432
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:42,151
Here tomorrow night.

433
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,686
Tomorrow night? What if we have
school work to do?

434
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:47,839
Spitter, that's impossible. Did you
not hear a word of what I just said?

435
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,801
It's against the Omega Kais!

436
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,622
Besides, it's the first week of school.
It's always easy.

437
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,461
You could probably just sit
this one out, Spitter.

438
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,290
I mean, maybe this isn't
your kind of thing.

439
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:04,336
Do what you gotta do, Russ.

440
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,742
Case, Frannie is calling an emergency
meeting about Rebecca.

441
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,795
Now?

442
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:18,170
You think she knows anything
about the list Rebecca had?

443
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:20,628
- I guess we're about to find out.
- I'll meet you in there.

444
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:22,840
Case, can I talk to you?

445
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,155
- Now is like the absolute worst time.
- Please, just two minutes.

446
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,307
Okay, go, hurry.

447
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:31,015
- I've got this scheduling issue.
- Seriously?

448
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:34,858
- Buy a calendar. Done.
- But tonight the Kappa Taus

449
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:37,029
are hosting this beer pong event,

450
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:39,533
which I'm not really sure what that is.

451
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,696
Classy choice, Cappie.

452
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:43,141
I also have to finish
this really hard problem set

453
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,981
in order to stay in this physics class.

454
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:47,439
Easy. Drop the class.
And you're welcome.

455
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:49,763
I can't just drop the class,
case, it's a prequisite.

456
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:52,244
Then skip beer pong,
but know it's a lot of fun.

457
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,338
I can't skip. I'm just a pledge.

458
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,739
How do you juggle school
and your sorority stuff?

459
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:00,793
I don't take honors engineering classes.

460
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:02,055
I really need to go.

461
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,246
That's all you got for me?

462
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:07,322
You knew joining a fraternity
wasn't gonna be easy.

463
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,880
You're in this super hard,
super brainiac program

464
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:11,342
that's gonna take up a lot of time.

465
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,451
But being in a fraternity
takes time too.

466
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,442
So you have to make a choice.

467
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:17,908
Choices are good.

468
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,311
Choices make you pick a path

469
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:21,835
- and stay the course.
- It's not fair. Why can't I do both?

470
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,475
Well, if you could, you wouldn't
be here right now.

471
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:28,767
This is one reason among many why
guys like you aren't in fraternities.

472
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:30,997
But the world isn't
black and white, remember?

473
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:32,951
I can be gray.

474
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,227
I can be an amalgam.

475
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:36,938
Why does every conversation we have
turn into a vocab test?

476
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:39,439
Forget it.

477
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,290
Be realistic, Russ.

478
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:42,588
Be my sister, Case.

479
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:48,000
Panhellenic has called five times

480
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:50,173
wanting to know how
we're gonna handle the situation.

481
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:52,532
They're implying hazing.
What am I supposed to tell them?

482
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:53,646
She's on drugs?

483
00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:56,782
What was she doing in there?

484
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:59,109
If this were

485
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,122
any other girl on campus,
no one would care.

486
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,915
It's just because she's Rebecca Logan.

487
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:06,280
Maybe it's a good thing
this happened for us now.

488
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,523
What do you mean?

489
00:23:07,672 --> 00:23:11,346
Well, what she brings to this
sorority in notoriety pales in comparison

490
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:13,664
to all we're gonna have to
do to manage our reputation.

491
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:15,179
She lives under a microscope.

492
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,320
Which means we're gonna live
under a microscope too.

493
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,060
And she's covered in bacteria.

494
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:21,629
I mean,

495
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:24,881
if she messes up again, then our name's
gonna be right alongside hers.

496
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:27,765
- It might be best...
- Excuse me,

497
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:29,402
may I have a moment of your time?

498
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,516
This is a closed meeting, Rebecca.

499
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,664
- Officers only.
- This will just take a second.

500
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:42,143
I made a huge mistake.

501
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,406
I went way overboard
with the scavenger hunt.

502
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,106
I was just trying
to make you proud, Frannie.

503
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:49,980
Make me proud?

504
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:53,955
You don't have to prove
anything to me, or anyone here.

505
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,428
We all love you.

506
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:58,191
We still have to answer to
Panhellenic and the university.

507
00:23:58,293 --> 00:23:59,418
It's taken care of.

508
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:01,189
Taken care of?

509
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:03,425
My father became involved.

510
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:05,938
He spoke with the provost
and a rep at Panhellenic

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,297
and suggested that it would be in
everyone's best interest

512
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:10,796
if this all just went away, so it has.

513
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:14,805
I won't allow my poor judgment
to affect my sisters.

514
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:17,529
You are amazing.

515
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:20,597
And for all the trouble
I've caused you all,

516
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:23,063
my father has offered us
his private jet for us to use

517
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:25,223
- any time we want it.
- Oh, my god, my god!

518
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,126
We got a jet!

519
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,325
- Is it a G5?
- Yes, actually it is. How did you know?

520
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:42,996
Hey, study buddy.

521
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:44,633
You done yet?

522
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,272
- Just about.
- Where you headed?

523
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:51,141
I'm really kind of

524
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,542
unfocused in here,

525
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:59,430
you know. So I'm gonna go to the library
to work on the problem set

526
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:01,621
for physics.

527
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,833
When are you gonna be done? Cause
I'm already done. I finished it about

528
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,326
1:30 this afternoon.

529
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:08,098
I mean, it was tough,
but I got through it.

530
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:10,364
And I was able to teach myself
a lot of stuff that's...

531
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:12,489
That's pretty advanced.

532
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:14,596
I'll definitely have my half.

533
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:16,644
Hey, I can come with you and help.

534
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,429
- I'm really smart.
- I know you are, Dale. But...

535
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:23,367
I want to do my part, you know?

536
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:27,438
- I'll see you.
- Hey, Rusty?

537
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:30,457
- Yeah?
- Aren't you forgetting something?

538
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,655
- Rusty?
- Yeah?

539
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:43,177
You forgot your backpack.

540
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:46,635
Right.

541
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:49,771
<i>Gentlemen...

542
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,451
And Omega Kais...

543
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,385
Welcome to the first annual
Kappa Tau/Omega Kai pledge tourney.

544
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:02,834
All right, we got
nine pledges on each side.

545
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,943
House with the highest
number of wins... Wins.

546
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:07,437
Any questions?

547
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:12,018
How do you play?

548
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,252
You know, we could drop one of our guys

549
00:26:15,361 --> 00:26:16,366
to make it an even game.

550
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:19,340
It's actually a great question, Spitter.

551
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:23,195
Beer pong rules and regulations
differ all over the world.

552
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:26,673
Adhering to the north american
beer pong association regulations,

553
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:29,108
two players square off
on their respective sides,

554
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:31,154
each taking a turn
hitting a ping pong ball

555
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:34,334
across a table with the aim
of making their ball land

556
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:38,137
in one of several cups of beer.
Now if he... Or she...

557
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,840
Is successful, then that opponent
must drink that cup of beer.

558
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,595
The player who drinks
all the cups loses.

559
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,016
Now I personally subscribe
to the notion though that

560
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:50,923
everyone wins in this game.
So let's do it. Let the games begin!

561
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,027
I guess this is gonna be the
drawback of being in different houses.

562
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:05,032
It's too bad you didn't come to
Omega Kai, but I get it.

563
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:06,983
The whole Evan thing.

564
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,868
There's no reason
we still can't be friends.

565
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:13,991
I mean, just because our houses
are in competition doesn't mean...

566
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:16,309
Doesn't mean we have to be, right?

567
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,927
So what number... I'm nine.

568
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:34,509
So... Good news.

569
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:36,549
Everything has been smoothed over

570
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,570
- completely.
- Great.

571
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:40,590
There's one thing though.

572
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:42,662
Rebecca wants your room.

573
00:27:43,544 --> 00:27:44,826
How did you break the bad news?

574
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,775
Explain something to me.

575
00:27:46,877 --> 00:27:48,723
Why Rebecca Logan given
so many hand things

576
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:49,975
to find on the scavenger hunt?

577
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:52,416
- She wasn't.
- "Shirtless faculty member"?

578
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:53,698
"Middle-aged panther"?

579
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:55,195
- Win is...
- And the point is...

580
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:57,185
you're still freaked out about
the Evan thing,

581
00:27:57,267 --> 00:27:58,293
and you lost control.

582
00:27:58,406 --> 00:28:00,334
You told me you could handle it,
and you didn't.

583
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:02,386
Rebecca's getting the room.

584
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,493
Hey, Calvin. What's your number?

585
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:11,677
Home or cell?

586
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:13,441
No, I mean your position.

587
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:16,600
- What number did you draw?
- Nine.

588
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:19,584
So do you wanna grab some beers
after this or something?

589
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:21,738
Beers?

590
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:23,728
Sure!

591
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:30,212
All right, next up!

592
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:32,243
- Number nine.
- And game point!

593
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:37,187
Spitter... You're up.

594
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,709
May the best man win?

595
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,621
- Best man win.
- All right.

596
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,298
Don't choke.

597
00:28:52,026 --> 00:28:53,113
How you feeling? You good?

598
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:55,329
I want you to relax, all right?

599
00:28:56,857 --> 00:28:58,908
There are these moments in life

600
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,923
when you are confronted
with something that you think

601
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:03,113
is monumental,

602
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:06,231
but 10, 20 years down the road
you'll look back and you'll laugh.

603
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:10,473
This is not one of those moments.

604
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:13,325
This is the most important thing
that could ever happen to you

605
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:16,319
or any of us in this entire world.

606
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:19,712
Good luck. Don't lose.

607
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:21,128
<i>All right, score's tied.

608
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,466
The winner of this game
will determine which pledges rock

609
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:24,717
and which pledges suck.

610
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:40,948
It's just kind of like ping pong.

611
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,246
I was champion five years
in a row in the Eagle Scouts.

612
00:29:44,712 --> 00:29:45,943
You were in the Eagle Scouts.

613
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:24,886
- Good game, Cal.
- The best won man, Cal.

614
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,251
You guys should've picked
naked ice melting.

615
00:30:29,902 --> 00:30:32,179
Is that supposed to be
a secret Omega Kai thing?

616
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:36,015
Hope you're ready
to do some pushups, pledge.

617
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:37,102
You bet...

618
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:45,156
You kicked ass, man.

619
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:46,572
It was...

620
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:49,280
Hell, yeah!

621
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:54,343
<i>Spitter! Spitter! Spitter!

622
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:03,134
2:00 a.m.! I gotta go! Put me down.

623
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:15,884
I'm up! You didn't finish?

624
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:18,766
It's due in ten minutes.
You're nowhere near finished.

625
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:20,181
I'll turn in what we have.

626
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:22,662
No, what we have can't compete with
what the other kids have,

627
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:24,038
because they take this seriously.

628
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:25,412
I prayed to God.

629
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:27,545
Why would he forsake me?

630
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:31,474
Okay, this class is a prerequisite
that's only offered in the fall.

631
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:34,674
Which means if we don't take it now
we can't take it until next year.

632
00:31:34,817 --> 00:31:37,176
Which means we can't start
our core classes for two years.

633
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:39,453
Which means I can't finish
undergrad till 2012.

634
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:41,637
Which means I can't finish
grad school until 2015...

635
00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:44,037
- Dale, I'm sorry.
- No, no, you've ruined my future.

636
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,129
And my kids' future
and my grandkids' future.

637
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:48,098
You've disrupted
the space-time continuum.

638
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:50,857
And you gotta fix it. You gotta build
a time machine right now.

639
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:53,093
- We gotta build a time machine...
- Dale, stop.

640
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:54,180
Stop!

641
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,385
I'll fix this.

642
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:57,534
I promise.

643
00:31:57,637 --> 00:31:59,319
Your grandkids will be fine.

644
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:00,508
I'll fix this.

645
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:04,479
This beyond sucks.

646
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:05,915
Is this yours or mine?

647
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:08,192
Does it matter? With the space
in that crappy room

648
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:10,366
all our stuff is gonna be
thrown together anyway.

649
00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:18,948
could you give me better ETA on when
you're gonna be completely out of here?

650
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:21,060
I scheduled some movers
to be here at 4:00,

651
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:22,641
but guess that's not gonna happen.

652
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:26,198
But don't worry. I want you all
to take your time and let me know

653
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:28,681
when this afternoon you're gonna have
your stuff out of here.

654
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,815
Thanks.

655
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,102
That's it. Screw this.

656
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:41,808
We gotta talk.

657
00:32:43,572 --> 00:32:45,295
I've tried to be cool about this.

658
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:46,649
I've tried not to get upset.

659
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,027
But this is me upset.

660
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:49,976
I'm officially very upset.

661
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:52,202
I know Rebecca's great for us.

662
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:54,499
Our alums love the idea of her.
She gives us a jet.

663
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:56,899
But I can't take it anymore.

664
00:32:57,084 --> 00:32:58,704
She slept with my boyfriend.

665
00:32:58,817 --> 00:33:01,156
I took him back. Now she's stealing
my room.

666
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:02,879
And all I've been is nice to her.

667
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:06,469
I know, except for the whole
shirtless faculty member thing, which

668
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,674
we've already discussed was a mistake
and we're past.

669
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:10,909
I've given you two years of dedication,

670
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,797
and she's given me two weeks of hell.

671
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:14,930
So you have to choose.

672
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,325
Her or me.

673
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:20,166
Is this what friends do, Casey?

674
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:21,971
Give each other ultimatums?

675
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:24,207
I'm sorry, Frannie, but I don't know
what else to do.

676
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,017
Let me consider this.

677
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:29,786
On the one hand, we have you...

678
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,478
Who put this entire sorority in danger
by hazing Rebecca.

679
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,934
I'd not think she'd finish the list.

680
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,656
We could've been on probation, or worse,

681
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,154
made an example of and suspended.

682
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:41,343
You put yourself and your petty squabble
with Rebecca before the sorority.

683
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:43,518
Well, when you say it like that
it sounds really bad.

684
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,851
And on other hand,

685
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,431
I have a senator's daughter and a jet.

686
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:48,682
- Frannie...
- Look...

687
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,047
The best thing
I can do for you right now is...

688
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:54,385
forget this conversation ever happened.

689
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:56,334
Because trust me.

690
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:58,701
You don't want me choose.

691
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,444
Can I talk to you?

692
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,696
Sure, what is it, buddy?

693
00:34:09,737 --> 00:34:11,788
Can you do me a favor
and crouch down on all fours?

694
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:22,652
I have to quit the fraternity.

695
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:26,776
- I'm almost done.
- No, I mean, I really have to quit.

696
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:29,678
I can't manage Kappa Tau
and engineering.

697
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:31,914
I was supposed to turn in
this physics problem set,

698
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:34,006
but I didn't because of last night.

699
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:35,689
Now I missed the deadline this morning.

700
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:38,365
I messed up my roommate because we were
working on it together.

701
00:34:38,714 --> 00:34:41,237
He's mad at me, and he won't even
talk to me now...

702
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,042
School comes first.

703
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,931
So I can have the successful,
professional future.

704
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:53,156
No, so you won't get kicked out
and you can stay here forever.

705
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:56,623
You know you could've skipped
beer pong last night, right?

706
00:34:56,718 --> 00:34:58,729
But I wanted to make
my pledge brothers like me.

707
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,067
You belong there.

708
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:04,123
But it's too late.

709
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:05,231
It's never too late.

710
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:07,446
You didn't ask any of us for help.

711
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:09,184
Now go finish that test.

712
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:11,461
You're not the first Kappa Tau
who's missed a deadline.

713
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:19,656
Don't tell me that's out of order.

714
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,887
Yep, sorry.

715
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,076
Gotta take the stairs.

716
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:29,220
I have to get to the parking lot.

717
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,799
No can do.

718
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:32,296
Better go out that door and around.

719
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:36,563
Let's get this right, guys.

720
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,142
This is love tap 23.

721
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:40,296
Love tap 23. Break!

722
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:43,902
<i>18, 24!

723
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,995
18, 24!

724
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:47,697
Hike!

725
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:02,344
You damn frat boys,
you almost killed me!

726
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,415
What are your names?

727
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:04,856
What fraternity are you with?

728
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,435
- But, sir, we were just...
- Names!

729
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,575
We're the Omega Kais.

730
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,298
My name is Evan Chambers.

731
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:13,677
And you're kind of being a pansy
about all of this.

732
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,945
Don't look back.

733
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,584
I can't believe this is it.

734
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:34,942
I'm gonna miss this room so much.

735
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:37,014
Remember when we first moved in?

736
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:40,871
Three weeks ago? We were just
down the hall last semester.

737
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,515
It's sad.

738
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,955
Is that...

739
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:54,514
Oh, my god!

740
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,586
- That's disgusting.
- What is it?

741
00:36:57,981 --> 00:36:59,909
- Who sent it?
- I bet it's from Rebecca.

742
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:01,407
Skank monster pulled a paris.

743
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,145
She looks a little busy
to be filming it herself.

744
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:05,273
She didn't so this.

745
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:08,350
Someone else is holding the camera,
and peeking in on quite a show.

746
00:37:08,412 --> 00:37:10,196
- Evan looks really...
- Ash!

747
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:11,653
Sorry, I'll delete it.

748
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:12,816
No, wait.

749
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:18,457
Could I ask you for a favor?

750
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,857
I have a lot of stuff Frannie wanted me
to finish in here.

751
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,293
Well, when you're done in here,

752
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:24,088
you can get your stuff out of my room.

753
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:26,180
You mean my room.

754
00:37:26,816 --> 00:37:29,011
I just got an interesting text message.

755
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:30,611
Weight Watchers going mobile?

756
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,055
- Where did you get that?
- What's more important is

757
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:41,969
where it's going. I personally think
it'll look great on the internet.

758
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:44,366
- You're blackmailing me?
- No, I'm...

759
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,505
I guess I am. This is my first time.

760
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,746
This obviously wasn't your first time.

761
00:37:51,648 --> 00:37:53,761
I took this psych class
my freshman year,

762
00:37:53,802 --> 00:37:54,807
and I'm willing to bet

763
00:37:54,848 --> 00:37:55,853
you didn't get attention

764
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:56,929
from your dad growing up.

765
00:37:57,535 --> 00:37:58,909
Want to get his attention now?

766
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:00,643
Isn't he like a hardcore, conservative,

767
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,833
family values man?

768
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,109
How's it going in here?

769
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,166
I gotta say, I think Rebecca and I
just had a major breakthrough.

770
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,735
Wouldn't you say?

771
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:11,237
We're great.

772
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:14,745
Tell frannie about the room.

773
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:19,762
I've decided,
in the spirit of sisterhood...

774
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:22,120
that I'm going to take the smaller room.

775
00:38:23,372 --> 00:38:25,895
And I haven't told either of you
the best part.

776
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,562
You haven't?

777
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,544
I've decided that I'm going to be
Rebecca's big sis.

778
00:38:37,355 --> 00:38:38,360
Thank God!

779
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:40,319
I knew you two would work it out.

780
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:48,862
You really want to start this?

781
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,134
It's already started.

782
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:51,611
Get your crap out of my room,

783
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:52,719
little sis.

784
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:02,447
This is pointless.

785
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:04,201
Trust me, it's all taken care of.

786
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:05,432
Am I gonna go to jail?

787
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:09,380
I'm not going to grade these.

788
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:15,780
Welcome back.

789
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,412
Looks like everyone has a seat,

790
00:39:17,473 --> 00:39:19,258
so the problem set served its purpose.

791
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:21,965
30 of you dropped the class
as soon as the tests were distributed.

792
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:23,668
Is it abusive?

793
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:24,940
Probably.

794
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:26,642
This isn't high school.

795
00:39:26,957 --> 00:39:29,439
I'm not here to coddle you
or inspire you.

796
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,511
I'm here to prepare you
for some harsh realities.

797
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:33,623
No one's going to help you through life.

798
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:35,429
So you hazed us.

799
00:39:40,063 --> 00:39:41,437
Let's start with the basics.

800
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:44,001
The kinetic theory of gases.

801
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,312
It's open.

802
00:39:57,004 --> 00:39:58,009
Come on in.

803
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:00,645
I can't believe you're in my dorm room.

804
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:03,742
And I can't believe you have
a confederate flag hanging on your wall.

805
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:06,009
Where are you reading all spiffied up?

806
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:09,189
Big brother ceremony tonight
at the house.

807
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:12,279
How did your problem set go?

808
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:16,208
All worked out. I'm gonna do both.

809
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,870
I'm sorry, Russ.

810
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:26,333
I have some juggling issues of my own.

811
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,723
This world's new for you too.

812
00:40:30,866 --> 00:40:31,872
Which one?

813
00:40:32,446 --> 00:40:33,451
Us.

814
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,854
I know.

815
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:39,998
And I've already started.

816
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:41,270
I can be...

817
00:40:41,926 --> 00:40:43,157
a ZBZ sister,

818
00:40:43,506 --> 00:40:44,859
as well as your sister.

819
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:46,962
I can be an...

820
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:48,234
amalgam.

821
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:50,532
Like you even know what that is.

822
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:55,096
Any blending or mixture of mercury
with another metal or with alloy.

823
00:40:56,552 --> 00:40:58,337
Like polymer science is that hard.

824
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,101
All right?
