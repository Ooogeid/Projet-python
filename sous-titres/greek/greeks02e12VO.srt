1
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:01,397
All right,
let's say I'm with an awesome rushee,

2
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:03,231
someone I could totally
see in the house.

3
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,754
While talking to her,
I put up one finger behind my back.

4
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,352
- What does that mean? Betsy?
- Immediate backup!

5
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,943
Good. Three fingers. Reagan?

6
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,070
- Legacy?
- Fingers crossed. Holly?

7
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,573
- A waste of time!
- I love all our hand signals.

8
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:17,952
I feel like all those deaf people
that work at the stock exchange!

9
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,278
And there's a new hand
signal this year.

10
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:24,077
Devil horns are for when
you meet a rushee

11
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:27,105
interested in Frannie's new sorority,
Iota Kappa Iota.

12
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,893
We'll be competing with them
for the same type of girls this rush

13
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:36,325
and since the Ickies have
yet to join Panhellenic,

14
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:38,845
they don't have to follow the rules,
but we do.

15
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,959
It's against the rules for us to
bad-mouth another sorority during rush.

16
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,845
So try and be subtle when you do.

17
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,858
What do we say if a rushee asks
about Frannie taking half of the house?

18
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:53,278
Or that dues might go up
if we don't get at least 25 new pledges?

19
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:57,958
Ladies, ladies.

20
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,327
We have a reputation to uphold.

21
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:01,579
Lie.

22
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:04,682
OK, so tonight is round Robins.

23
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,629
We don't have much time with each
group of rushees coming through,

24
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,967
so study your Facebooks!

25
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,964
Then tomorrow night is skit night,

26
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,749
and we've decided to do
our fashion week skit again,

27
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:17,052
since it was such a big hit
with the girls last year.

28
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,680
And because we get to dress up
like supermodels. I call Gisele!

29
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:22,659
But don't forget...

30
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:26,004
Skit night is the last impression
we get to make,

31
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,932
so let's make it awesome!

32
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:33,911
We're on.

33
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:41,802
Isn't this awesome?
Our first meeting as actives.

34
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:45,041
Finally we get to see how it
all works behind the curtain.

35
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,175
We get to be the guys involved
in choosing

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,558
- the next generation of Kappa Tau.
- And we get to haze'em.

37
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:52,235
I got so much pent-up aggression.

38
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,421
All right, let's get started!

39
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,047
It's a new year.
A fresh start.

40
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,646
And a fresh crop
of freshman girls...

41
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:06,656
OK, first topic of discussion:
spring break.

42
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,601
Now, myrtle beach was fun,
but this year I'm thinking mykonos.

43
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:11,392
Does anyone have a trust fund?

44
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,687
Spitter, you sly dog,
you've been holding out on us!

45
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:19,236
What about rush?

46
00:03:19,454 --> 00:03:21,893
Isn't that a little more
pressing than spring break?

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,789
I mean, it starts tomorrow.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,131
Rush! Of course.

49
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,948
Thank you for reminding me.
I completely forgot.

50
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:32,545
- Rush chair wade, what's our plan?
- I'm rush chair again?

51
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,549
Right. We also forgot to hold elections.
Dibs on president!

52
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,384
- Social chair!
- I said it first!

53
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,343
Jinx!

54
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,467
All right, I have a plan. Since no one
died, flunked out, or graduated,

55
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,188
I decree that all officers
get a second term.

56
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,442
Any objections?
Problem solved! Moving on!

57
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:59,662
OK, second-term rush chair wade,
what's our rush strategy?

58
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,474
To get new pledges.

59
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:03,390
Brilliant! How do we do that?

60
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,792
By throwing our top secret
rush party.

61
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,830
Sounds like a plan!
All right!

62
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,943
Wait, that's it?
That's all you guys do for rush?

63
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,756
Shouldn't we get out there
and recruit?

64
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:15,808
- Sounds like work.
- The guys who belong at KT

65
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,048
find KT. It's something
I like to call

66
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,593
"karmic synergy."

67
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:27,599
Sounds fancy.

68
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:30,978
But what if we were
a little more proactive?

69
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,962
Look, it's not that we don't want
to work to find new recruits,

70
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,038
but by working,
we're working against karmic synergy...

71
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,323
which benefits no one.
So the only solution

72
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,648
is to throw a party
and let karmic synergy...

73
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:51,242
The only solution is to throw
a party and let karmic synergy...

74
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,373
work for us.

75
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:58,369
Now, as for the party,
Spitter, you get the ice.

76
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:01,484
Pickle, you're on puke patrol.
I'm very sorry.

77
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:04,240
There's a mop and a bag
of sawdust in the back hall closet.

78
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:06,130
I suggest you breathe
through your mouth.

79
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:08,594
And where's Gonzo?

80
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,268
Cap, we're actives now.

81
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,939
Not exactly. You're what
we like to call post-pledges.

82
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:19,346
And until we have new pledges, you're
still the low men on the KT totem pole.

83
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:20,923
Sorry.

84
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,612
All right, back to spring break.

85
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:26,323
Now, mykonos.
Who knows where it's at?

86
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:29,875
Anyone?

87
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,289
- Canada.
- Africa.

[SeriesSub.com]

91
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:49,415
Over here.

92
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,891
Were you followed?

93
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,966
And is this really necessary?
We're spying on Frannie, not France.

94
00:05:57,817 --> 00:06:00,109
Frannie's been super paranoid
after "the lake incident".

95
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,651
I can't risk blowing my cover.

96
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,612
So what tricks does Frannie
have up her sleeve for rush?

97
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:08,650
All I know is she's not planning
on abiding by panhellenic's rules.

98
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:12,997
She's planning a party after skit night,
with alcohol and Omega Chis.

99
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,207
That is so not fair.
She's using booze and boys?

100
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:17,835
And so obvious.

101
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:20,573
Maybe you can tell us something
we don't already know?

102
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,269
Does that crazy old
lady still live there?

103
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:25,206
Maybe you can get her
to sabotage the party,

104
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,011
like come downstairs naked
without her dentures or something.

105
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,756
Frannie's taken care of Joan.

106
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,433
Did Frannie kill her?
'cause that would help us so much.

107
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:36,635
No, she bought her a case
of Gin and locked her upstairs.

108
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:39,464
She's thought of everything
and sharing nothing.

109
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,213
I think it's time for a new plan:

110
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:44,030
I'm thinking I befriend the rushees,
then pull Ajerry Maguire,

111
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,655
announcing my departure
and taking them back with me to ZBZ.

112
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,875
Unfortunately, all that plan
got Jerry Maguire was a goldfish

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,201
and Renee Zellweger,
neither of which we want.

114
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,415
So we need intel on what
Frannie's doing to attract girls

115
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,922
and who she's focusing on,
then we can block her if we have to.

116
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:02,671
- Stick to the original plan.
- But my plan's better.

117
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,716
No, mine is. The problem is
you need to be more proactive.

118
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,469
Or maybe the problem is
you're a control freak who just...?

119
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,859
Maybe she can do both?

120
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:14,266
Coalition of the willing!

121
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:23,468
She's good.

122
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,848
Look at all these clubs
recruiting freshmen.

123
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:31,720
We should do something like this.

124
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:35,744
Fraternities don't set up booths
in the quad for fraternity rush.

125
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,883
We'd look like total losers.

126
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:40,918
Or we'd look like total winners
because we care so much.

127
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,312
No. That definitely wouldn't happen.

128
00:07:43,574 --> 00:07:46,794
Relax, we have karmic synergy
working for us.

129
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,675
Heads up!

130
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:54,056
It was close.

131
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:56,600
How's it going?

132
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,537
It's all good. Haven't seen you
since the bus ride back from the lake.

133
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:01,424
That speech you made,
you were awesome!

134
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm sorry.
I haven't thrown in a while.

135
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,236
I'm gonna head to practice.
You need to work on that spiral.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,155
So Andy's pretty cool?

137
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,450
- I guess.
- Did he say anything about me?

138
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,579
- Do you have a crush on him?
- No, I think I might want to rush him.

139
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,184
- I have a rush crush.
- Ah, OK.

140
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:23,544
You should know
that Omega Chi is all over him.

141
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,547
He's from old East Coast money,
star student athlete...

142
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,800
He's the number one rush recruit at CRU,
and Evan wants him bad.

143
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:31,915
I don't mean to step
on your toes or anything,

144
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,939
- you're friends from high school...
- I just want Andy to end up

145
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,515
where he's gonna be the happiest,

146
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:39,476
- which might be Omega Chi.
- Or it might be Kappa Tau.

147
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:44,314
He did say he had fun with you guys
coming back from Canyon Lake.

148
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:47,109
So he did say something about me
after the lake!

149
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:50,206
I'm sure he'll call.

150
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:59,609
Sorry!
Just testing out the new cleaver.

151
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:06,761
No worries.

152
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,755
Thanks, bro.

153
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:17,154
- I thought I was in charge of ice.
- You are, my little ice princess.

154
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,725
And when you're queen,
you'll be in charge of the ice luge.

155
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,686
Guess what, Cap?
I think I experienced karmic synergy.

156
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:25,606
You eat the brownies in the fridge?
Because those were mine.

157
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,700
No, I was on campus

158
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:30,903
and this football
came flying at my head

159
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,981
and I closed my eyes and this guy
just reached out and grabbed it,

160
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,898
saving me from a broken nose,

161
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:37,367
or worse.

162
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:39,059
Guess who it was?

163
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:40,564
That guy Andy.

164
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:43,749
- You met him on the bus.
- The football guy?

165
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:46,752
The guy who came to the lake
with the Omega Chis?

166
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,881
Evan wants him real bad,
but I think he's interested in the KT.

167
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,383
Great.

168
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,735
If he's rushing, he'll stop by the house
with the other rushees

169
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,854
and karmic synergy will work it out.

170
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,349
But Cap, I keep running into him.

171
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,936
On the bus, the quad.

172
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,341
If that's not karmic synergy,
what is it?

173
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,471
Coincidence.

174
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:10,192
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have ice to attend to and so do you.

175
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:23,622
Everyone spread out
to make us look bigger!

176
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,890
And don't forget
to use your hand signals!

177
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,583
Betsy, stop eating the mint Milanos,
those are for the rushees!

178
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,212
Finally some intel from Rebecca.

179
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,376
She entered rush late,
so she's not in the facebook.

180
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,442
Her name is Maya Stewart.

181
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,840
As in Martha Stewart's niece.

182
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,177
I read The Martha Blog every day.
I'm addicted.

183
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:43,713
A girl like this
could raise our profile during rush.

184
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:46,252
Not to mention be
an asset to the house.

185
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:48,772
And Martha might visit
with wedding and cooking

186
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:50,323
and traveling tips!

187
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,255
Easy, Ash, we have to play it cool.

188
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,487
We  have to hit her
with everything we've got.

189
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:01,827
You four are to not let this girl out
of your sight, do you understand?

190
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:04,277
Are you sure you want
the four of us on one girl?

191
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,306
The rushees already
outnumber us as it is.

192
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:09,484
The rest of the girls are just
gonna have to pick up the slack!

193
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:10,652
OK, sure.

194
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:17,379
Welcome to Zeta Beta Zeta!

195
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:20,940
OK, guys, come on in.

196
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,738
- There you go.
- Have fun.

197
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:24,520
There she is. Go Go!

198
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:49,249
- Maya Stewart better be worth it.
- Thanksgivings at Martha's?

199
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:54,311
I'm Ashleigh,
president of Zeta Beta Zeta.

200
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:55,928
And I'm Casey Cartwright.

201
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:57,341
Nice to meet you!

202
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,310
I thought becoming an active meant
you're automatically one of the guys.

203
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,435
An equal.

204
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,996
But I'm still the one
getting ice for the party.

205
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:15,138
Last night,
some of the guys woke me up at 3:00am

206
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:17,361
and made me get
six cans of whipped cream.

207
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,592
- Did you do it?
- I was half-asleep

208
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:23,089
and already in the checkout line before
I realized I'm not a pledge anymore.

209
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,955
Listen,
I just wanted to say no hard feelings.

210
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,666
No, still hard, Evan.

211
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,588
My feelings,

212
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:38,383
that is. My feelings are still hard.

213
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,158
I gotta go.

214
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,269
Not because of him, I just gotta go.

215
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:58,621
So I was talking to your buddy,
what's his name?

216
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:02,114
- Andy?
- That's right. I need you to step in

217
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:05,230
and really close the deal on him.
I don't want to lose him to Kappa Tool.

218
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:06,660
Give him this bid.

219
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:10,297
You know, maybe you should.

220
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,871
I'm sure it would mean more coming
from the president of the fraternity.

221
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:17,093
You guys went to high school together,
you've got a history.

222
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:19,840
I got somewhere I gotta go.
You're all over this.

223
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,707
... then went in for the lime,

224
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,961
and accidentally spit tequila
all over her face!

225
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,405
Nice move, Spitter.

226
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,353
What do you think
my nickname would be?

227
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:37,563
Hard to say.
It could be anything, really.

228
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:41,313
Why? Are you interested
in possibly getting one?

229
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:44,573
I mean, by pledging Kappa Tau.
They could give you a nickname.

230
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,118
It could be Andy-licious...

231
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,704
or something cooler than that.

232
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,374
Sixty-eight percent isn't terrible.

233
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:04,661
Last year we had a 93 percent acceptance
rate to our Skit Night invitations.

234
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:07,044
I'm responsible
for our first D-plus!

235
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:10,426
If it makes you feel any better,
it's not my first one.

236
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:15,113
We'll get 100 percent of our 68 percent,
which would be better than last year

237
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,983
- and give us a'B'average.
- Right! I'm not worried.

238
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,675
Our Fashion Week skit will kick major
ass, Maya Stewart's going to be there,

239
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,156
making all the other girls
want to be there.

240
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:26,699
Did you hear?

241
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,683
Iota Kappa Iota, 95 percent.

242
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:33,913
- Pretty good for our first rush.
- We got Maya Stewart.

243
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:37,751
- As in Martha Stewart's niece.
- As in, suck on that.

244
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,326
I met her, too.

245
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:43,822
Only I didn't extend her
an invitation.

246
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:46,032
Turns out she's a total fraud.

247
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,220
I hear she got kicked out of rush.

248
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:52,140
Sorry to rain on your rush parade.

249
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,971
Good luck with Skit Night, though.

250
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,887
Does this mean Martha's not coming
to help us plant our own herb garden?

251
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:05,424
How are we supposed to cultivate
basil in this environment?

252
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:06,549
We need her!

253
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:09,389
We need to talk to Rebecca, now.

254
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:17,081
Why hasn't Rebecca texted us back yet?
Maybe Frannie knows.

255
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,198
What if she's torturing
Rebecca in the basement,

256
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:21,822
- trying to make her confess?
- I wouldn't put it past her.

257
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:24,319
Remember when she put that
curling iron up to Amy's neck

258
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:26,174
to find out
who finished off her vodka?

259
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:29,298
It worked. Amy confessed.

260
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:32,676
It was coerced.
We all know it was Betsy.

261
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:37,696
Can we talk?

262
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,595
I'm gonna get the binoculars
and start checking basement windows.

263
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:44,513
I need some rush advice.

264
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,801
Sure, but we had the worst
return ever on our Skit Night invites,

265
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:53,183
- I may not be the one to ask.
- You're all I have at this point.

266
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:55,774
Cappie doesn't want me going
after this rushee

267
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,789
who I know is perfect for Kappa Tau.

268
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,251
Kappa Taus
don't really go after rushees.

269
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:04,036
I know, karmic synergy whatever.

270
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,865
Regardless, if I wanted to,

271
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,830
how can I convince Cappie
that I'm right about this?

272
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:13,513
What is it with you new actives?
You've been one five seconds...

273
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,017
I'm just trying to prove myself.
Why is that such a bad thing?

274
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:22,230
Even as an active,
there's still a hierarchy.

275
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,053
If you really want this guy,

276
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:26,234
you've got to get him
invested in the house.

277
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,487
You got to get a few senior members,
like Cappie,

278
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,581
or whoever, invested in him.

279
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,824
How do I do that?

280
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:34,412
Find common ground.

281
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:37,558
- What's his deal? What are his hobbies?
- He's on the football team.

282
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:40,872
- Number one high school recruit.
- He's the number one football recruit?

283
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:43,179
Every house
on campus will offer him a bid.

284
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:46,224
He'll probably just end up
at Lambda Sig or Omega Chi.

285
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,028
I found Rebecca!

286
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,744
- In the basement?
- No, she texted me.

287
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:52,091
She's ready to meet.

288
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,687
It smells like cat pee in here.

289
00:17:06,136 --> 00:17:07,591
Cat pee and pickles.

290
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,371
What's so urgent that we had
to risk another meeting in person?

291
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:21,961
You gave us bogus intel
on Maya Stewart.

292
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:24,473
- What do you mean?
- She's not Martha Stewart's niece.

293
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:27,420
We put all our focus on her
and lost other girls because of it.

294
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,547
- And that's my fault?
- You're the mole!

295
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,898
We're relying
on your intel to be accurate.

296
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,594
- You're terrible at this.
- Maybe it's a faulty strategy.

297
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,262
Maybe we should pull the plug.

298
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,348
Maybe Frannie's feeding
her bad information.

299
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,183
No way. Frannie totally trusts me.

300
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,937
- How can you be certain?
- Because this morning,

301
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,926
she let me use her hairbrush.

302
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,464
The silver one?

303
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:51,393
She never lets anyone use that.

304
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,907
Not even Casey
when they didn't hate each other.

305
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,116
That brush was from Titanic.
She paid a fortune for it off eBay.

306
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:58,304
I know.

307
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,530
Leo used it to brush Kate's hair
in a deleted scene.

308
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:03,219
I miss young Leo.

309
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:04,344
So do I.

310
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:12,048
Look, I'm not trying
to be a problem.

311
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,883
I'm just trying to prove myself.

312
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:20,884
Fine.

313
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:24,185
Is there anything else
you know that we can use?

314
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:27,428
Anything about Skit Night?
Is her skit better than ours?

315
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:31,109
I'm not sure. She has a skit committee,
sworn to secrecy.

316
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,968
But I did find a bunch
of sailor hats in the hallway closet,

317
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,823
about 50 or so. It must be something
revolving around that.

318
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:40,869
Sailor hats?

319
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,001
She is so good!

320
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:51,106
I can see your leg,

321
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,126
I did not think
you could throw a football.

322
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:08,551
I used to play.
Long time ago.

323
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:12,776
Little League, actually. But I still
love tossing around the old pigskin.

324
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:14,073
Pigskin?

325
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,929
All right,
hit me deep, Archie Manning.

326
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,414
You gotta dive for it!

327
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:28,848
Over here!

328
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,967
I'm sorry, man.
I thought you were calling for it.

329
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:40,261
Dude,
your face is like a ball magnet.

330
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,554
I would've caught it.
I was distracted.

331
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,516
You guys rember Andy, right?

332
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,906
What a coincidence
running into you like this,

333
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:52,182
here on the quad
nearest the Freshmen Dorms.

334
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:53,990
How random.

335
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:57,786
Beaver plays football, too.
He was an all-state defensive lineman,

336
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,156
recruited to play ball here
four years ago.

337
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,242
No kidding.
I didn't see you at training camp.

338
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,369
- I had to drop the team.
- Injury?

339
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:06,830
- Yeah, the...
- Hangover.

340
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,207
I bet you guys have
so much in common.

341
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,836
- He was an all-state cornerback.
- Nice! Defense!

342
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:16,865
No way!

343
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,092
Is that theIron Mancar?

344
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:23,221
Hey, guys!

345
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:26,932
I didn't think the KT's
believed in exercise.

346
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,019
We wanna keep our heart rate up
for when your mom comes in town.

347
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:32,814
Seriously, she's foxy.

348
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,545
- I know!
- You've seen her?

349
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,277
Wanna go for a drive?

350
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,796
I'll see you guys later.

351
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:55,188
He's using the car?
How do we compete with that?

352
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:58,381
- We don't compete with that.
- We could borrow Wade's Miata.

353
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:01,551
Karmic synergy.

354
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:07,974
Wade drives a Miata?

355
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:16,065
Whatever.
Maybe they're sexy sailor hats.

356
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:20,235
Still, compared to Fashion Week?
It doesn't make sense.

357
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,890
Whatever. It is so not our problem.

358
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,449
Our skit is going to kick
her skit's ass.

359
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,863
- Ash, what happened to our skit stuff?
- Maybe someone moved it?

360
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:33,800
Why would someone move it?

361
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,552
I don't know.
I'm trying not to freak out.

362
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:39,877
Frannie stopped by to pick up
the Fashion Week decorations.

363
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:41,590
But what skit are we doing now?

364
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:43,463
You let her take them?

365
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:44,864
Oh, God!

366
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:47,512
She said that she talked to you
about it and she said

367
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,683
that you said that you thought
it would be best for her to have them.

368
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:52,992
Oh, God! Am I in trouble?

369
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,967
I think we all are.

370
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,184
I can't believe
Frannie stole our decorations!

371
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:02,995
- That's so... so...
- Like her?

372
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,184
And Rebecca isn't stupid,
she should've known about this.

373
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:08,534
Is it just me,
or is there something fishy going on?

374
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:22,562
Need to borrow some sugar?

375
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:25,377
We just came by
to wish you luck with Skit Night.

376
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,611
You're doing Fashion Week, too?

377
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:30,180
'Cause we were wondering
what happened to all of our stuff.

378
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:33,017
I believe Fashion Week was my idea.

379
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:34,978
When you were at ZBZ.

380
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,144
Sounds like an intellectual
property dispute.

381
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,191
- Maybe you should call your lawyers.
- We don't have any lawyers.

382
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:44,195
I have some sailor hats you can borrow.
Always wise to have a backup plan.

383
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,743
- What do they want?
- Wish us luck on our skit.

384
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,194
Isn't that nice?

385
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,944
We were also hoping
to speak with Rebecca.

386
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:57,290
We think it was a mistake
for you to leave ZBZ,

387
00:22:57,415 --> 00:22:59,460
and that maybe you should come back.

388
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,047
Sorry, Case, I'm here to stay,
so maybe you should get over it.

389
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:05,360
And then get your roots done.

390
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:15,575
- Your roots are fine.
- Whatever. Let's just go.

391
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,353
We need a new skit.

392
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:29,824
I'm Wade Matthews, Rush Chair.

393
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:31,451
Second term.

394
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:38,750
Come on! I've been nailing that
all night, I swear!

395
00:23:40,397 --> 00:23:42,295
All right.
How many of you know our reputation?

396
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,720
Raise your hands.

397
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:48,879
Wonderful.
Everyone with your hand up, get out.

398
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:52,543
Andy might be in the next group.

399
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:56,770
- Yeah, if he doesn't listen to Wade.
- That'd be pretty KT, huh?

400
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:02,358
If he comes through that door,
maybe we should give him a bid tonight

401
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,108
so we don't lose him to Omega Chi.

402
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,923
You can't lose
if you don't play the game.

403
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:09,113
Did I just make that up?

404
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:11,535
Wait, no. Oscar from Sesame Street.

405
00:24:12,337 --> 00:24:13,735
He's such a grouch.

406
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,494
What do you have against Andy?

407
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:18,831
Nothing. We just don't give early bids.
It's not the KT way.

408
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:21,666
Let the Omega Chis
and the Lambda Sigs kiss his ass.

409
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:25,479
We'll leave it to karmic synergy to see
if Andy walks through that door.

410
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:37,421
Nice. You did it. You were right.

411
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:48,221
Really? Sisterhood
of the Traveling ZBZ Pants?

412
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:49,720
We have to do something.

413
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:51,535
Come on, it could be cute.

414
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,199
I wanted to be fierce!

415
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,908
I wanted to be Heidi Klum again!

416
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,231
Now I have to be
freakin' Blake Lively.

417
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,551
At least you're blonde. How will anyone
know I'm America Ferrera?

418
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:05,669
Don't you think it's weird Frannie stole
the decorations at the exact moment

419
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,422
- we were meeting with Rebecca?
- Or that she didn't text us

420
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,007
when she saw the Fashion Week stuff
in the Icky house?

421
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:13,280
Maybe she just got home.

422
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,728
Maybe.

423
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:18,080
What about the sailor hats?

424
00:25:18,662 --> 00:25:20,354
Frannie's backup plan?

425
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,229
Frannie does like to plan.

426
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,008
Once I saw her calendar.
It's crazy full.

427
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:28,797
And then there was Rebecca's whole,
"I'm just trying to prove myself."

428
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:30,236
What a load of crap.

429
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,601
And don't even
get me started on Maya...

430
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,126
I am tempted to write
a letter to Martha.

431
00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:38,138
Let her prison friends
teach Maya a lesson or two.

432
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:41,873
You know, she never actually
forgave me for kissing Cappie, either.

433
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,712
Whose idea was it for Rebecca
to be the mole in the first place?

434
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:50,715
Rebecca's.

435
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:09,775
My first ice luge!

436
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,903
It makes it so cold going down
into your belly!

437
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:19,379
Andy, come here.
Cappie, you remember Andy, right?

438
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:21,829
- Andy, thanks for coming by.
- Thanks for having me!

439
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,413
Rusty told me KT's throw
the best parties. He was not joking.

440
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,752
Thanks for telling me
to keep my hand down.

441
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:31,797
You told him that?

442
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:37,510
Well, if you think we have cool parties,
you should go check out Omega Chi.

443
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,963
They went indoor skydiving
at their last date night.

444
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:42,767
Have you been to Omega Chi yet?

445
00:26:44,657 --> 00:26:46,740
Indoor skydiving.
How cool is that?

446
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,190
We're heading there next.

447
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:52,628
Great! Listen, I think
you're really gonna like it there.

448
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:01,580
- I'm sorry.
- Nah. It's cool, Rus.

449
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,414
I should probably go.

450
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,797
Why are you the only one
who gets to judge

451
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,563
who's a Kappa Tau and who isn't?

452
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,288
I'm not judging anyone.

453
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:33,919
Like I said before,
it's all karmic synergy.

454
00:27:34,044 --> 00:27:35,937
Don't feel bad
that you can't recognize it yet.

455
00:27:36,062 --> 00:27:39,657
Like "the Force," bowling,
it takes years to master.

456
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,681
- Cut it out, Cap, I'm an active now...
- Post-pledge.

457
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:45,037
Well, in my post-pledge opinion,

458
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:47,495
I think Andy will make
a good Kappa Tau.

459
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,745
- I disagree.
- Why?

460
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,060
- Because.
- But why?

461
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,709
- Because, that's why.
- Stop it.

462
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,212
- Because.
- Because why?

463
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,588
- Why?
- Because!

464
00:27:55,794 --> 00:27:59,323
You told Andy of our reputation, then
by telling him not to raise his hand,

465
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:02,471
you defied a long history
of tradition of karmic synergy.

466
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,313
There's a method to our madness.

467
00:28:04,438 --> 00:28:07,708
It may not be a perfect method,
it may not even be a method,

468
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,681
but it's the way
we do things here at KT.

469
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,440
And you know what?
We're pretty happy with the results.

470
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:15,174
What about my method?

471
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,127
What about what I can offer
to the house?

472
00:28:18,252 --> 00:28:20,085
And what he can offer to the house.

473
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,824
He's a valedictorian.

474
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:23,512
He's a football star.

475
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,850
We don't get guys
because they're gets.

476
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,844
That's an Evan Chambers move.

477
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:30,702
What more do you know about him?

478
00:28:33,256 --> 00:28:34,945
See? Karmic synergy.

479
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:40,862
What if he was meant to be
a Kappa Tau and I screwed it up?

480
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,998
Unfortunately,
that's something we'll never know,

481
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:46,098
along with what hot dogs are made from,
how Smurfs reproduce.

482
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:52,574
And yes, you're almost an active,
but you still have much to learn.

483
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:54,818
And, regardless, I promise to start

484
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,968
treating you more like an equal...

485
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,511
in 12 hours.

486
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:00,728
Why 12 hours?

487
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:05,290
Because then we'll have pledges,
and right now we're out of ice.

488
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:09,063
There you go.
Six bags should do it. Thanks.

489
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:20,074
Isn't it weird how the entire house
can fit into these pants?

490
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,512
It's because we're sisters.

491
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:30,661
Don't you think the pants have
the magic to keep us together?

492
00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:32,895
Right.

493
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:36,611
The pants have the magic
to keep us together as ZBZ sisters

494
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:38,376
for the rest of our lives.

495
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:43,453
Maybe these pants will fit you, too!

496
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:03,475
Hey, man, glad you could make it.

497
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,636
And this is your last stop, right?

498
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,224
Yeah, I think so.

499
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:10,141
And... what's the verdict?

500
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:14,019
To be honest, the one house I was ready
to join doesn't seem to want me.

501
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:18,610
I'm sure there's a lot of houses that
are gonna want you, including Omega Chi.

502
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,485
And... I think
you'd really like it here.

503
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,861
I know I do.

504
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,126
Thanks, Cal.

505
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:38,114
Look, man, no pressure, all right?

506
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:41,213
If you decide to join, I'll see you
at the bid party tomorrow night, OK?

507
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:43,425
Cool, man.

508
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:51,860
He's leaving?

509
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:55,391
You know, we're all headed
to a party at Frannie's new house.

510
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:59,856
- Did he accept the bid?
- Yeah. He's gonna sleep on it.

511
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:01,677
You said this was a done deal.

512
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,837
He's seriously considering
Omega Chi.

513
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,154
I'm not gonna pressure someone
that doesn't wanna be here.

514
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:08,265
I tried to help you out.
I let him drive my car,

515
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,284
I gave you the bid, but you failed.

516
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,509
I failed?

517
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:13,996
You hung out with him for,
like, five minutes.

518
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:16,417
You know his resume,
but you don't even know his name.

519
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,085
Where have you been, Evan?

520
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:34,642
What are you doing out here?

521
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,585
Just heading back to the dorm.
That's a lot of ice.

522
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:39,435
Someone has to get it,

523
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:43,108
and I'm still low man
on the KT totem pole.

524
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,081
Oh, not for long, though, right?

525
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:48,231
You'll have plenty of pledges
to order around soon enough.

526
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,397
How'd things go at Omega Chi?

527
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:55,985
To tell you the truth?

528
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,833
Other than Calvin, I thought
the Omega Chis were pretty shallow.

529
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,919
They're like a Greek kiddie pool.

530
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,088
All they want to do
is talk about football.

531
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:06,472
I don't know.

532
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:09,099
I guess I'm sort of used to being
labeled at this point, you know?

533
00:32:09,224 --> 00:32:11,970
People find out you're a football player
think they've got you figured out.

534
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,474
"He's cool. He's dumb. He parties.
He has tons of sex."

535
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:18,727
Yeah, I have the same problem
as a polymer science major.

536
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,231
OK, not the same problem,

537
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:25,682
but I get labeled, too.

538
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:28,865
Most people don't equate it
with being in the Greek system,

539
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:30,322
you know?

540
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:33,059
Yeah, I do.

541
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:39,163
I don't know, I figured I'd walk
into a house and just know...

542
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,959
this is...

543
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:44,044
where I'm meant to be.

544
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:48,800
And I thought I had,
when I walked into Kappa Tau.

545
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,131
I love that movie!
And the guy who played Kostos?

546
00:32:56,256 --> 00:32:57,891
Oh, my God, so dreamy.

547
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,242
I wouldn't kick him out of bed.

548
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:03,691
This is our favorite house.

549
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,608
You all are so much nicer
than the girls at the IKI house.

550
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,041
We totally are!

551
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:12,448
Especially compared to the super rude
girl over there who was ripping on ZBZ.

552
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:13,823
She was so nasty.

553
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:16,598
Let me guess, was her name Frannie?

554
00:33:16,723 --> 00:33:20,205
She was that senator's daughter.
Something Hogan?

555
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:25,960
Excuse us.

556
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:29,882
Rebecca's unnecessarily bad-mouthing us?
That seals it.

557
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,279
I can't believe
Rebecca manipulated us like this!

558
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:37,820
You know Frannie's loving it.

559
00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:41,852
I can see them toasting each other,
laughing about how they fooled us.

560
00:33:57,178 --> 00:33:59,118
Are you two defecting
to my house or...

561
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:01,830
- crossing the border?
- We're on to you.

562
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,225
We know you're not planning on
coming back to ZBZ.

563
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,223
You've been bad-mouthing ZBZ...

564
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:09,181
If you were actually our mole
and actually trying to help us,

565
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:11,215
why would you be doing that
in front of rushees?

566
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,619
Because Frannie
was standing right next to me,

567
00:34:13,744 --> 00:34:15,134
just like she is right now.

568
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,860
What? You think I didn't know?

569
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,568
Wait. You knew?
And you didn't know she knew?

570
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:24,851
- Which means...
- I figured it out after the lake party.

571
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,730
You're a terrible mole.

572
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,232
See? She thinks so, too.

573
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:31,318
Oh, my God! I'm 19!
I'm not Sydney frickin' Bristow!

574
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,862
What about theTitanicbrush?
You let Rebecca use it.

575
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,080
The real brush
is under lock and key.

576
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,819
That brush was fake,
kind of like your friend

577
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,120
Maya Stewart:

578
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,923
A theater major
who need some quick cash.

579
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:50,281
Oh, God. May I have
your attention, everyone?

580
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,636
I think everyone
has the right to know

581
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:57,761
that apparently ZBZ was so hard-up,

582
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,050
they sent a spy
into my house for rush week!

583
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:04,043
Kind of desperate, don't you think?

584
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,564
And now, I'm sorry,
but on Greek Row, one day you're in,

585
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:10,285
and the next day

586
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:11,692
you're out...

587
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:14,361
and you three are out.

588
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:17,704
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

589
00:35:41,624 --> 00:35:43,899
I guess we kind of humiliated
ourselves in front of...

590
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:46,587
most of this year's rush class, huh?

591
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,710
You did.

592
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,287
I really wanted to trust you.

593
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:01,759
It was just hard,
given our history together.

594
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:08,015
Our history together is exactly what
made me want to prove myself to you.

595
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,423
Despite all our issues,

596
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:13,086
I still haven't forgotten
that you stuck your neck out for me.

597
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:18,509
So how do you think
Frannie figured it out?

598
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,927
After the lake party, she asked me
what room I wanted in the house.

599
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:27,225
I told her I didn't care.

600
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,231
That was a gimme. Everyone knows you're
kinda bitchy about stuff like that.

601
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,524
I know, right?

602
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,849
I wasn't thinking.

603
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:39,736
I really am a terrible mole.

604
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,783
Sorry.

605
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:48,372
I'm sorry I thought
you were a double agent.

606
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:52,459
You really were trying
to prove yourself, weren't you?

607
00:36:57,858 --> 00:36:59,424
I'm sorry about your roots.

608
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:02,004
That's OK,
I know you didn't mean it.

609
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,764
No, I mean, I'm sorry about them.
You could use a little touch-up.

610
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:10,019
Get your own bag.

611
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:14,731
Whatever. At this hour they'll just go
straight to your hips anyway.

612
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:27,882
While we appreciate
you doing double duty on puke patrol

613
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:30,080
and as rushee party pic purveyor,

614
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:32,352
the point is to get their face.

615
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Sorry.

616
00:37:36,726 --> 00:37:38,393
Wasn't meant to be. Next!

617
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,341
All right. Next!

618
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:50,726
I like this guy. He's bald,

619
00:37:50,947 --> 00:37:54,368
we don't have a bald guy in the house.
He started balding at age 12.

620
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,340
Can you imagine the ridicule
he must have gone through,

621
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,314
all the nicknames he must have had?

622
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:03,950
We should call him Cue Ball.

623
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,035
You just want to rub his head
for good luck, you know?

624
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,907
All right, all in favor
of giving Cue Ball a bid?

625
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:12,915
Perfect. Moving on.

626
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,628
This guy's name is Anthony Hopkins!
It's his real name!

627
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:19,921
He told Wade someone
says "Hello, Clarice"

628
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:22,429
to him a dozen times a day
and he laughs every time.

629
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:24,425
We don't even need to vote, right?

630
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:26,136
He's definitely in. Next photo.

631
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:30,182
Next.

632
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:33,185
Wait! Let me say something.

633
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:36,279
This is Andy,

634
00:38:37,376 --> 00:38:39,582
and he really wants
to be a Kappa Tau.

635
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,125
I screwed up.

636
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,117
I tried to mess with karmic synergy
and recruit Andy into our house.

637
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:53,293
I told him not to raise his hand
after Wade drops the cleaver.

638
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:55,181
What?

639
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:57,209
I know, it was wrong.

640
00:38:57,743 --> 00:38:59,243
It's not the KT way.

641
00:39:00,618 --> 00:39:04,526
I was rushing him based on his resume,
just like every other house on campus,

642
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,569
but Andy should not have
to pay for my mistake.

643
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:11,598
He said when he walked in
that he knew this was the place for him.

644
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:15,007
Maybe he wouldn't have run away
or raised his hand,

645
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,938
and ended up at the party
without my help.

646
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,072
We'll never know.

647
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:23,360
But what I do know is
that Andy's a really great guy.

648
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,197
And we could
call him Andy-licious...

649
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:32,244
or something cooler.

650
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,956
Come on, Cap, it's been 12 hours.

651
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:40,376
All right, then,
let's put it to a vote.

652
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:42,837
All in favor
of Rusty's golden boy, Andy?

653
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:01,276
He's in.

654
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:09,385
Great. Little Debbie Gibson
accepted our bid. That's nice.

655
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,823
We're not exactly in the position
to deny anyone now.

656
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:15,535
OK, fine, I'll try
to appreciate her style as...

657
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,498
ironically faux-retro-trashy
or something.

658
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:20,639
At least we got some pledges.

659
00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:22,836
Twenty is a respectable number.

660
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:26,138
We'll just have to give out
some snap bids, no problem.

661
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:28,513
I can't wait for our pref party
with the Lambda Sigs.

662
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:32,138
After all this estrogen, I could use
a good injection of testosterone.

663
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,568
- Rebecca, how did you...?
- I told them about Frannie-gate,

664
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:50,781
and why I wanted to be the mole,
despite protests from leadership.

665
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:53,075
Then I got them
to accept their bids to ZBZ.

666
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:55,080
Way to go, Rebecca!

667
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:00,499
Maybe I underestimated
your plan after all.

668
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,626
I have a present for you.

669
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:11,967
- Frannie's Titanicbrush?
- The real one.

670
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:14,721
- How did you...?
- I may be a terrible mole,

671
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,598
but I'm an excellent thief.

672
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:50,465
Listen up, everybody!
This is Todd, aka Cue Ball!

673
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:53,468
And this is Anthony Hopkins, aka...

674
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,303
Anthony Hopkins!

675
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,597
Two more KT pledges!

676
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,202
I guess he's not gonna show.
I'm sorry, Spitter.

677
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:24,157
I thought it was for real, you know?

678
00:42:24,282 --> 00:42:26,179
I thought it was karmic synergy.

679
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:32,299
Looks like it was.

680
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,460
Go on! Go introduce your pledge.
He's your monkey now.

681
00:42:39,103 --> 00:42:40,895
- You're here!
- Yeah, sorry I'm late.

682
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,851
I decided to stop by Omega Chi...

683
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,399
You know, tell Calvin I decided
to accept my bid at Kappa Tau.

684
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:48,141
All right! Come on.

685
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,773
May I have your attention, please?

686
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,888
This is Andy, aka...

687
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:57,020
Andy-licious!

688
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:03,288
Or something way cooler.

689
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,582
Yeah! Way cooler.

690
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,876
Another KT pledge!
