1
00:00:01,587 --> 00:00:04,977
My life has been planned out for me
since before I was born.

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:08,719
You were the first person
who's ever made me think

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:12,702
I would take a detour. I would go
all the way off the map for you.

4
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:15,183
- What the hell are you going?
- I'm getting rowdy.

5
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,393
This is {\really}beneath you.

6
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:18,161
You know what's beneath me?
You{\'re beneath me}.

7
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:20,523
My parents just called.
They're getting divorced.

8
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:23,067
Sorry.
Going inside'd cheer you up.

9
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:25,653
Give me a straw and I'll drink
apple juice through my nose.

10
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:27,655
I don't think lemon
drops can fix this.

11
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:31,370
I'm Max, your new Resident Advisor.

12
00:00:31,694 --> 00:00:33,911
You worked for NASA?
You must be a genius.

13
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,830
You're done processing?

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,809
It's been processed,
packaged and put on a shelf.

15
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:43,050
- What happens to Big Sis, Little Sis?
- We're sisters forever.

16
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:45,230
We're just no longer friends.

17
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:53,360
Move out of the way!

18
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:55,754
Speed kills!

19
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:00,230
She's getting away.
Put your backs into it.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,199
What's a hernia feel like?

21
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,946
When's Cappy gonna realize

22
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,277
that the Broncosaurus
isn't gonna start again ever.

23
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:08,547
I heard that.

24
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,757
I know you love her. But maybe it's time
extinction ran its course?

25
00:01:11,877 --> 00:01:13,726
I didn't give up on her
when the engine blew,

26
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:17,046
when the backseat caught on fire
or when I crashed her into a bog.

27
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,333
- There's bogs in Ohio?
- I'm not giving up on her now.

28
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:22,609
Besides, I'm assuming you
pledges will be needing her

29
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:24,802
for your monthly supply run
to Cost Club,

30
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:26,671
since none of you
have cars of your own.

31
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,239
But it's 15 miles.

32
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,883
The house is woefully low

33
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,928
on essentials like moisturizer and
butt paper, and I'm sick of stealing it

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,430
from the sorities.

35
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,666
Powder fresh scent makes me chafe.

36
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:38,857
Dude, borrow your sister's car.

37
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:41,129
- She'll never go for it.
- Why not?

38
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:44,242
When I was 16,
I borrowed her car for my DMV test,

39
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:46,426
and I ended up in
a grocery store parking lot

40
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:49,144
and I ran over one of
the coin-operated horse rides.

41
00:01:49,264 --> 00:01:50,738
Was there a kid on it?

42
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,796
- Then who cares?
- Casey cared.

43
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,174
She doesn't trust me.
She never will.

44
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:58,829
I'm also not allowed to install
her software or touch her dolls.

45
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:03,176
- It's a long story.
- But you're her brother.

46
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:07,175
Her little brother and she's likely
to never see me as anything but that.

47
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:10,534
Less chat, more push.
We need more momentum for the hill.

48
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:14,220
I'll ask to borrow her car.

49
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,194
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

50
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,153
- Mail call.
- Thanks, Pledge Logan.

51
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,252
I hope it's something good.

52
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:40,370
She's really starting to embrace
her pledge duties

53
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,115
and it only took her 7 months.

54
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:44,412
Not good.

55
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:46,927
It's my credit card bill!

56
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,785
We knew this day was coming.

57
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:50,173
Be gentle, Credit Plus.

58
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,227
This is my first...

59
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:55,491
- 1300?
- Dollars?

60
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:56,930
And 27 cents.

61
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,966
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Don't panic.

62
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:02,368
Just pay the minimum
and live to fight another month.

63
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,771
It doesn't say anything
about a minimum.

64
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:08,215
This is a charge card,
not a credit card.

65
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,744
You have to pay off
the entire balance each month.

66
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:13,987
But it's called Credit Plus,
not Charge Plus!

67
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:15,141
They lied.

68
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,099
My parents're gonna kill me.
They're gonna take away my allowance.

69
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:20,893
- We can deal with that.
- They're gonna make me get a job,

70
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:23,372
which means I won't have as much
time to devote to the house.

71
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:26,459
- We can deal with that too.
- Which means no more social chair.

72
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:29,057
That we cannot deal with.
The office of social chair is more

73
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:30,546
important than vice-president!

74
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,508
Of America!

75
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:42,924
Afternoon, ladies.

76
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:46,061
As president of Omega Chi,
I have an announcement.

77
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:48,376
I thought Evan was the president
of Omega Chi.

78
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:51,943
No, Dino's always been president.
Evan's the pledge educator.

79
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:53,586
You need to pay more attention.

80
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:56,109
This Saturday evening
is our Casino Night.

81
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,659
The 20 dollar cover goes to charity

82
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:03,603
and gets you 2,000 dollars
of fake gambling money.

83
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,266
However,
there is a real 2,000 dollar pot

84
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:09,240
for whichever player
wins the most chips by midnight.

85
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,088
All right, gentlemen,
whip out your decks.

86
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,175
Bring your A-game, ladies, because
the best card sharks in the Greek system

87
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:18,636
will be there.

88
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,049
You are the luckiest girl
in the world.

89
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:32,306
Greek 203
<i>Let's make a deal.</i>

90
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:34,235
Synchro :<i> Coke, ¤AkaZab¤.</i>

91
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,412
Sub-way.fr
Seriessub.com

92
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:41,421
So, today's the day.

93
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,966
I think today's the day.
I'm meeting my mom in a few minutes.

94
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:47,685
I guess the car my dad gave me
after graduation

95
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:50,043
was the closest thing
to a trust fund I'll ever see.

96
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:53,629
So, is it a lot?
No, don't answer that.

97
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,174
Just give me a hint.
No, don't do that, either.

98
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,704
I have been waiting
for this day, well...

99
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:01,387
since forever.

100
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:06,184
I mean, haven't you been rich
since... well, forever?

101
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:09,123
My parents have, but this
is my money, my freedom.

102
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,998
I'll be able to do anything.
I can go off the map.

103
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:14,720
I can do whatever I want.
Escape the Chambers prison.

104
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,695
Sounds like a rich kid thing.

105
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:20,059
"The Chambers prison."
What does that look like?

106
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,310
Diamond latrines
and bars made from gold?

107
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,205
Nope, but with my trust fund
I can probably build you one of those.

108
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,211
That's a cool shirt.

109
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,499
Where did you get it?

110
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,311
Why? You going shopping?

111
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:41,135
No, I was just paying a compliment
to my super-awesome sister.

112
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:42,629
What do you want?

113
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,092
Your car.

114
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:46,485
Come on.

115
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:48,392
We have a good thing going here.

116
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:51,090
A year ago if someone asked
me what your favorite color is

117
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,726
I would have assumed you were
colorblind, given the way you dress.

118
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:55,313
Now I know it's brown.

119
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,006
Actually, it's green.

120
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:58,077
My point is,

121
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:00,677
let's cherish and protect
our new relationship,

122
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:02,948
not muck it up with something
like sharing things.

123
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:03,934
2 hours.

124
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:05,825
That's all I need.

125
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:09,120
2 hours was all you need for
your driver's test, remember?

126
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,291
- I knew you'd bring that up.
- It took 4 produce men and 5 quarters

127
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,232
to get my car off that horse.
I had to take the school bus for a week.

128
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,178
It was one honest mistake.

129
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:21,201
Your sketchy history spans decades.

130
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,885
What about my Cabbage Patch
Drink'N'Wet Newborn?

131
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:25,595
Your stupid doll that could pee?

132
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:29,307
You filled her with cranberry juice.
That doesn't look like pee.

133
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:31,921
I was six years old. I was six!

134
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,362
Or the time that you erased
my online'N Sync diary.

135
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,298
I was 12. I'm 18 now.

136
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:38,517
My god.

137
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,402
Six, 12, 18.

138
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,959
Six, six, six.

139
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:46,021
- This explains everything.
- Stop treating me like a kid!

140
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:47,695
Or Damien.

141
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:49,410
I'm a grown up.

142
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,799
When are you gonna see that?

143
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,478
I see you just as you are.

144
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,883
As my little brother
who's not borrowing my car.

145
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:09,253
Wade?

146
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:11,065
Are you waxing again?

147
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,687
I'd be offended if Wade didn't
have such great legs.

148
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,737
- I haven't talked to you in a few days.
- Sorry. I've been busy.

149
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,960
House stuff.

150
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,746
You should really put
this poor truck out of its misery.

151
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:29,117
It's a total POS.

152
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:33,039
And by that I can only assume
you mean "total piece of super-badass".

153
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,542
It's not looking
too badass right now.

154
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,880
There's been a lot of stuff going on
lately with my family and Spring Break.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,188
- Just a lot of drama.
- I love drama.

156
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:47,011
Remember when Locke blew open
the hatch? Finally?

157
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,473
I don't want my family stuff
to weigh us down.

158
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:55,061
So I've decided to keep that
part of my life over there

159
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:56,753
and

160
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,964
this part of my life over here.

161
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:03,152
Focus only on fun
when I'm with Cappy.

162
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,967
I love fun, too. Whatever you want.

163
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,445
Casino Night at Omega Chi
tomorrow night. Wanna go?

164
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:16,958
With Evan and the Chipmunks?
Is that a pitch for fun or drama?

165
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,626
Good point.

166
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:22,588
{\You know} What you're doing?

167
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,131
Does this look like
a transmission to you?

168
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:29,461
OK. Let's go.

169
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:30,577
Fun awaits.

170
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:32,848
Wait, wait.

171
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,261
Let's go with The Zen of 21.

172
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,225
You know,
we only need one book, right?

173
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:48,447
How did you afford all these?

174
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:54,447
- You put them on your credit card?
- Charge card!

175
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,996
Who cares? We're gonna win.

176
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:59,344
Maybe we should learn
how to play 21 first, then get cocky.

177
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:02,194
We each get two cards

178
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:04,212
and the one closest to 21 wins.

179
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,047
Do you have a queen?

180
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,448
This isn't Go Fish.
You hit if you want more.

181
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:09,568
OK. Hit me.

182
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,014
Hit me again.

183
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:15,641
Again.

184
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,443
Come on.

185
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:20,754
Forty-two!

186
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:23,914
- I got double blackjack.
- No.

187
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:25,482
You busted.

188
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:26,639
What?

189
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,950
They make it look so easy
in that movie,21.

190
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:33,296
But they weren't just adding cards.
They were counting them.

191
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,579
Too bad we can't fly in a geek
from MIT to teach us how.

192
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:40,875
No, but maybe we could find
a geek a little closer to home.

193
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:47,025
Your father and I are so excited
about your plans for the future.

194
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,112
Harvard. The Senate.

195
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:53,329
We just want to make sure
you remain on that path.

196
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:56,167
- It's an incentive trust.
- But Mom,

197
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,486
can't you just trust
that I'm gonna stay on that path?

198
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:03,378
I mean, those things, I've wanted those
my entire life. Isn't that enough?

199
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:06,410
Of course it is, but Evan,
this is a lot of money.

200
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,084
And you didn't expect us
to just hand it over

201
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:11,405
- after your brother's debacle?
- But I'm not Patrick.

202
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,864
I'm focused.

203
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:14,550
So was Patrick.

204
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,562
It seems when kids your age
receive this much money

205
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:20,344
it can provoke some fairly
ridiculous responses,

206
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:22,593
and we just want some peace of mind.

207
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:26,137
As a future lawyer,
I'm sure you can understand that.

208
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:30,109
Which is why we've included
certain lifestyle provisions.

209
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,710
And what are those?

210
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,443
How old I have to be before
I'm allowed to get married?

211
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:39,513
Well, actually, yes.

212
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,108
Not before you're 25,
which I can't imagine

213
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,013
you were planning on, anyway.

214
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,992
You aren't hoping to rush to the alter
with that blonde Casey, are you?

215
00:10:49,103 --> 00:10:50,454
She and I are done.

216
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:52,907
Sorry to hear that.

217
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,358
And what if I do choose
to pull a Patrick

218
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,579
and do something different with my life?
Would you sue me?

219
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,751
Don't be petulant, Evan.

220
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,071
If you chose to do something else

221
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:07,299
you'd be wasting
a tremendous amount of potential

222
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:09,005
and you would lose your trust fund.

223
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,135
If you're not prepared
to invest in us,

224
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,772
then how can you expect
us to invest in you?

225
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,012
I need to think about this.

226
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,573
All right.

227
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:23,351
Look it over

228
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:25,107
and let us know.

229
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:32,470
I'll have to call you back.

230
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:37,687
There's my

231
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:38,752
little...

232
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,891
big... brother! You busy?

233
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,016
- I'm kinda in the middle of something.
- We need to learn how to count cards.

234
00:11:45,243 --> 00:11:46,806
There are 52 in a deck.

235
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:50,212
We were thinking
more like in that movie.

236
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:52,081
Like "counting" counting?

237
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,141
The MIT guys?

238
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:55,550
- Yes. Do you know how?
- It can't be that hard.

239
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:56,801
I turned down MIT.

240
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:59,267
Why do you need to
learn to count cards?

241
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:00,597
It's not for me,

242
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:03,208
it's for Ash.
And the folks at Credit Plus.

243
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,715
I don't know.

244
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:10,326
You know, with my sketchy
history with peeing dolls and horses...

245
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:11,534
I won't ask.

246
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:15,071
OK, assuming you're
every bit the math geek we need,

247
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,740
- you can borrow my car for one hour.
- Two hours.

248
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,707
Fine, fine.
But only if Ash wins Casino Night.

249
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,020
You got a deal.

250
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,196
Cartwright powers, activate.

251
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,463
You always squeeze so hard!

252
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:34,340
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

253
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:47,860
I think you're distracting my
floormates from their studies.

254
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:50,260
It's like I'm their queen.

255
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:53,230
I'm gonna come here
every time I feel down.

256
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:00,021
Can we get back to this?

257
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:01,878
I haven't learned a thing.

258
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,495
Maybe if you applied yourself
a little more,

259
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,455
like you didn't do in algebra.

260
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:10,584
- Or you in your driver's test, Damien.
- I hate that you keep bringing that up.

261
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:12,589
- I hate being talked down to.
- Children!

262
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,046
It's simple math.

263
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,756
"Simple math" is an oxymoron,
whereas you're just a...

264
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:20,066
10 minute break.
Everybody out of the pool.

265
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:22,507
You know what? Forget it.
We're out of here.

266
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,685
- What about the car?
- What about my debt?

267
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,490
Sorry that you think your
brother is the demon seed

268
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:30,312
but I need 13 hundred dollars
and 27 cents.

269
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,815
The deal is off.
We'll formulate a Plan B.

270
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:34,651
No more deals with the devil boy.

271
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,329
I got your note.
Sorry. I'm car-less.

272
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:40,573
Also, I'm sorry about your
sister. She sounds terrible.

273
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,569
Max, this is my sister, Casey,

274
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,287
and her friend, Ashleigh.

275
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:50,825
Hi.

276
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:54,878
Do you know anything
about counting cards?

277
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:56,422
Counting cards? Yeah. Why?

278
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,897
'Cause there's this big fraternity
Casino Night tomorrow.

279
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:01,335
I'm trying to win two grand.

280
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:04,138
It's just keeping track of the ratio
of high cards to low cards.

281
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:07,086
A fraternity wouldn't
use six decks like a real casino

282
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,961
so there's even less to keep track of.
I'd say two decks, tops.

283
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,271
Anyone can count that. Bye.

284
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:18,527
Almost anyone.

285
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,367
Wait. Casey, wait.
I need a car. Don't go anywhere.

286
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:25,283
Max? Max, hold up.

287
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:30,543
If I help them win the money
Casey's gonna loan me her car.

288
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:33,495
But in order to help
them win the money,

289
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,794
I need to teach
these two how to count cards.

290
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:38,186
- Can you help me?
- I don't think so.

291
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:39,974
What if it's me and Max?

292
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,293
He gets...

293
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,717
What do you want?

294
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:45,089
5%?

295
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:46,930
10%?

296
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,295
10%?

297
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,764
And we get his knowledge.

298
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,440
Fine. Welcome aboard, Max.

299
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,824
These deal points aren't that bad.

300
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,659
I can't even get
married till I'm 25.

301
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,883
Should I be flattered?

302
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,363
You know, it's not the rules.
It's the finality.

303
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,050
I'm 21,

304
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,002
and the idea of

305
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,648
legally committing the rest of my life
to the order of a document...

306
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:27,262
it's a little daunting.

307
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,849
Why did you want to go to
law school in the first place?

308
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,311
It's all I've ever wanted.

309
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,522
My grandfather attended Harvard Law.

310
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,215
My father attended Harvard Law.

311
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,551
So,
your family influenced this path?

312
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:43,310
It's not the same thing.

313
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:52,695
What's so different?

314
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,957
Either way you're set for life.

315
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,190
Why get cold feet now?

316
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,503
I don't know.

317
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,592
What if I want to go off the map

318
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:03,756
and be someone else?

319
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:08,306
Like who?

320
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,188
You're Evan Chambers.

321
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:13,001
You're going to be on the map
no matter where you are.

322
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,311
Might as well make
it a treasure map.

323
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,858
Feel like I'm cheating
on Broncosaurus.

324
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,777
A guy can still look, right?

325
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,487
What's that, KITT?
You say you want me to buy you?

326
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,330
You say together
we can fight the forces of evil?

327
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,071
Affirmative, Cappy.

328
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:41,252
We can use my grappling hook
to steal the Omega Chi wet bar.

329
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:44,088
Becks, did you hear that?
He likes wet bars too.

330
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:46,341
Then let's get it.
Or him.

331
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:49,385
- Too bad I can't afford him.
- I can buy it for you.

332
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:50,622
It's a car.

333
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:54,058
According to you, he's your
crime fighting partner to be.

334
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:55,869
Come on, let's have fun.

335
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,093
There's this whole thing
called the male ego.

336
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,395
Calm down, caveman.

337
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,446
My father's been trying to buy
my love lately

338
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,572
and this seems
a good place for him to start.

339
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:04,718
It's a gift.

340
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:08,864
But if it makes your ego feel better
you can always pay me back in trade.

341
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:11,525
Trade?

342
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:16,287
That's gonna be a lot of sex.

343
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:17,748
I know.

344
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,543
Think I can make an advance deposit?

345
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:28,785
Tens through kings,

346
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:29,898
minus one.

347
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:31,536
Aces are minus two.

348
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:34,006
The more of these left
in the deck, the better.

349
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,189
Cards two through six are plus one.

350
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:39,259
A lot of these left, not good.
Bet small amounts.

351
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:43,711
I knew it wouldn't be
that complicated.

352
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,307
You're a good teacher.

353
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:48,236
It's easy when you pay attention.

354
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:50,683
Did you say something, Damien?

355
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,781
Car. Car. Car.

356
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:56,377
So let's try one.

357
00:17:57,657 --> 00:18:00,791
Start with dollar bets. They're
the Flintstones Chewables.

358
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,399
Don't bet the horse pills

359
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:06,011
till the count gets to plus seven.

360
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,631
Can I split these?

361
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:12,720
But not if I'm showing a ten.

362
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,555
Unless you're a complete dweeb.

363
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:15,864
Like Rusty.

364
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:18,002
Minus three?

365
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:19,476
Minus 2?

366
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:20,596
Plus three.

367
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:21,913
Minus three?

368
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,064
With all the low cards showing?

369
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:26,650
- Who's the dweeb now?
- Shut up, Little Man Tate.

370
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,985
Are we gonna have to have
another time out?

371
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:30,570
OK. Round two.

372
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:31,617
Ready?

373
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,240
Begin.

374
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:39,454
You're going too fast.
I'm getting card sick.

375
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:40,763
Who's got it?

376
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,510
Put your hand down.

377
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:46,508
Plus 7?

378
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:48,891
So now we bet big.

379
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:50,382
We bet huge.

380
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,469
We're so gonna win.

381
00:18:54,023 --> 00:18:56,178
If all we're doing
is increasing our odds,

382
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,723
won't adding more players
better our percentage?

383
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:02,680
What? I totally get percentages.

384
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,300
Why don't you guys come with us?

385
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:09,485
- To a fraternity party?
- An Omega Chi fraternity party?

386
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,653
Another half hour in the car

387
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:14,573
and we'll add another five percent.

388
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:18,734
We'll consider it an advance
against your expenses.

389
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:20,598
Expenses?

390
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:26,611
Do you own anything that doesn't look
like you want to climb a mountain?

391
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:35,761
Thanks for including me on the deal.

392
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:39,916
I love my sister but when I try
to explain anything to her,

393
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:42,255
it's like we're polystyrene

394
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:44,086
and polybutadiene.

395
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:47,105
More like polyvinylchloride
and polyurethane.

396
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:49,441
No wonder you worked for NASA.

397
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,412
The gray

398
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:54,918
or black?

399
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,896
Black, but with a red tie.

400
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:58,662
Wait, green.

401
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:00,868
- Why green?
- The color of money.

402
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:02,690
You're a genius. More.

403
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,107
I'm so sorry for Casey.
She's so annoying.

404
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:10,170
- Just roll with it.
- No, it's fine.

405
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:14,639
Try these on.

406
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:19,012
Right here?

407
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:21,956
Just put them on
over your cargo shorts.

408
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,009
- Really?
- Trust me, Max.

409
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:27,833
Resistance is futile.

410
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:37,738
Let's just see if
that jacket matches.

411
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,337
There you are.

412
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:45,384
Snazzy.

413
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:47,945
Me?

414
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:52,712
- Does this make you a kept man?
- She's just buying me a car, that's it.

415
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:55,965
Be careful, Cap.
Reese and Ryan. Madonna and Guy.

416
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:58,735
All wealthy women in history who
could afford to buy their men.

417
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:02,347
OK, would you simmer down,
Us Weekly, she's not trying to buy me.

418
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:05,497
This one girl
I used to pretend to date,

419
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:08,686
she got to choose all the movies
because she paid.

420
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:12,056
I lost years of my life watching
nothing but chick flicks.

421
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,216
Euro Trip?

422
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:14,483
Never seen it.

423
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:17,946
- Ella Enchanted? 16 times.
- I think I read somewhere

424
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,797
that Julia Roberts
literally owns Danny Moder.

425
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,598
Smart investment. He's hot.

426
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:25,375
I wonder how he doesn't feel
beneath her, you know?

427
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:29,117
OK, guys, Rebecca's not trying
to control me or buy me.

428
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,297
She's been through a lot lately.

429
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:34,296
We're trying to get back
to some reality-free fun.

430
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:37,265
I thought you were way too
different to make it for the long haul,

431
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:38,572
but I guess I was wrong.

432
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,886
You really got
to like the girl a lot to take a car.

433
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:43,141
There's no breaking up after that.

434
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:45,174
Nope.

435
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:46,919
No breaking up.

436
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:57,174
So, the Bentley GTC is amazing,
but the Iron Man Audi

437
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:58,585
is just

438
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:00,412
plain disgusting.

439
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:04,763
I hear they literally raise the cows
in the shape of the leather seats.

440
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:07,969
All you have to do is drive only
to the places you're allowed to go.

441
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,247
I'm sure it's worth it
for a few dollars.

442
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:11,583
Try a few million.

443
00:22:11,743 --> 00:22:13,084
I told you not to tell me.

444
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:17,863
Why did you rush Omega Chi?
That's right, your dad told you to.

445
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:20,427
My dad
didn't make me sign a contract.

446
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,797
I still maintain some
semblance of freedom.

447
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:24,262
Freedom's an illusion.

448
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:27,432
Frannie said that,
'cause I just got goosebumps.

449
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:29,175
- Come on.
- I know. You like her.

450
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:32,078
I'm sorry. It's just that
this is a huge decision.

451
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,613
I'd hate to see you at 40
regretting a choice you made at 21.

452
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:37,051
Calvin, get down here.

453
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:38,364
That's my cue.

454
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:40,034
I got a pit to boss.

455
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,970
All right, let's go.

456
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:18,045
Ash, you and Rusty take that
table. We'll go over there.

457
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:19,885
Happy counting.

458
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,110
Follow me.

459
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:29,202
Hi. I'm Betsy.

460
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:30,950
Hi, Betsy.

461
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:35,167
I've been playing at this table
for two hours and loving it.

462
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:38,053
That's because I don't need
alcohol to have a good time.

463
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:39,433
I'm high on life.

464
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:41,537
Cherish every moment.

465
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:43,473
That's very sweet.

466
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:47,289
Twenty-two. You bust.

467
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:48,597
Son of a bitch!

468
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:51,427
I gotta win that back.
Deal me again. Let's go.

469
00:24:00,178 --> 00:24:01,575
What are you doing here?

470
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:03,991
I heard this was for the
Omega Chi's official charity.

471
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,566
Erectile dysfunction.

472
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:08,408
A terrible affliction. I know how much
you guys want to beat it.

473
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:09,993
The cover just went up to 120.

474
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:12,615
Come on.
He's got the cover. Let him play.

475
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:15,311
Thank you.

476
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:16,456
Here you go.

477
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,349
Don't steal our booze.

478
00:24:26,953 --> 00:24:27,851
You're here!

479
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:30,143
- Why'd you change your mind?
- And miss all the fun?

480
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:31,494
Place your bets.

481
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:36,478
Hello?

482
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:38,678
I can't.

483
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,256
That's between you two.

484
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:44,780
I'm at a party.
I'll call you tomorrow.

485
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:48,243
- Everything all right?
- Of course.

486
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,283
It has nothing to do with us.

487
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:51,615
Here you are.

488
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:55,114
Blackjack!

489
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:58,054
Right on.

490
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:58,054
Right on.

491
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:02,545
You're tipping me with fake money?

492
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:04,663
Yes, but the feelings are real.

493
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,045
You keep this up you'll be able
to get satellite radio for your new car.

494
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:13,285
Assuming you didn't want the super retro
tape Deck you already have.

495
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:19,998
Double down.

496
00:25:39,824 --> 00:25:42,955
Yeah. Looks like someone's gonna
win their 15 percent.

497
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:46,615
I'll probably just take five percent.
Your friend needs it more.

498
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:50,764
- Excuse me.
- We have a problem.

499
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,087
Calm down, Chicken Little.
The sky's not falling.

500
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:56,440
Yes, it is. It's Jason.
He's beating all of us put together.

501
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:01,612
Oh, my god.
The dork in the Travis suit?

502
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:06,826
Yes!

503
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,611
- Is Travis a designer?

504
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,224
- No, he's Ashleigh's evil ex.

505
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:15,167
Jason is his clone from the shallow
end of the gene pool.

506
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:16,708
That's kind of harsh.

507
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:19,185
He said polymers are as
interesting as a dirt sandwich.

508
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:22,278
A dirt sandwich that's found
in almost every adhesive.

509
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,363
And lubricant on the planet.

510
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,359
Stupid knuckle-dragging
astrophysics.

511
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,014
Is he counting cards too?

512
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:31,051
His winning percentage
is higher than ours.

513
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:33,175
His bets are mathematically insane.

514
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,982
He's got to be cheating.

515
00:26:38,776 --> 00:26:40,717
- Sunglasses?
- It's got to be.

516
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:43,956
- X-ray vision? No way.
- He's marking cards.

517
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,665
It's probably a substance on his fingers
that he can see with his glasses.

518
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,925
I read about that in one of my 21 books,
so if we don't stop Jason there's no way

519
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:52,216
we can win for sure.

520
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,477
Then Caseys and gentlemen,
I think it's time for a little sting.

521
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:11,943
Allow me.

522
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:15,869
- Ashleigh!
- What do you want?

523
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,742
I wanted to apologize.

524
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:21,588
Why? 'Cause you realize the last time
I saw you, you were a total loon?

525
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,064
I'm trying to be nice now.

526
00:27:25,692 --> 00:27:27,694
I should pay attention here.

527
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:31,536
But I want to apologize,
maybe rekindle our friendship.

528
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:34,501
Seriously?

529
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,495
Only if we can be friends...

530
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:47,102
with benefits.

531
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:11,080
- warned her bout that credit card.
- It's actually a charge card.

532
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,292
- New deck.
- Yeah. Just like you asked.

533
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,352
So which ones do we mark?

534
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,496
The twos, threes and fours.

535
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,827
So when he thinks
he's getting a high card

536
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:21,728
he's getting a low one, baby.

537
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:23,614
- Don't call me baby.
- Right.

538
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:29,351
<i>You're a winner.
Chicken dinner.</i>

539
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:32,932
- What the hell does that mean?
- I don't know.

540
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:34,251
I want to play.

541
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,113
Let's not jinx my system.

542
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:39,894
- What gives?
- What do you mean?

543
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:42,267
Well, this is just for fun, right?

544
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,925
If you don't win I can just
get you a satellite radio.

545
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:47,823
I don't want the radio.

546
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:50,145
I would. Terrestrial bites.

547
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:51,581
Or the car.

548
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,506
I just want to get some money
and fix the Broncosaurus.

549
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,135
OK.
I can pay to have that fixed, too.

550
00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:58,804
- I just thought...
- I got it.

551
00:29:01,178 --> 00:29:02,519
And that's blackjack.

552
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,486
Hey.

553
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,692
- Why aren't you playing?
- I'm down to my last 45 dollars.

554
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,427
Sister.

555
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:24,878
Casey.

556
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,894
Casey has a warped sense
of sibling relationships.

557
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:34,225
I'm starting to understand
her brother better.

558
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:36,498
Ever since I came back
to the house I've done nothing

559
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:39,620
but support her,
advise her constantly, and

560
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:41,507
this is the thanks I get.

561
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,070
Maybe you should stop being so nice.
Just get back in the game.

562
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,499
Well, maybe you're right.

563
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:51,367
Blackjack!

564
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,044
What's going on?

565
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,439
You still thinking
about the trust fund?

566
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:01,070
Yeah.

567
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:03,593
You know, growing up,

568
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:07,824
I was always referred to as
the oungest of the Chambers sons.

569
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:12,980
When I came to Cyprus-Rhodes,
I thought I could be my own man

570
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,218
and not just an
extension of my family.

571
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:20,073
You sound like you're about
to break into song.

572
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:23,472
I mean,
everyone comes to college wanting

573
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:25,444
to exert their independence, Evan.

574
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:26,760
To have fun...

575
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:29,614
Right now college
doesn't seem like much fun.

576
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,273
Don't confuse a fake casino
in a fraternity house with real life.

577
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:38,874
Stop gambling with fake chips.

578
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:41,570
What reason do you seriously
have to go off the map?

579
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,901
You have a trust
fund and a birthright.

580
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,182
Embrace it.

581
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:55,898
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

582
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:59,329
To be the center of attention.
That will make you feel better.

583
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:07,581
All right, everybody.
Listen up. It's almost midnight

584
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,404
and we are down
to the final high rollers.

585
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:17,717
High rollers, you ready to gamble?

586
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,736
Yeah.

587
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:20,747
It's time to get paid, y'all.

588
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:22,909
Big money, big money.
No whammies.

589
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,487
Jason, if you're so confident,
why not just bet it all?

590
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,634
Are you crazy?

591
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,828
I'll bet half, Carrie.

592
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:42,719
- It's Casey.
- It's Casey.

593
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:53,347
So, I heard you compared
polymer science, to

594
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:54,683
dirt sandwiches.

595
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:57,893
Well, it's just that
we astrophysicists,

596
00:31:58,014 --> 00:31:59,819
we discuss big things.

597
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:02,056
Like the string theory of matter.

598
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:05,820
We work with real world stuff,
like self-healing rubbers.

599
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:07,797
- Get out.
- Seriously?

600
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,173
Any chance that'd hit stores
before Christmas?

601
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,161
Not those kinds of rubbers, Cap.

602
00:32:13,562 --> 00:32:14,268
Tease.

603
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,537
Hey, polymer boy.

604
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:28,224
How much you want to bet I get a 21?

605
00:32:28,352 --> 00:32:29,505
I'll double down.

606
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:40,502
Hey, Jason?

607
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:53,592
- Wait. I thought you had a ten.
- Why would you think that?

608
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,090
And ten makes 18.

609
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:05,873
Max and Casey push.
Rusty wins.

610
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:10,927
Better Luck next time to our
friend, Jason, who's out.

611
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,991
- Yes.
- Come on, Ashleigh.

612
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:26,253
Don't ever let me
catch you in here again.

613
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:34,339
That's pretty awesome, Cal.
By the way,

614
00:33:35,758 --> 00:33:36,627
I won.

615
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,442
It's too close to call.
We'll play one more hand.

616
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:02,656
One minute to midnight.
It all comes down to this hand.

617
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:11,281
OK, the deck's minus two, which
means crazy low card time.

618
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:13,414
Let's play it safe
and keep our lead.

619
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,301
Let's
split these aces.

620
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:23,996
- Splitting aces?
- Not safe.

621
00:34:24,215 --> 00:34:25,947
Calvin has a ten.
He probably has a 20.

622
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:28,175
This will work.
High risk, high reward.

623
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:30,331
Remember splitting aces?
Ten?

624
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:31,863
Complete dweebs?
Rusty?

625
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:34,449
Hit this one.

626
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:39,021
And this one.

627
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:43,518
- Split them again.
- Max!

628
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:54,226
Sorry, guys.

629
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:56,710
Nineteen, 17, 18. That's...

630
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,275
Bad if Calvin has a ten.

631
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,562
I gotta go.

632
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:11,661
What just happened?

633
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:13,938
Sorry.

634
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:17,200
Cappy, it's your move.

635
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:19,453
Hey, how's it go...?

636
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:23,955
- Hit or stay?
- Beat the house, win two grand.

637
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:26,859
Cap?

638
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:33,953
I'll stay.

639
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:39,236
Dealer gets 20.
Cappy wins.

640
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:43,489
I just saved the Broncosaurus.

641
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,882
200,000 miles and counting.

642
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:47,390
Congratulations.

643
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,380
Ready for an indecent proposal,
Miss Logan?

644
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:07,506
I think we've probably had
enough of those for one night?

645
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,576
Come on,
let's just have sex and money.

646
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,930
Why couldn't you just tell me
you didn't want me to buy that car?

647
00:36:16,763 --> 00:36:19,314
'Cause I didn't want
to make an issue out of it. Instead it

648
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,211
looks like I made
an entire newsstand.

649
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:25,430
Let's be serious.
For once.

650
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:29,007
I'm the one who's been a downer lately
so I was just trying to keep things fun.

651
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:32,060
I'm really sorry if your male
ego can't handle a girl buying

652
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:35,173
- you something expensive.
- It's not my ego, it's my pride.

653
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:36,599
Your pride?

654
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:40,433
It's just another reminder
of how I'm beneath you.

655
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:41,898
Beneath me?

656
00:36:43,483 --> 00:36:45,260
Are you talking about Spring Break?

657
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:48,254
I apologized for that.
I was drunk.

658
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,438
As someone who's drunk a lot,

659
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,513
I know when someone says stuff
like that, you might not mean to say it,

660
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:55,797
but there's usually a part of
you that does mean it.

661
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:58,492
And it wasn't the first time.
Remember Parents'Weekend?

662
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:01,332
Whenever your family comes into
your life, I instantly become

663
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,661
the poster boy for the Rebecca Logan

664
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,540
Make a Wish Foundation. And I just...
I don't want to deal with it.

665
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:10,056
That the reason I can't
even talk to you about my family

666
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:13,775
without you consoling me by offering
to drink apple juice through your nose?

667
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,438
You didn't want the car
because then we'd ha to get more

668
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:18,118
serious and that freaks you out.

669
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:24,919
And with everything happening
right now...

670
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:28,136
My parents'divorce,
my father's trial, Zeta Beta...

671
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:30,166
I need something more than just fun.

672
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:34,745
Well...

673
00:37:37,624 --> 00:37:41,624
Then I'll be serious. I can
step up and be that guy.

674
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:45,705
I know you can, Cap.

675
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:48,441
But just not for me.

676
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:53,760
Deep down I think you know that.

677
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:03,607
You're just too Cappy to say so.

678
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,491
So, are we...?

679
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:14,244
Broken up?

680
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:15,606
Yeah.

681
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,278
I guess so.

682
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:20,632
I'm sorry.

683
00:38:22,257 --> 00:38:23,352
I'm sorry, too.

684
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:40,546
I have to get a job, Case.

685
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,162
A job!

686
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:45,837
What did I do to deserve this?

687
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:49,523
I think the answer is,
taking up both of our closets.

688
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:53,132
I don't even know
how to look for a job.

689
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:55,039
Where do you start?

690
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:58,976
OK, job or no job,
you can't drop your office.

691
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:00,194
I need you.

692
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:02,814
Laura wants to pass
a bylaw instituting

693
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:04,975
an annual hayride mixer.

694
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,938
I will fight her
every step of the way.

695
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,465
- You will?
- Yes, I will.

696
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,495
If I can find a job
working 25 hours a week

697
00:39:12,615 --> 00:39:14,792
at 20 dollars an hour, that's $500.

698
00:39:14,975 --> 00:39:17,708
Or I could find a job
working two hours a week

699
00:39:17,894 --> 00:39:19,913
at 250 dollars an hour.

700
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:22,530
Either way you're still
my social chair?

701
00:39:22,804 --> 00:39:24,791
- Till death do us part.
- Yeah!

702
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:27,947
So...

703
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:32,694
What do you think happened with Max?
That whole

704
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:34,607
Runaway Bride thing was so weird.

705
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:36,872
I know, right.

706
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,503
Cal!
What do you think?

707
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:46,814
I see you made a choice.

708
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:49,005
We all make choices.

709
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:52,595
And we're choosing to go to Martha's
Vineyard for a very long weekend.

710
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,033
- Careful, Ev.
- See you next week.

711
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:06,978
Here we go.

712
00:40:19,914 --> 00:40:22,454
You are here to chew me out
for losing Casino Night.

713
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:24,285
I'm here to say

714
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:26,254
that I was wrong.

715
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,572
I've always seen you
as my nerdy little brother.

716
00:40:30,447 --> 00:40:31,751
You're not little anymore.

717
00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:33,861
I see you as an adult now.

718
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:35,773
Why now?

719
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:38,760
Because we wouldn't have
had a chance to win

720
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:41,653
- Casino Night without you.
- But we didn't win.

721
00:40:42,077 --> 00:40:42,889
True.

722
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:45,231
But the way you carried yourself,

723
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:48,402
catching Jason cheating,
that thing with your arm, that was

724
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:49,633
pretty cool.

725
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:52,528
My big sis thinks I'm cool.

726
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:55,441
I said you did something cool.

727
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:03,642
Two hours. No, really,
I'm timing you, so...

728
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,047
- OK, I'll gas it up for you.
- Just avoid mechanical horses.

729
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:37,707
You bailed with barely
a word last night.

730
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,579
Yeah.

731
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:42,440
You know, I thought I'd...

732
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,277
That's not entirely true.

733
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:47,845
I just...

734
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,372
had to go.

735
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:53,117
No worries. Just wanted
to make sure you're OK.

736
00:41:55,073 --> 00:41:56,017
Thank you.

737
00:41:57,177 --> 00:41:57,876
I...

738
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,086
Yeah.
You?

739
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,107
What?

740
00:42:09,743 --> 00:42:11,425
You started to say "I."

741
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,165
- Did I?
- Yeah.

742
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:17,192
What were you going to say?

743
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:19,894
I forget.

744
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,910
- Did you have fun last night?
- Yes.

745
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:29,196
My first fraternity party.

746
00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:30,845
Very exciting.

747
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:34,706
What do you normally do for fun?

748
00:42:40,886 --> 00:42:42,152
Seriously?

749
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,025
Dr. Who?

750
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:45,756
The British guy with the

751
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,259
hat?

752
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:48,858
That's neat.

753
00:42:50,322 --> 00:42:52,268
We should get you out more.

754
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:54,365
Have you ever been to Doblers?

755
00:42:56,478 --> 00:43:00,693
Or maybe we could just fly to Vegas

756
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,024
and practice our card counting
superpowers in the big time.

757
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:08,545
Sure.

758
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:10,559
Maybe. I don't know.

759
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:12,579
I gotta go, though.

760
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:14,676
Bye Cassie.
