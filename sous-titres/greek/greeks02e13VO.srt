1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,376
- <i>Previously...</i>
- First meeting as actives.

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,337
We get to be the guys
involved in choosing

3
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:07,538
- the next generation of Kappa Tau.
- I figured I'd walk into a house

4
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:10,343
and just know
this is where I'm meant to be.

5
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,553
And I thought I had
when I walked into Kappa Tau.

6
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:17,475
You hear?
Iota Kappa Iota, 95 percent.

7
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:20,019
- Pretty good for our first rush.
- Least we got some.

8
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,937
20 is respectable number.

9
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,148
We're just gonna have to give out
some snap bids.

10
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,026
I hate to ask this,
but I need a rent check.

11
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:28,762
For the house?

12
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:30,996
Of course.

13
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,641
- Welcome to Titan Tower Apartments.
- Thanks.

14
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:39,705
I'll admit I was taken aback
when you added two gentlemen roommates.

15
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:42,083
But these two look responsible.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,939
Come on Griffin, not again!

17
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:00,036
- Have you seen my backpack?
- It's on the hook by the door.

18
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,327
We have a hook by the door?

19
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:05,680
We also have a fairly awesome set
of nesting saucepans here.

20
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:08,018
Just figured we might as well
share the blessings.

21
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:09,920
He hath bestowed upon us, right?

22
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:12,238
That's where
the smell's coming from.

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,768
What? This is your classic
bluegrass scramble,

24
00:01:14,893 --> 00:01:16,363
couple glasses of Sunny D.

25
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:19,370
That we're outta the dorm we are gonna
start every day with a home-cooked meal.

26
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:21,122
I need to go to the bookstore.

27
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:23,643
School supplies can wait.

28
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:26,419
We are 43 minutes from walking
into hostile territory here.

29
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,045
It's an Art History class.

30
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:30,211
We're highly intelligent
men of science

31
00:01:30,336 --> 00:01:32,383
who use logic and reason
to make our decisions.

32
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:35,964
If we have to descend
into the land of liberal arts, so be it,

33
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:38,431
but I will not let you face it
on an empty stomach. I won't.

34
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:40,435
You're making the right move.

35
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:42,904
Smell that.
Look how it congeals.

36
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:45,688
That'll set your day off.
Get a big gut-full of that.

37
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:48,941
So, what's in this?

38
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,193
You know... Eggs, butter,

39
00:01:51,383 --> 00:01:53,112
sweet corn, country ham.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,451
A little cheese product.
Although I did have to substitute

41
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:59,368
Spam for the ham.
And I couldn't find any sweet corn

42
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:02,216
so I ended up usin'
sweet pickle relish instead.

43
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:05,166
I really,
really need those supplies.

44
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,334
Come on!

45
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,880
Come on, Come on,
give me a good number here.

46
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:12,313
Big money.

47
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,677
Stupid calculator. I hate you.

48
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:18,512
We're already cutting corners.

49
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:21,142
If we don't get some more sisters
in this house pronto,

50
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,762
we're going to have to...

51
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,143
raise dues.

52
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:29,231
- Hello, Casey
- What? Sorry.

53
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,069
My women's studies class,
Sex, Power, and Politics, starts today,

54
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:37,739
and I don't want it to be a repeat
of my summer internship in DC.

55
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:39,763
So, I want to be prepared

56
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,120
and taken seriously, I'd start the day
off with the Washington Post.

57
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:46,499
- You're reading the horoscope.
- As a warm-up.

58
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,210
Is our kitchen staff hiding
or did Frannie steal them, too?

59
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,635
Good morning to you.

60
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,867
Not if we have to bus
and wash our own dishes.

61
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:54,256
Have you seen the kitchen?

62
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,555
A Friday mixer with the Kappa Taus
is one thing.

63
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,178
Living like them 24-7 is just gross.

64
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,385
We can't really afford
a full kitchen staff.

65
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,932
But I did hire a student hasher
over the phone yesterday

66
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:07,394
- and he should be here...
- Sorry. I'm looking for Ashleigh?

67
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,067
What? Me. Hi, I'm Ashleigh.

68
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,574
I'm Fisher. The new hasher.

69
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:16,828
I'm Betsy.

70
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,521
Anyway, I'm late on my first day,
I'll spare you the story about my bike

71
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:25,454
and the car that cut me off and...
I'll just get to work.

72
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,135
I got that.

73
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:38,762
There you go.

74
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:44,682
He's a keeper.

Welcome to Perspectives
on the High Renaissance.

79
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,256
You'll find your syllabus
next to the projector.

80
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:10,124
No labs, no equations on the board,

81
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:11,458
no board.

82
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,236
This class actually
doesn't look bad.

83
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:15,739
I don't know, man.

84
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,340
Aren't you a little curious
about the verbiage? Liberal Arts?

85
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,324
It seems like it could attract
a certain element.

86
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,478
You know?

87
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,555
Like Socialists, tree-huggers,

88
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,420
general deviants.

89
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,640
I barely slept.

90
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:34,057
Again I just...
Griffin just kept doing it.

91
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,709
All night long.

92
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:40,116
I get that you people,
most of you people,

93
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:42,646
want to have sex,
and that's fine. I don't care.

94
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:45,063
I just don't want to see it.
Or hear it.

95
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,699
Or feel it...

96
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:49,450
brushing up against my leg
in the middle of the night.

97
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:50,915
Let's get started, please.

98
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:53,699
The word Renaissance

99
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:56,063
means rebirth.

100
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:58,581
But as we focus

101
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:01,641
on the artists of the 15th
and 16th century this semester,

102
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:05,062
one might argue that it refers...

103
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,229
to an exploration of the flesh.

104
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:13,882
Correggio's Venus, Cupid and Satyr.

105
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:15,209
Those are boobs.

106
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:18,025
Pretty much Sums up my morning.

107
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,195
On your syllabus you'll see that
Correggio is our artist for week one.

108
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,906
- Where do we get the syllabus?
- For a taste

109
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:26,071
of week two...

110
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,536
- I'll get you one.
- Here is

111
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,957
Leonardo's Vitruvian Man.

112
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,252
- Better.
- Moving on to week three...

113
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,514
Hurry up.

114
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,069
Sex, power, and politics, please.

115
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,323
Thank God I'm not late.
Pilates class ran long this morning.

116
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:10,384
There was a traffic jam getting on
the reformer, so, you know.

117
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,161
Casey?
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,914
I should ask you that question.

119
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,958
I'm just broadening my horizons.

120
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,002
Or should I say
horizoning my broads?

121
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:20,684
That was the teacher.

122
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,710
Good morning, everybody.
I hope we're all ready

123
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,966
to dive into the theme
of blurring traditional gender lines

124
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,515
in world politics.

125
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:36,184
You know,
every year there's at least one male

126
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,015
who tries to broaden
his horizons by taking this class.

127
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,887
That's me. <i>Vive la femme</i>!

128
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:48,907
How you doing?

129
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:54,049
And every semester,
that experiment fails.

130
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:57,583
Miserably, scholastically
and otherwise.

131
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,521
So good luck to you, sir.

132
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,856
Now let's roll up our sleeves
and dig in to the Middle East.

133
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:12,194
So...

134
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:13,849
Fisher.

135
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,726
What kind of motorcycle do you have?

136
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,063
Is it a big fat hog?

137
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,188
No, it's a Triumph.

138
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:25,903
Does your girlfriend
ride on the back?

139
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,283
Excuse me.

140
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:34,411
- Ashleigh, do you have a second?
- Sure Fisher.

141
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:38,198
Girls?

142
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:42,368
Let's give them some privacy.

143
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:47,596
Sorry. They're weird.

144
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,922
Or, lonely.

145
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,427
What's up?

146
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,264
There's something you should know.

147
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:57,684
I got fired from the last
three sororities where I worked.

148
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:01,557
This might come off
kinda arrogant. It's just that...

149
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,601
every house I've worked in,
the girls have...

150
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,791
kind of gone crazy.
Over me.

151
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:11,987
First it's just flirting,
but it always evolves into stalking.

152
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:13,492
Anyway, the point is,

153
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:16,990
everywhere I go,
somehow I end up being a distraction.

154
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,051
And, then I get fired.

155
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:25,671
I mean, oh!

156
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:28,297
The reason I didn't tell you
in the first place is because

157
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:31,361
I'm putting myself through school
and I really, really need this job.

158
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:34,632
So, could you maybe
say something to your sisters

159
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,064
- to get them to back off a bit?
- Yeah, sure.

160
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:41,687
No ZBZ sister will bother you.
Promise.

161
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:51,842
Did it look as bad as it felt?
Be honest.

162
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:54,960
It was pretty much
the worst public display

163
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,007
since Fergie wet her pants on stage.

164
00:08:57,132 --> 00:09:00,010
- Incontinence is a growing epidemic.
- I'm dropping the class.

165
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,673
I'll take an elective
in literature next semester.

166
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:04,911
I'll never see any
of those people again.

167
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,173
Until what? The next thing happens?
Then you're gonna drop that class, too?

168
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:11,924
I mean, come on, Rusty.
Just drop out of society, then.

169
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,596
You know? Join that cult.
Get you three teenage wives.

170
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,640
'Cause fear is a downward spiral
that knows no bottom.

171
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:25,898
I just wanted to make sure you're OK.
Spill looked pretty painful.

172
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,065
- Wasn't as bad as it looked.
- You just said it almost...

173
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,688
Dale! We gotta go.

174
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:32,477
- We have nowhere to go.
- Now.

175
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,409
It was extremely cool you tried
to help me out. Thank you.

176
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:39,012
No problem.

177
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,616
I'm Jordan.

178
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:43,535
I don't usually run
after guys to say hello, but...

179
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,460
Oh, God, you're bleeding.

180
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:47,798
What?

181
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:54,218
Yeah, that's nothing.

182
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:58,062
What'd you think of the class?

183
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,612
It was my first class actually.
I just transferred.

184
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,559
I don't know anyone. Not a soul.

185
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,395
Now you know the guy
who face-planted in Art History.

186
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,071
And bled a little.

187
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:09,481
Very true. All right.

188
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:11,710
So now that
you're my first friend at CRU,

189
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:14,071
can you tell me
where the social science quad is?

190
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,659
You see that brick building
way out in the distance?

191
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,341
Directly behind that.

192
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,164
No way.
OK, I have to run, like, literally.

193
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:27,167
- Are you gonna be OK?
- Yeah, thank you.

194
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:29,253
All right. I'll see you
in class Thursday.

195
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:39,985
I think I have a girl crush on her.
She totally put you in your place.

196
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,240
A girl crush?
You and Professor Freeman?

197
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:44,142
Hold on, let me get a visual here...

198
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:48,065
- You're aggressive!
- You're disgusting.

199
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:50,665
Which reminds me,

200
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,627
your house better be clean
for the KT-ZBZ mixers this Friday.

201
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:56,272
Since when are ZBZ sisters
worried about being dirty?

202
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,291
Cappie's in
my Women's Studies class.

203
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,419
That's an interesting area
for you to study.

204
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:11,920
I love studying women.

205
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,006
This guy...

206
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:17,406
- How's your beaker?
- My...

207
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,790
I'm working
with a cement compound now, so...

208
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,389
So?

209
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,268
So, we don't use beakers.
Not enough tensile strength.

210
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:29,239
- Yeah, me, too.
- I am so gonna be late for my class.

211
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:31,321
- Weren't you going to walk me?
- Yes.

212
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,153
See ya.

213
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,737
Douche.

214
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,157
I'm sorry,
did you just call me a douche?

215
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:44,995
- What's that?
- You just called me a douche.

216
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:47,622
What? I don't say...

217
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,126
OK, the last time I saw you,
you said it then, too.

218
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:54,546
- I'm sure he didn't, Max.
- No, he did.

219
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,673
I not sure I like
what you're inferring.

220
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,175
- Implying.
- Exactly.

221
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:00,115
Hello! Late for class.

222
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,138
Education's important.
We're the future.

223
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:04,922
We should go.

224
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,183
Never mind.

225
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:08,891
Douche.

226
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:14,299
They're guys. That's what they do.

227
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:17,641
They act all tough
and call each other names.

228
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:21,324
Suck it, douche!

229
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,279
See?

230
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:26,820
Maybe. I just don't want this to turn
into the same nightmare

231
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:28,909
that was Evan and Cappie last year.

232
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:31,106
Maybe that should
tell you something.

233
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:33,520
Maybe I should do something
before it spirals out of control?

234
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:37,047
That maybe God didn't create
the universe for boyfriends

235
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,029
and ex-boyfriends to get along.

236
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,927
But this is Max and Cappie.

237
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,513
They're great guys.
They shouldn't just get along,

238
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,277
they should be friends.
Is that not possible?

239
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:50,819
It's as possible as us finding
three girls to give snap bids.

240
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:53,146
We only have this week to do it.

241
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,859
Beautiful night?

242
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,320
The moon just
lights up the whole sky.

243
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,324
Someone took a club drug?

244
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:06,743
I met a girl.

245
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:09,955
She's beautiful,
and smart, and funny.

246
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:12,233
That's great, Rus.

247
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:13,917
Does she want to join ZBZ?

248
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,809
- I don't know.
- You should ask her.

249
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:20,173
Because we're unofficially
desperate for sisters.

250
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:23,260
I don't really know
if she's the sorority type.

251
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:26,709
You said she's a girl, you said
she's beautiful, and you said...

252
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:29,102
What else did you say?

253
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:32,394
Do it, Rus. Before Ashleigh
calls you a douche.

254
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,753
And I will, bro.

255
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,051
Omicron, Pi, Rho,
Sigma, Tau, Upsilon,

256
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:49,035
Phi, Psi, Chi, Omega.

257
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,013
- And spicy ketchup.
- Where'd you score these?

258
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:54,207
In the fridge behind Beaver's socks.

259
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,563
Well done. Have some fries, pledge.

260
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:57,836
Yes, sir.

261
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,758
You should ask that girl out, Rus.

262
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:03,049
That's what my roommate does and it
clearly works for him. All night long.

263
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,448
See, showing up at her dorm
is what freshman Rusty would do.

264
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:09,139
Sophomore Rusty is a different guy.

265
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:11,308
Sophomore Rusty is patient.

266
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,388
He plays it cool.
He's not a stalker.

267
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:17,731
He builds
that foundation of friendship,

268
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,564
and he waits for the fates to conspire
to create that perfect moment.

269
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:24,254
And he talks about himself
in the third person.

270
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,449
I'll talk to her in class,
and see what happens.

271
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:31,314
I don't know, man. I'm with Calvin.
I think you should just go for it.

272
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,113
- Always worked for me.
- You're a freshman, Andy.

273
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:38,084
Calvin's gay.
Women in college are different,

274
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:39,443
trust me.

275
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,421
You'll see, little Padawan.

276
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,519
You'll see.

277
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:59,395
I hope you don't mind
that I study down here.

278
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,234
I always get really... restless...

279
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:04,159
in the bedroom.

280
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:05,100
You know?

281
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:06,320
Yeah, sure.

282
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:12,037
I'm so tired!
I could use a pick me up.

283
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,912
If I make the coffee, will you...

284
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:28,229
foam the milk?

285
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,684
Your girlfriend called.
She said she had another outbreak.

286
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:42,941
And she said to get more ointment.

287
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:44,974
I'm tired.

288
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,361
Night everybody!

289
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:53,311
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but pretty genius.

290
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:54,436
Right?

291
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,317
So, your girlfriend's name is Vivian,
she studies design,

292
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,165
and you met her last
summer in Dayton.

293
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,132
Sounds like a great girl.

294
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,516
I mean, aside from her unfortunate,

295
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:05,422
condition.

296
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,799
I wouldn't let you
date just anybody.

297
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:12,674
- Do you have a real girlfriend?
- Nope.

298
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,725
I don't have herpes, either.

299
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,634
In case you were wondering.

300
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:20,874
Awesome!

301
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:27,899
All right.

302
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,569
You get back to work.

303
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,160
Just getting my book,
so I'm really not looking.

304
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:55,167
- Hey, man. Where've you been?
- Running late, Cal.

305
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:58,891
OK. Listen, man.
Griffin is a total horn-dog.

306
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:01,897
- I don't even think he goes to class.
- That's awesome.

307
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,248
No, it's not. It's a nightmare.

308
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,399
I was wondering,
since you're my big brother,

309
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,683
and the president of the fraternity,
you could help me get me

310
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,292
get a different roommate.

311
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:14,240
It's probably too late for that.

312
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,561
What am I supposed to do?
I haven't slept in two nights.

313
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:21,607
I don't know.
Buy some earplugs?

314
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,677
Good morning.

315
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,347
I know you called me
a douche yesterday.

316
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:41,685
I think you're paranoid
and a bit delusional

317
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,270
and from the looks of it,
a hair over-caffeinated.

318
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:47,691
- One of these is for Casey.
- No duh. Are you always so literal?

319
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,360
- Did you just say "no duh?"
- Are you always so deaf?

320
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,694
You called me a douche.

321
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,422
What'd you get her?

322
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:59,077
- Mocha, soy milk, three shots.
- Half-caf?

323
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,996
- She doesn't drink half-caf.
- She has since I've known her.

324
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,433
But maybe now that she's with you,
she needs the caffeine to stay awake.

325
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:10,547
Or, maybe she just realized she'd rather
be alert than go through life like...

326
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:13,883
- Like what?
- Like you.

327
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:16,264
What's going on?

328
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,881
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

329
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:18,805
Guys?

330
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,349
You'd better get to class!

331
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:26,413
Thanks.

332
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:28,176
You're welcome.

333
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,030
I'll see you later.

334
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,864
Notice the satisfied posture,

335
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:39,367
the seductively-parted lips.

336
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,164
Is it hard

337
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,402
to imagine the state

338
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:47,292
of the Satyr's genitalia, so...

339
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:50,962
subtly hidden
behind the blue drapery?

340
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:56,071
See you all next week.

341
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:06,351
- I can't believe she didn't show.
- I can't believe I'm still awake.

342
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,895
Griffin and Jenna had another
marathon session last night.

343
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,440
Is her last name Talia?

344
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,378
Jenna? Jenna Talia?

345
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,957
- This class is getting to me.
- I'm sorry I'm late,

346
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:21,514
Professor Summerfield.
I really don't want to fall behind,

347
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:24,204
so is it possible for me
to watch your lecture online?

348
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:26,689
The Internet is where art

349
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,896
goes to die, young lady.

350
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,829
You're welcome to stay
and look at the slides,

351
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:34,146
but I can't help you
with the lecture.

352
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,966
I took notes.
I can help you through it, if you want.

353
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,187
You're awesome.

354
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:42,129
I'm awesome.

355
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,268
So, without looking at your notes,

356
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:50,438
what do Kollontai, Suu Kyi,

357
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,148
and Meir had in common?

358
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,527
Besides being incredible women
and effective leaders?

359
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,536
I believe if you look at the political
careers of all three women...

360
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:10,065
the common thread is a strong record
of conflict resolution.

361
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,294
That's exactly right.

362
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:17,546
By the way,
I'm available as a study partner,

363
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:19,896
or for anyone
who just wants to spoon.

364
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,303
So generous of you to offer.
Thank you.

365
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:24,975
So. Bear in mind
what we've been discussing.

366
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,016
It is a woman's instinct

367
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,845
that compels her
to resolve conflict.

368
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,731
That's why these women were so effective
at bringing opposing parties together.

369
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:38,069
Great class, everybody.
See you next week. Thank you.

370
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:50,999
Deer in the headlights, Case.
They don't have a chance.

371
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,041
Maybe I'll even take you up
on your offer.

372
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,211
- Spooning?
- Studying.

373
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,298
- You free later today?
- For actually studying?

374
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,217
Where we actually... study?

375
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,470
Dobler's, 2:00?

376
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:07,455
Drinking and studying.
Yes. That I can do.

377
00:21:16,238 --> 00:21:18,046
You wanna meet me for a late lunch?

378
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:21,905
So this new concrete would mean

379
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,699
any new road or freeway would be,
like, 20 percent thinner.

380
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,764
Which is interesting because all
the natural resources you would save,

381
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:29,954
like gypsum.
This is really boring, isn't it?

382
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,959
I like gypsum.

383
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,290
And I like you even more.

384
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:42,081
A kiss goodbye?
Always tugs at the heart strings.

385
00:21:42,206 --> 00:21:43,509
You are leaving, aren't you?

386
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,499
What are you doing here?

387
00:21:49,328 --> 00:21:51,555
I was invited by Casey. To study.

388
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,810
And drink.

389
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,605
OK, so I invited you both.

390
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,359
So you two could talk and resolve
the conflict between you two.

391
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,153
- You set this up?
- That is spectacularly lame.

392
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,977
Maybe, but...

393
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,741
you can't shake hands
with a clenched fist.

394
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,285
Indira Gandhi said that.

395
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,954
That was not in our reading.

396
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:15,124
It was in my horoscope,
in <i>The Washington Post</i>.

397
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,651
Never mind. The point is,
you guys could be friends,

398
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:22,544
and that's never gonna happen
unless you guys talk.

399
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,218
Why don't you talk about
whatever your problem is with Max?

400
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,152
Let's just get it out in the open.

401
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,973
I don't have a problem with Max.

402
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,142
I don't.

403
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:35,979
How about your feelings
about Cappie?

404
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,149
I'm fine with my feelings
about Cappie.

405
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,527
Come on.

406
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:45,780
The longer we avoid dealing with this,
the worse it's going to get.

407
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,323
I should get back.

408
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:49,563
Yeah, good luck paving
that driveway.

409
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:50,987
Yeah, good luck...

410
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:54,249
with your extensive
jewelry collection.

411
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,543
The next time
you want a study buddy,

412
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:02,422
why don't you just ask
that frowny girl with the overbite.

413
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:11,806
This one is called
<i>Leda and the Swan</i>.

414
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,805
It's from the Greek myth.

415
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,749
Zeus was in love
with this beautiful mortal woman

416
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:18,938
named Leda,

417
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,899
so he transformed himself
into a swan

418
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,930
and impregnated her.

419
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,834
Wait. She had sex with a swan?

420
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,849
How does that work?

421
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,542
Actually,
it's an anatomical impossibility.

422
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:35,246
What about this one?

423
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:38,332
This one is called <i>Danae</i>.

424
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:40,460
Is she giving birth?

425
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:44,432
Apparently, she's being
impregnated by a curtain

426
00:23:45,052 --> 00:23:46,272
of divine rain.

427
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:48,495
That makes more sense.

428
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,138
Our dog has sex
with our curtains all the time.

429
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,727
That's why my mom bought blinds.

430
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,932
You know, I'm actually
really glad I missed class.

431
00:23:58,057 --> 00:23:59,990
It's so much more fun
doing this with you.

432
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,058
I think Professor Summerfield
needs to...

433
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,901
get out more.

434
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:07,166
Or buy some curtains.

435
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:11,628
What's next?

436
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,703
- Can I ask you a question?
- Are you gonna ask me out?

437
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:24,497
Do you...

438
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:28,091
want to join a sorority?

439
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:36,975
What can I do for you?

440
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,939
I've been thinking. A lot.

441
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,774
About conflict resolution

442
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:48,736
and the challenges faced
by our great female leaders.

443
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,030
- Great.
- And I'm wondering

444
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,337
what they did when the...

445
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,994
opposing parties wouldn't even
acknowledge the conflict?

446
00:24:58,034 --> 00:24:59,288
Can you be more specific?

447
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:05,837
It sort of involves... my boyfriend.

448
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,133
And another person
who is technically my ex-boyfriend.

449
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:12,426
And, conflict ensues.

450
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:15,840
So you'd like
to exploit the principles

451
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:18,766
you learn in my class
for the sake of your social life.

452
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:21,144
Is that bad?

453
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,322
Honestly, its nauseating.

454
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:26,482
But I was a girl
with a social life not long ago.

455
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,550
Let's start with you.

456
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:34,410
Women are wired

457
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,551
to desire harmony.
It's in our DNA.

458
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:38,786
That's why we care about things

459
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:40,788
like world hunger
and the environment.

460
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,488
Or spirit week!

461
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:43,817
Or spirit week.

462
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:46,878
Men, on the other hand,
are more ego-driven.

463
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,505
Actually, that's nothing
like my boyfriend at all.

464
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:51,841
No, it's not personality.
It's DNA.

465
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:54,338
He's probably reluctant
to confront the problem

466
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:57,430
because he can't see anything
to gain by doing so.

467
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,866
So I have to give them each
something to gain.

468
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,766
Either that, or get 'em drunk

469
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:03,930
and let them slug it out
in a basement somewhere.

470
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:05,855
After all, boys will be boys.

471
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:16,449
- You going home?
- Yeah. Got a paper to write.

472
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,920
But I wanted to say thanks.
Ever since...

473
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,965
Vivian and her herpes
came into my life

474
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,543
the other girls have pretty much
left me alone.

475
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:26,918
You've kind of been my superhero.

476
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:30,982
Saving hot guys from the clutches
of horny girls everywhere!

477
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:34,978
I meant temperature hot.

478
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,048
Is the air conditioner even working?

479
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,851
Hey, guys!

480
00:26:48,412 --> 00:26:49,412
Night!

481
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,192
Let this be a lesson.

482
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,911
Herpes can afflict
even the hot dudes.

483
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,399
But, the triethanolamine level has
nothing to do with the agglomeration.

484
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,376
- If you'd give me a chance to show...
- Butter nut crunch!

485
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:12,980
No, sir, I do not think
I'm a smarty-pants.

486
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:16,649
If I were a smarty-pants
I would tell you that...

487
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:20,374
I'll see you tomorrow.

488
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:28,591
Every day I try and tell myself that
working in concrete is more than just...

489
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:31,857
working in concrete.
But it just... isn't.

490
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:33,968
Wanna talk about it?

491
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,737
I just wanna be with you.

492
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:40,138
Then let me feed you ice cream.

493
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:44,597
- All right.
- And apologize for Dobler's.

494
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:47,402
I was so focused
on getting you and Cappie together

495
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:50,042
that I never really figured out
how to get you to talk.

496
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,836
I don't know
we have much to talk about.

497
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:55,131
But you're both great guys.
You should be friends.

498
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,087
- Why?
- Because...

499
00:27:58,598 --> 00:27:59,598
Because...

500
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:03,388
Because it's nice to have friends.

501
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:06,851
- I already have friends.
- But don't you want more?

502
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,699
You can never have too many.

503
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:12,732
But he doesn't like me.
Why would I want to be friends with him?

504
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:18,220
I'm in a relationship

505
00:28:18,903 --> 00:28:20,744
with this amazing guy

506
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:23,260
who I really care about.

507
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:25,600
And I've got this friend,

508
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:28,474
who I dated, yes, and OK,

509
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,167
maybe he's sort of annoying,

510
00:28:32,056 --> 00:28:34,019
but I really care about him, too.

511
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,468
And...

512
00:28:38,036 --> 00:28:39,878
maybe I'm being selfish,

513
00:28:40,374 --> 00:28:42,891
but I don't want
to have to give up one of them.

514
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:44,661
I did that...

515
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:46,438
once before...

516
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:48,377
and it sucks.

517
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:51,815
I just want to feel like...

518
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,400
I can be your girlfriend

519
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,901
and Cappie's friend
all at the same time.

520
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:59,498
So, it would make you happy
if we got along?

521
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,468
That's all you had to say.

522
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,416
Really?

523
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:09,150
I love you, Casey.

524
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:16,155
I love you, too.

525
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:27,110
So...

526
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,689
What do you want me to do now?

527
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,228
Say it again.

528
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:36,893
I love you, Casey.

529
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,241
But I meant...

530
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,905
what do you want me to do now
about me and Cappie.

531
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,105
Come to the mixer with me?

532
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:51,321
I can do that.

533
00:29:55,142 --> 00:29:56,363
I love you, too.

534
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:22,143
Not bad. Not good, but...

535
00:30:22,497 --> 00:30:24,930
It doesn't have
that neglected men's room smell anymore.

536
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:26,435
Look out below!

537
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,325
We gotta make this thing go faster.

538
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:35,898
Excuse me.

539
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:40,088
Do you have a water-based,
dry-glide silicone in a moly spray?

540
00:30:40,683 --> 00:30:42,796
- Moly?
- The basic...

541
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,429
- He's fine. Let's mingle.
- I have to find Cappie.

542
00:30:53,657 --> 00:30:55,686
Dude, you're wearing a skirt.

543
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:58,499
- It's called a sarong, moron.
- I'd call it a so right.

544
00:30:58,624 --> 00:30:59,631
Would you?

545
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,170
You made it!

546
00:31:14,032 --> 00:31:16,932
- Looks like a great party!
- We always have the best!

547
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:20,001
Beer bottle juggling guy!

548
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:21,768
Awesome!

549
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:24,547
Kappa Tau's definitely
a unique experience.

550
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:27,932
But once you get to know it,
you can't help but love it.

551
00:31:28,057 --> 00:31:29,069
I can tell.

552
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:33,681
- There's my sister.
- Come on, I'll introduce you.

553
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:35,767
Can I make a confession?

554
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:37,325
Sure.

555
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:40,396
I'm a little nervous
about the whole sorority thing.

556
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,857
I don't usually make friends
with these kind of girls.

557
00:31:42,982 --> 00:31:44,526
Really, any girls.

558
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:46,964
But that's the great thing
about the Greek system.

559
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:49,761
There's a place for everybody.
No matter who you are,

560
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:53,033
there's an entire house full
of guys, or girls

561
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:55,246
who are ready to be your friend

562
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,413
and support you no matter what.

563
00:31:58,748 --> 00:32:00,861
- That sounds kind of great.
- It is.

564
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,127
And if it's not this sorority,
it'll be another one.

565
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,101
Don't stress about it.

566
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,593
Who's your friend?

567
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,179
Casey, this is Jordan.
The girl I was telling you about.

568
00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:14,764
Nice to meet you!

569
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,975
So you're interested in joining ZBZ?

570
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:20,186
- I think so.
- Cool!

571
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:35,830
Shape-shifter.

572
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,294
When last we met,
you looked suspiciously

573
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:39,998
like one of Frannie's IKI clones.

574
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:43,173
That. I was just spying for ZBZ.

575
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,433
Spying?
What's your next assignment,

576
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:47,380
wiretapping
your dad's satellite offices?

577
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,300
The only satellite my dad has
is attached to the DVR at home.

578
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,538
He gave up his Senate seat.

579
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,086
Yikes.

580
00:32:55,384 --> 00:32:58,350
No longer the senator's daughter.
How will we categorize you?

581
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,337
I've been giving that
some thought myself.

582
00:33:00,462 --> 00:33:02,854
You know, it's been four months
since we broke up.

583
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:05,907
So, you can officially
categorize me as...

584
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,735
a friend.

585
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,505
The four-month rule.

586
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:12,035
I guess if we had this conversation
two weeks ago,

587
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,033
- it would've been totally awkward.
- Timing's everything.

588
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:27,734
Scouting the talent, Spitter?

589
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:34,530
Where are the Jell-o shots?

590
00:33:34,655 --> 00:33:35,655
Here!

591
00:33:43,615 --> 00:33:47,524
A non-greek at a greek mixer?
Not in my backyard. Sorry, Case.

592
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:51,094
You know how persnickety
the interfraternity council can be.

593
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,660
You don't because you're not Greek.
I don't make the rules.

594
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:55,288
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Max.

595
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:57,888
- Excuse us.
- I'll be right back for you.

596
00:33:58,325 --> 00:33:59,328
Screw the rules.

597
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:02,038
Including the one that says
you and Max can't get along.

598
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:04,446
Good God, woman,
are you on repeat with this?

599
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:08,377
Listen to me. You are my friend,
and I care about you.

600
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:10,296
But Max is my boyfriend.

601
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,547
If things keep going this way,

602
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:15,649
and if I have to choose
between you and my boyfriend?

603
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,263
Then, I'm sorry, but I'm going
to end up choosing him.

604
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,391
What? Did he give you
an ultimatum? Like Evan?

605
00:34:20,637 --> 00:34:23,328
He didn't, but I'm giving you one.

606
00:34:23,882 --> 00:34:26,263
If you care, at all,
about our friendship,

607
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,815
you'll figure out a way
to make this work.

608
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:31,837
Please.

609
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:57,622
- Where are you going?
- To make my move.

610
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,221
Go for it!

611
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:30,857
All right.
Everybody out, now. Let's go!

612
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,868
Let's go, come on!

613
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:44,016
Rhino?

614
00:35:50,886 --> 00:35:53,395
- Listen, Cappie...
- Just let me think, OK?

615
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:56,694
I gotta figure out
how we're going to...

616
00:35:58,194 --> 00:35:58,947
bond.

617
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,450
We can get drunk.

618
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:04,160
We'll end up getting in a fight.

619
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:06,746
Wait. That's not a bad idea.
We could fight.

620
00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:08,831
That's how we bond.

621
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,294
Like in <i>Fight Club</i>.
That's brilliant, right?

622
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:16,423
All right. Max, I want you to hit me.
As hard as you can.

623
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,916
I don't think getting bruised
and bloody is what Casey wants.

624
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,885
Good point.
We'll stick to the body.

625
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:24,123
Nothing below the ribs.
Actually, avoid the ribs altogether,

626
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:25,727
I'm kinda sore from Pilates.

627
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:28,101
I'm not going to hit you.
That's the stupidest idea.

628
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,809
I don't hear anything better.

629
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:32,244
- 'Cause you won't shut up!
- If you would just...

630
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:39,196
Look, I get why you don't like me.

631
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,867
I'm this weird, sort of quiet guy

632
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:46,479
who's usually in his head.
I don't have your sense of humor, or...

633
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,704
The mumbling,
that's really annoying.

634
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:54,297
Meanwhile, you know Casey's just about
the greatest girl you could ever know.

635
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:57,032
And I'm the one who brings her coffee.
And that...

636
00:36:57,554 --> 00:36:58,715
probably sucks.

637
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:05,472
There's no way
we're gonna be friends, is there?

638
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,432
Then let's try something else.

639
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,944
What can I say except mazeltov,
my little Golda Meir!

640
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,448
- You were right. This guy's awesome!
- This guy is the awesome one.

641
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,825
You shut up. Shut up.

642
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,992
- Stop it!
- What happened?

643
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,043
It was like you said.

644
00:37:30,418 --> 00:37:32,181
As soon as we got
a chance to just talk...

645
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:35,369
We figured out it was just
a big man-crush. Right, pal?

646
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:37,349
A man-crush.
Just a big man-crush.

647
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:38,874
That's all it was.

648
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,300
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

649
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:43,885
That's right.

650
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,991
Look, how about we go get a beer,

651
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:49,253
you big bag of douche!

652
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:55,647
He called me a douche.

653
00:37:56,365 --> 00:37:57,482
That's hilarious.

654
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:03,947
- You think they bought it?
- Dude, we were spot on.

655
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,925
- Men are the worst liars.
- Seriously.

656
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,318
At least they're trying, though.

657
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:11,374
I guess part of being
a great leader is knowing

658
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:13,443
you can't change human nature.

659
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,877
Sometimes you have to just tame it.

660
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:23,300
There you are.

661
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,510
Ashleigh told me
that ZBZ's gonna offer me a snap bid.

662
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,764
I don't know what that is,
but I think it means they want me.

663
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:31,820
- How cool is that?
- Pretty cool.

664
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:35,611
Thank you so much.
I was totally lost here until I met you.

665
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:38,439
We're heading back to the house.
Come check it out!

666
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,697
- See you in class, right?
- See you in class.

667
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:49,367
Kick-ass party?

668
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:52,274
I love this place.

669
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,613
Did your girl ever show up?

670
00:38:56,193 --> 00:38:59,751
Tough break, man.
I just met this awesome chick.

671
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:01,387
So cool.

672
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:03,130
Go get me a beer, pledge.

673
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:29,281
What are you doing here so late?

674
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:32,876
I got an 8:00 AM class,
so I figured I'd get my work done now.

675
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:34,651
You want me to come back?

676
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,623
I need to go to bed anyway.

677
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:41,714
Superheroes need their sleep, too.

678
00:39:44,786 --> 00:39:46,382
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

679
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:55,474
Sleep well.

680
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:58,215
You, too.

681
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,982
When you, eventually, go to sleep.

682
00:40:09,904 --> 00:40:11,854
I don't want to be
a superhero anymore.

683
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,535
I want to hang up my cape.

684
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,371
What about Vivian?

685
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,057
She called.

686
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:21,834
Said she wanted to break up
with you.

687
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:43,481
What's going on?

688
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:45,166
You want to tell him?

689
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:48,403
There's actually two girls in Ohio
named Jenna Talia.

690
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:51,075
We found'em on
my Christian social networking site.

691
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,225
That's not what I was talking about.

692
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:57,746
I was just gonna crash a couple nights.
You know, hope Griffin gets tired.

693
00:40:58,026 --> 00:41:00,206
That way, I can catch up
on some sexless sleep.

694
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:04,001
I think it's safe to say
there'll be no sex in this apartment.

695
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,086
Thanks, buddy.

696
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,423
Did something happen at the mixer?

697
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,795
I just don't get
how it's so easy for some guys.

698
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,554
Like all they have to do is exist
and they get the girl.

699
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:19,558
It's a gift. But, you know.
Heavy is the crown, too.

700
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:26,316
- What is this?
- That's an Arkansas Shipwreck.

701
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,742
You take leftover
bluegrass scrambler

702
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:31,321
and leftover tuna casserole
and just kind of mash'em together.

703
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:32,738
What do you think?

704
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:34,777
It's not that bad.

705
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,155
Sorry, guys. I gotta go.

706
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:46,869
All right.

707
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:11,995
Thanks.

708
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:14,703
You OK?

709
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,366
- I'm all right.
- Where's your car?

710
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,920
I think it got stolen.

711
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:22,418
The <i>Iron Man</i> car?

712
00:42:24,103 --> 00:42:25,375
You call the police?

713
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,891
I did. I mean, I talked to them.

714
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:30,473
They'll find it, right?

715
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,757
Let's just go.
Let's get out of here, man.

716
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:36,278
Dude, what's going on?
Seriously.

717
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:39,000
- Don't forgot your bag.
- Thanks.

718
00:42:42,764 --> 00:42:44,181
I'll call you tomorrow?

719
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,629
I don't know what I'm doing.

720
00:42:56,124 --> 00:42:58,660
Just drive, man.
Let's just get out of here.
