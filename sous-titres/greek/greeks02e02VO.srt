I do not want Ítre killjoy.

173
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,614
I prefer Ítre fall joy.

174
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,675
As far as aa means.
Or, I do not know ...

175
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:46,411
<i> Forget </ i>.</i>

176
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,179
I guess you
know the topo.

177
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:53,749
I am the new
responsible Room.

178
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:58,503
L ‡ I am for the tragic events
such as the loss of your keys,

179
00:11:58,623 --> 00:11:59,878
<i> the absence of parents.  </ i></i>

180
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:03,476
But I hope you good Ites
with AA now.

181
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:07,417
<i> Or if you want to kill between,
or kill you, </ i></i>

182
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:10,608

183
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:14,611
But I do not know you at all.

184
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,830
I am l ‡.

185
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,629
He did not really
impose its authority.

186
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:31,748
It is because he knows that nobody
I can give sub-vÍtements.

187
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
<i>Almost . </ i></i>

188
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,893
- What are you doing?
- A game invented: the tower Kappa Tau.

189
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:47,978
We play for 4 hours.

190
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,522
Your breathing is the move.

191
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:55,078
Someone will have to remove
the hair of my shower.

192
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:01,075
Crap!

193
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,172
These things are demonic.

194
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,663
I finished your laundry.

195
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,926
- You have ironed my pants?
- You do not AA?

196
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,627
What's happening?

197
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:26,960
- How to AA?
- You dry the course,

198
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,688
do more homework.
Looks like a normal life of man.

199
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:35,652
I took a seminar on polymers
which becomes increasingly complicated.

200
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:38,564
It's hard for me
to stay motivated.

201
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,601
- And the problem is ...?
- C'est pas moi, AA.

202
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:47,637
- Forget it. You will not understand.
- Why not?

203
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:51,014
Because it is a serious problem.

204
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,054
This week, I learn

205
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:58,285
‡ Ítre understanding
the problems of others.

206
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,904
Tell me of yours.

207
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:06,094
¿11 years
with my first pocket money,

208
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:07,850
I bought the Sully Putty.

209
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,498
I had to buy a porno,
but still.

210
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:14,173
This is the best toy.
You can make a ball,

211
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:15,999
stretch as clay,

212
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:19,152
throw it against the ceiling
as a "Water-Gum"

213
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:22,997
if you support against a comic strip,
you can transfer the images.

214
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,427
Like Garfield?

215
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,569
- I love it.
- It is an incredible area,

216
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,945
and created by a man.
"May seem strange,

217
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:33,488
but I had to learn how.
So I was ‡ library

218
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:37,479
and y'avait this book on polymers
inorganic and everything was clarified.

219
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:40,775
Kevlar,
nylon,

220
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:42,268
Post-it,

221
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:44,406
tape.

222
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,291
The world is full
miracles humans.

223
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,529
And I could not wait to Ítre
‡ college ...

224
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Boring.

225
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:00,459
Life is too short.

226
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:08,827
Voil ‡, big problem solved.
I'm good l ‡ inside.

227
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:16,238
So the plan.

228
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:19,373
It sort of way, I give the box.
It is not difficult.

229
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,762
What counts
is how you submit.

230
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:23,926
You can not just
him as aa swinging.

231
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:25,550
Make aa well.

232
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:27,171
Tu cracks on it.

233
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,473
"Has seen this because you're fond ‡
on details.

On a mime teacher

238
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:43,351
I know because we kidding
his pronunciation of Matisse.

239
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:45,623
There is also aa drÙle.

240
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:49,285
Go Tom, shows up.

241
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,289
Sexy Ness monster.

242
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:09,095
J'en reviens pas
it is in our college.

243
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,911
I understand
what happens.

244
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:13,467
- We never liked the guy mÍme.
- And George Clooney!

245
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:15,185
We are in dangerous territory.

246
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,755
You know what?
You should have it.

247
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:21,108
You're crazy about him for a long time.

248
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:24,453
- OK.
- Really?

249
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:26,797
Because ...

250
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:30,054
We might share it.
I rise up and ...

251
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:31,319
Wait.

252
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,342
I think.

253
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:43,838
It is not the only ones on the spot.

254
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:46,261
Someone else calls?

255
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,552
Laura?
This little bitch.

256
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,971
No. I mean,
he should be able to choose his mime.

257
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:53,599
I guess.

258
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:56,739
So we invited the fite ‡,

259
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:59,152
seen with
aa that happens the better,

260
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:01,315
and one withdrew
respectfully.

261
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:04,702
- It's mature on our part.
- I know.

262
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:06,028
I like maturity.

263
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:10,240
How he gives the carton
without saying that the calls?

264
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,910
- How is aa?
- Uh, well.

265
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:16,826
One would like
that thou this invitation.

266
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:18,499
An invitation ZBZ?

267
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:21,529
I always riveted to have one.

268
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,636
And you give the
‡ this guy, ‡ l-low.

269
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:29,357
But tell him that it is not us.

270
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:38,152
Monster genetics.

271
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,660
It's not good.

272
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,971
When you pips life
benefits of the fruit.

273
00:17:58,217 --> 00:17:59,957
Dobler's going to discuss.

274
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:02,005
Why when you can act?

275
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,388
Disturbs your hair,
pretend Ítre of momentum,

276
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:05,558
and frustrated.

277
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,893
Sir ... Kwon.

278
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:23,178
You have before you two students
who are continuing on campus.

279
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:25,190
Our predators?
Photographers.

280
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:28,413
It can not go
and out of classes.

281
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,738
It requires a password Priority
for parking.

282
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:34,099
The terminal is the most selective?

283
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,006
You see someone
more deserving

284
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:39,571
or more vulnerable
Miss Rebecca Logan?

285
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:44,850
- The paparazzi?
- They are vicious.

286
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,773
‡ Ask Amy Winehouse.

287
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,552
Help me, Mr. Toby Kwon,
Ites you my only hope.

288
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,347
Okay, but this is not me
you've given.

289
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,501
Let us seize this moment.

290
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:04,897
The fruit, Miss Logan.

291
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:08,054
And voil ‡.

292
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:20,151
I think I need advice
a senior student in engineering.

293
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:29,392
‡ I have trouble staying focused and motivated
‡ my science courses polymers.

294
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:33,371
- Are you bored.
- "Has had never happened.

295
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:36,093
- It's too hard for you?
- Not really.

296
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,467
- It's a bit arrogant.
- I misspoke.

297
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,337
I've understood as aa.

298
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:44,186
You déj ‡ Ites asked if you Ites
‡ you in engineering?

299
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:50,667
But if aa bored,

300
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:53,612
Can you do better Ítre
to change course.

301
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:57,481
Really?
It's not too complicated?

302
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:00,744
Return to the program of excellence
‡ déj was very complex.

303
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:02,287
Just fill out a paper ‡.

304
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,039
Let my parents sign?

305
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:06,834
Or my adviser?

306
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:08,703
So it?

307
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:11,091
It's easy to abandon
a program of excellence.

308
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,020
My bank always becoming
a scientist in polymer

309
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,636
may end
with a single form.

310
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:34,059
It is also exciting
burial of a life as a young girl.

311
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,374
Except that is not trentenaires
immondes who sabotage them.

312
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:39,106
Vive maturity!

313
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:41,910
Have you seen my lucky gloss?

314
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,166
You wear heels?

315
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,031
Of course ˚ r, why?

316
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:54,506
'A give you an unfair advantage.

317
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,817
You believe her eyes more.

318
00:20:57,432 --> 00:21:00,679
I take my heels
if you take out your chicken breasts.

319
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,257
But what are you talking about?

320
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:06,969
Ah, aa?

321
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:09,926
I bet his eyes would be more
aa believe that my heels.

322
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:11,262
You're ridiculous.

323
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:14,192
Me ridiculous?
L ‡ is you who are ridiculous.

324
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,989
Sorry, I bother you?

325
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:20,944
No, I ...

326
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:24,022
Casey said just ‡
How I envy him.

327
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,662
They are beautiful.

328
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:29,829
Me, I love your smile.

329
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:32,169
Your teeth are like
snow-capped mountains.

330
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,939
- The fite Ítre goes too far, I ...
- I am still digesting.

331
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:04,612
"Will be a dilemma for him, because
is all magnificent.

332
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:06,534
Of body and mind.

333
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:09,099
And if a man should prefer
another girl that I,

334
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:11,063
- Aa must Ítre you.
- Same.

335
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:15,321
When does it happen?

336
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:21,927
This is Ashley, the spring break.

337
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:24,765
That's true. What coÔncidence.

338
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,192
- And Casey Cartwright.
- In the flesh.

339
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:32,187
I imagine that you
sent me the invitation.

340
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:33,662
- Me!
- Me!

341
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:47,152
Someone leaves you a form.

342
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:48,688
- What?
- Nothing.

343
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:52,492
You have entered in a contest
university or price?

344
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,366
A request for abandonment?

345
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,715
You abandoned the
polymer science?

346
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:03,122
- I think that's all.
- You can not make aa.

347
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,345
I have not decided yet.

348
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:07,930
You can not
Áa would be a big mistake.

349
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:10,642
Finally. Thank you.

350
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:12,759
Because I have a new roommate,

351
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:16,106
and I want to spend my last two
months with a tare fanatic.

352
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:18,356
Yes, aa would be horrible.

353
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:19,986
Why do I move?

354
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:23,956
This is the residence of good engineers,
not engineers means.

355
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:26,261
O ˘ is the advisor?

356
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:29,279
Let's see how will be aa.

357
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:35,098
This is not done yet.

358
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:37,736
- I was just ...
- Wait a minute.

359
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:39,749
O ˘ increased the door?

360
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:41,423
The seniors were barricades!

361
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:45,627
We have to go home.

362
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:49,014
I do not know
I'm also questioned.

363
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:51,690
One should wear masks.

364
00:23:53,813 --> 00:23:54,728
'A walk.

365
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,879
Why do you want to drop out
polymer science?

366
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,041
It's not as exciting
I thought.

367
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:05,151
Other courses, fellowship,
aa while, it's great.

368
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:08,174
Can I do Ítre
try something else in progress.

369
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:10,911
Come with me in electrical engineering.
It's fascinating.

370
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:12,981
Or plutÙt is electrifying.

371
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:18,845
Let it fall.

372
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:28,981
This is a good, he plastified entry.
Nice try ..., badgers

373
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,569
It's not plastic,

374
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:33,249
is poly-methyl
methyl.

375
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:35,754
Yes, I know ...

376
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,224
I want to do that you feel bite
if you did not know.

377
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,026
You know what aa mean?

378
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:45,647
Say hello ‡ Johnny.

379
00:24:46,523 --> 00:24:48,865
No!
It is shock resistant glass.

380
00:24:48,985 --> 00:24:50,927
Ax bounces above.

381
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:54,477
Now what, then?

382
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,083
Chloroform dissolve.

383
00:24:58,244 --> 00:25:01,723
I used my last bottle
for my secret murder.

384
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:05,298
- You can try acetone.
- It's dissolving.

385
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:09,264
I explain well

386
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:13,234
but it is a long history
and complicated, and there was no time.

387
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:36,913
- Hi!
- I digest.

388
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:42,065
- She looks likely.
- Got what you wanted.

389
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:43,837
Casey takes it badly.

390
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:48,341
- And aa disturbs you because?
- It is I who must manage aa.

391
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,671
Why you're concerned?

392
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,555
Casey and you've already ‡
Been so close?

393
00:25:53,877 --> 00:25:56,126
Even though it was
more Ashleigh.

394
00:25:56,246 --> 00:25:57,559
His Siamese giant.

395
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:02,313
- You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

396
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,967
Who looks assembled. They are
Similar: divorced from reality.

397
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:08,134
Everyone

00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:13,731
"Frannie out with my ex-boyfriend?

400
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,885
It's the same as Rebecca.

At worst, as a will to move

402
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,359

403
00:26:24,074 --> 00:26:25,523
You are very sexy.

404
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,041
So, I got this scar.

405
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:37,227
How fascinating history.
Let me see.

406
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:40,963
"May paraÓtre stupid, but

- MÍme I kept the glass as a souvenir.
- Too cute.

408
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:49,444
Ashleigh custody also
things to remember, is not it?

409
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,468
I keep things
important to me.

410
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:54,975
Objects, not ex-friends.

411
00:26:56,326 --> 00:26:59,290
- You Ites best friends?
- And roommates.

412
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,704
Since the 2nd year.

413
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:03,416
I can not comment more mÍme
his snoring now.

414
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:06,638
It was known
good and in our worst moments.

415
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,608
As layer when t'as
with this guy for 16 years.

416
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:10,871
DrÙle too!

417
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:16,471
Or when you confessed your
‡ feelings a guy who was gay.

418
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,966
My God.
¿Die laughing.

419
00:27:20,262 --> 00:27:23,207
Enough about us.
We want to hear you.

420
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,355
Do you have pets?

421
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:29,109
- I have a dog with me, Shadow ...
- Ash is allergic!

422

Casey is lactose intolerance.

- Ash hate Will Ferrell movies.
- Casey loves Mariah Carey.

424
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:40,154
I go to the toilet.

425
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:58,615
- "Has softens.
- Not sufficiently significant.

426
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:02,910
One could try to radiate.
The hole with a laser. T'en as one?

427
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,365
In our ship, Captain Kirk.

428
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,862
Samir will use dynamite
to blow up a door.

429
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:14,063
Shall we?

430
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:15,929
Not so close.

431
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,522
... Cost, I spent my evening here.

432
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:20,910
It's dynamite,
Áa will literally explode.

433
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:23,954
No, go ahead.

434
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:34,340
Heat.

435
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:47,954
- Hi!
- Hi, Betsy!

436
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:53,067
I wanted to tell you that
I am determined to live sober ‡

437
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:56,268
- ‡ succeed and my 12-step program.
- Great.

438
00:28:57,324 --> 00:29:01,145
One step is to ask forgiveness.
So I wanted to apologize.

439
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:05,330
I know that my drinking problem
you 2 all caused problems.

440
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,615
When I think

441
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:09,584
that my foolish behavior
you empÍchÈes d'itre

442
00:29:09,745 --> 00:29:12,877
into a relationship with a
guy who could Ítre great.

443
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,161
- Then I realized that I am ...
- Incredibly ÈgoÔste?

444
00:29:19,804 --> 00:29:22,305
Whether you were a
‡ tite real cheerleader?

445
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:26,184
As if t'avais empÍchÈ
2, my suur of Ítre together.

446
00:29:26,304 --> 00:29:28,320
I understand! I shit!

447
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:33,026
It's harder than I thought.
I will see my godfather.

448
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,269
- I have a solution for everything.
- Me too.

449
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:37,389
You go.

450
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:40,352
Or on a 15 min each,
alone with him.

451
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,742
After that, he must choose.

452
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:46,137
"I was going. In addition,
I am in better-‡-tite tite.

453
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:47,229
Prem's!

454
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:50,225
For you to him

455
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:51,384
Me first.

456
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,814
So you tell him
I fear that dwarfs?

457
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:55,055
Sneaky!

458
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:58,508
‡ plays on the coin toss.

459
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:05,879
Face!

460
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:26,732
T'es toujours l ‡?

461
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:31,756
It is therefore of plastics aa
‡ react to heat. And you?

462
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,102
Let us say that a little exaggeration:

463
00:30:35,222 --> 00:30:37,088
the dynamite was 3 firecrackers.

464
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,680
'A would not peter
doll's house of my suur.

465
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,233
I was able to retrieve this piece of hanger.
But it was easy enough.

466
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:45,203
I can sleep winner.

467
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,559
- And the reward?
- He left the batteries.

468
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:52,228
It's too diffuse.

469
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:54,897
Get DÈpÍche ‡ concentrate.
You still 1 / 2 h.

470
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,816
- How to AA?
- The game ends ‡ midnight.

471
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:05,983
Can aa-being that will help you.

472
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,635
- A map of the gym.
- OK.

473
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:16,348
- 2 döner restaurant.
- OK.

474
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:20,118
Very original! Who would
put gelato Buuf with Kobe?

475
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:22,592
I must confess.

476
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:25,013
The scandals have good cutés.

477
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,667
That is what must
Heidi and Spencer feel.

478
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:32,519
What do I have a Lemon Drop?

479
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:34,465
Having 21 years?

480
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,667
I work on it.

481
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:42,111
- O ˘ is Cassie?
- It will come back in 14 min 30.

482
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:45,513
Dingue we seated l ‡!

483
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:48,116
First,
we meet at spring break.

484
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:50,995
And it is in the mÍme university!

485
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:53,248
It is fate.

486
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:55,873
Absolutely.
The spring break was awesome.

487
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:57,258
The most genial.

488
00:31:57,378 --> 00:31:59,921
Like your smash.
You play in a team here?

489
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,507
I play volleyball.
I have too much jewelry.

490
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,635
It's not like aa
we met?

491
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,006
No, it was the ‡ fite.

492
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,457
Hot House.

493
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:12,350
You made me stumble
with your foot giant.

494
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,142
It was crazy!

495
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:16,563
And you had a
lifejacket!

496
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:20,692
I wore a tunic
adorable green,

497
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:23,486
with many small flowers.

498
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:24,647
Full.

499
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:26,485
A necklace "Peace".

500
00:32:26,803 --> 00:32:28,001
A pink hat.

501
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:31,228
Every week is a little fuzzy.

502
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,247
I lost a
my favorite sandals.

503
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,944
- I will seek ‡ drink.
- I can go.

504
00:32:42,683 --> 00:32:44,257
Do not particularly hot.

505
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:53,826
‡ It is you.

506
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,903
But it will remain 14 minutes.

507
00:32:57,364 --> 00:33:01,357
Not really my type.
¿What I thought? Temporary insanity.

508
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,693
But it is the Sexy Ness monster.

509
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:06,366
Correction: was ...

510
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,929
Now it's your new guy.

511
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:10,533
New guy.

512
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:14,379
- T'es ˚ s re?
- Yes. Go ahead.

513
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:19,921
Wait.

514
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:24,631
I found your lucky gloss,
He had slipped into my bag.

515
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,382
In the nails.

516
00:33:50,622 --> 00:33:52,161
Surrounded by Spitter.

517
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:03,878
It is locked.

518
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:12,658
Fini.

519
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,568
You were there?

520
00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:32,132
I will use the torch,
you'd better back.

521
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,042
So your first Crush Party?

522
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,496
It tears.

<i> Crush. </ i> rules.</i>

00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,055
I'm sorry
for all the quirks.

526
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:58,980
You're worried about Ashley.

527
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:04,694
It is brilliant,

528
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:06,356

529
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:09,278
a keen sense of fashion,
a body of shore.

530
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,303
It will make a guy very happy.

531
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,217
Can Ítre

532
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:17,154
They could invite
man pregnant.

533
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:20,919
They could. But here l ‡,
there will be more clearly ˚ s pregnant.

534
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,992
In short, it will be well.

535
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,140
You should put "lifts spirits"
on your CV,

536
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,155
in skills.

537
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:31,646
I should.

538
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:33,679
Just below "kisses."

539
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,141
You're engaged.

540
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:58,416
Good night.

541
00:36:16,372 --> 00:36:18,346
What do we do now?

542
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:27,693
- You're still l ‡?
- O ˘ is your lock?

543
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:29,147
I changed the handle.

544
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,453
- It's not fair.
- The game has no rules.

545
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:36,155
- In fact, everything is fair.
- So I guess that you have won.

546
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,065
Come see something.

547
00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:49,753
What?

548
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,296
The number of SOS Suicide.

549
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:55,341
- "A walking 24 / 24.
- I'm not suicidal.

550
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,360
Of paperwork and less.

551
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,762
Je cherche une raison d'itre
polymer scientist.

552
00:36:59,882 --> 00:37:01,312
A hotline for AA?

553
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:04,186
I have my memory on the kevlar,
you can borrow if you want.

554
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,434
T'es polymer?

555
00:37:06,314 --> 00:37:10,164
I knew one day that I worked
store tires of my father.

556
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:14,193
I tried to cut the kevlar tire
which is impossible,

557
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:15,862
because it is indestructible.

558
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:18,210
I cut the
hand deep enough.

559
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,282
And I realized that a man

560
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:21,693
created aa,

561
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:24,404

sheet on it, sorry.

563
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:27,340
What is important

564
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,127
is that someone had
The idea of creating something

565
00:37:31,288 --> 00:37:33,753
behavior very natural.

566
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:35,673
As Sully Putty.

567
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,181
Genial, that thing, huh?

568
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,919
Your reward
to have almost succeeded.

569
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,397
I am impressed
that thee not abandoned.

570
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:55,556
- I never give up a puzzle.
- This is why you are a scientist.

571
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,405
And that's why you're a
Polymer science.

572
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:07,645
- It's time to go.
- Not believable. Tu es de la NASA.

573
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:13,252
So you're a genius?

574
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,311
I guess.

575
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:24,072
I have a compromise.

576
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:27,558
They can not serve
of alcohol to minors.

577
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,519
But if you wear
Áa every Thursday

578
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,688
t'aurais nachos all year.

579
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:33,898
Free.

580
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:37,818
Sales, ‡ oil, covered in cream ...
God I'm hungry!

581
00:38:39,146 --> 00:38:42,657
- I'll look for other things.
- My parents come to call.

582
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:44,888
They divorced.

583
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:53,285
Sorry.

584
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:57,353
You turn a small cheer.
Give me a straw.

585
00:38:57,473 --> 00:38:59,465
I drink the juice
Apple through the nose.

586
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:02,131
That's all?

587
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,762
I can do the anthem
National ROTANT.

588
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:12,019
You want me to come?

589
00:39:15,784 --> 00:39:17,983
No Lemon Drop
can not help me, l ‡.

590
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:45,811
You release your feelings?

591
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:48,931
So Sexy with Ness?
Finally, Drew.

592
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:51,559
Let's say I'm not Frannie.

593
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:54,050
Frannie is on it now?

594
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,608
He must put his ideas clear.

595
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:58,794
I escort

596
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:02,111
when I saw Frannie
embrace her new boyfriend.

597
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:03,725
"Has made me tilt.

598
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:07,909
It is not whether
with Evan that upset me,

599
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:13,105
is that it has chosen
a possible relationship with a guy

600
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,020
at the expense of our friendship,

601
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:18,919
and I would make you thing the mÍme

602
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:20,361
with Drew.

603
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,709
No, Case. Not at all.

604
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:27,090
Tout va bien.
Drew is a super guy

605
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,638
‡ and is built on you
not on me.

606
00:40:33,204 --> 00:40:35,698
- He does not remember mÍme me.
- What?

607
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:39,440
It's impossible. You're unforgettable.

608
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:43,027
- Apparently not.
- Tu l'es, for me.

609
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,956
No man on earth
is so great

610
00:40:48,477 --> 00:40:49,992
to save us.

611
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:53,795
Come l ‡.

612
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,462
¿-Being can share Christian Bale.

613
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:03,839
Or Johnny Depp.

614
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,299
Johnny Depp.

615
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:09,371
For you. Just for you.

616
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:26,623
I can get?

617
00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:28,671
Although ˚ s r.

618
00:41:29,524 --> 00:41:32,034
Sometimes, simply
get up and smell the coffee.

619
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,018
You smile.

620
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:38,499
- Are you finished digesting?
- This treaty,

621
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,543
packed and weighed.

622
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:42,545
‡ We are friends again?

623
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:44,559
Absolutely not.

624
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,092
How AA?

625
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:51,587
Evan me wrong,

626
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,945
I lied and tried
I handle.

627
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:56,267
Leaving with him,
you do as if it were nothing.

628
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:57,965
You prefer.

629
00:41:58,085 --> 00:42:00,735
- I see it as aa.
- Je m'en fiche.

630
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:07,511
It is what then?

631
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:11,615
And large and small suur suur?

632
00:42:14,246 --> 00:42:15,792
It is never suur ‡.

633
00:42:17,147 --> 00:42:19,582
But we are no longer friends.
