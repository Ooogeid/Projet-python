1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,143
Previously...

2
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:02,878
We're leaving now, anyway.

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,213
But it's 10:30.

4
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,564
You said we'd come,
not that we'd stay.

5
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:08,383
But thanks for paying
our electric bill.

6
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:11,911
That was loud.

7
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,064
I offered to pay

8
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,432
gamma psi's electric bill.

9
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,893
- Ashley didn't even know about it.
- That's not true.

10
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:21,658
Dr. Larsen, I was hoping
you might be interested in

11
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:24,259
- sponsoring a project of mine.
- But I've already

12
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:26,859
committed myself to
sponsoring dale kettlewell.

13
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:30,199
I understand you turned down
an opportunity to work with Dr. Larsen.

14
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:33,864
I'd rather take a chance working on my
own project, even if they call me anchor

15
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,448
- until I graduate.
- I'll sponsor you.

16
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:38,520
- This mean we're a team?
- This about cappie?

17
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:40,668
It's pretty clear
there are still feelings.

18
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:43,122
How I feel about cappie is
irrelevant since he's off

19
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:44,932
with that night club girl.

20
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:47,844
I guess I should explain why
I've been blowing you off.

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,840
Are we still, or not?

22
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:52,496
I want someone different.

23
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,061
Your cab's here! You better hurry before
someone steals it!

24
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:00,099
Out of my way, bitches!

25
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:03,204
It's a four-day weekend,
you're not moving home.

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,304
- Unless.
- Are you?

27
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:08,051
Sorry to disappoint,
but I'll be back on sunday.

28
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:10,557
You could pay me to stay longer but

29
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,669
I don't have an electric bill.

30
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:16,072
Are you going home Or back in time to
return that suitcaseto

31
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:19,738
- to its rightful owner?
- I prefer the vintage look to the whole

32
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:22,289
walking-advertisement
label-whore whore thing.

33
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:25,459
But that's just me. Obviously.
And yeah, I'm going home.

34
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:27,255
Thanksgiving at the cartwrights'.

35
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,375
I'll bet it looks like
a norman rockwell painting.

36
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,454
Hardly. I'll probably end up spending
the weekend with my old boyfriend.

37
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:36,375
Old boyfriend? Sounds like
a home-for-the-holidays hook up to me.

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,326
It's not like that. I just want see how
he's doing and catch up.

39
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,315
Please. The only reason to catch up

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,627
with an old flame,
when there's no flame.

41
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,552
Is for sex.

42
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:48,196
Just because you would,
doesn't mean I will.

43
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:51,523
Right. Because you're the
good one, and I'm the bad one.

44
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:53,050
Right.

45
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:55,985
At least we agree on one thing.

46
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,486
- Happy thanksgiving.
- You, too.

47
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:03,162
I typed up the cooking
schedule for tomorrow,

48
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:05,634
breaking it into two shifts,
which should give us equal time

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,219
- to hit the lab working on projects.
- I'm not going to the lab.

50
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,921
What about your special project?
And the grant?

51
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:14,035
Proposals are due on
monday. Every minute counts.

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,724
I hit a wall and hastings isn't the best
person to show me how to get over it.

53
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:20,211
That's true. He's no larsen.

54
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,478
What's up?

55
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,637
- I'm double-parked. Are you ready?
- Go where?

56
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:31,054
Our flight home that leaves in two
hours, please tell me you packed.

57
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:34,692
We're not going anymore.
Mom and dad cancelled our tickets.

58
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,647
- They're off to maui for the weekend.
- How do I not know this?

59
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:39,970
She left you five messages!

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,165
She didn't leave me any messages!

61
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:45,170
Or, wait... Did she?

62
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,344
Started skipping mom's
long voice-mails

63
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,992
after she left one re-enacting
a health care debate on c-span.

64
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:54,752
Now when I hear, "hey, case,

65
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:57,167
it's mom," I skip it.

66
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,993
- What a fun story.
- What about my message?

67
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:01,915
I left you one, too.

68
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,760
Just my luck!

69
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:09,805
I can't believe this.
I was looking forward to seeing derrick.

70
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,714
And mom and dad.

71
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:14,811
Does that mean you'll be spending
thanksgiving dinner with us tomorrow?

72
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:17,490
First one on our own.
Another big milestone.

73
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,373
Might as well.

74
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,563
I'm not going home now.

75
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:23,384
What else have I got to do?

76
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:26,055
OK, not the most
enthusiastic response,

77
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,808
but I'll take it. I promise, anything
you coulda got at home,

78
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,349
you'll get right here.

79
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,539
I doubt that.

80
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:35,215
-= Greek 309 =-
"The Wish Pretzel"

81
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:37,525
<i>Kappa Team</i>

82
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:41,551
You going home this weekend?

83
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,819
My parents don't believe
in celebrating thanksgiving.

84
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,944
They side with the native americans.

85
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,367
And the turkey, as vegetarians.

86
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,007
How about you? Going to the
chambers estate to discuss

87
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:55,051
extramarital affairs, feuding families,
oil, and murder?

88
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,257
You been watching dynastyon dvd?

89
00:03:58,382 --> 00:03:59,922
Dynasty?
Never heard of it.

90
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:03,361
- Never mind.
- No, actually,

91
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:07,443
I will not be going to the annual
chambers turkey extravaganza.

92
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:10,665
I politely declined the e-mail
invite from my dad's secretary.

93
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,828
If we're both here,
we should do something.

94
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,221
- Maybe road trip to play some golf?
- Sounds good to me.

95
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:17,012
We should go tomorrow.

96
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:19,125
It's thanksgiving,
so the course'll be open.

97
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,899
Or closed, which means
we play for free...

98
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:24,199
Free... I can afford that.

99
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,795
Wait... Tomorrow?

100
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:29,476
I have the turkey hunt.

101
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:31,392
It's this thing we do every year...

102
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,816
One of the actives who's gone
for the weekend hides a turkey,

103
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,272
leaving clues for the kts
who stuck around to follow.

104
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,845
It's kind of a kt
thanksgiving tradition.

105
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,488
Turkey hunt? Seriously?

106
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,125
Aren't you getting a little
tired doing the same old stuff

107
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,780
with those guys all the time?

108
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,592
Come on, it's my first
thanksgiving away from home.

109
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,043
Calvin and most of the other
omega chis are gone.

110
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:52,538
Come on.

111
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:55,145
Fine, they can do it
without me this year.

112
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,865
When you get done with work?

113
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,619
Sometime after lunch.
I'll give you a call when I know.

114
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,517
And, I'll drive...

115
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:03,048
Get it?

116
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:05,487
That would've been funny
if you still had your car.

117
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:08,033
- Yeah. You should drive.
- Yeah, I will.

118
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,415
Rusty and I will handle
all the cooking,

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,786
if you'd like to contribute,
bring a bottle of something.

120
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:16,941
I think a dry ginger ale
might go best with deep-fried turkey.

121
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,746
It's a kettlewell tradition.

122
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:20,999
Sure is. Along with making
a wish on the wishbone.

123
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:23,462
Wait, rusty and I do that
every year, too.

124
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:24,974
It's a cartwright tradition.

125
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,881
Considering how things've
been going in my love life,

126
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,500
I could use the help.

127
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,918
Why am I telling you this?

128
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:33,194
I Miss ashleigh.

129
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,730
You can have the wishbone,

130
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:36,671
but you'll have to fight me
for the gizzard.

131
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,819
It's all yours.

132
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:41,173
Isn't this a little ambitious?

133
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:44,511
I didn't stay in town to dilly-dally and
plan on getting some serious work done.

134
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,046
Over a holiday weekend?

135
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:49,264
Dale's applying for the
gary wyatt innovation engineering grant.

136
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,642
Which could land me
40 gs to fund further research,

137
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,953
and some serious bragging rights.

138
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:57,061
I'm working on waste-printed
circuit board with my advisor.

139
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:59,191
You might know him fromcharlie rose?

140
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:02,660
Or from the cover of
the latest issue ofew?

141
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,761
Engineering weekly?

142
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,304
He was number two
on their "must list."

143
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:09,534
Our project's one of
the top contenders.

144
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,544
Are you applying, rus?

145
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,480
No. It's fine. I get to concentrate
on more important matters,

146
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,959
like our first thanksgiving
dinner without mom and dad.

147
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,534
Yeah, without them
fighting over who gets

148
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,790
to carve the turkey,
or who makes better gravy.

149
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,800
If you Miss it, I can always nag
you on your bad table manners.

150
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:26,107
Thanks.

151
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:34,494
Hello? Anybody home?

152
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,519
You really do think your life
is a romantic comedy, don't you?

153
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,046
What are you doing home?

154
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:23,955
Flight was cancelled, and
flying standby on thanksgiving

155
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,986
depresses me.
What's your story?

156
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,625
My parents ditched me for maui.

157
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:31,313
So no booty call for casey?

158
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:33,495
I told you, it wasn't a booty call.

159
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,370
Right. My mistake.

160
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:39,657
So were you texting,
emailing each other?

161
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:42,380
How exactly did you
make the booty arrangement?

162
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,480
I at least hope you had
the decency to cancel,

163
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:47,391
so he can make other booty plans.

164
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,390
Looks like it's just
the two of us this weekend.

165
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,913
Just my luck.

166
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:04,347
If you guys are interested,
dale and I are having

167
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:06,356
thanksgiving dinner
at our apartment.

168
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,316
Why would we find that interesting?

169
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:10,197
Because I'm inviting
you guys to join.

170
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:13,884
Sounds awesome. As long as
it's after the turkey hunt.

171
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,823
You're hunting with us, right?

172
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:18,959
I don't know. I have to cook,
and I should be thinking about

173
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:22,506
my polymer science project but I'm so
far from the solution, it's pointless.

174
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:24,473
How about you find
the turkey with us,

175
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,134
and then we help with your
polygamy science project.

176
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,871
Has anyone seen my pitching wedge?

177
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:32,118
I left it here a few years ago.

178
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:33,819
Thank you.

179
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,858
What are you doing in town?
Thought you were going home.

180
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,060
Our parents ditched us for maui.

181
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,450
Casey's still in town?

182
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:45,962
She's coming over tomorrow
for thanksgiving dinner.

183
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:47,598
Dale and I are cooking.

184
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:49,360
Maybe you should come.

185
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:52,418
Tomorrow? Shoot.

186
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:54,802
No, I wish I could.
I got this...

187
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:58,333
Charity golf tournament thing...
For the poor.

188
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,114
But what about the turkey hunt?

189
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,087
Thanksgiving dinner.

190
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,401
Next year,

191
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:05,825
I promise.

192
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,045
Combo shot...

193
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,498
- you guys.
- Interference.

194
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:12,986
Game over, I win.

195
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,775
It was tied!

196
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,431
Sure, it was, until cap
knocked in one of my balls.

197
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,598
Combo shot.

198
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:24,833
The electrons could pass
through a cross-linker!

199
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,900
I gotta ask Dr. Hastings
if I can try a combo shot.

200
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,588
Balls.

201
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:34,730
You're right! I'm gonna tell
hastings I'm gonna try

202
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:37,212
a combo shot,
whether he likes it or not.

203
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,061
Yes, darling.

204
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:45,144
I agree, your mother is insane.
Certifiable.

205
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,221
We could leave her at
the nursing home this year.

206
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,964
Of course i'm kidding!

207
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,883
I'll pick her up on the way home.

208
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,719
I have a student here now.

209
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,504
Talk to you soon.

210
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,035
What is it, cartwright?

211
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,850
I think I know how to make
a self-healing polymer wire reconduct.

212
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,094
That's not knowing.

213
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:05,979
- How do you think it could happen?
- With a combo shot.

214
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,147
Are you on drugs?

215
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,150
We need to make the cross-linker
conductive, as well.

216
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:11,860
That way, there will be more

217
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,404
pathways for the current to travel.

218
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:17,778
Certainly sounds plausible.

219
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:20,369
But you haven't tested
this theory yet?

220
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,413
Then why are you here?
Go try it!

221
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,374
If it works, then I'll get excited.

222
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,528
Then you might have a shot
at the Gary Wyatt grant.

223
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,652
Really? You think so?

224
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:35,895
Well, it is you we're talking about
here, so I won't hold my breat but

225
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,050
if you do get lucky,

226
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,931
even I may have to stop
calling you "anchor."

227
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,138
But my friend's already going
for that grant.

228
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:48,637
You think it's OK
that I try for it, too?

229
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,109
There are no friends
in the lab, Cartwright.

230
00:10:51,878 --> 00:10:52,859
Remember that.

231
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,040
Is that you?

232
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:30,772
Stop doing that!

233
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,984
It's creepy enough in this empty,
huge house without you stalking me.

234
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:35,652
I keep hearing noises.

235
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,879
It's an old house.
Things creak.

236
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:41,107
I know! And I can sleep through
drunk singing in the hallways,

237
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,910
or late-night Beyonce all the single
ladiesdance parties,

238
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,278
<i>but it's like The Shining in here.</i>

239
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:48,792
Red rum

240
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,655
- Red rum.
- Please stop!

241
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:56,214
Rusty did that once when he was six and
still swears he's never seen the movie.

242
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:59,169
What are you doing?

243
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,013
I thought I could spend the night here.
Keep you company while Ash is gone.

244
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:04,748
No...

245
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,021
... thanks.

246
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:10,913
I guess you're not that good
of a person, after all.

247
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:11,743
Fine.

248
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,576
If a psycho axe murder
chops me up into little pieces,

249
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,985
it's on your head,
which he'll probably chop off, too.

250
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:19,834
OK, fine, fine!
You can stay.

251
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:20,597
But...

252
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:22,697
Just for tonight.

253
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:30,328
- Brought your alarm clock?
- It's a rain machine.

254
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:32,959
It's proven that white noise
helps you sleep more soundly.

255
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,087
You can thank me later.

256
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,136


257
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,081
You're up early.

258
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:49,610
And wearing jeans?

259
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:52,901
I'd recommend something
a little more elastic today.

260
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:54,747
I'm heading to the lab.

261
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,344
I think I know how to get my
self-healing polymer wire to reconduct.

262
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:00,610
You weren't working on eco-polymers?

263
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,156
I was, but this seems
more exciting to me.

264
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:04,880
And here's the thing...

265
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,831
If it works, Hastings thinks
I should go for the grant.

266
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:11,957
My grant?

267
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,083
It's not yours.

268
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,001
- Well...
- I mean, not yet.

269
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,963
Wanted to make sure it's OK with you
'cause I know you're going for it, too.

270
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,464
We're both honors engineers.

271
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:22,509
There aren't a lot of undergrad
grants going around.

272
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,144
No, of course it's OK!
You're right.

273
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,515
It's not mine. Not yet.
I haven't won it. Yet.

274
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:29,861
I will.

275
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:32,127
I mean, it's not like
you can call grant dibs.

276
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,646
But if you can, I totally did.

277
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:38,066
I'm just kidding.

278
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,155
Go for it.

279
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:45,791
You know what, I'll go with you.

280
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:47,784
I padded that schedule.

281
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,078
This way, we can cook together
when we get back, and...

282
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:51,628
... be best friends.

283
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:53,373
OK, let me get some clothes on.

284
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,174
I think we should go back
to separate rooms tonight.

285
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,112
You think?
You're the one with the

286
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:03,990
rain machine and humidifier.

287
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:05,842
And you snore like a beached seal.

288
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,248
I rather take my chances
with an imaginary axe murder.

289
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:12,426
Maybe I was snoring because of all the
humidity from tropical storm Rebecca.

290
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,103
What are you up to today?

291
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,992
Well, I'm volunteering

292
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,819
with CRU's moveable feast.

293
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,939
They deliver turkey dinners
to the elderly.

294
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:27,369
I mean, things haven't exactly been
going my way lately.

295
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,784
ZBZ's fourth.

296
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,655
Ish.

297
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:31,438
My parents ditched me.

298
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,726
Still waiting for a decision
on that stupid

299
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,646
board position from Katherine,

300
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:37,876
and my dating life
is pretty much in the gutter.

301
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,438
- The whole Cappie thing?
- I was talking about Derrick.

302
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,255
But anyway, I've decided
to give back to the community

303
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:46,843
in order to get some good karma
and hopefully reverse the trend.

304
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,306
- How selfless of you.
- At least I'm doing something.

305
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,223
I'm writing a check.

306
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,849
How generous of you.

307
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,601
For 10,000 dollars.

308
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,039
That is generous.

309
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:02,234
But if you really cared you'd invest
your time and not just your money.

310
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,070
<i>I care about old people.
I watch Desperate Housewives.</i>

311
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,863
And I can totally volunteer
with you today.

312
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:09,241
I don't have any plans.

313
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:11,620
I didn't mean today.

314
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:13,208
I meant...

315
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:14,994
in general.

316
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:17,624
You're not the only one
who needs good karma.

317
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:23,213
I've wondered,
with all those balloons,

318
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,729
there's not one mischievous guy
with a pellet gun?

319
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:29,880
It's almost noon!

320
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,888
Let the turkey hunt begin!

321
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,848
Here you go, Beav.
You get the first clue.

322
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:40,973
"Take my cue,
this pool is too shallow for swimming,

323
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:42,691
but does have deep pockets."

324
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,860
We don't have a pool.

325
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:48,989
Check your pockets!

326
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:50,865
Wait, we don't have a pool,

327
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,432
but we do have a hot tub.

328
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:55,662
- The next clue's in the hot tub!
- No, guys, guys! Come on...

329
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:57,345
Cue?

330
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,560
Pockets? Pool?

331
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:02,419
Don't you think you should check
the pockets at the pool table?

332
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,721


333
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:14,195
Got it!

334
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,017
Cap, you want to read?

335
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,841
He can't.
He has golf with poor people.

336
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:21,062
- Remember?
- Yeah, he has better things to do.

337
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:24,274
Come on. Golf is slow, I'll just play
fast and catch up. Let me see the clue.

338
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:29,040
"Smaller than a lion,
bigger than a mouse,

339
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:31,906
I'm hiding under a trash can
in the smelliest room of the house."

340
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,867
- Bathroom! - Kitchen!
- Could be anywhere.

341
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:37,642
What filthy animal am I
staring at right now?

342
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:42,149
Really?

343
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:44,586
It's beaver!
The clue's in Beaver's room.

344
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,209
You guys are terrible...
Whatever, let's find this turkey.

345
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,216
I guess we weren't the only ones
with this idea.

346
00:16:58,442 --> 00:16:59,342
Excuse me.

347
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:02,937
We're here to help deliver food
to old people.

348
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,796
More volunteers.

349
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:07,691
We always get so much help
on Thanksgiving.

350
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,289
I think we have it covered now but

351
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:13,728
you're welcome to volunteer
any of the other 364 days of the year.

352
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:16,076
You deliver thanksgiving dinners
to the elderly year-round?

353
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,913
They don't know what day it is,
they just want to eat.

354
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,964
We'll totally do that.
We're just...

355
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:24,417
feeling really charitable today.

356
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,420
Join the club. If you'd really like
to help, write us a check.

357
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:34,302
Oh, my God!

358
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,502
Thank you!

359
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,675
That is so generous!

360
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:43,068
Looks like I'm the good one now.
And I'm good on karma through Christmas.

361
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,267
How about you?

362
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,464
Let's count it down. Ten...

363
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:50,374
Nine...

364
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,219
Eight...

365
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:57,310
It works!

366
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:59,452
- What happened? What works?
- The combo shot! Look!

367
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,033
Why would you do that?

368
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,591
If it turns back on, then it works.

369
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,717
A conductive wire containing
self-healing microcapsules

370
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,642
isn't a breakthrough, but a self-healing
reconductive one is grant-worthy.

371
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,521
You think so? Because Rusty mentioned
earlier that a wire like that

372
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:17,372
is still a ways off,
and we only have until monday so...

373
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:20,181
Who is the nosy ninny?
And why does he know about our project?

374
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,814
That's Dale. He's my friend.

375
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:23,908
We were in your
physics class together.

376
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:27,480
Listen to me closely, Cartwright.

377
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,977
He is the enemy.

378
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,760
Do not share any information
with other students.

379
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:34,204
Keep your guard up.
I told you...

380
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,031
There are no friends in the lab.

381
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:43,121
What a grouch!

382
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,308
Don't listen to that old has-been.
Don't let him push you around.

383
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,964
He can't expect you to be finished
by monday, right?

384
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,075
It's nearly impossible, right?

385
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:54,382
Yeah, it would be pretty amazing.

386
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,509
But all I can do is try.

387
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,619
Exactly!
You might as well try.

388
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,433
Dale. Your project.

389
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,160
- It's good...
- Your project!

390
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,946
Looks like you're sinking
with the anchor.

391
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,165


392
00:19:37,228 --> 00:19:38,468
I was so close.

393
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:40,909
I could taste that stupid grant,
and now

394
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:43,379
I gotta find a new circuit board
and start all over.

395
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:46,851
Frank Stallone!

396
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:52,106
Dale, I'm really sorry about that.
If there's anything you want me to do.

397
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:54,484
Yeah. Go for Dale.

398
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,462
Hello, Dr. Larsen.

399
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,099
Yeah, well... Yes, sir,
we seem to have sailed

400
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,700
into some rough waters.

401
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:05,784
I've lost a couple days' work,
I don't know if there's time to...

402
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,061
Yes sir, I do want the grant.

403
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:12,625
Yes sir, I am a champion.

404
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:18,379
<i>Yes sir, of course, I would like to be
on Charlie Rose someday. I don't...</i>

405
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:19,507
Hello?

406
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:24,389
<i>He really milks Charlie Rose
for all he's worth, doesn't he?</i>

407
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,715
He sure does.

408
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,845
Hey, it's on!

409
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:35,525
- That's too bad.
- No, no, it's too good!

410
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,969
It reconducted!
But it wasn't sustainable...

411
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:40,105
Could be the battery.

412
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,658
Or I might have to adjust
the cross-linker monomer ratio.

413
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,017
That's great, Rus.

414
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:48,182
So happy for you.
Yours didn't even catch on fire...

415
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,419
which is awesome.

416
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:53,742
It still doesn't work
like it should,

417
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:55,461
but it's a small gain.

418
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,672
I really don't appreciate your tone.

419
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:00,508
I'm just fried.

420
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,125
I'll start again tomorrow.

421
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:05,371
See you at home.

422
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,091
I'm telling you,
it has to be in my room.

423
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,088
"The KT that gets the most box?"

424
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:19,074
Look around.

425
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,921
I think it's meant to be ironical.

426
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:23,281
I don't know. I think
the next clue's in Cappie's room.

427
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,365
I'm flattered, Wade.
But I think Heath may have a point.

428
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:28,816
This is a lot of box.

429
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:31,398
What gives?
You start a shipping business?

430
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:34,538
I'm graduating in a few weeks.
Remember? I'm moving out.

431
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:36,077
What? Hold up. Rewind.

432
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:38,683
You're moving out? Graduating?

433
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,891
- And there's no shipping business?
- You didn't know, Cap?

434
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:44,344
I thought you knew everything.

435
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,554
I'm so disillusioned right now.

436
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,891
But we haven't even begun to organize
your going away party!

437
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:52,390
Actually, we have.
It's next saturday.

438
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,180
And if anyone's secretly gay
and wants to declare their love for me,

439
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:57,903
now'd be the time.

440
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,214
Sorry, Cap, but you haven't been around
much lately, so we took the initiative.

441
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,395
Found it!

442
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,977
"In the chambers
of the rich and pompous,

443
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,661
where Tom Sawyer sits
and taunts us."

444
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:17,292
It's at Omega Chi.

445
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:21,848
"Chambers?" Evan chambers.
Jeez, you guys suck at this.

446
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,301
We have to break into Omega Chi
for the next clue?

447
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,124
Looks like we do.

448
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,868
You're coming with us?

449
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,640
What about your golf tournament?

450
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,273


451
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,866
It was just cancelled, actually.

452
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:45,154
Something about an unruly gopher
and explosives.

453
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,506
And Heath, it's your last turkey hunt!
I'm sorry I almost missed it.

454
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,338
Let me get my ski mask!

455
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:53,029
Get ready,
I'll meet you guys out there.

456
00:22:57,705 --> 00:22:59,615
There's a canned food drive
at Dobler's.

457
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:02,172
For every five cans donated,
you get two-for-one drinks.

458
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:04,003
That was yesterday.

459
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,085
What?

460
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,763
- Looks like you do need good karma.
- Anything to get me out of this funk.

461
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:09,929
I don't know.

462
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:12,473
I really wanted to see Derrick
this weekend.

463
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,372
So it was an interstate booty call!

464
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:16,685
Fine. Yes. It totally was.

465
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:19,481
And I probably still could've
gone home to see him,

466
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,316
but when my parents bailed,
it suddenly felt...

467
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,609
Super slutty?

468
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:27,280
I was going to say "unnecessary",
but yeah, a little slutty.

469
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:30,033
My flight didn't get cancelled.

470
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:33,860
The more I thought about it, the more
I dreaded going home. So I didn't.

471
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:36,748
So Derrick's that good, huh?

472
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,708
I've had better.

473
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,893
Like who?
Cappie or Evan?

474
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,588
- I'm not going to answer that.
- What about Evan?

475
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:48,322
- Did you guys say my name?
- Yeah.

476
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:49,894
I saw you coming.

477
00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:51,786
I mean... I said,

478
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,223
"Hey, here comes Evan".

479
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:56,809
- So what are you up to?
- And why do you smell like yams?

480
00:23:58,374 --> 00:23:59,396
I was working.

481
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,027
And then I had plans with a friend,
but he flaked so

482
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,272
here I am.

483
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:04,657
Walking home alone.

484
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:06,915
You're not alone now.

485
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,239
You should come to dinner
with me at Rusty's apartment.

486
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:13,117
- I doubt he wants me there.
- It's Thanksgiving.

487
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,370
I'll just call and tell him
to add another place setting.

488
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,164
You invite Evan, but not me?

489
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:21,193
I assumed you wouldn't want to go.

490
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:23,503
- Would you?
- I would. Thank you for the invite.

491
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:32,606
You're stirring way too fast.

492
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,247
If we wanted a stuffing smoothie
I'd throw it in the blender.

493
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:42,021
You sure about setting up
that deep-fryer on the porch?

494
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:43,562
That doesn't seem safe,

495
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:45,024
like, at all.

496
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,735
I know what I'm doing.
Never had a turkey go up in flames.

497
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,946
I don't plan on it happening today.

498
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,949


499
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:58,392
How much celery is in there?
You even bother to measure?

500
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:00,515
Sort of.
It looks fine to me.

501
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,959
Don't you understand
the importance of precision?

502
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:05,464
Because, yeah, it may look fine,

503
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:08,271
but then you realize
you underclocked the cpu so much,

504
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:11,451
that your processor is useless
spinning at such a low speed.

505
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:14,345
Wait a minute. I thought we were talking
about the stuffing, not your project.

506
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:17,046
We are.
But the stuffing or my project,

507
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:18,641
you have to be precise!

508
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:21,627
If you want, maybe tomorrow
I can help you get back on track?

509
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:23,183
I can do it on my own.

510
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,151
Are these cranberries?

511
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,361
These are!
There's no cranberries in the recipe!

512
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,824
That's it! Thanksgiving's ruined!
I'm going to the lab.

513
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,938
- What about dinner?
- Dinner's cancelled!

514
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:41,091
Dinner's cancelled!

515
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:44,417
I guess dinner's cancelled.

516
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,285
What are we supposed to do
for dinner now?

517
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,834
I've got an idea.

518
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:52,766
We pretend
like we're delivering them,

519
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:54,927
but we keep a few meals
for ourselves.

520
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:57,772
That's serious bad karma.

521
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,390
Yeah, that won't be happening.

522
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,779
I have an idea.

523
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:07,516
Look at all these people
with nowhere to go.

524
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,901
Let's have Thanksgiving
at the ZBZ house!

525
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,861
And everyone's invited!

526
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:13,789
It's gonna be so great.

527
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,852
OK, guys, we're gonna have Thanksgiving
at the ZBZ house!

528
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,453


529
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,505
Microwave pizza?

530
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:30,509
It's turkey sausage.
Happy Thanksgiving. Next!

531
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:34,233
What's in this stuff, anyway?

532
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:36,969
This is cranberry juice

533
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,623
and an assortment of half-empty bottles
I got from catering.

534
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,224
I call it "cranberry sauce".

535
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:47,469
Is Cappie in town?
We should ask him over.

536
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:48,528
There you go.

537
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,157
He's the flake I had plans with.

538
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:54,403
- Is he with Lana or something?
- No, they broke up.

539
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,824
They did?

540
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:58,622
But you know cappie, he's probably
got drunk with the KTs and

541
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:01,416
skeet shooting dinner plates,
skateboarding off the roof,

542
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:03,304
or something stupid like that.

543
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:24,985
Check under all the chairs.

544
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:30,965
It's still cold!

545
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,272
Someone was just here.

546
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:35,951
Where Tom Sawyer sits.

547
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:37,093
Good one.

548
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,217
- I found it. Let's get outta here.
- Wait.

549
00:27:44,473 --> 00:27:46,122
We have to pull a prank, right?

550
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:49,834
- Yeah, let's saran wrap the toilets.
- No, let's steal all their underwear.

551
00:27:52,897 --> 00:27:55,749
Let's do something to Chambers's room.
You guys have any eggs on you?

552
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:58,089
Or rancid trout?
Anyone need to pee?

553
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:12,815
No one's doing anything to Evan's room!
Let's get out of here.

554
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:16,643
- What's up with you lately?
- You don't want to prank the OCs?

555
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:18,654
It's, like, bizarro Cappie!

556
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,111
There's no pranking today.

557
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:22,312
It's not me, it's in the KT by-laws.

558
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:25,328
"On thanksgiving day,
all KTs must adhere to

559
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,499
a brief suspension of hostility
in the spirit of the holiday."

560
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,858
It even suggests we invite
our enemies over to

561
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:33,210
watch football or...
Or skateboard off the roof.

562
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,713
KTs and OCs will never get along.
We're too different.

563
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,019
You don't want to screw
with Evan Chambers?

564
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:40,747
The guy who hit Spitter
with his own pledge paddle?

565
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,845
The guy who stole your girlfriend?

566
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:44,252
It was a long time ago.

567
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:46,273
I had the opportunity
to be with her, and I...

568
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:48,824
- I didn't want to risk it.
- You didn't want to risk it?

569
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:51,266
Seriously, what's going on
with you, Cap?

570
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:53,011
You used to live for risk.

571
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,884
And chutes and ladders.

572
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,322
All I'm saying is...

573
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,944
Why would I want to go
through all that again?

574
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:01,243
To be with the love of your life?

575
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:12,083
Come on,
let's just get out of here, OK?

576
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:22,676


577
00:29:27,673 --> 00:29:29,433
Aren't you supposed to be at dinner?

578
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:33,354
I left for more brown sugar,
and unfortunately, I had car trouble.

579
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:34,525
Really?

580
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,858
I'm changing my tire as we speak.

581
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,361
What happened to dinner
with your friend?

582
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:42,405
Cancelled it to keep working.

583
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:46,158
You know,
I had a friend like yours once.

584
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:49,535
We pioneered the work that led
to the miniaturized hard disk.

585
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,183
However, without my knowledge,

586
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:56,085
my friend published a book about
our research and forgot to credit me.

587
00:29:57,114 --> 00:29:58,671
He went on to make millions,

588
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,590
win the Pulitzer, and marry
a Victoria's secret model.

589
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:05,635
No friends in the lab?

590
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,994
You're going after the same result.

591
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,391
You can't both win.

592
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:19,637
I've been getting along with her
for two solid hours now.

593
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:22,748
Must be the spirit of the holiday.

594
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:25,086
You know, it could be
the cranberry sauce.

595
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:27,362
That helps, too.

596
00:30:28,114 --> 00:30:32,311
Sure you don't want to call cap? I love
that the three of us are friends again.

597
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:33,602
It's like old times.

598
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:35,690
These people don't know yet...

599
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:39,177
Well, maybe the omega chis
and kts should embrace

600
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:41,933
the spirit of the holiday
a little, too.

601
00:30:43,144 --> 00:30:44,397
I need a refill. You good?

602
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:50,013
Were you two just talking about me?

603
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,452
Paranoid much?

604
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,342
What did he say? Did he see me
talking to that cute guy?

605
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:58,147
- Think it made him jealous?
- What's going on with you?

606
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,203
- Nothing.
- Hey, check it out!

607
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:03,402
Hey! You're not allowed up there!

608
00:31:03,923 --> 00:31:06,140
- That's my roommate's shirt!
- I'm on it!

609
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,450
I think it's time we close
the kitchen.

610
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,120
All right, everybody, listen up!
Thank you for coming,

611
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:16,537
but we are now closed,
so be careful out there.

612
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:17,860
Happy thanksgiving.

613
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:31,190
What are you doing?

614
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:34,839
I was just curious.

615
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:39,425
Going through my notes?
Spying on me? That's cheating.

616
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,108
And unethical,

617
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:42,691
at the very least.

618
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,580
Our projects are nothing alike.
I just wanted to see how close you were.

619
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,371
You should take thisas a compliment

620
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:52,952
'cause I saw you making progress
and realized you're real competition.

621
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:55,955
What does that mean?
I wasn't competion before?

622
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:58,871
You know, you're the anchor.

623
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:03,077
You actually think that little
of me? You think I'm that bad?

624
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:05,642
I don't think you're bad,

625
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:08,288
I thought your project might've
been a little ambitious.

626
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:11,983
I've looked at you like a friend and
you've looked down on me like the anchor

627
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:15,952
It's just a nickname!

628
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,293
It's just a nickname!

629
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:26,730
It looks like all he took was
that one shirt. What an odd choice.

630
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:29,989
It's funny, I thought I'd
be spending tonight alone.

631
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:34,159
I thought I'd be spending it
with an old boyfriend.

632
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:37,918
Cranberry sauce.

633
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:41,670
Old boyfriend?

634
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,667
I thought all I wanted was
a booty call,

635
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:59,300
but I realize now I want...

636
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:01,145
... more.

637
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:03,575
I know exactly what you're saying.

638
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,354
No, I... I mean...

639
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:09,260
Us

640
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:11,940
In general. No offense.

641
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:14,485
What? No... None taken.

642
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:18,427
Yeah, I knew what
you meant. In general.

643
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,817
I chased him three blocks before
I realized we're doing Ash a favor

644
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,269
by letting him keep the shirt.

645
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:26,806
Anyone else hungry?

646
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:29,171
So busy being charitable,
I forgot to eat.

647
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:35,170
I just got a text from rusty, inviting
us to thanksgivingat the kt house.

648
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:36,480
Great! Let's go.

649
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:38,704
The kt house?

650
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,945
Don't worry, i'll protect you.

651
00:33:54,962 --> 00:33:56,351
What are you doing on the roof?

652
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,786
Not much. Just thinking.

653
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:01,345
This is definitely the spot
for that.

654
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,504
I do my best thinking up here.

655
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,538
Just gotta watch out for bird poo.

656
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:10,822
Heard you guys found the turkey.

657
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,655
It's being prepared for
the big feast as we speak.

658
00:34:13,882 --> 00:34:15,846
Sorry we had to cancel
dinner at our apartment.

659
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,931
Don't worry.
I know you and dale are busy.

660
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:20,661
What's going on with you?

661
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,040
It kinda involves, your sister, so

662
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:28,201
I don't know if you. It's fine.

663
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:31,193
Pretend like she's not my sister.
Pretend like she's some other girl.

664
00:34:32,651 --> 00:34:35,778
See? That's the thing. She's not just
some other girl.

665
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:38,204
At least not to me.

666
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:42,079
I had the opportunity to
be with her, and my "friend"...

667
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,845
talked me out of it.

668
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:47,651
Maybe this friend doesn't have
your best interests in mind.

669
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,281
Maybe he's just looking out for
himself.

670
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:01,432
i'm working on this project...

671
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,933
I'm making progress.

672
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,296
I mean, the...

673
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,086
Bulb lit up.

674
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,245
Briefly...

675
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:13,211
But it's something.

676
00:35:14,508 --> 00:35:15,884
It involves this wire

677
00:35:16,886 --> 00:35:18,352
that heals itself.

678
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:21,440
This wire can get cut, but
it just keeps growing back.

679
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:25,382
It could get cut over and over again,
and just keeps growing back.

680
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:28,700
It does not give up.

681
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:35,529
Neither will i.

682
00:35:38,214 --> 00:35:40,285
No matter how many times
they call me the anchor.

683
00:35:46,098 --> 00:35:47,554
So what are you gonna do?

684
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:54,503
I'm gonna have thanksgiving
dinner with my brothers.

685
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:07,610
He's not coming inside. We don't
care if it's thanksgiving.

686
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,958
It's not a big deal. I can just go.

687
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,829
Can you help us out here?

688
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:13,299
What seems to be the issue?

689
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:15,631
They won't let our guest in.

690
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:19,510
No OC is stepping foot in this house
without getting pounded...

691
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:21,970
...by my fist.

692
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,348
- In the face! I don't know...
- Look, guys.

693
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:29,418
If the pilgrims and indians can set
aside their differences for one meal...

694
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:31,997
- Can't we?
- And he brought a peace offering

695
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,948
that's much better than corn...

696
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,169
You know what? If...

697
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:40,656
the cowboys and indians can do it,
you know, so can we.

698
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:43,033
Come on in.

699
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:49,685
Sorry I bailed.

700
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:51,155
Turkey better be good.

701
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,685
Which one of these looks
more like an anchor?

702
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:15,794
As we near the end of our meal,
i'd like to propose a toast.

703
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,244
And no toast would be
complete without... The turkey!

704
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,947
Finally, some real food.

705
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,730
It's not that kind of turkey.

706
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,543
To the success of yet another
turkey hunt! Kts for life!

707
00:37:35,998 --> 00:37:38,149
You know, some people
can't pull it off

708
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:42,009
...but I bet you'd look
really good with a shaved head.

709
00:37:43,003 --> 00:37:44,058
Maybe I should go.

710
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:48,794
You shave him, I shave you, beaver.

711
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,314
Come on, rus. It's a cartwright
tradition. Make a wish.

712
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:06,086
Shoot. I was hoping for some
good luck with my project,

713
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:08,118
so I can destroy my competition.

714
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:10,287
Should probably go work on it.

715
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:13,874
I think I should get going, too.

716
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,375
I'll walk you home.

717
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:17,044
thanks.

718
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:19,091
See you at the house.

719
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:26,762
Thanks for having me, guys.
This was really fun.

720
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:08,478
Thanks for the walk home.
I think I can take it from here.

721
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:11,952
How about a nightcap?

722
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:18,160
No, I meant... I mean...

723
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:24,628
Wow, it must really be scary
being the only one here.

724
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:29,363
No boys allowed upstairs.

725
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:30,325
Wait, wait...

726
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,671
There's something I need to say.

727
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:06,371
I've been thinking...
About...

728
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:09,239
Stuff.

729
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,363
Really? Me too. Like, should
I get my hair colored?

730
00:40:13,392 --> 00:40:14,862
Would I look good as a brunette?

731
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:18,671
I think you'd look
gorgeous with any color.

732
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,715
Good to know.

733
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:22,461
Thanks.

734
00:40:23,142 --> 00:40:24,733
So anyway...

735
00:40:28,381 --> 00:40:29,730
You... You've been thinking.

736
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:34,282
I was thinking, um...

737
00:40:35,704 --> 00:40:36,987
I was just...

738
00:40:38,214 --> 00:40:39,617
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

739
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:45,911
I really wish things
worked out with us.

740
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:51,535
That was my wish, too.

741
00:41:01,014 --> 00:41:02,268
Dale! Hey, I got it...

742
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,418
I got it to work.

743
00:41:13,794 --> 00:41:14,836
So your wish?

744
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:21,354
Is that what you wished for
on your wish... Pretzel?

745
00:41:23,578 --> 00:41:26,733
You know, I'm sorry, I've been drinking.
Um, let's just talk tomorrow, ok?

746
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,041
No, let's talk now.

747
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:37,353
I poured my heart out to you
at the end of the world party,

748
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:39,465
and you didn't come after me.

749
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:42,322
You should've come after me.

750
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,061
I know.

751
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:47,801
And I have no excuse.

752
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:52,384
But I'm here now.
And I'm telling you...

753
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,871
Telling me what?

754
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:08,899
I want to try us again.

755
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:14,515
I want to be with you.

756
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:19,967
I want to be with you, too.
