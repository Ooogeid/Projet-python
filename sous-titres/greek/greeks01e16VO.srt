1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,316
<i>Previously on</i> Greek...

2
00:00:01,722 --> 00:00:04,986
Do you truly believe
Casey is over Cappie?

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:07,155
- Tell the truth.
- We kissed.

4
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,658
But it didn't go any further.
Evan, don't go.

5
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:12,145
I'm wearing your letters.
I'm planning forever with you.

6
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,162
- I love you.
- No, you love you!

7
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,652
The Omega Chis are stripping you
of the title of Sweetheart.

8
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:19,206
The brotherhood is not
comfortable maintaining

9
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:22,587
such a close relationship
between us and Zeta Beta Zeta.

10
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:26,950
Why you defend her?
She wasn't making your life any easier.

11
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:29,302
Frannie seriously lost it last semester,
no doubt.

12
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:32,427
- But she wasn't always like that.
- You went to the KT house

13
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:34,516
- the night of the Greek ball?
- You're my little sis.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,850
What was I supposed to do?

15
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,146
The way I feel about you
has nothing to do with Casey.

16
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:42,583
If you and Casey signed a peace treaty,

17
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,444
it would be so much easier
for us to have diplomatic relations.

18
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:49,447
- U-Sag flyer?
- What?

19
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,282
University students against Greeks.

20
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:53,413
Now is the time
to politicize my position.

21
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:56,736
I decided to move on, and so I did.
You can do it too.

22
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:59,498
Decide to be done with Jen K.,
and you will be.

23
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:03,076
Decide this is going to be
a great new semester, and it will be.

24
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:07,682
I'm telling you, Baldwin's rules
for ring closure, they don't even apply.

25
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:08,739
Dr. Albert's wrong.

26
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,546
Then somebody better change Baldwin's
rules between now and the final.

27
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:13,620
Dr. Albert is not infallible, Dale.

28
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:16,042
If you define "infallible"
as I do in this situation

29
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,851
as in "holds my future in her hands,"
then yes, she is.

30
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,098
What you looking at?
Dr. Albert?

31
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:23,153
Did she hear you say
she wasn't infallible?

32
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:24,857
Please, Lord,
grant me invisibility...

33
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:27,693
It's the girl
from my American lit class.

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,238
- Just don't stare so much.
- That girl right there?

35
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:35,801
I hate to say this,
but I liked it better

36
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:38,575
- when you weren't on the prowl.
- That's the Moby Dick girl.

37
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,887
I'm not real sure I'm comfortable
with that statement either.

38
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:42,594
Last week, in my American lit class,

39
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:44,973
Mr. Ellman pointed to me and he's like,
"Mr. Cartwright,"

40
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:47,337
and I said,
"No, please call me Ishmael."

41
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:49,298
Emma cracked up.

42
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,500
It's such a good story.

43
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:53,135
- Every time.
- She got the joke.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,970
I think she gets me.

45
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,942
- You know how rare that is?
- No, not really.

46
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,102
But what I do know is that obsessing,
particularly in the carnal realm,

47
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:05,108
distracts the mind from important
matters, like solid-state chemistry.

48
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,959
My work in solid-state chemistry
is not suffering because of Emma.

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,110
Well, mine is.

50
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:14,265
If you like this girl, for heaven's sake,
and mine, just ask her out.

51
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:18,432
She laughed at my joke,
she didn't give me her phone number.

52
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:23,087
Look how she closes her book first,

53
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,536
and then takes her last sip of coffee.

54
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,650
She'll meet you for coffee tonight
at the espresso farm, don't thank me.

55
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:53,486
Let's start with exo-digs,
you take favored, I'll take unfavored.

56
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:55,876
You wanna sit down
or you wanna just keep standing here?

57
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,913
Come on.

58
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:00,532
What's going on?

59
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:04,081
Caroline, Laurie, and Amy have been
invited to Lambda Sig pink rose formal.

60
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:05,609
Fantastic.

61
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:08,623
We're finally moving out
of the social dog house.

62
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,796
Under the amazing leadership
of Casey Cartwright.

63
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,885
So when do we call the Omega Chis?

64
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,264
To build on the momentum?

65
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,142
The Lambda Sigs are
the second hottest house on campus.

66
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:28,554
Now that they've officially taken us off
Greek death row with these invitations,

67
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:31,668
this is the perfect time to push for
a full pardon by setting up

68
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,107
a mixer with the first hottest house...

69
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:35,303
the Omega Chis.

70
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:41,999
- If you thought that was a good idea.
- Actually, I think it's a...

71
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,260
terrible idea.

72
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:45,770
But the Omega Chis are
a rightful social counterpart.

73
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,290
Rightful social counterpart B.J.K.

74
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:51,874
"Before Jen K."

75
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:54,548
And the shunning Omega Chi gave us
after the article was published?

76
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,282
Not to mention B.P.H.

77
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,239
Before...

78
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:03,370
- Paris Hilton?
- "Before public humiliation?"

79
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,142
The back-to-school carnival.

80
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:08,231
Am I the only one who remembers
the kissing booth debacle?

81
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:10,731
The way the Omega Chis
publicly humiliated us?

82
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:13,472
Why should we reward them
for treating us like that?

83
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:14,470
No, ladies.

84
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,696
ZBZs will find their way
to the top on their own merits.

85
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,989
And in the meantime...

86
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:22,814
We can celebrate,
and strengthen from within.

87
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,471
How about a game night?

88
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:27,921
We can order pizza, bake cookies...

89
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,503
Great, that sounds great.

90
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:35,785
It sounds great.

91
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:43,112
Greeeeeeekkkkkkkkk

92
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:48,355
7:00, 8:00.?
7:00 sounds great.

93
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:56,549
That's fine.

94
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,045
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you then.

95
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:01,879
All right, bye.

96
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:07,111
She wants to bring her roommate
along on our date.

97
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,303
That can't be a good sign.

98
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:13,178
If she didn't want to be alone with me,
why didn't she just break the date?

99
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:15,648
Pity can be a pretty powerful emotion.

100
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,916
Or...

101
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:21,783
She likes you so much already,
she wants to show you off.

102
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:23,781
All right,
maybe I should bring somebody to...

103
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,340
To keep her roommate busy.

104
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,516
So I can have a little
one-on-one time with Emma.

105
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:30,268
Good idea. Maybe get
one of your frat bros to go along.

106
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:33,924
No, I don't wanna have to explain how
this whole stupid date thing happened

107
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:38,068
to any of the guys at the fraternity.
Especially if it's go up in flames.

108
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,408
How about you go with me?
You're the one who got me into this.

109
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,863
I know you haven't been able
to see me in action.

110
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:52,916
You know, pure girls being
somewhat in short supply here at CRU.

111
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:55,972
I'm known in certain circles
as quite the ladies' man.

112
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,972
- I wouldn't wanna show you out there.
- What circles are those?

113
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:00,235
Purity pledge circles.

114
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:03,654
I was voted "most likely to
have the opportunity to become impure,

115
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,680
"but have the supreme self-control not to"
three years running in high school.

116
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,595
I just don't want to risk
our friendship over some girl.

117
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,978
I'm willing to take the risk.

118
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,082
All right, then.

119
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,483
If that's the way you want it, roomie.

120
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,013
But be forewarned.

121
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,929
I have no control over this charisma.

122
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:30,718
That sounds terrible.

123
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,325
Poor thing!

124
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,630
So I'll call you later.

125
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,465
That was Cappie.
He's sick.

126
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,713
Yeah, I'm suddenly feeling
a little nauseous myself.

127
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:47,637
Not having a boyfriend is nothing
to get yourself upset about.

128
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:50,453
You don't need a man
to have a fulfilling life.

129
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:53,351
You could be the next mother Teresa
or Rosie O'Donnell.

130
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:57,153
Caroline and Mandy have
already left for the movies yet?

131
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:59,149
Wait, you're not going to see Cappie?

132
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,977
- He's sick.
- Really?

133
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:08,067
- I saw Mandy...
- What?

134
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:09,566
It's just...

135
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,472
When we were together, I always
took care of him when he was sick.

136
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,103
But...

137
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:18,871
He's probably not even
thinking about that right now.

138
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,921
Maybe you can just send
him a nice warm e-card.

139
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,330
I'm sure it'd mean a lot to him.

140
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:35,102
Okay, I'm here.
So what's with all the secrecy?

141
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:38,003
We needed to talk
somewhere away from the house.

142
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,663
I'm worried about Casey.

143
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:46,033
I know you've supposedly gone through
this whole personality overhaul thing,

144
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,244
but I'm kind of weirded out

145
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,109
when you start talking
about your concern for Casey.

146
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,351
This is not about me. Didn't you notice
how everyone was looking at her

147
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,332
when she nixed mixing
with the Omega Chis?

148
00:07:57,496 --> 00:08:00,218
And I know you heard
someone call her "Lizzi."

149
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:01,219
So?

150
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,967
Casey, Lizzi.
It's an understandable mistake.

151
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:07,134
Casey is seriously being
blinded to what's good for the house

152
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:10,840
and herself by this
Evan-shaped mental block.

153
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:16,489
Which I know I helped to put there.
That's why I'm doing everything I can

154
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,562
to get everyone back
to their rightful places.

155
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:21,940
If you feel so strongly about this,
why don't you talk to Casey about it?

156
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,526
Because she might
be kind of weirded out.

157
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,337
Don't let her blow
this opportunity.

158
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,745
Not wanting to have
a mixer with the Omega Chis

159
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,656
couldn't possibly have anything
to do with my feelings for Evan.

160
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:40,591
I don't have feelings for Evan.

161
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:44,118
It doesn't matter to me if
he's arrogant, or rude, or dismissive...

162
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,257
- I don't even notice.
- Yeah, I can see that.

163
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,888
Did you know that Amanda gets PE credits

164
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:55,123
for massaging the varsity boys
during swim meets?

165
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:56,318
We should just go...

166
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,253
The Omega Chis publicly humiliated
the ZBZs at the back-to-school carnival.

167
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:01,741
Right?

168
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:07,091
From where I was standing,
Case, it looked more like...

169
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:09,097
Evan humiliated you.

170
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:13,103
But I could be so wrong.

171
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:19,441
You're right.
It was about Evan and me.

172
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:22,547
But he is an Omega Chi and I am a ZBZ.

173
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:25,045
Yes, you are.
And you're the best president ever.

174
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,181
And there are 50 other girls
in this sorority,

175
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:31,509
who didn't get dissed and who want
to resume relations with the Omega Chis.

176
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,360
50 hot, desirable Omega Chis,
including Calvin,

177
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,523
who might be waiting for an opportunity
to disagree with Evan Chambers.

178
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,789
- That part would be gratifying.
- I'm social chair.

179
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,640
I can extend the invitation.

180
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:47,735
But this isn't just about the party.

181
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,668
It's about normalizing relations.
I need to do it.

182
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:54,573
I can do it.

183
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,095
Wanna go fondle some swimmers first?

184
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,385
You are such a good friend.

185
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:13,571
- So how did you meet?
- Did you guys meet here?

186
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,451
- You can go first.
- No, you first.

187
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:17,919
Luck of the draw.
Housing office saw fit to put us

188
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,809
two brainiacs on the engineering dorm.

189
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,601
- Dale, we don't need...
- Honors floor.

190
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:25,979
I got a 2210 on my sats.
Rusty here got about the same.

191
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,800
- I got 2250.
- 780 in math.

192
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:29,901
790.

193
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:32,350
Dale's very proud
of his accomplishments.

194
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:34,686
It's okay.
Tina's not easily intimidated.

195
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:35,723
I see that.

196
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:38,852
So how are you liking american lit?

197
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:42,330
Honestly, I am finding Moby Dick
a little long and kinda stiff.

198
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,100
I can't believe I just said that.

199
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:52,797
I say things I don't
mean to say all the time.

200
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:54,502
Why do you think
I don't talk in class?

201
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:57,793
Well, I just figured you were
so far ahead of the discussion,

202
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,866
you were just waiting for
the rest of the class to catch up.

203
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,617
I wish.
Mostly I'm just trying to stay awake.

204
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:06,545
Which I guess brings us back
to Moby Dick being...

205
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:08,815
A little long and stiff.

206
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,277
- Is that what I think it is?
- What, what is?

207
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:15,474
His pledge pin?
Or his scarlet letter, if you will?

208
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:18,754
- He's in a frat.
- We prefer "fraternity."

209
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,173
I'm pledging Kappa Tau Gamma.

210
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,997
The Greek system should
be banned from college campuses.

211
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:28,209
You got a 2250 on your sats,
and you're down on the Greeks?

212
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:30,444
Well, the Greeks aren't so bad.

213
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:33,937
Emma, they're this totally ritualistic,
secretive society.

214
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,169
I think you may be taking
it a little bit too seriously.

215
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:40,347
You don't think it's serious
when an organization takes monies

216
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:42,349
from general students services fees,

217
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,643
but doesn't allow all students
to participate in its activities?

218
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:50,420
Well, the same could be said for
most clubs on campus and sports teams.

219
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:52,848
I could use some more coffee.

220
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:55,130
- Be right back.
- I can get that for you.

221
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,531
You know, I've started an organization
you may be interested in, U-Sag.

222
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:01,493
U- sag?
What does that stand for?

223
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,213
University students against Greeks.

224
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:07,999
- That was a complete disaster.
- Are you kidding? That was great.

225
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,984
That Tina's a real spitfire.

226
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:12,670
Dale, this was supposed
to be my date with the new girl,

227
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,658
and it turned into
the Greek inquisition.

228
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:17,425
They didn't even want us
to walk them back to their dorms.

229
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:20,493
If Tina wants to call me,
tell her it's okay.

230
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:21,346
I'm serious.

231
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:26,418
I just wanted to apologize
for abandoning you tonight.

232
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,478
I'm not much good with confrontation.

233
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,277
Your roommate likes it enough
for both of you.

234
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,600
I know.
I probably shouldn't have brought her.

235
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:36,974
I didn't really know you,
and anyway, I'm really sorry.

236
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:38,904
See you in class?

237
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:45,022
Maybe we can try it again?

238
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,489
Just you and me?

239
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:49,944
- Friday night?
- Sure.

240
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:51,262
Why not?

241
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,611
Did you tell her to call me?

242
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,192
I was looking for Dino.

243
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,250
- Dino?
- The Omega Chi president?

244
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,366
Yeah, I know.
I know who he is.

245
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:27,117
He's not here right now.
What did you want to talk to him about?

246
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,483
Just some Greek business.

247
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,751
- If that's okay with you.
- Why wouldn't it be with me?

248
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,925
Just that the OCs and the ZBZs
aren't exactly doing business anymore.

249
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,929
But if you want me to tell Dino
you stopped by, I'll tell him.

250
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,581
You know what?
Never mind.

251
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,675
I don't have to talk to him after all.

252
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,282
Thought maybe you could use
a massage or maybe a sponge...

253
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:36,682
- I thought you had a cold.
- I do.

254
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:39,263
- I also have pink eye.
- Bummer.

255
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,162
Well, there's some tea.

256
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,348
- I've gotta go.
- Wait.

257
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,658
What's under the white coat, doc?

258
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,291
It's... nothing that
should be seen through...

259
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:52,055
Crust.

260
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:53,873
Is it really that bad?

261
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:56,867
Okay, hold on.

262
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:06,158
Here we go.

263
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,998
- Better?
- A little.

264
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:16,244
- What?
- I didn't think that you'd come.

265
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:17,245
Why not?

266
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,691
Casey took care
of you when you were sick, right?

267
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,394
Well, yeah, but, I mean, you're not...

268
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,490
Tea!

269
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,242
What is this, Earl Grey?

270
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:31,865
It's chamomile.

271
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:34,372
Is there anything else I can do for you?

272
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:38,862
I don't wanna impose.

273
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,584
Let's see.
Would you mind...

274
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:46,962
Heating that up?

275
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,251
Yeah, it's just a little cold.
Thanks.

276
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:54,686
And maybe some Chicken noodle soup
in a cup, in, like, the mug, you know?

277
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:57,795
It's always better
when it's in a mug for when you're sick.

278
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,981
With some of the little
oyster crackers on top.

1
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,225
I'm sorry.

2
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:08,402
It's probably a good
thing you wore the coat.

3
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,624
So the social committee
is planning a game night,

4
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:22,762
and I'm taking a poll on board games.

5
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:24,360
More like boring games.

6
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:27,255
What we should be planning
is a great party with the Omega Chis.

7
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:28,598
I couldn't agree more.

8
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:31,367
Which is why I went to the Omega Chi
house just now

9
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,433
to discuss the possibility
of mixing with us.

10
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:35,566
My God, that's fantastic.

11
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:36,974
But they said no.

12
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,705
Really?

13
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:40,429
Did you talk to Dino?

14
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:43,577
We're still poison
as far as they're concerned.

15
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,466
But who cares, right?

16
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:48,990
We don't need the Omega Chis
to be the best sority at CRU.

17
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:50,604
We are the ZBZs.

18
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:52,423
We have the Lambda Sigs.

19
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:53,977
We have game night.

20
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,509
Now I'm gonna go change my clothes.

21
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:59,370
And then let's scatter some gories.

22
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:07,376
She did what she could.

23
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:08,631
I guess.

24
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:16,694
CD, cD jacket.

25
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:18,991
Think I'm set.

26
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,042
Were you able to include
any "Darwin lied"?

27
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,461
I tried, Dale, but

28
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:25,993
damnation seems like a little bit
of a romance killer.

29
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,653
You know what Emma's gonna like, anyway?

30
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,527
I don't, which is why I emailed
her a detailed questionnaire

31
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,216
with multiple options
in each musical category.

32
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:37,231
She hasn't sent it back, though,
so I thought I'd give her some choices

33
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:39,377
that she can cross-reference
while deciding.

34
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,413
Man, that's my third
email from Tina today.

35
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:43,515
She's really chompin'at the U-Sag bit.

36
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:45,272
I think she's gonna come
by our meeting tomorrow.

37
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:46,700
I don't get the attraction.

38
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,749
Tina's one of the most
abrasive people I've ever met.

39
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:52,244
I'm just not intimidated
by strong women.

40
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,467
And U-Sag is a big tent organization.

41
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:01,210
- Over here.
- Let me just go grab some coffee.

42
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:02,467
No! Sit.

43
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:04,315
Or... not.

44
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:06,317
Why don't we have mixers anymore?

45
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:08,524
"We" meaning "you and I"?

46
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,576
"We" meaning ZBZ and Omega Chi.

47
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:13,148
You guys totally shut down
the idea of having a mixer with us?

48
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:14,330
What's up with that?

49
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,827
I still have no idea
what you're talking about.

50
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:20,381
Casey said that she got a
seriously strong negative reaction

51
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,764
from Dino when she invited
you guys to mix with us.

52
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,652
Really?

53
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,659
That's weird.

54
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:26,775
When it comes to getting
back together with the ZBZs,

55
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,697
my sense is most of the guys
are fine with it, including Dino.

56
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,312
I need you to do something for me.

57
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,044
- Okay, let me just grab...
- No.

58
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,712
So this is what I need you to do.

59
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:35,590
"Indelible."

60
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,312
Crap.

61
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:39,511
See you at dinner, Tina.

62
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,489
What are you doing with our white board?

63
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,172
I just came by to drop off
a CD for Emma, and

64
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,111
it just fell off.

65
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:58,774
And I thought I would just
take it back to my dorm room,

66
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:01,451
slap some adhesive on it,
and bring it back.

67
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:02,366
It fell?

68
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,702
Crazy?

69
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,523
Good thing I was here.
And I have adhesive in my room, so...

70
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,773
I'm gonna go.

71
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,783
I can't speak for Emma, but

72
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:14,354
I really don't appreciate
being part of these little frat pranks.

73
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,524
- Give me back my white board.
- This has nothing to

74
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:19,118
- do with the fraternity.
- Then give it back.

75
00:20:26,382 --> 00:20:29,312
Don't you think it would
have been simpler to just erase it?

76
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:30,551
Yes, but...

77
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,970
Okay, I used their marker,
and it's indelible.

78
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:35,409
Who knew?

79
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,258
Yeah, they're in the middle of
this feud with these guys down the hall.

80
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,596
Hey, if you could find one
with a corkboard, that'd be great.

81
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,959
Hey, can you just
give this to Emma for me?

82
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,583
Any message?

83
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,830
Something...

84
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,674
Short and limp?

85
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:54,598
Just say it's from Rusty.

86
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:56,781
Here.

87
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:00,499
All right.

88
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,247
Look, we all know the ZBZs have been
looked down upon ever since the article.

89
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:07,470
But it's old news.

90
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,485
I think it's time we
gave them a second chance.

91
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,849
They're the same girls that we partied
with last semester, and

92
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:13,852
they're awesome.
I just don't think we should keep

93
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:16,319
punishing them for something that
could have happened to any of us.

94
00:21:18,424 --> 00:21:20,015
I think my little brother is

95
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,362
well-intentioned, but,
in this particular case, missguided.

96
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,039
I mean, come on, guys.

97
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:29,329
The events of the past few months
have just shown us who they really are.

98
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:30,679
I mean, they're a house...

99
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:31,680
That...

100
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:34,984
Always puts their own interests first,
and ultimately can't be trusted.

101
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:38,182
I mean, no matter how much
we might wanna trust them.

102
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,693
Do you really believe that?

103
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,599
Look, if this is about having a mixer,

104
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,559
the Tri Pis are always available.

105
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:44,937
A little too available.

106
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:47,338
Why don't we put it to a vote?

107
00:21:47,354 --> 00:21:50,611
All those in favor
of continuing to shut out the ZBZs?

108
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,418
All those opposed.

109
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:57,969
ZBZs have it.

110
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,324
What, did they just announce a new
season of "America's Next Top Model"?

111
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:14,154
Better!

112
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:16,579
Kyle, the Omega Chi social chair,

113
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:19,968
just came by to invite the Zeta betas
to mix with them this weekend.

114
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:22,778
Wow, that's...

115
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:24,978
That's so not what they said before.

116
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,580
But great.

117
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:29,104
We're gonna have to scramble
a little to get the registration forms

118
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,628
and keg application into
the dean's office in time.

119
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:33,888
But where there's a will, there's a way

120
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:36,942
to get through with the new party
restrictions. Right?

121
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:38,062
Right.

122
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:42,728
We're back on with the Omega Chis.

123
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:44,928
I wonder how all of this happened.

124
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:49,485
Did you ever actually
talk to Dino about a mixer?

125
00:22:50,173 --> 00:22:51,860
Why would you even ask me that?

126
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,361
'cause I talked to Calvin.

127
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:57,088
And from what he was hearing at
the house, it didn't sound like you had.

128
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:59,635
Let's go see that...

2
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,878
- That was really fun.
- Right?

3
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:08,186
I really meant to.

4
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:09,435
I wanted to.

5
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:10,948
I went over there,

6
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:14,358
and Evan answered the door,
and he was all cold and judgey.

7
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,180
I knew what I should say,

8
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,862
but I couldn't talk.

9
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,716
I couldn't give him the satisfaction
of knowing I wanted anything from him.

10
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:26,134
It's one night.

11
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:29,391
One night that'll make
two houses very happy.

12
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:31,921
And all you have to do
is sign our half of the registration

13
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,511
forms and get through
a few hours with Evan.

14
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:36,249
And I have a plan for that.

15
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,932
Hey, guys.

16
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:43,209
Emma loved the CD.
I just got a text from her. "T-h-x"

17
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:44,884
with an exclamation point.

18
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:46,535
- A bake sale?
- Car washes?

19
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:47,643
Just keep reading.

20
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:49,837
So I guess she wasn't phased
by the white board incident.

21
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:51,653
I told you, Dale, she gets me.

22
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:54,345
I just want to give her a couple
more song choices before class.

23
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,605
- This is truly ambitious.
- What are you guys doing?

24
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:58,939
We're meeting with Tina later
that afternoon about U-Sag.

25
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:02,098
I just want the guys here to be
up to speed on all our suggestions.

26
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:04,217
That's a lot of suggestions.

27
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:05,441
Tina's a real dynamo.

28
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,719
And I feel like, you know, it's my job
now to harness all her energy.

29
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:10,587
That sounds dirty.

30
00:24:10,723 --> 00:24:13,269
You think everything sounds dirty.
Guys, could we focus?

31
00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,485
Dale?
You ready?

32
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,589
Come in.

33
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,406
Let me introduce
you to Sanjay and Ted.

34
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,371
- Hi.
- Hi.

35
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,672
Sanjay, Ted.

36
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,729
Ishmael.

37
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:25,174
So are you guys ready to go?

38
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,858
I had a bunch of posters made up.

39
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,002
Posters? But,
I mean, we haven't really went over...

40
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:30,725
We gotta grow this thing.

41
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:34,439
I've got a hammer, and the rest
of you guys could just use your shoes.

42
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:37,757
Come on, guys, let's go!

43
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:38,956
Hurry up!

44
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,772
Nice harnessing.

45
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:47,608
Got extra shoes?

47
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:02,875
Anybody know where the charger to
Cappie's little video game machine is?

48
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:03,654
Nope.

49
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,958
I don't suppose you
have any saltine crackers.

50
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:21,944
Anybody?

51
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:25,540
How 'bout some peanuts?

52
00:25:25,896 --> 00:25:27,832
- They're warm.
- Works for me!

53
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,226
Okay.

54
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,581
I will pay anyone $200

55
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:44,334
to take this tray up to Cappie's room
and watch Reba with him.

56
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,252
We're on season five!

57
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:50,057
No one goes into Cappie's
room when he's sick.

58
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:52,261
It's like going into
the Bermuda Triangle.

59
00:25:52,604 --> 00:25:53,449
With germs.

60
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:55,271
The only one brave
enough to do that was...

61
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:55,996
Casey.

62
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:57,351
I know.

63
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,518
I hear she never left his side.

64
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:00,541
Yeah,

65
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,564
she was a real angel of mercy.

66
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,505
- Hey...
- Hey!

67
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,539
I also brought you

68
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:27,839
a set
of push pins.

69
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:31,011
Because, look,
it's got a corkboard on it.

70
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:34,541
And a new set of dry erase pens.

71
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:36,498
'cause you don't want
any more accidents.

72
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:38,493
No, that's for sure.
Thanks.

73
00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:41,172
And I got you a cup of coffee.

74
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:42,274
Careful.

75
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,766
And a full selection of additives.

76
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:50,443
Last, but not least, here is

77
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,838
a few more song samples,

78
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:54,657
an updated hard copy
of the cd questionnaire.

79
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:56,511
I figured, since you hadn't responded,

80
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:58,679
you were having trouble downloading
the attachment.

81
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,822
This is amazing.

82
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,008
The only bad thing is now

83
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,573
I feel like a real jerk for having
to postpone our date tonight.

84
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:13,325
I have a paper due
on Monday for my philosophy class.

85
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:14,557
And I...

86
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:16,694
Thought I'd be a lot
further along than I am.

87
00:27:16,817 --> 00:27:19,251
So now I have to work on it all weekend.

88
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:22,025
- I'm really sorry.
- That's okay.

89
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:26,487
When you're dating a student, you have
to expect these kinds of things, right?

90
00:27:26,655 --> 00:27:27,404
Right.

91
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,727
There, now you only have
to come in contact with Evan once.

92
00:27:32,847 --> 00:27:34,724
When you check his ID.
And stamp his hand.

93
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:35,811
Or his face.

94
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:37,893
Like you wouldn't love to.

95
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,090
Nice to see the Greek
world back on its axis.

96
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,792
How's Cappie?

97
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:46,840
Contagious?

98
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:47,895
Probably.

99
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:48,842
Whatever.

100
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:54,690
Enjoy your soda.

101
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:56,452
Thanks, Casey.

102
00:27:59,147 --> 00:28:00,850
This might not be so bad after all.

103
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:04,253
There's Calvin. Are you okay here?

104
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:05,394
Sure, I'm fine.

105
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:06,810
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

107
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:15,073
Let me just stamp
your hand and then

108
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:16,865
you can go get started.

109
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,632
You're ZBZ party patrol?

110
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,132
Your guy hasn't shown up yet.

111
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:25,666
Actually, he has.

112
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:27,948
It's me.

113
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,363
Oh, my God.

114
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:41,253
Is this a reunion of...

115
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:43,464
More than just our houses?

116
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,395
Or just an incredibly
awkward coincidence?

117
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,390
You're holding up the line, Frannie.

118
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,143
Do you think people can really change?

119
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:57,502
Right now, I'm more concerned
about having something

120
00:28:57,622 --> 00:29:00,423
that combustible so close
to the alcohol.

121
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:02,863
I think they're gonna be okay.

122
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:04,420
Let's go mingle.

123
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,905
If you stamp that hard,
it makes the ink wet.

124
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:16,770
If the ink stays wet,
it's easier for them to transfer stamps.

125
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,187
If you guys had invested
in wristbands instead of stamps,

126
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:20,934
we wouldn't have to worry about it.

127
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:24,036
Have fun.

128
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,469
You didn't check her ID.

129
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,350
She's over 21.
I've known her for two years.

130
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:29,670
It doesn't matter.
You still have to check her ID.

131
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:34,194
Right. I guess knowing someone for two
years doesn't mean that much in the end.

132
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:39,124
I'm over 21, Casey.

133
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:42,262
Beer is high in carbs and it makes
you bloat. I'm doing you a favor.

134
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:45,162
I guess you always gotta
make me be the bad guy.

135
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,903
So you can play the victim again.

136
00:29:47,423 --> 00:29:48,659
Man up, Condon.

137
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,341
Whatever role I play,
I have to be a mime,

138
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:54,080
since you never stop accusing
long enough to let me get a word in.

139
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:55,709
You mean you think you have some...

140
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:59,353
Some reasonable explanation for kissing
Cappie after I lavaliered you?

141
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:00,895
How about that I'm human?

142
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:02,345
That I make mistakes?

143
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:04,884
Like you did
when you rush-humped Rebecca.

144
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:07,559
Will you ever quit playing that card?

145
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:09,632
I was never in love with Rebecca.

146
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:13,401
You... move!
Move! Just move!

147
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:17,221
So?
Can I get re-stamped?

148
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:19,667
Listen, it wasn't
the same level of betrayal, okay?

149
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:21,518
You obviously still
had feelings for Cappie.

150
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:23,934
And I still have feelings
for Cappie, Evan.

151
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:26,079
Just like I still have feelings for you.

152
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:28,138
Maybe I always will.

153
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:29,987
Unlike the super-human Evan Chambers,

154
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:32,368
I don't seem to have control
over how I feel about people.

155
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:33,744
Most of the time however,

156
00:30:33,754 --> 00:30:36,075
I do have control over what
I do about those feelings.

157
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:38,273
And what I did was choose you.

158
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:41,089
I thought that
was the most important thing.

159
00:30:41,627 --> 00:30:43,395
Clearly, in your world, it isn't.

160
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:46,719
And then you dumped me
without trying to talk,

161
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:49,852
without giving me the second chance
I gave you.

162
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:00,585
O'Toole. Perfect.

163
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:04,156
You're gonna have to do this, man,
you're it.

164
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:05,459
I need a drink.

165
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:13,243
Dr. Logan.

166
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:15,200
You're...

167
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:19,862
A scary scandinavian woman.

168
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,846
It's nurse Von Lembke.
But you can call me Helga.

169
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:25,646
Why would I wanna do that?

170
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:28,848
Rebecca Logan sent me.
She said it's time for you to get well.

171
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:32,262
Shall we start with
the nasal irrigation?

172
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,097
Emma must be really working hard.
She's not even answering her phone.

173
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,402
I just hope she got that
care package I sent her.

174
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:48,440
Could you keep your voice down, please?

175
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:49,392
Why?

176
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:52,304
'cause Tina said she was coming over,
and I do not want to talk to her.

177
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,779
And put your phone on vibrate.

178
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,561
Whatever happened to "Not being
intimidated by strong women"

179
00:31:57,712 --> 00:31:59,524
"Harnessing that dynamo"?

180
00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:01,330
She's trying to take over U-Sag.

181
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,579
She emails me at least
a dozen times a day.

182
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,533
She put her email on all the flyers.
Now she's even got

183
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:08,168
Ted and Sanjay including a prayer

184
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:11,047
for a greater U-Sag profile
on campus in their daily intercessions.

185
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:13,266
Well, dale,
you just can't hide out here.

186
00:32:13,386 --> 00:32:15,464
You're eventually going
to have to talk to her.

187
00:32:15,656 --> 00:32:16,632
No, I won't.

188
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,671
Are you just gonna will her away?

189
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,909
I believe in science
and creationism.

190
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,743
My mind is a powerful instrument.

191
00:32:23,882 --> 00:32:24,744
Hello?

192
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:27,930
It's Tina.
Anybody in there?

193
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:29,636
Don't say anything.

194
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:31,274
Is that you, Dale?

195
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,828
I'm actually here to see Rusty.

196
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:35,689
It's a ruse.
Don't fall for it.

197
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,787
- Do not let her in.
- Don't be ridiculous, Dale.

198
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,527
What's going on in there?

199
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,170
What's going on in there is that

200
00:32:47,492 --> 00:32:49,982
Dale wants U-Sag back.

201
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,183
- What are you talking about?
- You...

202
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:54,379
overstepping your boundaries.

203
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:57,117
As much as I disagree
with U-Sag,

204
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,822
it's important to Dale.

205
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,216
It's his brainchild.

206
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,906
You took a simple invitation to join,
and you ran wild with it.

207
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:06,901
I thought that the goal
was to get rid of the Greek system.

208
00:33:07,021 --> 00:33:09,668
It is, unfortunately. But...

209
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:11,575
Dale wants to do it his way.

210
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,602
And you had no right to come
in and pull the rug out from under him.

211
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:17,132
The guy's freaked out.

212
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:19,149
So you just need to back off.

213
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,400
Yeah, well, I didn't come
here to talk about U-Sag anyway.

214
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:25,840
I came here to give you this.
It's from Emma.

215
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:27,854
Your care package.

216
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:30,936
I mean, between the cd and
the white board and the coffee

217
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:33,126
and the questionnaire, and now this...

218
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,077
I mean, you're scaring her.

219
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:36,833
She wants you to back off.

220
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:02,528
Frannie...

221
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:04,205
What do you want?

222
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:09,807
To apologize.

223
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:13,593
For screwing things up with you
and Casey last semester.

224
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:19,596
I don't even wanna think about me
and Casey anymore.

225
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:22,953
Or maybe I can help.

226
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:31,364
My...

227
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:36,621
Not exactly what I had in mind.

228
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:39,676
- Really?
- Look, Evan...

229
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,295
You're a gorgeous guy, with

230
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,334
many, many fine attributes.

231
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:48,394
You're also...

232
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:49,554
Clearly

233
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:51,635
Still working out some issues.

234
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:55,744
I'm not interested in being
anyone's warm body.

235
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:57,960
I got it.

236
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,988
Evan. I need my shoes.
Where are my shoes?

237
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,348
- Right there.
- Yes, okay.

238
00:35:52,468 --> 00:35:54,145
You look like crap.
Where are you going?

239
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:59,795
I'm gonna go tell Casey I'm an idiot,
and I want her back.

240
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:02,417
Good luck with that.

241
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:05,826
Casey.

242
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:09,105
- You look amazing.
- I feel pretty amazing.

243
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:11,610
I'm done, Evan.

244
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:13,101
Done with what?

245
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,275
With all this.

246
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,061
I'm finished being angry with you.

247
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:19,842
I woke up this morning
and I finally realized no matter

248
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:22,720
what I say or do,
I can't change the past.

249
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,273
Or how you feel about it.

250
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,502
And I'm done trying.

251
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:29,863
I'm finally ready to move on.

252
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:34,324
Move on...

253
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,331
From us?

255
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:47,545
And what if I was
less of a jealous idiot?

256
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,067
Then I'd think maybe
we could be friends...

257
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:53,913
If you think you can do that.

258
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:56,215
Friends?

259
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,814
Think about it.

260
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:06,762
See ya around campus...

261
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,157
Evan Chambers.

262
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:24,965
Hey, you're up early.

263
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:27,393
I've got coffee, thanks.

264
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:29,433
This one's mine.

265
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:31,134
Look, Emma...

266
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:33,568
I just want to apologize

267
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:35,524
for coming on so strong.

268
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:37,933
I never meant to scare you

269
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:40,445
or seem like a crazy person.

270
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:42,241
That's okay.

271
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:44,220
Yeah, I guess I'm just...

272
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,919
Overly enthusiastic.

273
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:49,595
I really liked you.

274
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,733
And I really liked being in a
relationship when I was in one before.

275
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:55,312
And I guess when it...

276
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,641
Seemed like I might have a shot
at a new one, I kind of jumped the gun.

277
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,325
I'm sorry for
the firearms metaphors.

278
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:05,880
Don't worry about it.

279
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:09,230
Yeah, I don't know.

280
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,382
It's probably obvious that...

281
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:15,753
I don't have a lot of experience
in the romance department.

282
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,145
But I'm a fast learner.

283
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:21,723
And maybe if I totally put
the brakes on,

284
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,936
we can try again.

287
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,637
But I'll see you in class, okay?

289
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:43,525
We need to talk.

290
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:45,895
About what?

291
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:49,177
Do you still wanna
move back into the house?

293
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,133
Then do it.

294
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,378
You're officially off probation.

295
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:57,517
We're moving forward.

296
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:08,816
Good morning.

297
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:12,484
What did you do to him?

298
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:14,233
You know the rules, Ms. Logan.

299
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:15,938
What happens in Cappie's room

300
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:17,757
stays in Cappie's room.

301
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:27,076
Still contagious, right?

302
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,698
No, I was just wearing this because,
apparently,

303
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:33,447
Helga likes pirates.

304
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:35,706
- You two...
- Did not.

307
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,538
I am currently a one-woman man.

308
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:44,604
Look, Cappie...

309
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,774
I am not now,
nor will I ever be Casey Cartwright...

310
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,241
- Perfect girlfriend, angel of mercy.
- Well, thank God.

311
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,927
You really are a colossal pain in the
ass when you're sick, you know that?

312
00:39:58,341 --> 00:39:59,972
I don't know how she stood you.

313
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:03,269
Well,
she is an angel.

314
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:07,493
And
she discovered my achilles heel.

315
00:40:08,134 --> 00:40:09,164
Cough syrup.

316
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,809
Knocks me on my butt.
She'd give me a dose,

317
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,682
climb out the window, and come back
by the time I need another one.

318
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:15,821
No one knew.

319
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,398
She didn't even think I knew.

320
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:20,358
What?

321
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,364
Only makes me like her more.

322
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:26,256
Really?

323
00:40:27,284 --> 00:40:28,632
We talkin' threesome now?

324
00:40:29,851 --> 00:40:31,136
Who said you're invited?

325
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:34,203
You're bad.
You naughty little girl.

326
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:41,195
I had a new idea for a U-Sag flyer,

327
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:45,231
and I just wanted to run it by Dale
and see if he would sign off on it.

328
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,286
I'll make sure he gets it.

330
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:50,841
For what it's worth,

331
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:54,533
Emma likes her crazy on the outside,
not the inside.

332
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:56,927
You're the first guy
she's gone out with all semester

333
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,953
that's not covered in
tattoos and body piercings.

334
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:00,306
I'm not crazy, okay?

335
00:41:01,115 --> 00:41:03,577
And I'm not an egomaniacal
control freak.

336
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,935
Look...

337
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:09,059
you probably won't understand this,

338
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:12,429
and I don't even know why
I feel the need to explain it to you,

339
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,767
but I like to be in things.

340
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:17,104
And all the ramp-up,

341
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,265
getting-to-know-you part
makes me feel anxious.

342
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:22,868
So I kind of sort of just
jump over it.

343
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,063
Which can make me seem a little...

344
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:27,904
pushy.

345
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:36,178
Okay?
Well,

346
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:38,574
you better watch out for us, frat boy.

347
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:40,518
Go, U-Sag!
