1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:02,096
- <i>Previously...</i>
- I don't even wanna think

2
00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:04,276
- about me and Casey anymore.
- Maybe I can help.

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:09,573
We need to talk.

4
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:14,277
You still wanna move back
into the house? Then do it.

5
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:18,257
That senator Logan
could do so much for us.

6
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:21,596
I used to see everything in terms
of whether it would piss off my parents.

7
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:23,339
You like to walk on the wild side!

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,006
I just don't want people to think
I was dating you to get to her.

9
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:29,343
- What is it exactly you see in her?
- She like me for me.

10
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,512
I want to rush a fraternity.

11
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:34,979
Who would choose to hang out with
a bunch of drunkards whose goal in life

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,280
is to fornicate on as many
vapid sorority girls as possible?

13
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:41,063
- I'm gonna pray for you.
- Do you have any brothers or sisters?

14
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,732
- Not really.
- She can't tell anyone about me?

15
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,607
You have your world and I have mine.

16
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,416
Gentlemen!

17
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:59,206
We are at the threshold of an invasion

18
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,909
by a vast and powerful army,

19
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,756
an international force that strikes fear

20
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:07,779
and awe into the hearts
of the bravest among us.

21
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:10,551
It's an Omega Chi retaliation.

22
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:12,847
Freshmen parents' weekend.

23
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,671
Now, as tradition dictates,
every house on Greek row hosts

24
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,812
some sort of event
for your folks to enjoy.

25
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:25,202
And to let them see the money
they drop on dues every semester

26
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:27,474
- is being well-spent.
- As usual,

27
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,331
we at Kappa Tau
host our annual barbecue.

28
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:36,429
And as usual, preparation of said events
falls on your...

29
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,434
at times questionable shoulders.

30
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:44,898
- Am I hearing whining?
- I think you are.

31
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:49,250
Freshmen parents' weekend.

32
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,939
Freshmen do the work.

33
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,538
And even if it wasn't,
need I remind you... pledges.

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,932
Now, the very nature of this event
is entirely up to you.

35
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:02,362
You gonna clean up,
you gonna put a little extra effort in,

36
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,726
make it all spiffy for mom and pa?

37
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:07,763
Or are you gonna show yourselves off
in your natural habitat

38
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:10,417
and fly that Kappa Tau flag freely?

39
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:23,368
- We're flying our flag?
- Come on.

40
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:27,254
This ain't high school anymore.
We do what we want when we want.

41
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,061
Who cares what our parents think?
As pledge class president,

42
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,307
I say no cleaning.

43
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:37,042
And we'll heat up some hot dogs...
maybe.

44
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:42,804
Both my parents are professors.

45
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:46,188
I don't think they're exactly
gonna appreciate the Kappa Tau flag.

46
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:49,274
Your pledge brothers have chosen.

47
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:52,757
Besides, what are your parents
going to expect, really?

48
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:54,527
You told them about us.

49
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:57,616
What do you mean,
mom and dad don't know about Kappa Tau?

50
00:02:57,738 --> 00:03:00,452
I know you talked about it over break.
Would you just...

51
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:02,879
Sorry.
We did.

52
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,332
I just haven't told them
any real specifics.

53
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:07,225
So what do they know?

54
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:11,400
- They think it's a service fraternity.
- A service fraternity?

55
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:15,412
- The Kappa Tau service.
- The beer industry.

56
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:19,526
I've never lied to mom and dad before.
How can I tell them the truth?

57
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:23,086
You know how they feel about
the Greek system, especially mom.

58
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:26,312
- It's a dangerous distraction...
- From academics and your future.

59
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,781
I've heard. If you need a living,
breathing example

60
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:32,417
of someone who manages to survive
without parental approval...

61
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:34,528
Look no further.

62
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:37,245
Maybe you can
help me explain it to them.

63
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:39,460
Come on, they've accepted
your involvement at ZBZ.

64
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,465
First, "accepted"
isn't the word I'd use,

65
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:44,576
and secondly, this whole weekend
is about you, little man.

66
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:47,310
I'll be entertaining
a senator and his wife,

67
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,794
which means press coverage.

68
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,008
Which means nationals
will be all over it.

69
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,589
Which means I don't have
time to manage Karen and Russell.

70
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,968
Just tell them the truth.

71
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,804
Dad'll give you his stern,
yet understanding frown.

72
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,617
Mom will just put her hand on her chest
and look disappointed and judgmental.

73
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:07,168
- You can take it.
- Yeah, you're right.

74
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:12,452
I'm a big boy. I can do this.
I'm gonna tell 'em the truth.

75
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:15,958
I'm gonna tell 'em the Kappa Taus
are a regular fraternity.

76
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,315
They don't give a crap about academics,
and they like to party.

77
00:04:19,316 --> 00:04:22,505
<i>Flight 510 from Chicago
has arrived at Gate number 3.</i>

78
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:25,621
Look, in 47 hours and 11 minutes,

79
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,653
we'll be back here sending them

80
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,147
home to Chicago.

81
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,548
I can't tell them the truth.
It's gonna kill them.

82
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:40,623
- There's my little big man!
- I missed you.

83
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:42,809
I missed you too.
You look great.

84
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:45,515
How are you?
You look lovely.

85
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:49,140
- That's wonderful.
- I know.

86
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:51,849
I'm so excited to spend
some time with you guys.

Greek Episode 1x17
"47 hours and 11 minutes 3

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,927
Subtitles:
Kasius, AkaZab.

87
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:01,949
Where are the spoons?
And we need extra forks, please.

88
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:04,241
Could you put this
back in the fridge?

89
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:06,868
It'll be sour by the time
everyone gets here this afternoon.

90
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,826
Is there anything I can do to help?
What's Senator Logan's ETA?

91
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:12,607
- Did you speak with him directly?
- His aide confirmed this morning.

92
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:14,461
They know when the tea is starting.

93
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,680
If you ever need anyone to delegate,
you can just delegate out to...

94
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:22,330
Sorry.
Overstepping.

95
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,950
Aren't you excited, though?
We're hosting a US Senator and his wife.

96
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,997
A man who every day makes decisions that
effect great change for this nation.

97
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,396
- I have a million questions.
- My only question for them

98
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:37,132
is at what age did they have
Rebecca's horns and demon tail removed?

99
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:38,222
Right.

100
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:42,964
So I'm surprised the Omega Chis haven't
tried to get in on the senator action.

101
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:47,697
Ashleigh heard they're taking parents
to Canyon Lake for a weekend retreat.

102
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:51,607
So... you haven't been in touch
with Evan

103
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,937
- since the mixer.
- Not really.

104
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:56,710
- Why?
- No reason.

105
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:59,673
I'll go make sure that
the cream is safe and chilled.

106
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,722
- She making you crazy?
- She's not.

107
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:07,940
Just a reminder.

108
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,191
My mother likes chamomile tea
with a twist of lemon,

109
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:12,338
and my father hates biscotti.

110
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:16,732
This is the first I'm hearing
about the biscotti.

111
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:18,559
Breathe.
This is manageable.

112
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,153
We'll just separate the biscotti out

113
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,845
like the loser crouton
cookie-wannabes they are.

114
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:27,868
- And everything's gonna be fine.
- Thank you.

115
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,459
So what about your parents?
Are they gonna come by?

116
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,071
They missed our freshmen parents'
weekend 'cause you got sick.

117
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,122
And then I miraculously got well

118
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:39,296
- when they decided not to come.
- Yeah, that was crazy.

119
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:44,233
- And I am so stupid.
- No, you're not. You're not stupid.

120
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:47,304
You just have great, nonjudgmental
parents that you never lie to.

121
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:49,495
You can't imagine
other people lying to theirs.

122
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,798
- But you're awesome.
- But I'm not Rusty.

123
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,708
They get him.
They don't get me.

124
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,897
- They don't get the whole greek thing.
- But they're okay with the KTs?

125
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:58,559
That is Rusty's problem.

126
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,861
Me? I'm on tap for a few meals
this weekend, and that's it.

127
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:04,905
Which is exactly how I want it.

128
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,369
Does anyone like biscotti?

129
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,998
A student photography exhibit?

130
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:17,545
Love that.

131
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,041
And Professor Bernstein
is doing a Tai Chi demonstration.

132
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:25,653
When are you taking 'em over
to your house of ill repute?

133
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,901
I don't think they'll find
that as interesting as...

134
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,126
the parents' fireside chat
at Lockhart Pavilion.

135
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,715
That's good. You're embarrassed.
Means your conscience is kicking in.

136
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,909
I'm not embarrassed, Dale.

137
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,727
It's just not part of my life
they'd understand.

138
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:46,315
When I told my parents about
your descent into the Greek sect,

139
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:50,070
my mother cried, my father said "GD"
for the first time in his life.

140
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:54,172
- Why'd you tell them?
- 'Cause they're my best friends.

141
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:03,597
Kettlewells!

142
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,006
Come here!

143
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:12,008
- You look wonderful, sugar toes.
- You always say that, mom.

144
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,970
And she always means it.

145
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,073
- Now, how are you, son?
- I'm wonderful.

146
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:20,642
This is Norma.
I'm Fred.

147
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,301
You must be Rusty.

148
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:24,832
Nice to meet you.

149
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:27,174
We've heard a lot about you.

150
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:36,127
- What's that?
- An air mattress.

151
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:39,958
You know, 'cause of my dad's sciatica,
he can't just sleep on the floor.

152
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:43,464
- They're sleeping here?
- They're only here for two days.

153
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:45,827
We want to spend as much time
together as possible.

154
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:46,828
Great...

155
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:50,327
I just didn't realize
they were bunking with us.

156
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,472
We're very tolerant people, Rusty.

157
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:59,811
I see you're getting a lot
of mileage out of your granddad's flag.

158
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:01,962
He'd be proud.

159
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,748
What's it like being
a senator's daughter?

160
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:14,166
- What's it like being a hippie's son?
- My parents are too young to be ones.

161
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,781
They're free spirits.

162
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:17,936
And hemp connoisseurs.

163
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:20,707
And there's nothing special
about being their son.

164
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,542
Neither is being
a senator's daughter.

165
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:26,994
Except for the money, the power,
the prestige, the press.

166
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,032
The restriction,
the phonies, the scrutiny.

167
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,683
You make it sound
a lot more fun than I do.

168
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,590
Can we please not talk about my family?

169
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,919
Look, I just want
some pre-introduction stats.

170
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,550
Like is your father a cigar guy
or an "all smoking is bad" guy?

171
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:43,745
Or is he into golf or team sports?
What about your mom?

172
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:46,066
- Is she...
- You're not gonna meet them, okay?

173
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:49,194
I just don't wanna do
the whole meet the parents thing.

174
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,596
I was just thinking we could
have a nice meal

175
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:58,662
with some amuse-bouche,
something poached, maybe chutneyed.

176
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:00,053
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:03,393
This is new, and it's nice.

178
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:07,128
And I don't wanna jam it
under the parent microscope yet.

179
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,027
- Is that all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, fine.

180
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,213
Sure. Your call.

181
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,098
So you ready to work off
this massive brunch?

182
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:19,329
Here.

183
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,337
What's this?

184
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:28,502
- What an extensive selection of events.
- Honey, look!

185
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,420
It's an astronomical
introduction to the night sky.

186
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:34,616
I'd love to hear their take on Pluto.
Stupid dwarf planet.

187
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:38,076
And then after lunch,
we have this fun...

188
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,063
geological walking tour of the campus.

189
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,624
And then there's an open house
at the engineering department.

190
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:48,314
We have an historical
walking tour of the campus,

191
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,255
a special lecture on cyberspace
and metapolitics,

192
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:53,842
dinner...

193
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:57,637
Then bed.

194
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:02,772
- Casey, will you be joing us today?
- You know, I would love to.

195
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:05,895
Cyber-politics and meta-space
are always hard to pass up.

196
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:08,455
But I am slammed this weekend.

197
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,390
And I figured freshmen parents' weekend.

198
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:14,561
You being the parents,
Rusty being the freshman...

199
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,783
- I'll see you all at dinner tonight.
- Sorority's keeping you busy, huh?

200
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,200
Actually, we're hosting
a US senator today... Senator Ken Logan.

201
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:28,244
A man who every day makes decisions
that effect great change in our nation.

202
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,712
Well, a sorority is a good place
for Senator Logan.

203
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:33,979
I mean, after all of his votes
against funding higher education...

204
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,014
He'd be an idiot to go anywhere
near anything remotely academic

205
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:38,178
on a college campus.

206
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:41,931
ZBZ has the highest
cumulative grade point average

207
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:45,540
- of all the sororities on campus.
- Well, that's great, honey.

208
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,562
What about your fraternity, Rusty?

209
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:51,067
Serious, like-minded boys without
any sort of animal housedistractions.

210
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:53,225
I mean, you must be pushing a 4.0.

211
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,685
- I'm not sure if anyone's added it up.
- Or could.

212
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:59,193
- What was that, honey?
- Coffee.

213
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:00,779
It's good.

214
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:03,713
I don't see anything
about your little fraternity on here.

215
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:06,464
Are we gonna be able
to check that out later?

216
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:09,584
Unfortunately, it's closed this weekend.

217
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,935
Because most of the guys
are out of town.

218
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:16,379
In Mexico.

219
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:21,365
- Building huts.
- Is that right?

220
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,056
It's for humanity.

221
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,820
Like habitat for humanity.

222
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,401
But huts, so...

223
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:31,369
Hubitat.

224
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:38,145
- They're great people.
- You guys should probably get going.

225
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,989
- Don't wanna miss any of that tour.
- You're right.

226
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,250
Miss you.

227
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:55,914
Now, this sedimentary dolomite rock

228
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:58,827
happens to be known as big singer.

229
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:02,598
Not because it actually sings.

230
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,348
But because back
when this was a sugar beet farm,

231
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,800
the pickers used to have their lunch...

232
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,897
Next to this rock and sing
whimsical folk songs...

233
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:13,876
About how they enjoyed working together.

234
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:19,423
<i>- She'll be comin'around the mountain...</i>
- Are these the crazy Cartwrights?

235
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:22,699
- I don't know about crazy...
- I'm Karen. This is Russell.

236
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,826
- Hi. I'm the...
- Charles.

237
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:28,204
- Huh? My... my name isn't...
- These are my parents.

238
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,334
- You got a good kid here.
- He's a little uptight,

239
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:35,931
but we're working on that, right?

240
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:38,965
- I'll see you at the house.
- The house?

241
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,128
Kappa Tau.
For parents' weekend.

242
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:45,197
- You're... you're coming, right?
- Right.

243
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:47,765
What about Mexico?

244
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:51,143
Gee, that'd be kind of far away,
but real fun.

245
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:53,438
Don't forget the cups.

246
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:57,317
- Nice to meet you, Charles.
- Are there any questions?

247
00:13:57,996 --> 00:13:59,694
What happened to building huts?

248
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:02,969
They must have gotten done early.

249
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,062
- If you'll follow me, please.
- Tour's leaving.

250
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:07,194
You don't wanna miss
the titan botanical gardens.

251
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:09,787
- It's a highlight.
- Why did he call you Spitter?

252
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,790
That's my nickname.

253
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,937
Yeah. I spit on injustice everywhere.

254
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:21,964
Figuratively.

255
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:29,853
And, Ash, make sure there are ZBZs near
him at all times to maximize photo ops.

256
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:34,370
While Senator, Mrs. Logan and the press
are here, they are priority numero uno.

257
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:35,952
Got it.

258
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:43,535
I hope your folks
will be favorably impressed.

259
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:47,035
They'll be touched by your concern
for their happiness and...

260
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:49,702
Wait...
I still see biscotti.

261
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,178
- What are you doing here?
- Change of plans.

262
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:10,515
Rusty's fraternity's throwing
a last-minute dinner tonight.

263
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:12,023
The KT barbecue.

264
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,557
I realized I need a little time
to help my brothers

265
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:18,731
at the service fraternity
get the place ready

266
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:21,486
- before mom and dad come over.
- And we thought

267
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,487
since we hadn't gone to your parents'
weekend your freshman year,

268
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:27,073
- that, why not give it a shot now?
- Why not?

269
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,196
Unless it's some trouble, and
then we can always go back to the hotel.

270
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:34,330
Or pitch in and help Rusty's fraternity.
Would they mind that?

271
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,986
No... trouble at all.

272
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:39,397
It's great.

273
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,089
Come on in and have some tea.

274
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:45,259
- I'll see you at dinner tonight.
- Love you.

275
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:51,741
This is the route I take every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday at 10 a.m.

276
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:54,341
To solid state chemistry
with Dr. Juergens.

277
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:57,873
Which reminds me... I actually
have a paper I kinda need to go finish.

278
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,857
But we want to trace
every moment of how you spend your day.

279
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,400
And photograph it!

280
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,169
Let's go! I got a new pair of scholl's.

281
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,872
Let's go.

282
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,404
I know nobody cares
what their parents think.

283
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,569
Unfortunately, I do.

284
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:21,444
I just wanna clean up a little.
I'll do it myself.

285
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:25,551
- No one has to help.
- Are you showing shame for the KT ways?

286
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:27,503
I know. I'm sorry.

287
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:32,292
But I am trying to live up
to the Cartwright ways.

288
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:34,676
My parents are not
ready to see the new Rusty.

289
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:36,427
Your parents aren't ready?

290
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:39,637
I'm not ready to show him to them.

291
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:41,773
They like me the way I was.

292
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:45,474
It's not like you had
a sex change operation, Spitter.

293
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:48,543
But... your adam's apple
is a bit less pronounced.

294
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:50,064
Come on, Cap.

295
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:51,820
Ease up.

296
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,409
You're not alone.

297
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:58,964
Happens every year.

298
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:02,251
Friday night,
you're all a bunch of tough guys,

299
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:05,664
and Saturday morning,
you turn into Amelia Bedelias.

300
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,504
Go on, grab your apron.
Get to work.

301
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:16,829
And if you guys want some coffee,
we have regular and decaf.

302
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,772
I doubt the boys' little soiree
will be quite this impressive.

303
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,275
I'm sure most of the money goes towards
philanthropy rather than entertaining.

304
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,362
Case, do you gals have any biscotti?

305
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:33,921
Check the chairs. Stay here.
I'll be right back.

306
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:45,907
- Look at you. You look wonderful.
- Thank you!

307
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,890
- Where's mom?
- Mom wasn't feeling very well.

308
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:52,359
But I get you to myself all weekend.

309
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,371
- What's wrong?
- Nothing to worry about.

310
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:57,967
- She's just a little tired.
- Senator Logan. I'm Casey Cartwright.

311
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:01,714
- President of the ZBZs.
- Nice to meet you, madame president.

312
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:04,856
- This is some house.
- Please make yourself at home.

313
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:10,238
- What happened?
- There's nothing to discuss.

314
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,905
I'm here, and we're gonna
have a great weekend together.

315
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:17,596
Now, we have reservations
for dinner tonight.

316
00:18:17,948 --> 00:18:21,998
And tomorrow, I expect you'll be
my date at the dean's reception, okay?

317
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:25,332
Will you look at this spread?

318
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:27,970
- Ken Logan.
- Senator.

319
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:30,590
Which one of these impressive
young ladies is yours?

320
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:33,079
I'm hers.
She's mine.

321
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,317
My daughter and I were talking earlier
about your higher education funding.

322
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:40,640
Would you... excuse us?

323
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:43,057
I need to... Come.

324
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:45,897
Nice to meet you.

325
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:50,473
I wasn't gonna attack the man.
I was gonna ask him a question which,

326
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:52,862
as an elected official,
he should be able to field.

327
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,521
But... here?
Write the guy a letter.

328
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,300
Fine. Fine.

329
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,239
Well, let's talk about you.

330
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,825
I'm Ashleigh.
I'm Casey's roommate.

331
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:08,294
I can't tell you how much morale has
improved since Casey's become president.

332
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:11,714
She basically saved us from losing
our charter, which would have been...

333
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,648
Whatever. But because of her hard work,

334
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:18,888
we are still in good standing.

335
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:22,329
- That's terrific.
- Yeah, it really is.

336
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:23,983
Because now we can

337
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:26,938
focus all our energy on the reasons
we joined ZBZ in the first place.

338
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,184
Like parties and mixers and...
Sister bonding.

339
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,365
And... rituals, traditions.

340
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:40,141
You guys are out of tea.
Would you get them some more?

341
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:41,327
Philanthropy.

342
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:45,122
My grades are good.
Everything's fine.

343
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,333
And I am still very
much considering law school.

344
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:49,252
To be a lawyer?

345
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:51,683
I'm not... sure...

346
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:53,427
At this exact moment.

347
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:57,343
Well, before you go down a road,
you need to know where you're headed.

348
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:00,508
Well, I'm thinking about politics.

349
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,516
Casey, honey, come on.
This is your junior year.

350
00:20:03,815 --> 00:20:06,665
You need to start making
some tough decisions.

351
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,586
Now? At a sorority tea?

352
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:12,849
Look at Rusty.
He's focused.

353
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:14,910
He's getting his BS
in polymer sci.

354
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:17,046
He's going to graduate,
go to graduate school.

355
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,622
He's gonna go to JPL...

356
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,741
As you've made clear,
I am not him.

357
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:22,823
We don't expect you to be Rusty.

358
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:25,160
What I want is to be
at the center of things,

359
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:26,956
to be challenged and inspired.

360
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,959
I'm just not sure
what form that's going to take.

361
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:33,186
If you took a little less time
with your social life

362
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:36,395
and saving the sorority,
you could be specific.

363
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:39,022
- We worry about you.
- Don't.

364
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:42,170
Why don't you just try having
a little faith in me

365
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:44,349
instead of constantly telling me

366
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,268
everything I'm interested in or good at
is a waste of time.

367
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:52,828
More tea?

368
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:12,612
Whiskey and diet.

369
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:15,448
Tough day on the road crew, Mack?

370
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,715
My parents are here.

371
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:21,969
Jeez, between you and your brother,
I'm expecting the parental Cartwrights

372
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,808
to be some kind
of oozing green monsters with,

373
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:28,893
I don't know...
Your smile, maybe Rusty's hair.

374
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,842
Worse. They look perfectly normal.

375
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,435
And if you met them, you,
like everyone else, would love them.

376
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:37,700
In two hours,
I'll get to test that theory.

377
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:41,270
Right! Right,
my parents are going to Kappa Tau.

378
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:44,992
- This'll be fun.
- And... this pleases you?

379
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:50,331
Because you think
they'll disapprove of us.

380
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:54,126
But I'm not proud of wanting that.

381
00:21:54,353 --> 00:21:58,081
You know, it's so inspiring to see
such a caring sibling relationship.

382
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:00,003
Be warned.

383
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:02,551
KTs actually might surprise you.

384
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:06,889
It'll take more than bleach, furniture
polish to fool Karen Cartwright.

385
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:09,036
So, speaking of parents,

386
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,357
what do you think of senator Logan?

387
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,009
From what I've seen on tv,

388
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,532
he's a handsome man who uses
a little too much hair product.

389
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:20,531
But he's avoided the comb-over,
so he gets my vote.

390
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:22,363
You haven't met him yet.

391
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:26,053
Not going to.
Apparently, I'm not senate ready,

392
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,428
which, by the way, I totally am.

393
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:30,861
You really like her.

394
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:36,410
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it was parent serious.

395
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,169
Well, it's...
It's not.

396
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:40,412
Not exactly.

397
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:43,592
Fine. It's not.

398
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,304
You should cut her some slack,
though, when it comes to her dad.

399
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:51,416
Wait... a... minute.

400
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:54,395
Are you sticking up for Rebecca Logan?

401
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,759
You see?

402
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:58,607
Parents show up,
and everything goes nuts.

403
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:00,830
Cheers to that.

404
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:15,782
Tater tot.

405
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:19,410
Honestly.

406
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:23,495
Sweetie,

407
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,261
it's rude to have these on
when someone's trying to talk to you.

408
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:31,361
Well, I had them on, so I didn't know
you were trying to talk to me.

409
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:35,782
- What did you want?
- Well, I was wondering if you'd be...

410
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:39,520
Up for another round of uno.
Or hearts, maybe.

411
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,318
You gotta give me a chance
to win back some of my toothpicks!

412
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:44,746
I'm smelling a card game-athon!

413
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:50,430
You know, I actually just realized
I think I have to step out for a minute.

414
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:53,181
- We'll go with you.
- I'll just be a second.

415
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,871
Come on, Daley.
Just let me slip my shoes on.

416
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,658
My feet are swelling.
Your feet starting to swell, son?

5
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:02,550
No. No, they're not.

6
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:06,798
Look at the time!
It's 4:30!

7
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:09,327
- It's dinnertime!
- Is it?

8
00:24:09,546 --> 00:24:12,167
No wonder my stomach's
been growling like a tiger.

9
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:15,825
'course, you wouldn't know,
'cause you had your headphones on.

10
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:17,922
I sure did.

11
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:37,976
Becca, I was just coming
down to the lobby to see you.

12
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:39,763
Surprise.

13
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:41,136
I'm starving.

14
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:42,386
You ready to eat?

15
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:46,338
Yeah, Heather made us
reservations for 6:30 at Red Door.

16
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,549
No offense to Heather, but

17
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:52,001
I think I'd rather go somewhere else.

18
00:24:53,747 --> 00:24:55,900
I wasn't sure if you were coming.

19
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,588
We said we were having dinner together.

20
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:01,303
Yes, we did, but,
you know, after what happened earlier...

21
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:02,791
Which was in the past.

22
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,633
Now we're traveling to the future.

23
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,061
A night of family fun.

24
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,383
You're right.
I'm sorry.

25
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:12,854
Let's just look forward to having a
lovely evening with all of us together.

26
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:15,216
I know I'm looking forward to it.

27
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:18,544
I can't wait to see what
you two think of Kappa Tau.

29
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,835
- Hi.
- Hi.

30
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:36,115
Nice banner.

31
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:39,609
- Thanks. Doesn't it look good?
- Mr. And Mrs. Cartwright.

32
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:42,042
I'm Cappie,
president of Kappa Tau Gamma.

33
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:45,189
Kudos to you and all
the work that you kids do.

34
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,717
Thank you so much.

35
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,652
Well, we are very committed
to what we do here.

36
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:51,968
You could use a fresh
coat of paint out front.

37
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:55,888
Well, sir, our paint money
goes to much more urgent causes.

38
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:57,378
Let me show you around.

39
00:25:58,637 --> 00:25:59,637
Please.

40
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:09,801
Go, go get some food.
I'll see you in a second.

41
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:12,471
Hey.

42
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:16,482
I can't believe you got these
guys to put on this ridiculous show.

43
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,571
Well, I learned from the best.

44
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,032
You've been pulling
this off most of your life.

45
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,338
Now it's my turn.

46
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,123
Yep.
You're perfect.

47
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:29,168
Thanks again for helping
out this afternoon. I mean it.

48
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:31,015
Anytime, Russ.

49
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,975
Listen, there's a... another party.

50
00:26:34,274 --> 00:26:37,629
There's arealparty when all the
parents leave if you wanna come back.

51
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:39,232
Thanks again.

52
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:41,313
Anytime.

53
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:49,018
Dad, I'd like you to meet Cappie,
my boyfriend.

54
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,699
Senator Logan.

55
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:52,767
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

56
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,931
Had I known you were coming,
I would have worn socks.

57
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,069
No need for that.
I want him to meet you just as you are.

58
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:00,907
This is my friend...

59
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:02,397
Charles.

60
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,939
- A pleasure, sir.
- Nice to meet you.

61
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:06,747
Excuse me.

62
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,750
So, are you enjoying your stay, Sir?

63
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:12,958
Very much. Beautiful campus.
Beautiful weather.

64
00:27:13,113 --> 00:27:15,322
Yeah, the wea...
You ever notice that it's about

65
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,967
20 degrees warmer here
than anywhere else in the state?

66
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:19,690
We never have to wear coats.

67
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:21,849
Who said there's no
upside to global warming?

68
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,167
Who said there's such
a thing as global warming?

69
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:26,997
So, you from around here?

70
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:29,327
No, sir. No, northern California.

71
00:27:29,474 --> 00:27:31,964
- But his family moved around a lot.
- In the military.

72
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,032
Deadheads. Followed the band everywhere.

73
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,358
Well, I'd love to meet them.

74
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:38,864
They're not here.

75
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:41,788
This is freshman parents' weekend.
I'm a junior.

76
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:47,511
So, Cappie,
what is your area of study?

77
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:50,124
Cappie's declared a lot of majors.

78
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:52,970
I have a voracious
intellectual appetite.

79
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:54,424
And he's not very ambitious.

80
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,218
Would you excuse us, sir?

81
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:02,665
Why are you trying to make
me look like Kevin Federline?

82
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:04,506
Hey, Kevin Federline's
an upstanding citizen.

83
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:06,522
You know what I mean. I'm trying
to get your father

84
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,431
to like me,
and you're making me look like a...

85
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:17,002
- You don't want him.
- I don't care who he likes.

86
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,075
Yes, you do.

87
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:20,438
And you're trying
to use me to piss him off.

88
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,214
Come on.
You can take it.

89
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,308
Tell your father
it was nice to meet him.

90
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:32,866
Where are you going?

91
00:28:32,986 --> 00:28:35,136
If you wanna piss off daddy, fine.

92
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,132
Just leave me out of it.

93
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:39,603
Cappie, come on!

94
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:50,684
Well, this was so fun.

95
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,330
My first frat party.

96
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,545
Yes. I'm so glad you guys came.

97
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:56,813
You sure we can't coax
you out for some dessert?

98
00:28:56,949 --> 00:28:58,864
I can't.
I can't, all right?

99
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:00,754
Pledges have to clean up.

100
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,838
We just hate waking up to a mess.

101
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,754
Recycling.

102
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:17,956
Well, of course!

103
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,920
Well, I guess it's just us then.

104
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,366
I guess so.

105
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,189
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

106
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,083
- It was wonderful.
- So proud of you.

107
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,397
Bye, dad.

108
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:31,573
Bye, Casey.

109
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:33,044
- Rusty.
- See ya.

110
00:29:46,762 --> 00:29:47,698
Yes.

111
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,522
Did you know that Ben
Bennett is a kidney donor?

112
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:55,196
I hadn't heard that.

113
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,338
I didn't hear it from ben himself.

114
00:29:57,805 --> 00:30:00,345
One of the brothers told me about it,
and I think it's great.

115
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:02,285
It is so amazing.

116
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:04,632
What an impressive
collection of young men.

117
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,259
I mean, wholesome and helpful, and,

118
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:09,565
you know, committed to social welfare.

119
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:14,245
It would be Rusty who goes off
to college to find a group like this.

120
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,668
Hey, you know, the Kappa Tau
could come and give a kind of...

121
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,413
A how-to philanthropy
seminar to your sorority.

122
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,482
Whoa... sweetheart!

123
00:30:27,908 --> 00:30:29,313
Where are you going?

124
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:32,845
I forgot something at Kappa Tau.

125
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,320
Wow, where did everybody go?

126
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:44,056
- Case, what'd you forget?
- I left it in the basement.

127
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:46,194
Since when were you in the basement?

128
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:56,480
- What's going on here?
- Who are these people?

129
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,820
Katrina victims.

130
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:02,063
Where's Rusty?

131
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:03,185
I don't know.

132
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,477
Hey, Rusty?

133
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:13,292
Mom, dad...

134
00:31:16,353 --> 00:31:17,589
I don't drink.

135
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,063
He totally deserved it, right?

136
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:28,369
I mean, putting on the whole mr. Little
perfect act at everyone else's expense.

137
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:31,925
I just can't believe anyone would
buy the kts as a service fraternity.

138
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:34,258
How did they explain the vomit smell?

139
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,077
If it was associated with my brother,

140
00:31:36,197 --> 00:31:38,517
my parents probably thought
it smelled like Roses.

141
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,961
You're like scary mad.

142
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:47,117
Yeah, I am.

143
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:56,834
Why would you ambush me like that?

144
00:31:56,954 --> 00:31:58,517
You're 18 years old, Rusty.

145
00:31:58,637 --> 00:32:00,963
It's time for you to stand
up to mom and dad and fight.

146
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,069
For what?

147
00:32:02,193 --> 00:32:03,559
My right to party?

148
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,043
- You knew they weren't gonna understand.
- You wanted to join a fraternity.

149
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:08,522
Why not just say it?

150
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:12,050
Because I'm not like you.
I care what mom and dad think of me.

151
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:13,617
News flash... so do I.

152
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:17,478
And I am so tired of them thinking
you're perfect and I'm ridiculous.

153
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:21,302
Yeah, well, you try being Casey
Cartwright's dorky little brother.

154
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,600
"Your sister's so pretty."

155
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:25,343
"Your sister's so cool."

156
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,094
"Your sister has friends."

157
00:32:27,964 --> 00:32:29,554
You were like perfect.

158
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:32,832
To everyone except mom and dad.

159
00:32:34,016 --> 00:32:35,647
They're making me quit Kappa Tau.

160
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:36,470
What?

161
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:39,186
Personally, I'd rather
they thought I was ridiculous.

162
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:50,343
Cheesoritos.

163
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:52,103
That's a cry for help.

164
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:55,673
What's wrong?

165
00:32:56,294 --> 00:32:58,068
I think it's over with Cappie.

166
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,521
Sorry.

167
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,114
So did you cheat?

168
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:09,445
Lie?

169
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,850
Well, you haven't been together
long enough for the slow,

170
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:16,380
relentless dimming of passion.

171
00:33:16,446 --> 00:33:17,645
I humiliated him.

172
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,157
Why?

173
00:33:20,586 --> 00:33:21,877
'cause I'm an idiot.

174
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,881
You've been much nicer
since you've been dating him.

175
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:27,904
Can you fix it?

176
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,682
I don't know how.

177
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,417
It's not brain surgery.

178
00:33:31,537 --> 00:33:33,818
Just give him the same
thing that we'd want.

179
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,096
Thoughtful gifts.

180
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:36,667
Or extravagant ones.

181
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:38,319
Guilty party's choice.

182
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,608
Then total acceptance of responsibility,
even if it's not your fault.

183
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:44,018
Although,
in this case, it sounds like it is.

184
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:47,910
And then follow up with
a full groveling apology.

185
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,223
- What are you waiting for?
- Just... just back off, okay?

186
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:13,348
What's wrong with you?

187
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,338
They're driving me nuts.

188
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,864
- Your parents?
- Yeah. They won't leave me alone.

189
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,704
I finally put on
<i>The passion of the Christ</i>

190
00:34:20,749 --> 00:34:23,418
and said I was going to the bathroom.
That was like an hour ago.

191
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:26,280
So you need time to yourself.
There's nothing wrong with that.

192
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,862
Yeah, but that's never happened.

193
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,334
I used to never want
to get away from my parents.

194
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,296
I cherished every
moment we had together.

195
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:35,945
So now you're finding that
that old cherished relationship,

196
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:39,136
it's... a little restrictive.

197
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,757
College has corrupted me.

198
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:43,286
I'm not the boy they sent away.

199
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,373
That's right.

200
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:45,874
You don't have to be.

201
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:47,890
That's why we came here, right?

202
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,398
To find out who we are.

203
00:34:51,682 --> 00:34:53,646
To become our own men.

204
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:57,813
And they have no right
to make us feel ashamed of that.

205
00:34:58,037 --> 00:34:59,145
Wait. Be quiet.

206
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,482
The flaying stopped?

207
00:35:03,824 --> 00:35:04,824
No. Never mind.

208
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:08,421
- I don't know, Rusty.
- Okay, look.

209
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,367
It's time we stop being
scared of losing their approval.

210
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:13,525
What, we're not doing anything wrong.

211
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:16,507
Growing up is not a punishable offense.

212
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:18,707
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

213
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:21,415
There are you, monkey-buns.

214
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:24,173
Where'd you go? We were starting to
get worried about you.

215
00:35:24,229 --> 00:35:26,419
Well, mom, actually, i...

216
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:31,531
I just didn't want to interrupt
during the resurrection.

217
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,470
Brought you breakfast.

218
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:47,916
Your favorite.

219
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,579
Greasy egg sandwich and

220
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:55,428
44 ounces of sugar and caffeine.

221
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:59,338
Dad with a pretty girl.

222
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,245
Zeta Beta without the scandal.

223
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:05,030
Yeah.
Win-win for all concerned.

224
00:36:06,795 --> 00:36:08,667
There's no mention
of the senator's daughter's

225
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:10,569
poor taste in boyfriends, though.

226
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:15,362
I know I said I'm not that girl anymore,
but sometimes he just gets to me.

227
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:17,951
I can't help myself
from trying to piss him off.

228
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,899
That's your apology?

229
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:22,849
It's my excuse.

230
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,146
I'm getting to the apology.

231
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:29,385
My father is having an affair.

232
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:34,093
Again.

233
00:36:35,391 --> 00:36:38,405
This time it's with that
stupid bubble-headed aide.

234
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,441
I saw her coming out
of his hotel room in a robe.

235
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:43,940
Okay, well...

236
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,004
If there was an acceptable excuse,

237
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:51,226
which there isn't, that would, you know,
be up there.

238
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:54,218
I'm so sorry I used you last night.

239
00:36:54,736 --> 00:36:57,171
That's the last thing
I would ever want you to feel.

240
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:00,100
I don't wanna push you away...

241
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:01,585
Because...

242
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:04,610
I think that I...

243
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:06,865
You know...

244
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:08,342
Maybe...

245
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:10,268
Very possibly...

246
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,216
Care about you.

247
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:14,676
"Maybe"?

248
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:16,810
"Very possibly"?

249
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:23,040
- You are smothering me.
- Hey, it's huge for me.

250
00:37:31,698 --> 00:37:33,814
Excuse and apology accepted.

251
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:42,458
We're doing what we
think is best for him.

252
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,712
But it's not.

253
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:46,858
Look, there's more to
college than just school.

254
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,089
I know you guys think that
fraternities and sororities

255
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:51,245
are some kind of gateway
drug to a pointless life.

256
00:37:51,387 --> 00:37:52,458
But they're not.

257
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:54,129
Look, Rusty's great.

258
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:57,829
He's not going to
end up like planless, unfocused Casey.

259
00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:00,284
Don't worry.
He's not gonna be like me.

260
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,249
I can't think of anyone
else I'd rather be like.

261
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:04,663
Rusty, I'm trying to help you.

262
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,083
I'm trying to help them understand
that being like you

263
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:08,659
is something to aspire to.

264
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:11,961
If I were like you,
I'd have amazing people skills.

265
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:14,621
I'd be able to solve
problems creatively.

266
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:17,478
If I got to be president
of my fraternity,

267
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:21,353
I'd basically be learning how
to be a CEO of a small corporation.

268
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:24,976
Yeah, all in all,
I'd be pretty incredible.

269
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:29,461
And I would expect my
parents to be proud of me.

270
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:34,205
And I would stand up
for what I want no matter what.

271
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,386
Which means for right now,
I will be remaing in Kappa Tau

272
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:40,324
while maintaing the high
academic standards that happen

273
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:42,629
to be just as important
to me as they are to you.

274
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:47,078
And if I have to find a
way to pay for it myself, I will.

275
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:52,902
And I wanna see a menu.

276
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:54,355
I wanna see it now.

277
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,880
The dean is expecting us.

278
00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:13,693
I'm sorry. I know how you
hate to keep people waiting.

279
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:16,258
I'm particularly sorry
because I'm not going with you.

280
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,171
I'm afraid I have other plans.

281
00:39:23,003 --> 00:39:24,649
Maybe Heather can go.

282
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:26,788
Young lady.
Young lady!

283
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:29,102
This is an important function.
I expect you.

284
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:30,057
Senator.

285
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:34,336
Bye, daddy.
Have fun.

286
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:46,664
We've decided to let
Rusty stay in the fraternity.

287
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:48,223
Your father's telling him now.

288
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:51,666
You know, halfway
through your brother's

289
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,856
soliloquy at breakfast,

290
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:55,645
it became very apparent that your

291
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:57,891
stubbornness and independence
had rubbed off on him.

292
00:39:58,076 --> 00:40:00,566
Which aren't my worst characteristics.

293
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,105
They're two of your best.

294
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,055
And you got 'em from me.

295
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:05,959
Have you seen my mother?

296
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,954
I mean, you have the
same "mom" hair, but.

297
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,373
And a tendency toward sarcasm?

298
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:12,950
Not either of our best characteristics.

299
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:17,323
Casey, we're very different people.

300
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:20,516
And I don't know if I'll ever
understand your approach to life.

301
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:22,483
- But that doesn't mean...
- Let me finish.

302
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,310
But that doesn't mean
that it doesn't have value.

303
00:40:25,662 --> 00:40:28,429
And that it's not gonna lead
to some magnificent

304
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,211
and purposeful place.

305
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:33,254
Thank you.

306
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:35,002
Now you know, I can't promise

307
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:37,698
that I'm still not gonna
nag about GREs and ISATs.

308
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:38,956
That's all right.

309
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,524
I guess...
I could use a slightly more

310
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:45,456
defined plan of action.

311
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,934
Slightly more defined.

312
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:48,606
- Casey...
- Mom, mom!

313
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:51,254
You're about to ruin
a really nice moment here.

314
00:40:53,136 --> 00:40:56,354
<i>Flight 217 non-stop
to Chicago is now boarding.</i>

315
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,505
Okeydokey.

316
00:40:57,737 --> 00:40:59,234
Our flight is boarding.

317
00:40:59,987 --> 00:41:00,983
All right.

318
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:02,607
- Off we go.
- Bye, mom.

319
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,193
- Love you, honey.
- Love you too.

320
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:06,374
Thanks for coming.
Thank you.

321
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:10,570
- All right.
- All right.

322
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,657
Come on, Russell.

323
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:13,464
- Bye, dad.
- Good-bye, sweetheart.

324
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:15,585
See you soon.

325
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:19,984
You and mom looked pretty chummy.

326
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:22,620
Well, after your
throw-down this morning,

327
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:25,147
I kinda sorta became their new favorite.
Sorry.

328
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:29,210
And I'm really,
really sorry for the ambushing.

329
00:41:29,497 --> 00:41:31,325
No, I'm actually relieved they know.

330
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:32,377
But...

331
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:35,545
I could have done without
them seeing me in drag.

332
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,060
Yeah.

333
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:39,549
I guess this was a pretty good trip.

334
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:42,196
Yeah. I'm kinda sorry to see 'em go.

335
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:46,352
<i>Attention passengers on
