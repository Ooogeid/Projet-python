1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:01,755
<i>Previously on</i> Greek<i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:04,049
You never mentioned
that you knew a Kappa Tau.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,885
Heath? We met during rush.
It's no big deal.

4
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:10,430
It's the one chance we have to follow
our impulses and get away with it.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,350
- So... what now?
- All I know is I'm in college,

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,061
- and I had fun with you.
- But what about Michael?

7
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,105
Cappie and I kissed
very briefly,

8
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:22,233
- which we have since left behind.
- Frannie called to warn me

9
00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:25,820
- about Rebecca's Greek Week behavior{\in the first place}.
- Frannie was your eyes and ears?

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,593
The {\only}vote I care about
is for president,

11
00:00:27,732 --> 00:00:31,024
and I'm happy to have you challenge me
for that because I cannot wait

12
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:33,370
to kick your ass.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,340
Yeah. You're ahead.

14
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:47,258
I count two more pink than white.

15
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:50,679
Which means our preliminary polls put
me two measly votes ahead of Frannie.

16
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,556
I can't believe there's even a chance
she could be ZBZ president again.

17
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:55,951
I know, right?
It's like nobody remembers

18
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,291
that she was removed
from office last semester.

19
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:01,398
That was just last semester?
It feels like forever ago.

20
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:05,777
That was Jessica S.
She's going with Frannie.

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,879
Of course she is. She still
thinks I stole her toothbrush.

22
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:12,575
As if there's no {\possible way}Colgate makes
more than one of the same stupid color.

23
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:15,036
Forget about Jessica S...
and Jessica P.

24
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:18,117
We have Jessica M.
and Jessica R. still undecided.

25
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:19,936
Half the house
is still undecided.

26
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,836
And she's a senior,
AKA one of Frannie's pledge sisters.

27
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:24,504
You have most of the juniors.

28
00:01:25,193 --> 00:01:27,966
- How many sophomores do we have?
- Seven firm, eight maybe.

29
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:30,635
Then there's the pledges.
Who will probably

30
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,628
follow whoever
Rebecca chooses to back.

31
00:01:32,748 --> 00:01:35,265
Our very own
super dele... pledge.

32
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:37,969
Which is why I want her
to nominate me at tonight's meeting.

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,067
- You think she'll do it?
- She owes me one.

34
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:42,814
But who knows? Rebecca is
one tough nut to crack.

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,234
Yeah, she's like one of those
pistachios with no opening.

36
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:48,611
- I hate those.
- So do I.

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,438
I just have to break her
before Frannie does.

38
00:01:56,798 --> 00:01:58,913
Speak of the nutcracker.

39
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:01,291
Frannie's calling me, too.

40
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,001
And me.

41
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:06,037
<i>It's up to each of you</i>

42
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:08,298
<i>to decide the fate of ZBZ
on election night.</i>

43
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:10,547
<i>Who would you rather have
leading the house,</i>

44
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,169
<i>a sister with a proven
track record like myself,</i>

45
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:15,930
<i>or a sister with Lizzi
on speed dial?</i>

46
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,378
<i>Vote Frannie
for ZBZ president!</i>

47
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,438
Uh, did Robo-Frannie seriously
just drop a Lizzi bomb?

48
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:38,328
What's the problem, little buddy?

49
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:41,234
Is is a rainy day or Monday?
Those always get me down.

50
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:43,040
I'm fine.

51
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,873
I need to get back to this boss.
For some reason I can't beat him.

52
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:49,335
It's just... I was reading
through my journal last night...

53
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,251
- You mean your diary?
- No. Journal.

54
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:55,053
And I realized
this year's almost over

55
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:57,334
- and I only dated one girl.
- And you see no obvious

56
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:59,801
connection between this fact
and the diary?

57
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:01,172
- Journal.
- Right.

58
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,630
Well, you dated that... Jacqueline.

59
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:04,997
Jen K.

60
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:07,565
Right.
What about Crabs Girl?

61
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,356
Hardly dated.

62
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:11,290
You went to the ZBZ formal
last week.

63
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,310
Yeah, with my sister's
best friend, as "friends."

64
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:15,657
I just...

65
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:18,660
I want to find someone
to get excited about, you know?

66
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,119
You sure it's not a diary?

67
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:23,248
You're not doing much better.
You only dated Rebecca this year.

68
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,503
Buck up, Bridget Jones.

69
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,762
We just need to get back out there,
cast a wider net.

70
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,168
A date dash
for the Tri-Pis, perhaps?

71
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:36,761
Get those girls in your house,
it's not a question of if,

72
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:38,721
- but when.
- I got a better idea.

73
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,765
Meet me at 4:00 at Dobler's.

74
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:43,224
Intriguing and done.
Oh, wait, Rus, hey.

75
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,062
By the way...

76
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,038
Sorry about all the diary crap.

77
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:49,581
You know, strictly between us,

78
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:52,026
I've got one, too.

79
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:55,071
- Really?
- God, no. I'll see you at 4:00.

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,425
Greek 2x08
<i>The popular vote</i>

81
00:03:57,663 --> 00:03:59,450
Synchro : 7844, Benj!

82
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,468
seriessub.com
sub-way.fr

83
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,749
She's about to sing <i>Anything Goes</i>.
You're gonna miss it.

84
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:08,805
I don't think "miss" is the word
I would use

85
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:11,963
when An Evening With Patti LuPone
is involved.

86
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,924
I believe you owe me. I did watch
the Ducks game with you last week.

87
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:17,677
When you agreed to it you thought
I meant <i>The Mighty Ducks</i> movie.

88
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,470
I'm an Estevez completist.

89
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,776
And technically, it is still sports.

90
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,641
I just want to read my book, OK?

91
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:28,965
What's going on?

92
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,733
Nothing.
I just have a lot of studying to do.

93
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,735
So, you know, I...

94
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,280
I think I'm gonna go.

95
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:42,471
Cal, we can watch something else.
It's not a big deal.

96
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:44,189
It's OK.
I, um...

97
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,381
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,728
Hey, Little Sis, off to class?

99
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,993
No, skydiving, actually.
This is my parachute.

100
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:02,587
That's so funny.

101
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:06,241
Anyway, I was wondering, can I count
on your support for ZBZ president?

102
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:09,851
Casey, I'm sure you realize
the success of the democratic process

103
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,023
relies on the guarantee
of privacy with one's vote.

104
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:14,914
Of course. I also know that
the only reason you have a vote

105
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:17,278
is due to me standing up
to Tegan on your behalf.

106
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:19,489
Which I will definitely
keep in mind on election day.

107
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm just curious,

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,178
is there anything else we can put
in your mind to help with your decision?

109
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:26,676
I'll think about it
while I'm at lunch with Frannie.

110
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:28,361
You know, if I'm elected,

111
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,571
Ashleigh and I were planning
on moving into the...

112
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,961
presidential suite and you had
your eye on our room.

113
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:36,255
- I do like your room.
- It's a double. I can't promise.

114
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:38,365
It's a double because of
that other bed in there.

115
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:40,218
If that bed were to disappear,
though...

116
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:43,388
Tell you what, I'll start looking into
a way to tweak the floor plans

117
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,376
after you nominate me
at tonight's meeting.

118
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:47,626
Hey, Rebecca, just FYI,

119
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,769
our mani-pedi rezies
are at 12:30.

120
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:52,238
They were totally booked,
but I pulled some strings.

121
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:53,798
I'm so sorry, Frannie,

122
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,635
but I just realized
that my nails look awesome.

123
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:58,214
Thanks, though.

124
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:00,551
How strange,

125
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:02,530
turning you down
at the last minute like that.

126
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,242
It's far from the last minute.

127
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,540
Speed dating at Dobler's?

128
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,916
This is your better idea?

129
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:14,893
The fliers are all over campus.
You meet 20 girls in an hour.

130
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,681
If you hit if off with one,
you get to go out on a real date.

131
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:20,863
I've heard of this before.
I believe we call them parties.

132
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,253
No, this is different.

133
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:24,050
This is a group
of college students

134
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,864
who are all looking
for the same thing.

135
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,842
- A life?
- A relationship.

136
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:29,202
Something real.

137
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,321
Something like I had with Jen K.

138
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,173
This whole thing reeks of desperation
if you ask me. No offense.

139
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,508
Non taken. But you should know
this event's sponsored

140
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:38,773
- by the women's volleyball team.
- The volleyball team?

141
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:40,653
Tall blondes with stamina?
Hello.

142
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,406
Sign in here, please,
and that will be $10 each.

143
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:45,654
Sorry. I've got a policy.

144
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:48,500
It's more of a code, really. I don't pay
for things that I can get for free.

145
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,441
Water, valet parking,

146
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,070
Internet porn...

147
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:54,583
I can meet any of these girls
on campus at any time.

148
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,211
That's great, Fonzie,
but they charge us to rent the space.

149
00:06:57,787 --> 00:06:59,929
OK, you know what,
I'll pay for both of us.

150
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:02,050
Thanks, buddy. You know
I can't break that code.

151
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,286
You get 2 minutes with each girl,
so make it count.

152
00:07:04,406 --> 00:07:06,012
Check off the girls you liked

153
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,431
and if there's mutual interest,
at the end of the session

154
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:11,100
we exchange numbers for you.
Pretty simple, right?

155
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:13,822
Will you be participating?

156
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,615
'Cause I would love

157
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,258
to check you off.

158
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:24,947
So, what's your major?

159
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:27,274
So, what's your favorite position?

160
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:28,951
I'm a polymer science major.

161
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:30,894
I meant on the volleyball team.

162
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,792
Where's your mind,
you dirty girl!

163
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,342
What's polymer science?

164
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:36,863
It's actually pretty fascinating.
How much time do we have let?

165
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,269
No, you keep talking.

166
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,464
I want to know all about you.

167
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:42,629
I'm in a frat,

168
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,334
but we prefer "fraternity," actually.
Would you call your country a...

169
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:47,623
Come on, of course
I'm voting for you!

170
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:49,640
In fact, let's just cut out
the middleman here,

171
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,119
pretend we're human beings,
capable of making a love connection

172
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:53,976
and I'll see if I ask you
for your number.

173
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:56,105
We should vote for each other,
you know.

174
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:59,056
How can you really get to know
somebody in two minutes?

175
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:01,565
You'll see.
I'm really kind of adorable.

176
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:08,167
Casey must have offered up
something huge for Rebecca

177
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,771
to blow me off like that.

178
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,668
So, you counter with a better offer.

179
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:15,123
And what exactly do you offer

180
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:16,494
a sorority sister

181
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:18,776
who has access to her own G-5?

182
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:21,030
Certainly not chocolates.

183
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:23,714
And honestly,
I'm sick of kissing her ass.

184
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:25,591
Just try another approach.

185
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:28,158
You know, whenever my father
deals with recalcitrant

186
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,657
board members,
sometimes bad news

187
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,349
is just as effective
as good news to shake things up.

188
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:36,934
So, if telling her something
she does want to hear isn't working,

189
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,713
just tell her something
she doesn't want to hear.

190
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:46,215
- How many numbers did you get?
- Looks like ten.

191
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:47,766
Ten? Really?

192
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:49,916
- How many boxes did you check?
- All of them.

193
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,440
- All 20?
- I took her advice. I voted liberally.

194
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,149
Casey Cartwright for president.

195
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,895
Oh, out on the campaign trail?

196
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,508
And on our way to lunch.

197
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,835
So, what's your stance
on the war in Iraq and your plan

198
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,931
to correct the collapsing
housing market?

199
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,140
Nice shirt.

200
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,731
Hey, have you been to Jamaica?

201
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:08,718
No. Why?

202
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:12,054
I don't know. I thought
that your... I'd think that...

203
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:13,681
Uh, never mind.

204
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:18,019
We just went speed dating
and I got two numbers.

205
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:20,296
You guys were speed dating.

206
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,566
I don't really need to go speed dating.
I just went for moral support.

207
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,860
Cap went ten for 20.
I went two for four.

208
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:28,029
So, that's 50 percent each.

209
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:29,614
So, it seems that you guys both

210
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:33,013
had the same level of success,
statistically speaking.

211
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,286
I know. Isn't that cool?

212
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:37,636
Well, no, I don't
speak statistically.

213
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:40,208
I got eight more potential dates,
so how is that the same?

214
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:41,908
Hey, you know what?

215
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:45,213
Just good luck
with your dates.

216
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:48,867
- And try not to bak the speed limit.
- Thanks, Case.

217
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,916
Good luck with your election.

218
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,249
Try not to...

219
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,223
Lose.

220
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:57,065
Do you have any more buttons?
I'll pass them around.

221
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:01,270
And, uh, try to keep the odds up.

222
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,283
It's good seeing you.

223
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:07,024
What a douche.

224
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:11,447
What happens tonight and
at Thursday night's elections

225
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,408
will shape the next year
of our lives here at ZBZ.

226
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:17,328
It's more than just
a popularity contest

227
00:10:17,488 --> 00:10:19,956
or who loaned you
their Gucci bag last week.

228
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:22,333
It should also be noted

229
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:24,293
that campaigning is forbidden

230
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,213
- during the nomination meeting.
- Duly noted. Thank you, Frannie.

231
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,798
Oh, and thanks...

232
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,962
so much for that personal
phone message this morning.

233
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:34,679
It made each of us
feel so special.

234
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:39,058
So, let's begin
our first round of nominations.

235
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:40,309
ZBZ president?

236
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,522
- Would you make the first nomination?
- With pleasure.

237
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:46,208
I'd like to nominate...

238
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,067
Frannie Morgan.

239
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:49,902
Oh, thank you so much for that.

240
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,029
Rebecca has nominated me.

241
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:54,326
Any other nominations?

242
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:57,509
Actually, I said Frannie.

243
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,870
Yeah, I think she said me.

244
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,168
Rebecca has nominated Frannie.

245
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,164
Brenda, you had your hand raised.

246
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,468
Uh, actually, I was also
gonna nominate Frannie.

247
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:20,006
Would anyone else like
to make a nomination?

248
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:22,013
Anyone?

249
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,175
Casey Cartwright.

250
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,485
Anyone else?

251
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,482
All right, then.
No, no? OK.

252
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:36,956
Let's move on to social chair.

253
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:44,153
- I thought we had a deal.
- We did.

254
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:46,394
I found out about you and Cappie
at Myrtle Beach.

255
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:49,587
- What about me and Cappie at Myrtle{\Beach}?
- You two hooking up.

256
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,881
What do you mean
by hooking up?

257
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,525
Stop playing dumber
than usual.

258
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,551
- You two had sex. I know.
- Wait.

259
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:57,513
That is so not true.

260
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,638
Who told you that?
Was it Frannie?

261
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:01,140
It's all over the house!

262
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,166
OK, come on, Rebecca,
this just comes out

263
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:04,602
the day before the election?

264
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,447
- I've been swiftboated.
- I saw you two on the beach,

265
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,023
building sandcastles together.

266
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,275
Yeah. As friends.

267
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:14,862
So, you're saying you didn't hook up
with Cappie over Spring Break?

268
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,908
I did not have sex
with that man.

269
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,266
What's up, Cappie?

270
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,886
- How'd your date go last night?
- She had eight piercings...

271
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,512
below the neck.

272
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,473
You counted them?
I mean, where were they?

273
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:45,370
I'm partly grossed out,

274
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:47,678
but just curious enough
to require a visual.

275
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,980
I didn't see any.
She just told me about them.

276
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:51,690
She also said she hates dogs,

277
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,736
she hopes to marry rich one day,

278
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:56,016
then she said something else
I won't even repeat because

279
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:57,571
I think it's kind of fascist.

280
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,532
- Next.
- Yeah, it was doomed

281
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:00,884
from the start.

282
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:02,326
There weren't any sparks,

283
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:05,238
- not like there were with Jen K.
- You're still into that girl?

284
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,665
She's the bar.

285
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,801
Everything about her
was perfect.

286
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,459
Except that whole article thing.

287
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:13,176
- How'd your date go?
- Well...

288
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,590
- Which one?
- You had more than one?

289
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:18,801
Is there some rule I'm not aware of

290
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,227
limiting the number of dates
allowed in a single evening?

291
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,687
I had a coffee date,

292
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,132
a dinner date,

293
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:27,810
a drinks date, and then a booty
call date with the coffee date.

294
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,090
You went out with
three girls last night?

295
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,545
They didn't all sleep over.

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,418
I do have boundaries.

297
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:37,971
And a realistic sense of my own
libido after two pitchers.

298
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,729
I guess I'm just looking
for something more

299
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,991
than meaningless sex.

300
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:47,319
Why do you assume it was meaningless?
It always means something to me.

301
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:48,754
OK. OK, fine.

302
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:51,632
But I'm looking for something...

303
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,170
more.

304
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,731
College is all about hook-ups

305
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,923
and having tons
of meaningful sex.

306
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:01,187
You can settle down when you're 40,
drive a Porsche, and have

307
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:03,804
hair in the most unseemly places
but for now,

308
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:05,453
carpe diem, Spitter.

309
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,476
Carpe the women's volleyball team.

310
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,837
- What's the score?
- Seven-six.

311
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,326
- You.
- Easy there, tiger.

312
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,925
That's like the third time you tried
to throw this basketball through me.

313
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,333
Sorry.

314
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,035
Did I do something to piss you off?

315
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:41,759
You know, when Frannie
was out of town,

316
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,552
I cheated on Michael
because of you.

317
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,890
Have your parents ever talked
to you about peer pressure?

318
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:50,427
You made it seem
like everybody cheats.

319
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:52,520
That it's OK
as long as nobody finds out.

320
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,522
So you're mad at me
because you cheated?

321
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,878
I'm just pissed
because I did it.

322
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,319
And because
I'm keeping it from Michael.

323
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:10,287
And because he and I are
so different, you know.

324
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:11,627
And because...

325
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,161
I don't know what I want.

326
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,710
Listen,
maybe you should just tell him.

327
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,046
Look, I mean,
I speak from experience that

328
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:21,090
when the other person finds out,

329
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:23,968
deciding what you want
becomes a non-issue.

330
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:28,597
But either way
the ball's in your court.

331
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:41,364
What flavor's that,

332
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:43,737
Lemon Liar
or Mint Chocolate Bitch?

333
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,907
I's raspberry sorbet, actually.

334
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,117
Want a bite?

335
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,594
I know it was you who started
the rumor about Cappie and me.

336
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:52,871
Not cool, Frannie.
You're messing with people's lives

337
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:54,665
and real emotions here.

338
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:57,001
- Rebecca is really hurt.
- Oh, look at you.

339
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,671
Suddenly so worried
about poor, fragile Rebecca.

340
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:04,675
You lied, which doesn't surprise me
but it still annoys me.

341
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,659
Politics is perception, poodle.

342
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:10,890
And the truth is irrelevant.

343
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,536
What the majority believes,
that's what matters.

344
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:17,265
Oh, am I interrupting?

345
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:19,023
Not at all.

346
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:21,313
I was just leaving.

347
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,568
OK, the house is alive
with the sound of gossip.

348
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,898
Please tell me you're not
carrying Cappie's love child.

349
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:30,712
I thought you two just kissed.

350
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:34,121
We did just kiss.
One tiny,

351
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,121
miniscule little kiss!

352
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:38,417
Frannie made up
the sex rumor, knowing

353
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:41,674
Rebecca would hate me for it
and get the pledges to hate me, too.

354
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:44,173
Did you tell Rebecca the truth,
that it was just a kiss?

355
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,442
I can't!

356
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:47,621
The damage is done.

357
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,876
By the time Rebecca cools down
to understand what really happened,

358
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:53,390
the elections will be over.

359
00:16:54,316 --> 00:16:55,687
So, what do we do?

360
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:03,734
Find some dirt
on Frannie, add water

361
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,694
and sling mud right back.

362
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,370
I cheated on you.

363
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,958
No, Mom, that was nothing.

364
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,407
I'm gonna call you back, OK?

365
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,049
I'm... I'm sorry.

366
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:32,895
So, you hooked up
with someone else?

367
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:37,848
You remember Heath
from the bar?

368
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:40,646
We used to sort of... date.

369
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,575
- Is it still going on?
- No.

370
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:49,340
Well, I guess we never talked
specifically about exclusivity

371
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,572
in our relationship.

372
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,702
You're taking this a little
better than I imagined.

373
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:57,913
Why? Do you want to break up?

374
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:01,750
I mean, don't you?

375
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:04,850
I've had a lot worse
happen to me in relationships.

376
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,833
But listen, we don't have to figure
this out right here, right now.

377
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,175
I have to call my mom back.

378
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:12,724
Let's just take some time
and think

379
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,406
and we'll talk more
tomorrow night at my place.

380
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:18,382
Yeah, sure. OK.

381
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:25,149
- <i>L.C. to Audrina, come in.</i>
- Next time I get to be L.C.

382
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,026
Fine, Audrina. Do we have a visual
on Fran... I mean, Heidi?

383
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:31,405
Heidi's in the common room
painting her nails with Brandi.

384
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,161
<i>Who we didn't give a code name to.
How about Whitney?</i>

385
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,909
Forget the code names.
I'm going in.

386
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,177
<i>Are you in?
Have you found anything yet?</i>

387
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:41,555
Checking the closet.

388
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,508
She has more shoes
th an Sarah Jessica Parker.

389
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:49,963
Hello. What do we have here?

390
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,664
- Are you shoe shopping?
- I found a box of protein bars

391
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:56,263
that went missing last week.
The sorority paid for them!

392
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:57,973
- Jackpot!
- <i>Not enough.</i>

393
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,977
Even you and I have
five boxes of Pop-Tarts

394
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,227
stashed in our room.
At least Frannie's being healthy.

395
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:05,147
Have you seen the sugar count
on those bars? Not so healthy.

396
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,402
They're removing
the cotton balls.

397
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:12,196
{\I repeat: }They're removing
the cotton balls!

398
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:14,772
We need something else,
something more.

399
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,405
<i>I wish I was up there with you.
This is like watching paint dry.</i>

400
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,090
<i>In fact, it is watching paint dry.</i>

401
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,389
Hurry up.
I'm getting nervous

402
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:29,471
and when I get nervous
I have to pee.

403
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,673
And I refuse to pull a Betsy
and go in the bushes!

404
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:34,362
I just need one more minute.

405
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:40,724
You don't have one{\more minute}.
They only did one coat!

406
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,562
Casey! I mean, L.C. or whatever!

407
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:48,444
They're coming up the stairs.
Abort mission, abort mission!

408
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,375
That was my first time
speed dating, too.

409
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,630
I was pretty nervous about it.

410
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:11,937
All my friends are so outgoing,
they do all the talking

411
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,924
and I have a hard time
meeting guys.

412
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:17,302
I can be a little shy
at first.

413
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:18,959
You know, shy is good.

414
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:20,480
I mean, I like shy.

415
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,058
I mean, I'm not really a body shot,

416
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,394
dancing on the bar,
wet t-shirt kind of girl.

417
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:27,184
Body shots are overrated.

418
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,313
I mean, they're unsanitary.

419
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:30,977
Really.

420
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:33,137
Can I take your order?

421
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:34,860
Jen?

422
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:42,828
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:47,833
I got it.

424
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:56,046
So, do you do this all the time
or just when you see me?

425
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,843
- Just you.
- Maybe you can aim

426
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:00,888
for somewhere less embarrassing
next time, like my shoes.

427
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:02,666
I'll try, I promise.

428
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:09,021
Oh, geez, you're on a date.

429
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:11,042
First date.

430
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,068
- Is it going well?
- It was.

431
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:16,430
I'm so sorry.

432
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:23,493
So, what about you?
You still seeing that guy?

433
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:27,441
Who? Oh, no,
we broke up a while ago.

434
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,333
I mean,
I broke up with him.

435
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:32,087
That's too bad.

436
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,833
Yeah. Whatever.

437
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,365
Well, I should get back.

438
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:43,231
Well...

439
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,349
I'll see you around sometime.

440
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:48,560
Probably in a few minutes
when I come take your order.

441
00:21:52,622 --> 00:21:53,683
Great.

442
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,652
See you then.

443
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:06,130
Sorry about that.

444
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:10,707
Here you go.

445
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,960
Do you guys know each other?

446
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:16,215
We...

447
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:19,883
- We used to date.
- Yeah, but he broke up with me.

448
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:23,011
I mean, what I'm trying to say
is, that he's a great guy.

449
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:25,829
You're in good hands.

450
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:36,281
Where do the lies end?
How well do you know Frannie Morgan?

451
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:39,285
Who is Frannie Morgan?
You have a right to know the truth.

452
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,447
She was never captain of
the cheerleading squad. She was in band.

453
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,686
First chair clarinet.

454
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:47,730
- I played the violin.
- I played Maria in <i>West Side Story</i>.

455
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:51,040
Yes, which is fine.

456
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:52,791
And pretty cool in retrospect.

457
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,294
But it's not that she was in band.
It's she lied to all of us about it.

458
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:59,589
Oh, and remember how she said
she was Miss Teen Indiana?

459
00:23:00,768 --> 00:23:02,017
Miss Turnip.

460
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,069
Runner up.

461
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:08,729
Where do the lies end?
How well do you know Frannie Morgan?

462
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:15,147
Trying to win some more girls
by offering up your old room?

463
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:16,440
Not exactly.

464
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,330
- Where did you get this?
- Running for office can dig up

465
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,614
dirty secrets.
And politics is perception.

466
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:26,646
Right, poodle?

467
00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:31,200
Want a bite?

468
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,135
I ran into Jen K. last night
at the Espresso Farm.

469
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:46,594
Really?

470
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:51,099
Was she undercover, writing
an expose on expensive cafes?

471
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:53,226
No, but she did ruin my date.

472
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:55,768
- And that's good?
- Yeah.

473
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:58,523
It made me realize the girl
I was with wasn't right for me.

474
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:00,621
There weren't any sparks

475
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,611
so I just have to keep looking.

476
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:04,279
For someone like Jen K?

477
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:07,755
For someone that makes me feel
all tingly inside like she does.

478
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:09,242
Did.

479
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:12,662
Why don't you just ask Jen K out again
since you're obviously not over her?

480
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,255
You really think I should?

481
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:19,377
I don't know. I've been sort of thinking
about the past lately, too.

482
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,747
I wish someone
would just tell me what I want.

483
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:23,407
I know what you mean.

484
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:31,021
How about I tell you if you
should ask Jen K out again

485
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:34,976
and you tell me if I should
break up with Michael.

486
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:39,231
- You're breaking up with Michael?
- I don't know. You tell me.

487
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:40,894
What?

488
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:44,820
Beer pong. Great. This is...

489
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,704
Clear beer?

490
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,202
- It's water, Cap. It's only 11 a.m.
- Yeah, we're just practicing.

491
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:56,748
- Beer pong. Very nice.
- Don't be fooled, Heath.

492
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,500
- There is no beer here.

493
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,256
- What are they playing with?
- You don't want to know.

494
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:30,659
This next song holds a very
special place in my heart.

495
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,966
It definitely got me through
some rough times.

496
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:34,744
- You're amazing, Frannie.

497
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:36,371
Thank you.

498
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,541
But before I play again, I...

499
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:42,608
want to welcome any questions
that you may have for me.

500
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:44,921
I'm used to dealing
with bullies,

501
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:47,813
although I thought I left them
all back in high school.

502
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:51,970
My question is very personal.
How do you do it? How do you...

503
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,723
How do you stay
so upbeat and wonderful?

504
00:25:58,823 --> 00:25:59,894
It's not easy.

505
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,586
But I have help.

506
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,218
I have all of you.

507
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:11,156
Oh, please.

508
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:20,722
You missed
a real Kumbaya moment.

509
00:26:20,842 --> 00:26:23,532
Apparently, when her parents got
divorced all she had to console her

510
00:26:23,652 --> 00:26:25,257
was that stupid clarinet.

511
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,422
They divorced
when she was three,

512
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:29,579
and that sounds suspiciously
like a Lifetime movie

513
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:31,134
she and I watched last year.

514
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:33,079
You're not really buying this,
are you?

515
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,337
No.

516
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,370
But Frannie didn't sleep
with my boyfriend.

517
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:42,675
We didn't have sex.
We just kissed.

518
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:46,483
And that's supposed to swing me
to vote for you?

519
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:48,550
It's the truth.

520
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,905
Technically, you'd just
broken up with Cappie.

521
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:55,867
Regardless, it was just a moment
and it hasn't happened since.

522
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:57,516
And I'm sorry.

523
00:26:58,373 --> 00:26:59,801
That's the truth, too.

524
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:02,749
You must be
the world's worst politician.

525
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:05,835
Maybe that's a reason
to trust me.

526
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,144
So, let me get this straight.

527
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:26,823
The stickers on the ceiling
are actual constellations?

528
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,588
Yeah, it's what would be directly
above us if there was no ceiling.

529
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,497
I just thought they were pretty.

530
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:36,732
They are pretty.
And accurate.

531
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,124
Your wheels are spinning.

532
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,120
It's this election.

533
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:51,172
It's gonna be my senior year and my last
chance to {\really}make a diference in the house.

534
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:54,452
And the polls are saying Frannie
won back a lot of votes

535
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,927
after her little concert.

536
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:58,903
- You guys have polls?
- Ashleigh.

537
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:02,533
It's crazy. They don't even care
that she lied about her past.

538
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:04,730
Is that crazy? I mean,

539
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:07,981
I lie about embarrassing things
from high school all the time.

540
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:10,233
Oh, yeah? Such as...?

541
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:12,414
If you asked me what
I did on my hour lunch break,

542
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:14,779
there is no way I would ever
tell you the truth.

543
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:16,482
Let me guess.

544
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,576
In the computer lab
playing World of Warcraft.

545
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,088
Lucky guess.

546
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:24,539
How... Wait.
How did you...

547
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:27,170
Two years carpooling with Rusty.
He was a Rogue named Yarbinger.

548
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,683
Yarbinger?

549
00:28:30,754 --> 00:28:32,172
I did battle with Yarbinger.

550
00:28:34,823 --> 00:28:37,067
Probably something
I should have lied about. Nice.

551
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:39,187
No, no, you're right.

552
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:42,997
I knew it wasn't gonna blow
any minds that Frannie lied.

553
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:44,833
But it was all I had.

554
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:47,645
And now she's played
the sympathy card,

555
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:50,065
just like she played
the redemption card at the convention.

556
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:53,337
She got on Tegan's good side
by ratting out Rebecca...

557
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,702
Oh, my god.

558
00:28:56,205 --> 00:28:57,364
She ratted out Rebecca.

559
00:28:57,895 --> 00:28:59,699
That bitch?

560
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,960
I love it when you pretend
to be catty. I have to go.

561
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,372
I have a speech to edit.

562
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:09,976
See ya.

563
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:18,000
Dale got wasted?

564
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,403
Your roommate who hated me
from the moment he met me?

565
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:22,841
Yeah, but he doesn't know yet,
so don't tell him.

566
00:29:23,856 --> 00:29:26,667
- Do you remember my crazy roommate?
- The agoraphobe?

567
00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:29,562
She finally moved.
Dropped out of school and everything.

568
00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:32,503
But when her parents came to
move her out she was totally fine.

569
00:29:32,623 --> 00:29:34,885
- It was so weird.
- I told you she was lying.

570
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:39,781
Hey, so, how's Casey?

571
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:41,256
She's fine.

572
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
- Yeah, everyone's fine.
- Great.

573
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:49,777
- Do you remember Vesuvius?
- Of course.

574
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:53,294
Gone.
Got trashed at a wild party.

575
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:55,296
Nothing but scraps now.

576
00:29:56,874 --> 00:29:58,466
It was a great party, though.

577
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:10,175
- I'm... I'm glad you called.
- Same here.

578
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:14,773
I've been thinking about you lately.

579
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:17,080
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I, um...

580
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:21,483
Remembering stuff,
like walking to class together.

581
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,703
Like falling asleep
in the dorm room together.

582
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,459
And our first kiss.

583
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:32,064
That was nice.

584
00:30:33,717 --> 00:30:34,531
Yep.

585
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:46,725
I'm glad you called.

586
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,782
You said that already.

587
00:30:57,711 --> 00:31:00,316
Great timing.
The food just got here.

588
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:04,738
The place looks really great.

589
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:06,913
{\I thought }Moroccan food
would be a nice change.

590
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,781
There's a great place across campus.

591
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,326
I promise you are going to love it.

592
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:13,792
- Here, let me take that.
- {\Ah, }You know,

593
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:17,915
maybe we should go out.
{\Just }wait until you try the roasted lamb.

594
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:20,678
Yeah, I don't want the roasted lamb.

595
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:22,899
I don't want Moroccan food.

596
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:24,138
OK.

597
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,889
What do you want, Calvin?

598
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:37,214
I just think that we should break up

599
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:41,068
I like you, Michael,
I really do, I just...

600
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,905
I {\just }think we're too different{\, you know}.

601
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:44,899
I mean,

602
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,058
look. This isn't me.

603
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:50,094
I like hamburgers
and hockey and you like...

604
00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:53,497
you like Moroccan food
and Broadway divas.

605
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,103
How can you know who you are?
You're 18.

606
00:31:57,413 --> 00:32:00,976
Yeah, I know. You're seven years older
and wiser than me, which seems to be

607
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,441
an unavoidable theme between us.

608
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:05,251
It is unavoidable.

609
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:07,762
This is your first serious
relationship.

610
00:32:07,923 --> 00:32:10,768
You have no frame of reference.
I'm telling you

611
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:12,940
this is normal.

612
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:19,135
Yeah, but I gotta do
what feels right.

613
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:25,253
That's what makes
this such a tough decision.

614
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,955
I'm sorry.

615
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:46,499
I think you're making a mistake.

616
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:57,270
During my tenure as president,

617
00:32:57,431 --> 00:33:00,572
we were, without question,
the strongest sorority on campus.

618
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:03,848
With me back in office,
we will carry on our legacy.

619
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,756
We will party with the Omega Chis,
and partner with them

620
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:10,215
for every major event,
like Rush Preferentials,

621
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:12,118
Greek Week and Homecoming.

622
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:19,334
With someone else in office,
personal issues could get in the way,

623
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:22,589
keeping apart
the two most popular houses on campus.

624
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,174
And let's be honest.
That not only affects us,

625
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:28,968
it affects the future of ZBZ.

626
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:31,346
I don't know about you,
but in ten years

627
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:34,611
when I come back to visit,
I hope to find Zeta Beta Zeta is still

628
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:37,037
the best house on campus.

629
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:39,717
Vote for Frannie

630
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:41,814
and vote for the future.

631
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:48,387
And I almost forgot.

632
00:33:48,732 --> 00:33:50,054
I won't raise dues.

633
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:02,995
There is no pledge ZBZ,

634
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:05,880
sophomore ZBZ or senior ZBZ.

635
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,900
There is only Zeta Beta Zeta

636
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,176
and that's whose interests
I want to represent.

637
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,350
I have learned
a lot as interim president.

638
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,352
And I'm still learning every day.

639
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,772
The difference
between me and my opponent

640
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:24,911
is that I learn from my mistakes
and try to do better,

641
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:28,030
while she just keeps pulling from
the same bag of tricks.

642
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,613
And is that what we want?
More of the same?

643
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:32,953
A president who was removed
from office

644
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,617
and has not learned a thing?

645
00:34:34,778 --> 00:34:36,828
Are you willing to risk going down

646
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,323
that same road all over again?

647
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:41,908
I can't promise to be flawless.

648
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:46,427
But I can promise that I will be
looking out for all of your interests,

649
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:47,880
not my own.

650
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:49,645
A vote for me

651
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:51,259
is a vote for all of us.

652
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:57,626
And I almost forgot.

653
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:01,268
I won't rat out one of my sisters
just to curry favor with

654
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:04,522
Nationals, like Frannie
did to Rebecca during Greek Week.

655
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,876
Stop! Stop!

656
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:27,429
Can we please stop fighting!

657
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:30,122
And tearing at each other
and try to pull together!

658
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,989
For the house.

659
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:33,468
For our sisters.

660
00:35:38,632 --> 00:35:41,751
Ballots are due in one hour.
Don't forget,

661
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:43,603
every vote counts.

662
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,516
And now, the final two offices,

663
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:59,744
as tabulated by ZBZ's
own accounting major,

664
00:35:59,905 --> 00:36:03,004
who will be interning
this summer at Pricewaterhouse Coopers,

665
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:06,349
and who ensures
the accuracy of tonight's votes.

666
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:07,328
Ivy.

667
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:17,428
Our new social chair... is Betsy.

668
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:20,348
I'm social chair!

669
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,108
And finally,

670
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:28,543
ZBZ president is...

671
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:38,410
by one vote...

672
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:44,163
Ashleigh.

673
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:46,095
What?

674
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,672
Ashleigh won.

675
00:36:53,374 --> 00:36:54,298
What?

676
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:57,927
You... won.

677
00:36:58,088 --> 00:36:58,946
What?

678
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:01,681
How's that possible?

679
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:03,388
You weren't even in the running.

680
00:37:03,802 --> 00:37:04,976
Third party write-in.

681
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:09,021
Some of the sisters and I decided
we're in need of a fresh perspective.

682
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:14,527
I had nothing to do with this,
I swear!

683
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,447
You framed it.

684
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,268
Sorry.

685
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,476
I thought that we were past that.
That's why you called, right?

686
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:49,332
Yeah.

687
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:51,357
Sure.

688
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,940
It's been six months.

689
00:38:00,685 --> 00:38:02,033
Don't you miss it, though?

690
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:04,172
What, the Greek system?

691
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:06,704
Not really.

692
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:10,128
To be honest,
I'm kind of surprised you stuck with it.

693
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:12,768
Why is that?

694
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:17,882
I just never really thought
those people or that world

695
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:19,138
were really you.

696
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,406
You know,
even when I was writing the article,

697
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:25,514
I think I gravitated to you because
we were both kind of the outsiders.

698
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:36,600
Well, maybe you don't know me
as well as you think.

699
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:41,508
Maybe I don't.

700
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:47,810
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

701
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:52,155
Maybe it wasn't.

702
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:01,701
I should probably just...

703
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,246
I'm gonna go now.

704
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:14,740
Rusty.

705
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:19,603
Don't call me.

706
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:29,992
I can't believe I lost.

707
00:39:30,112 --> 00:39:32,192
It was so close,
almost a three-way tie.

708
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,774
{\Well, }Obviously you have
a lot of the girls behind you.

709
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:37,003
Or had.
Now we have to get behind Ashleigh?

710
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,584
- Yeah.
- {\Oh, }Screw that.

711
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:42,108
Listen,
you may not be president, but...

712
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:44,599
that doesn't mean
you can't lead the house.

713
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,323
Knock, knock.

714
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:57,365
Go away, Rebecca.

715
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:01,724
For what it's worth,

716
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:04,071
which I'm sure isn't a lot,

717
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:05,691
I'm sorry, Case.

718
00:40:06,378 --> 00:40:08,617
It wasn't personal.
It was politics.

719
00:40:11,102 --> 00:40:13,419
I had great ideas for this house.

720
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:16,375
Did you?
Because I didn't hear any.

721
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,409
All you talked about
was turnips and clarinets.

722
00:40:19,872 --> 00:40:21,492
You played the politics perfectly.

723
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,863
But great politicians
are supposed to inspire people,

724
00:40:25,779 --> 00:40:27,915
not just be better
than the alternative.

725
00:40:38,363 --> 00:40:39,666
Congrats, Ash.

726
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:48,784
Are you OK?

727
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,505
I'm fine.

728
00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:57,233
Congratulations.

729
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:11,000
You know, when I was with Jen K,
I was convinced she was it.

730
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:13,640
The one, or whatever.

731
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,226
And ever since her
I've compared every girl

732
00:41:16,346 --> 00:41:17,752
to the great Jen K.

733
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:19,730
I've put her up on this pedestal.

734
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:23,092
But even now I realize
that even Jen K

735
00:41:23,591 --> 00:41:25,058
isn't really Jen K.

736
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:27,863
I had the exact same thing
happen to me with The Goonies.

737
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:31,117
They were in my top five all time,
and then Beaver rented it last week.

738
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,130
Man, did those kids
chew the scenery.

739
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:38,230
I made a mistake by going back to her,
but I guess I...

740
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:40,024
I guess I'm glad I did.

741
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,650
Because now you know.

742
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,963
She was your first,
but she isn't the one.

743
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:47,128
I just broke up with Michael.

744
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,377
Really?

745
00:41:49,861 --> 00:41:50,803
Are you OK?

746
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:52,435
I think so.

747
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:55,037
I mean, on one hand

748
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:56,980
I feel relieved, you know.

749
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:58,987
And on the other hand, I...

750
00:41:59,313 --> 00:42:02,580
can't help thinking that maybe
I just broke up with my soul mate.

751
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:06,926
What if one day
I actually like Patti LuPone?

752
00:42:07,756 --> 00:42:09,970
OK, well, first of all,
who doesn't like Patti?

753
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:11,986
Have you seen her in Gypsy?

754
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:13,450
Second of all,
you can

755
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,184
always go back to your soul mate,
that's what makes them a soul mate.

756
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,263
I'm gonna find my soul mate...

757
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:24,874
someday.

758
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,943
I'll tell you what, fellas, {\I think }
I'm done with relationships for awhile

759
00:42:30,177 --> 00:42:33,405
I've only got five or six years left
on this campus and I'll be damned

760
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:35,931
if I waste a second of that time.

761
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:38,422
Life is too short.

762
00:42:39,678 --> 00:42:42,604
And speed date number eight awaits.

763
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,889
- Can I get a spot, Spit?
- Yeah.

764
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:49,830
While you're looking for
that special someone

765
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,959
might as well have
a little fun, right?

766
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,407
Cap!

767
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:08,242
Thank god we didn't return
this thing.
