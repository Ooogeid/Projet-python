1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,459
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:03,716
- What's wrong?
- I kissed Jordan.

3
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:06,838
- Now Andy and Jordan hate me.
- Way to go, Sienna Miller.

4
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,122
Rusty, I think that you and I together
is just a bad idea.

5
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:12,470
And maybe we shouldn't
hang out anymore.

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,592
Casey? What are you doing here?

7
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:16,389
I should ask you that question.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,433
I'm just broadening my horizons.

9
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,730
Or should I say
horizoning my broads?

10
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,574
She's not hung up on Casey,
that'll never come between us

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,355
- like it did with me and Cappie.
- Wait. I thought you broke up

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,903
- because you went public.
- I lied.

13
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:32,323
It's torture watching the girl of your
dreams on the arm of some other guy.

14
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:36,327
I just wish I could accept it
and stop hoping for things to change.

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,497
You've always gotta have hope.

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,420
Observe

17
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,271
the rigidity of form

18
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,085
underneath such silky softness

19
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:49,756
and somber expressions,
depicting the joys

20
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:52,176
and sorrows of love.

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,333
- The rigidity of what?
- His form.

22
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,390
Because of her silky softness.

23
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,556
And notice the second man,

24
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:02,882
standing directly behind
the newlyweds.

25
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:04,544
Is he a witness,

26
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:05,815
or perhaps

27
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,983
a scorned lover of hers?

28
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:10,154
Or his.

29
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,196
Evoking the bittersweet emotion

30
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:15,332
of a love triangle.

31
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,700
Tomorrow's midterm

32
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:20,453
will consist mostly
of essay questions,

33
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,665
analyzing some of the paintings

34
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,540
we've discussed in class.

35
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,169
Good luck.

36
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,712
Essays?

37
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,809
That leaves way too much room
for teacher interpretation,

38
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:33,174
frankly, this guy's kind
of a nut bag.

39
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,648
Do you know his office hours?
I gotta...

40
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:37,660
start preparing my argument
for a better grade.

41
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:40,596
I may try the old
"it's against my religion" thing.

42
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:44,395
- That always worked in gym class.
- You still haven't talked to Jordan?

43
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:47,470
She told me to get lost,
so I guess I'm moving on.

44
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:50,443
Technically she moved on,
or stayed put, with Andy.

45
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:52,142
Whatever. We both moved on.

46
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,945
And now she's moving towards us.

47
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,701
We were actually just
talking about the... the test.

48
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,915
About that,
there's a lot of material to cover,

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,052
and I figured you guys are
all studying together, right?

50
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:08,753
Right.

51
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,311
Anyway, I was kind of wondering

52
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:13,968
if maybe I could join?

53
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,171
You are a liberal arts major?

54
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:20,388
You're willing to contribute,
not just mooch off of us?

55
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:26,027
- It's fine with me.
- All right. See you at seven?

56
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:28,521
I'll see you then.

57
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:32,084
All right. Liberal arts major
to the rescue.

58
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,780
"The midterm will be based on lectures,
readings and class discussion."

59
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:38,874
- "Five short essay questions."
- What? Define short.

60
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,703
- "Three long essay questions."
- Define long.

61
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,562
- "200 multiple choice questions"?
- How is that possible?

62
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,723
I haven't even learned
that many answers.

63
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:48,866
If you'd spent more class time
on women's studies

64
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:51,669
and less studying the women,
you might've learned more.

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,190
I learned plenty.

66
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:56,740
Maybe not as much as
I should've to pass this test.

67
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:59,332
I'm not feeling all
that confident either.

68
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:01,882
I love this class and
I really wanna kick ass on the midterm.

69
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,440
Let's pull an all-nighter.
Like the good old days.

70
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:06,015
Your place or mine?

71
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:10,477
I don't know. An all-nighter?
Max is out of town.

72
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:11,845
I'm not sure it's...

73
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,073
- appropriate?
- If he were in town, it'd be different?

74
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:16,798
It's just studying.

75
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:21,215
You two know each other
from class, right?

76
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:25,246
I'm getting people together
to study at the Espresso tonight.

77
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,816
- Fantastic.
- Wanna come?

78
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,998
Sounds like a plan.
Casey will join us.

79
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,835
If that's appropriate.

80
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:43,054
- Tonight sounds good.
- Great. The more the merrier.

81
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,766
And don't forget
to bring your smarty smartness.

82
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,732
-=Greek 219=-
"Social Studies"

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,694
<i>Timing: Kappa Team</i>

84
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,492
I hate midterms.

85
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,041
What are you doing?

86
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,204
Mentally preparing.

87
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:17,133
My upper-division
advertising midterm is tomorrow

88
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,681
and I have read, I swear to God...

89
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,741
nothing.

90
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,470
And I can't procrastinate
like I normally do.

91
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,514
You know that's
what you're doing now, right?

92
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:30,627
Fine, fine.
I will go to the library.

93
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,242
- Do you wanna come?
- I can't.

94
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,231
I'm studying with Cappie
later tonight.

95
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,650
I'm gonna take a nap now.
Could be an all-nighter.

96
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,112
An all-nighter with Cappie?
What about Max?

97
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:45,254
Cappie and I are just friends.
Besides, it won't be just us.

98
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,870
Apparently he's dating
this new girl from class.

99
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:51,052
- She'll be there.
- So Cappie's dating a new girl.

100
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:53,730
- That's good.
- It totally came out of nowhere.

101
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,001
Why he didn't tell me?

102
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,922
- Are you jealous?
- No, I'm not jealous.

103
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,116
Just curious.

104
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:02,091
Do you wanna talk about it?

105
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:03,801
You're procrastinating.

106
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:06,472
Fine.

107
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:28,046
If you're looking for money,
I cleaned that one out

108
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,495
last week for beer money.

109
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,947
I'm looking for my art history
course packet. Have you seen it?

110
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,831
Paperback? Naked ladies?

111
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:36,627
You might wanna check Wade's room.

112
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,242
Come to think of it,
you might wanna get a new one.

113
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,423
My art history exam is tomorrow,

114
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,467
I need to study with Calvin,
Dale and Jordan.

115
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,844
- Andy's Jordan?
- It's not like he owns her.

116
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm done pulling douche moves.

117
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,861
It's just... I like her.

118
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:53,645
And I miss her.

119
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,059
I also don't know what its gonna be like
to be around her again

120
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,816
while she's still with Andy.

121
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,707
Some's better than none.

122
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:06,281
It's like this potato chip.
It's hard to just eat one, right?

123
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,032
You have one and want the whole bag.

124
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:11,517
Would you rather show some discipline
and have one per day

125
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:13,738
or would you rather not have
any chips at all?

126
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,206
I don't even like this.

127
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:18,459
If you like being around Jordan,
try and be friends with her.

128
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,336
It's better than nothing.

129
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,175
So I've made a schedule
for the study session

130
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,511
with a bullet-point list
of objectives.

131
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:30,888
We spend approximately
two hours on each section:

132
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:34,257
Proto-Renaissance,
Early Renaissance, High Renaissance,

133
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:36,538
Mannerist Period.
By my calculations,

134
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,230
and allowing breaks for food,
bathroom,

135
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:41,136
personal hygiene, etcetera,

136
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:44,283
we should be able to cover
the entire course-load by sunrise,

137
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:46,836
and have a couple of hours left over
for sleep before the test.

138
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,011
Sound good?

139
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,576
- I'm gonna get some water.
- I gotta pee.

140
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:51,998
Make it snappy.

141
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,537
We're supposed to be on
Trivial Pursuit Renaissance art history.

142
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,751
There's our fourth player.

143
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,745
Dinner.
Any special dietary preferences?

144
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,800
I don't eat red meat.

145
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,620
You're OK with the sausage
on the pizza but not the pepperoni?

146
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:14,322
Excuse me for a second.

147
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,895
Is it like an aversion to the color red
or like a religious thing?

148
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,107
Are you OK with me being here?

149
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,444
- Totally.
- Good.

150
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,780
Because,
I didn't come here just to study.

151
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,199
I miss you.

152
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,992
I want my friend back,
if that's OK with you?

153
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:35,988
So, what do you say?
Friends?

154
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,207
Friends.

155
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,627
Guys, come on.
We're on a schedule here.

156
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,531
Why don't you do it
when it's assigned?

157
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:45,448
You should work on time management.

158
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:48,324
I think I'm awesome at time management.
I only study two times

159
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,700
a semester, midterms and finals.

160
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:53,074
The rest of the time
I just live life.

161
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:54,705
And shop.

162
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:02,382
- Where's my car?
- It was definitely right here,

163
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:05,818
because I accidentally
banged your door into that car.

164
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,112
See, there's the ding that I left.

165
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:10,196
It's here.

166
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:12,293
It's gone.

167
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:14,785
Oh, my God. It was stolen.

168
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,664
I've never known a car
that was stolen before.

169
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,339
My laptop's in there.

170
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:23,168
With my midterm paper on
the sleep motif of Faulkner's

171
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:26,717
As I Lay Dying and there's no way
in hell I can write that thing again.

172
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:29,091
- I'd rather lay down and die.
- Are you two OK?

173
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,713
- My car was stolen.
- Silver Mercedes? Two-door?

174
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,096
You saw it get stolen?

175
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,014
I saw it get towed.
This is faculty parking.

176
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:40,805
But I left my flashers on.

177
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,897
Isn't it a rule you can't tow
a car with its flashers on?

178
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,264
Maybe, if you're gone for,
like, five or ten minutes,

179
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:48,915
but I saw it get towed hours ago.

180
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,198
You saw it get towed
and you did nothing?

181
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,490
First,
I didn't know it was your car.

182
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,874
Second, even if I did,
what was I supposed to do?

183
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,910
Throw myself on the hood?
Come on.

184
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:02,241
Great. So now we have to go
to the car jail and bail it out.

185
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:10,007
I guess I can just skip
my study session and take you.

186
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:12,780
- Thank you.
- I won't get the practice test.

187
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:16,555
- You're the best. I appreciate it.
- I'll fail the class. Get kicked out.

188
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,141
- Is your car at the house?
- Or I could take you.

189
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:26,846
I guess it's the least he can do
after letting them tow my car.

190
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,835
You're welcome.

191
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,868
We have 12 hours
and 17 minutes to cram.

192
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:35,779
I'm setting my watch now.

193
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,284
You might need
a lot more time, friend.

194
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:42,083
For women's studies?
I've already seenErin Brockovich.

195
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,664
I'm halfway there.

196
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,805
So what's up with you and Delia?

197
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,836
- How come you didn't tell me about her?
- Why? Are you jealous?

198
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,388
Not jealous.
Just... curious.

199
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,578
We're friends, Cap. You can tell me
when you're dating someone new.

200
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:58,600
I talk about Max all the time.

201
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,393
Although I must say, absence really
does make the heart grow fonder.

202
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,810
I really like him
better now that he's gone.

203
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:09,066
You really wanna know about
every girl that I hook up with?

204
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,365
Not in a braggy, high-fiving,
macho frat guy kind of way,

205
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,154
just in a general, FYI,
this-is-my-life kind of way.

206
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,493
Delia and I are just hanging out.

207
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,161
Completely casual.

208
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:24,433
Is that...?

209
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:27,332
- Did Max lavaliere you?
- He did.

210
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:32,002
- Why? Are you jealous?
- Just curious.

211
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,968
Now that's all out of the way,
let's focus on the test.

212
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,102
We have exactly 12 hours and...

213
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:43,977
Is there a problem?

214
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,553
Do you see the girl that
Delia's walking up with?

215
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,096
She's in our class too, right?

216
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,716
And coincidentally she's also

217
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,526
a girl that I hang out with.

218
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,279
- Both of them?
- You said you wanted to know.

219
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:03,287
You ready to study some women?

220
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:10,053
OK.

221
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:14,182
The city renowned
as the birthplace of the Renaissance,

222
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,516
and in particular
of Renaissance painting, is...

223
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:20,529
- Rome?
- Nope. Our turn. Come on.

224
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,256
OK. The Birth of Venus
was painted by...?

225
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,761
- Botticelli.
- Yes! For the brown wedgie.

226
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,333
What are you laughing at?
Just give me the brown wedgie.

227
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,337
You heard him.
Give him the brown wedgie.

228
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,280
You want the brown wedgie?

229
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:42,391
What are you laughing at?
That's what it's called.

230
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:43,885
This is fun,

231
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,329
but I'm not sure memorizing facts
is the best way to prep for this test.

232
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:49,096
We're gonna get questions like:

233
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:52,153
What do you think the smile on the face
of the Mona Lisa represents?

234
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,678
- Not just who painted it.
- Leonardo da Vinci.

235
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,865
We need to really understand
what the painting's about,

236
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,634
the experience of seeing it
and taking it in,

237
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,055
- not just the year it was completed.
- 1519.

238
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:06,891
You know what?
I think she's right.

239
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,064
Could you educate us on the meaning
of the smile in the painting?

240
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:12,669
In an essay form?

241
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,596
OK. Let's see.

242
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:17,211
It's Andy.

243
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,819
- Don't answer it.
- Too late.

244
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:20,906
Hey, man. What's up?

245
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,742
Yeah, man. Sure.

246
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:25,888
He wants to talk to you.

247
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,919
OK, that's strange?
Why would he call her on my phone?

248
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,900
Better question: Why have your phone
on in the study zone?

249
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:39,841
You don't think that was Andy
she kept putting to voice mail?

250
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:41,531
I don't know.

251
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,599
Everything OK?

252
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,539
Yeah, awesome.

253
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:52,062
Andy just broke up with me.

254
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:54,848
That's terrible.

255
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,617
But back to the Mona Lisa.

256
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:01,696
She's smiling,
but she doesn't look that happy,

257
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,864
you know?

258
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:09,246
That's not what
Professor Freeman said.

259
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,472
She said Angela Merkel
is the most powerful woman in the world.

260
00:13:12,597 --> 00:13:16,296
She was quoting Forbesmagazine,
who first called her that in 2006

261
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,262
as she was gearing up
to chair the G8 Summit.

262
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:21,873
Which Margaret Thatcher chaired in 1984,
the first woman to do so.

263
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:23,483
Does she beat out Merkel?

264
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:26,025
What do you think, Cap?
Merkel or Thatcher?

265
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,873
- Can't I just choose both?
- No.

266
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,647
Then, I'd have to choose...

267
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,039
... Oprah.

268
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,303
I could use another latte.

269
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:44,448
Does anybody want anything?
No? All right, then.

270
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:48,149
How long have you two been together?

271
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:50,704
You mean me?
Me and Cappie?

272
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,079
You're dating Cappie?

273
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,144
No.

274
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,541
No. Cappie and I are just friends.

275
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,832
Good. Because I hooked up
with him last weekend,

276
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:01,173
and I totally thought
he was cheating on you.

277
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,301
- I feel so much better now.
- What night last weekend?

278
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,510
- Friday. Why?
- What time on Friday?

279
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:10,724
I think I could use a latte,
actually.

280
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,973
<i>- You gotta be kidding me?
- What...</i>

281
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,562
They figured it out?

282
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,316
Both of them in the same night?
What were you thinking?

283
00:14:19,638 --> 00:14:21,193
That dreams do come true?

284
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:23,577
Now there's no way
we can study with them.

285
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:24,961
We're on our own.

286
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:27,543
Where's my book?

287
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,871
Right. We should...
We need to... Let's get...

288
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Yeah.

289
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,700
It's 11:15,

290
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,767
so according to the study schedule,
we're about a half-hour behind,

291
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,170
which means I'm sorry,

292
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,963
but the cookie break scheduled
for midnight's gotta go.

293
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,374
- I need some fresh air.
- Fresh air is not on the schedule yet.

294
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:47,773
It's...

295
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:51,554
Your friend's unsavory attitude
is screwing up our study sesh.

296
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,978
- Relax.
- Think you should talk to her?

297
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,532
That's great.
Get both of them to waste time.

298
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,137
That's fantastic.

299
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,328
The air's not so fresh out here.

300
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:27,509
These grad students down the hall,
they have a lot of cats.

301
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,511
Sorry about Andy.

302
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,001
It's his loss.

303
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:37,785
Thanks.

304
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,460
I know you kind
of have to say that, but

305
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:42,751
thanks

306
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:47,618
if you feel like you wanna go,
don't worry about us.

307
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,156
We have Dale's study schedule.

308
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:51,635
No,

309
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,206
I'll be fine. I'm just...

310
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:55,464
kind of bummed.

311
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,851
I transferred here
from a community college

312
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:02,980
'cause I wanted to experience
new things and meet new people.

313
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:06,576
And right off I met you
and I joined a sority...

314
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,136
and then I met Andy,

315
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:11,700
and he just kind of
reminded me of home.

316
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:15,853
Of my high school ex-boyfriend,
of my brothers.

317
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,307
He balanced out
all these new experiences

318
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:21,124
and he made me feel comfortable.

319
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,830
Now...

320
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:26,906
Whatever.

321
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:32,846
You still have the guy
who did a face plant

322
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:34,241
in art history.

323
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:37,786
Speaking of which...

324
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:40,322
Yeah. Baroque Bingo awaits.

325
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:48,352
Thanks.

326
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,477
We've been here for hours.

327
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,116
Where the hell is this guy?

328
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,523
You'd think we'd have more to talk about
considering we've seen each other naked.

329
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,894
- Are you hitting on me?
- What? No, no, no.

330
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,444
I knew there was a catch.

331
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,352
- I'm not...
- I just want my laptop.

332
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,579
In fact, you can go now.
I'll wait on my own.

333
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,368
- Thanks for the ride.
- Are you nuts?

334
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,909
I'm not leaving you
here by yourself.

335
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,289
Evan Chambers is chivalrous?

336
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,166
- Are you hitting on me?
- No.

337
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,127
It's just I've never seen
this part of you before.

338
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,879
And what part of me have you seen?

339
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:33,827
Right.

340
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,365
Right.

341
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,468
I definitely think
there will be different versions

342
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:39,873
of Leda and the Swan.

343
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,060
Good.
More naked breasts.

344
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,290
This class has made
me numb to nudity.

345
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:46,474
There's just nothing left
to the imagination.

346
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,482
I might as well start having sex.

347
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,544
Sure would make Sheila happy.

348
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,622
Also, remember
when we spent an entire class

349
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:54,564
discussing the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel.

350
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:57,036
I guarantee an essay question'll
be devoted to it.

351
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:59,739
Doctrine of the Church, creation,
downfall of man,

352
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:01,724
and promise of salvation.
Bring it on.

353
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,287
What do we think he'll ask?

354
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:04,833
It's a pretty big ceiling.

355
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,472
I don't know.

356
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,253
It's amazing in person.

357
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,060
- You've been there?
- In high school.

358
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:11,756
I went there when I was five.

359
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,718
All I remember is a pigeon pooped
on my head in St. Peter's Square.

360
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,554
- What was it like?
- Kind of runny.

361
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:20,889
These pictures don't do it justice,
that's for sure.

362
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,120
It's like...

363
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:25,200
It's just...

364
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:28,355
It's hard to explain.
You have to see it.

365
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,441
I have an idea.

366
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,412
It's time for us
to take a little field trip.

367
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:36,084
- No, actually, no, it's not.
- I could stretch my legs.

368
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,116
You guys,
we're falling way off schedule.

369
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:41,243
We already lost our pizza break. Do
you wanna cut the massage circle, too?

370
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:43,036
Yeah.

371
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,477
Fine. It's liberal arts.
Let's get liberal.

372
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:48,199
Let's go off book.
But you'll miss these.

373
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:55,776
Here we go.

374
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,206
Table for two, non-smoking.
By the window if you got it.

375
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:04,443
OK, let's just go find
somewhere to sit down and work.

376
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,123
- Look. A couch.
- OK. Here we go.

377
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:15,778
All right, so I didn't get a chance
to read the Baxandall article.

378
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,210
- What was it about?
- I don't have my book.

379
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,474
I need to squeeze in there.

380
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,649
Here it is.

381
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:27,560
- It's like our own love seat here.
- Don't call it that.

382
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,412
- Excuse me.
- Sorry. I'm just...

383
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,086
- I'm sorry.
- What is...?

384
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,107
- I'm sorry
- I was just a little warm.

385
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:37,795
- Can I just get to the page?
- It's kind of hot. Go ahead.

386
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:41,126
All right, chapter three.

387
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,826
Only 16 more chapters to go.

388
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,687
- I'll get it, yeah.
- Yeah.

389
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:52,187
There you go.

390
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:59,419
- I touched your boob. 
- I know.

391
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:02,325
It was an accidental boob graze.
I promise you.

392
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,035
I'm not one of those guys
who gets off on grazing boobs.

393
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,996
You need to watch out for Wade
in a crowded room, but not me.

394
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:14,838
Stop judging me.

395
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,995
All right, chapter three:

396
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,025
Women's Suffrage.

397
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:23,345
The movement's modern origins lie
in France during the 18th century...

398
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,847
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:28,119
I just need to get my arm out.
There we go. All right, better.

400
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:31,441
Please continue.

401
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:40,799
You know, this isn't working for me.
I'm gonna go find us a table.

402
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,727
- What?
- To... To sit at.

403
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:44,151
Here, watch this.

404
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,601
How's the studying going?

405
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:03,613
That was just a little power nap.
I am getting so much done.

406
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,471
I organized my work station.

407
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,033
And I made a new playlist.

408
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:10,521
I checked all my highlighters,
took a nap.

409
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,646
Now I'm...

410
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:13,721
ready to study.

411
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:17,190
But didn't you have, like,
a study group at the Espresso Farm?

412
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:18,706
Yeah, we did,

413
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,797
but Cappie just
screwed us out of it.

414
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:21,960
Literally.

415
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,116
Sorry.

416
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:28,411
It's like he'll just fall into bed
with any girl who asks.

417
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:32,122
OK, seriously, you're sounding
a little ex-jealous.

418
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,790
I am not jealous.

419
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:39,872
I just don't know what his deal is.

420
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:42,205
He's a great guy,
girls are all over him.

421
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,606
If he wanted to,
he could find someone awesome to date

422
00:21:44,731 --> 00:21:46,656
right now, right here in this room.

423
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:49,194
OK, Case.

424
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:51,642
I think that is the problem.

425
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:54,812
- I think that's exactly what he wants.
- What do you mean?

426
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,811
I didn't think it was a big deal
when Rebecca told me,

427
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:00,343
but now you're saying all this stuff
about Cappie,

428
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:02,561
it could explain why
he's messing around so much.

429
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:05,353
- What could explain it?
- We were at Gentleman's Choice.

430
00:22:05,478 --> 00:22:08,121
And in a homojito-induced
moment of honesty,

431
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:10,475
Rebecca told me that
she and Cappie broke up

432
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:12,216
because...

433
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,552
- He still isn't over you.
- No.

434
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:16,960
Seriously?

435
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,547
You're going to have to leave now.

436
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:32,440
What?

437
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:35,018
Can you grab my stuff?
We need to find another place to study.

438
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,650
Yeah. I actually know
where we can get a table.

439
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:43,334
He's still not back?

440
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:47,377
I'm pretty sure he's not coming back.
Not tonight, at least.

441
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:49,794
Then why is the door unlocked?
What about the sign?

442
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,198
- That sign lies. Let's go.
- I'm not leaving without my laptop.

443
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,354
- OK, I was just being nice before.
- I'm not leaving.

444
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:03,156
OK, wait a minute.
You just need your laptop tonight.

445
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:05,439
You don't need your car, right?

446
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:07,592
Do you have your keys?

447
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,625
Great.
We'll get in there and get your laptop.

448
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,429
I'll give you a boost. OK?

449
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,774
- Are you looking up my skirt?
- Where am I supposed to look?

450
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:43,144
Did that dog just
eat my frickin' key?

451
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,294
What are we doing here?

452
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,524
What if somebody thinks
we're trying to steal the test?

453
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:51,365
Professor Summerfield
wouldn't leave it here.

454
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,862
Should we look around just in case?

455
00:23:58,791 --> 00:23:59,791
There.

456
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,449
I rember this now,

457
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:11,449
just not as vidly
as the pigeon incident.

458
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,208
I figured this would be about
as close as we get to experiencing

459
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,670
the real thing in Cyprus.

460
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:19,432
Rusty, this is amazing.

461
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,251
This projector's top of the line.

462
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,082
It produces a great hi-res image.

463
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:27,091
No, I meant that you're amazing.

464
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,458
Michelangelo had to bend backwards,

465
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,969
painting over his head
for four years.

466
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:36,672
Can you imagine
painting upside down?

467
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:40,018
- It's unreal.
- Think that'll be on the test?

468
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,104
Just take it in, Dale.

469
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:43,229
OK.

470
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:49,628
you know that it's rumored
that Michelangelo was, like...

471
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:51,831
Like you are?

472
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,032
Black?

473
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,787
No, man, no. He was gay.

474
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:01,762
Have you ever seen
the statue of David, Dale?

475
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:04,582
Clearly the guy's about
as straight as a circle.

476
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,552
It's him.
I should probably take it.

477
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:15,038
Are you sure?

478
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,074
Too much Irish in that coffee?

479
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:40,552
It's a delicate balance.
I seem to have tipped the scales.

480
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,373
We only have nine more hours
until the test.

481
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:46,555
Or we could move even faster,
devoting

482
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,422
five minutes per chapter,
then take an eight-hour nap.

483
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,872
Read one random sentence
off each page.

484
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:54,467
That's actually tempting.

485
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:55,863
Great! I'll go first.

486
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,592
"The women's movement in France
would never be the same."

487
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,328
There. Now your turn.

488
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:14,642
What was wrong with Delia?

489
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:17,231
How come you only went out
with her once?

490
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:22,043
- You sure you're not jealous?
- No,

491
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:24,289
I'm not jealous. Just...

492
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,805
- Curious.
- Right.

493
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,671
It doesn't seem like
you're going on too many second dates.

494
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:36,052
Not since Rebecca, actually.
Don't you want a relationship?

495
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:41,556
Is this the part where you'll lecture me
about responsibility and maturity?

496
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:42,726
No.

497
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:45,731
It's the part where I ask you if

498
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,957
I may have had something to do with
your breakup with Rebecca last semester.

499
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:51,067
Because that's what someone told me.

500
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:53,903
And I'm hoping it's not true.

501
00:26:58,107 --> 00:26:59,224
You know what?

502
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:01,198
Forget I even asked.

503
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:03,210
We have to finish studying.

504
00:27:05,222 --> 00:27:07,040
It's not true, for what it's worth.

505
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,275
Last call.

506
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,423
We can go to the KT house.
Unless you have a better idea.

507
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:17,865
No. OK.

508
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:22,474
I have to get some coffee
or I won't make it.

509
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:25,616
I'll grab us a couple of lattes
and I'll meet you there.

510
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,775
How much longer's she gonna be on that
cell phone? I'm losing my study buzz.

511
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,697
If she's not back in five minutes,
I'll go out there

512
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:41,960
- and I'll see what's going on.
- Well, you're running out of time.

513
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:44,384
You know, I'm sure they're just

514
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,581
discussing who gets which DVD
and all that crap, you know?

515
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:49,198
These things can be complicated.

516
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:51,876
They have stuff together?
They've been dating, like, a few weeks.

517
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:54,797
- What else could they be talking about?
- I don't know.

518
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:02,139
I'm so sorry, guys.

519
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:04,817
Are you OK?

520
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,708
Yeah.

521
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,179
We had a good talk.

522
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,943
A good talk? What about?

523
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:16,988
Andy wants to get back together.

524
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,407
Well, fantastic. Now we can leave.

525
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,618
You're hitched again, you two
are friends, Michelangelo was gay.

526
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,506
Everybody's happy.

527
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:38,618
OK, so you're positive

528
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:41,492
that if the dog comes within a few feet
of the car, it'll unlock the doors?

529
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:44,738
It's a SmartKey.
It unlocks them as you get close.

530
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:48,429
It does when it's in my purse. I've
never tried it from a dog's stomach.

531
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,310
Well,

532
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:51,967
I guess we'll find out.

533
00:28:56,441 --> 00:28:57,441
Allow me.

534
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,003
Thanks.

535
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,363
Are you sure you wanna do this?

536
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,191
How bad do you need your laptop?

537
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:06,786
If I don't turn in my paper
by 9:00am tomorrow, I get a zero.

538
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:10,580
That dog looks kind of vicious.

539
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,292
No, no, he's still a puppy.

540
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,234
You're really weird
to do this for me.

541
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,260
You're welcome. OK.

542
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:47,994
Dear.

543
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,199
Nice dog, nice dog. No, no, no!

544
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:56,000
OK, all right, all right.
Down, boy! Down, down!

545
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,478
Oh, my God! He's mad!

546
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,545
Yeah!

547
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,773
That's right!

548
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:07,110
That's right, dog!

549
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:08,763
What did you do?

550
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:13,309
- I don't know.
- Now Cujo's in the car with my laptop.

551
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,274
Well,
my study schedule's shot to hell.

552
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:25,653
You probably think I'm an idiot
to even consider taking him back.

553
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:28,624
You know, it's not so much
what happened, it's just

554
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:30,189
how long it took.

555
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:33,089
Dale, why don't we go take a walk?
I know a shortcut home.

556
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:49,319
Earlier tonight he told me
he didn't want me to study with you,

557
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:51,062
and I got pissed,

558
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,309
which led to this huge fight.

559
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:57,260
But considering what happened
between the three of us,

560
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,484
who could really blame him?

561
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,052
He admitted that he was wrong.

562
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:06,912
You know, he apologized.

563
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:11,687
And I really do wanna be friends
with you, Rusty.

564
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:16,956
I'm sorry, Jordan.
I don't wanna be friends with you.

565
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,242
- You don't?
- I can't.

566
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,796
Because I'm crazy about you.

567
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:26,574
I liked you the moment I saw you.

568
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,034
But Andy acted first.

569
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:33,773
And it's been killing me ever since.

570
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:37,127
I fell for you the minute I met you.

571
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:41,120
Literally, down the stairs,
into the slide projector.

572
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:46,227
I fell for you.

573
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:52,717
Say something.

574
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,136
I have to go.

575
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,335
I'll see you in class tomorrow,
or today or whatever.

576
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:21,409
Look at him sitting there,
pretending to be so harmless.

577
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:23,983
Digging his filthy claws
into my nice leather seats.

578
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,234
He is mocking us.

579
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,077
I think he wants to go for a ride.

580
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,698
- Can we please get him out?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, OK. So,

581
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:32,277
I'll start running,

582
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:34,123
then you open the door.

583
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:37,441
The dog will chase me,
allowing you to grab your laptop

584
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:39,778
- and head in the opposite direction.
- OK,

585
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:42,565
- but what if he comes after me?
- He's a dog. Dogs like to chase,

586
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,978
so he'll go after me.

587
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,795
- Probably.
- That's comforting.

588
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,632
Screw it.
Let's just get my laptop and go home.

589
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:58,309
- On three.
- Yeah.

590
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,224
One...

591
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:00,311
Two...

592
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:01,807
Three!

593
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:09,487
Rebecca, move, move, move!

594
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:13,238
I just had this washed.

595
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:17,870
What happened to the plan?

596
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,867
That dog is so fast.

597
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,879
- It's just me.
- I'm sorry, Case.

598
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,806
I thought you were Jeremy.
He has this...

599
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,171
... weird thing
about watching people sleep.

600
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,791
It's kind of creepy.

601
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,509
No, it's totally creepy.

602
00:34:16,684 --> 00:34:17,805
Boundaries.

603
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:18,931
Come on, man.

604
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:23,844
Case, I'm cooked.

605
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,230
Is it too late to take
this class pass-fail?

606
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,352
Yes, it is.

607
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:28,606
Get up. Come on.

608
00:34:31,994 --> 00:34:34,519
- Where were we?
- I think we were in the...

609
00:34:37,229 --> 00:34:40,256
- Hey, you guys.
- OK, stop right there.

610
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,287
I love you, Rus.
But we have to study,

611
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,002
so whatever advice you want,
whatever you need to get off your chest,

612
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:49,086
can it please wait
for, like, six more hours?

613
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:52,448
I told Jordan I didn't wanna be friends
with her anymore.

614
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:54,988
I want the whole bag of chips.

615
00:34:55,113 --> 00:34:56,537
Here, you can have this one.

616
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:58,594
Andy broke up with her tonight.

617
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:00,835
Then they got back together.

618
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:04,148
I was there for the whole thing,
trying to be supportive,

619
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:05,783
trying be her friend.

620
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,939
I just couldn't do it.
I wasn't there to be her friend.

621
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:12,174
I was waiting.

622
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:15,043
I can't wait around.
That'll take forever.

623
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:19,450
It's easier for her to be friends
because she's with Andy.

624
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,738
But for me,
I just can't sit around hoping...

625
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:25,621
... she'll pick me.

626
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:35,009
God, I feel better
just getting that off my chest.

627
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,943
Thanks, guys.

628
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,260
Good luck on the test.

629
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:52,940
Are you waiting?

630
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,276
I told you.
It was an accidental boob graze.

631
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:57,696
I mean, you're bouncing
from girl to girl.

632
00:35:57,821 --> 00:35:59,864
You haven't found that special someone.
I wanna help.

633
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,991
I'm not talking to you
about this stuff, OK?

634
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,426
- Why not? We can be friends.
- Can we?

635
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:08,664
- Why? You still have feelings for me?
- And you still have feelings for me.

636
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,182
- I was just curious.
- Fine.

637
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:13,629
Let's just be friends,
go upstairs and study.

638
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,948
- No.
- Why?

639
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:17,872
You trust me, right?

640
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:20,960
- It's just not...
- Appropriate?

641
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:24,056
Because you don't trust yourself.

642
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,306
That's not true.

643
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:28,684
You want to find me a "special someone"
so you won't have a choice.

644
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,273
I'm with Max.

645
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:32,423
He's perfect.

646
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:34,820
He loves me and I love him.

647
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:37,562
You know,
he gave up grad school for me.

648
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:39,445
Why can't you find someone else?

649
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:42,072
Because no other girl in the world
compares to you.

650
00:36:43,506 --> 00:36:44,506
Oh, yeah?

651
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,479
Kind of hard to believe, right?

652
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:50,559
Look, it's...

653
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,585
It's late. We're both tired.
Let's just call it a night.

654
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,933
Look. A few hours sleep
isn't gonna change anything.

655
00:36:57,058 --> 00:37:00,177
- It's old habits.
- Like having a great time together?

656
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,010
Knowing each other better than we know
ourselves? What does that tell you?

657
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,595
That we can't be friends.

658
00:37:04,868 --> 00:37:05,868
Fine.

659
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:08,165
Then you're right.
I guess I do need to move on.

660
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,394
- See you around.
- I just wanna do what's right.

661
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,145
We can't be friends. That's what you say
I'm agreeing with you.

662
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,916
- Then why are we shouting?
- You started the shouting!

663
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,171
I just want...

664
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:23,106
To not waste my time?

665
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,285
I get it.

666
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:29,718
Well, you're wasting my time now.

667
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:32,708
Wait. What are we saying?

668
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,335
You said it all.

669
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,673
There's the door.

670
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,548
What time is it?

671
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:03,296
8:30.

672
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,257
Done,
and with the new doggy death angle,

673
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,551
- it's gonna really stand out.
- That's great.

674
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:12,246
Where is he?
Is he gone?

675
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,446
If we make a run for it, you still
might be able to turn that in on time.

676
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,338
I told you,
I just need to get to my laptop.

677
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:25,738
I don't know what people did
before e-mail, and SmartKeys.

678
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:27,793
Thank God for advancements
in technology.

679
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:34,137
And thanks for staying
with me all night.

680
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:35,918
I hope you don't hate me.

681
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,439
No.

682
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:39,716
You know, it's too bad that we...

683
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:42,402
... didn't hang out
and get to know each other more.

684
00:38:43,122 --> 00:38:45,980
- We could have been friends.
- Men and women can't be friends.

685
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,282
The possibility of sex
always gets in the way.

686
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,036
Well.

687
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,357
Who knows? Maybe there'll be
some advancements in that area, too.

688
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:55,539
OK, now you're hitting on me.

689
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,829
This belong to you?

690
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,402
Why aren't you working?

691
00:39:17,298 --> 00:39:20,077
- Why does the world hate me?
- The world doesn't hate you, Case.

692
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:23,347
And the espresso machine doesn't care
about your feelings.

693
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:25,138
It's a machine.

694
00:39:28,154 --> 00:39:30,969
So I asked Cappie

695
00:39:31,094 --> 00:39:32,661
about the Rebecca thing.

696
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:35,165
- And?
- Let's just say

697
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:37,798
the Cappie chapter
in my life may be over...

698
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:39,458
... for good.

699
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:43,629
This is serious.
Like Brad leaving Jen serious.

700
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:46,873
Cappie deserves to find someone else
who makes him happy.

701
00:39:47,713 --> 00:39:49,136
Well, that's mature.

702
00:39:50,044 --> 00:39:51,076
And honestly,

703
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:53,097
I was jealous.

704
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:55,735
- Shocker.
- Yeah.

705
00:39:57,745 --> 00:40:00,544
But as much as I'll miss him, as much
as I want to call him and tell him

706
00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:04,197
my sleep-deprived brain was clouded
by caffeine and midterm anxiety,

707
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:08,449
I know it's the right thing
for both of us.

708
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:10,672
Right?

709
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:15,244
Are you crying, Ash?

710
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,672
I am so tired.

711
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,256
It's Max. I should...

712
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:36,308
Hey, Max.

713
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,735
So you guys think we should probably

714
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:41,438
throw a couple of questions
just so we don't destroy the curve?

715
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,683
Don't listen to him, Calvin.
It's a trick. He's trying to beat us.

716
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:46,660
- What?
- All right, people,

717
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,293
you have exactly one hour,

718
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:52,595
and there is to be
no talking during the exam.

719
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,878
Where's Jordan?

720
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,588
You may begin.

721
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,949
Cheating is a coward's game

722
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,893
and will not be played
in my classroom.

723
00:41:37,217 --> 00:41:40,425
- What? I didn't do anything.
- The note's from me, sir.

724
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:42,873
Very well. You fail also.

725
00:41:43,271 --> 00:41:44,446
OK, OK, that's fine.

726
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:47,211
But I'm probably off the hook, then?
I was just an innocent...

727
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,228
We weren't cheating, all right?
Just read the note.

728
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:00,641
"Rusty,

729
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:05,646
"I want to be more than friends.
I've fallen for you, too.

730
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,640
"We need to talk.

731
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:11,246
"X, O, X, O. Smiley face."

732
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Why?

733
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:18,000
I mean, why now? Why me?

734
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,258
Because...

735
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:21,036
You're different.

736
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:24,405
No, different in a good way.

737
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,059
In a new and exciting way.

738
00:42:26,184 --> 00:42:28,295
That's the whole reason
I came here in the first place.

739
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,032
Look, I made a mistake,
taking the familiar route with Andy,

740
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,692
but what you did last night...

741
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:36,969
It was amazing.

742
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:43,470
I always liked you, Rusty,

743
00:42:44,672 --> 00:42:45,775
but last night,

744
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,899
under the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel...

745
00:42:50,712 --> 00:42:51,650
I fell for you.

746
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:00,302
Quiet down, people!

747
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:04,121
Thank you.

748
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:05,770
She fell for me.

749
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:08,963
Talk to her after the test.
