1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:01,829
The end of the world...

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,169
War...

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,253
Famine...

4
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,172
Pestilence... And death.

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,799
And there is four horsemen we see*

6
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,344
helpless villagers trampled, carnage

7
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:15,765
as the apocalypse ravages the earth.

8
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,391
We could call ourselves "Jordy".

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,603
No, your name should come first!
We can be "Rusdan".

10
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,738
No, you're first.
We're calling ourselves "Jordy."

11
00:00:22,863 --> 00:00:25,368
Bosch'sgarden of earthly delights.

12
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:27,226
Notice the right-hand panel.

13
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:29,758
Can anyone tell me why a sow

14
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:32,012
dressed as a nun
is flogging that man?

15
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:34,539
Can anyone tell me
why this class is worth three units?

16
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:36,327
Every first grader

17
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,413
knows that the pig is whipping
that guy because of lustfulness.

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,959
You just snorted in my ear.

19
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:46,253
It's your fault. If your futon
wasn't stuffed with rocks...

20
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,840
Or, maybe if you slept
in your own bed once in a while...

21
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,926
I can't,
'cause then I'd want Grant to join me.

22
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,928
And we'll stop here for today.

23
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,014
Not again.

24
00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:58,884
Leda and the swan?

25
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,685
No, that's sheila topless.

26
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,272
She gave me the full-court press lately.
Why did she gave us free cinemax?

27
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,725
She's trying to...

28
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,710
You know, arouse my primal instincts
through subliminal programming.

29
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,447
Yeah, lusty co-eds 4
is real subliminal.

30
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:16,114
What are you looking at,
perfect couple?

31
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,035
- Whatever, we're not perfect.
- Yeah. Just perfect together.

32
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:21,288
Have a great weekend, everyone.

33
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,456
Unless...

34
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:24,177
the world

35
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:25,835
comes to an end.

36
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,462
I'll see you at 4:00.
I'll be there.

37
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,957
- What was that all about?
- Some special,

38
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:36,956
last-minute panhellenic/ifc thing.

39
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:39,432
But "special and last-minute"
sounds ominous, huh?

40
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:43,229
They're probably just picking the theme
for next year's fall formal

41
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,438
or something.
I wouldn't worry about it.

42
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:47,245
OK, good.

43
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:51,252
So what would be a good theme
for the fall formal!?

44
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,991
- What's the name of the game?
- Thumper!

45
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,471
OK, you know, we can go.

46
00:01:57,596 --> 00:02:00,035
I feel kind of betsy-ish getting a drink
at lunchtime anyway.

47
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,884
It's fine.
I don't need to leave a bar

48
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,748
because of Cappie,
who plays drinking games at noon.

49
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,688
My amazing boyfriend
is back tomorrow.

50
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:08,931
- I'll have another bloody mary.
- You got it.

51
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,938
I'm just drinking it.
I'm not playing a game with it.

52
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:14,051
Are you sure? 'cause with all the...

53
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,511
"missing cappie" thing
and the "max coming back" thing...

54
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,597
doesn't matter.
There's is no Cappie and me.

55
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,515
Even if I wanted there to be.
Which I don't.

56
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,597
You know, I've just been lonely.

57
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:26,631
I haven't been myself...

58
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,649
I crashed a date with Rusty
and Jordan for god's sake!

59
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:34,317
As soon as Max gets back,
everything will go back to normal.

60
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:37,172
Max... is amazing and perfect.

61
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,523
And Cappie...

62
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:43,155
Whatever.

63
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:46,540
Max is a great guy.
He's cute, he's smart

64
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,696
and romantic... But what about all
that weirdness before he left.

65
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:53,099
Giving up caltech for you
with out telling you?

66
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,966
Yeah, max was the one
who gave up Caltech.

67
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,430
- Maybe you should stop Bloody Mary.
- You're here!

68
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,100
You're early.

69
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:06,547
I know,

70
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,391
I got an earlier flight.
Had to switch planes in Amsterdam.

71
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:11,649
I got you this.

72
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:14,638
And...

73
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,821
runway diva extraordinaire!

74
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:18,508
You're the best!

75
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,044
-=Greek 222=-
"At World's End"

76
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,628
Timing: <i>Kappa Team</i>

77
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:45,531
Look at the chandeliers.
And all these old books.

78
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,013
I'm kind of intimidated
by all the fanciness!

79
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,020
So, do you have some ideas?

80
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,589
How about relativity?

81
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:56,443
I know it's more of a theory
than an idea, but...

82
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,864
- All right, let's get started.
- OK, all right...

83
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:01,448
This is what I'm thinking:

84
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,950
you know how P. Diddy
has an all-white ball in the hamptons?

85
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,929
We could do a similar thing here
and have an all-blue ball?

86
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,375
I can't top that.

87
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:16,380
You two aren't here
to pitch social events.

88
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:17,923
The I-kaps say that last week

89
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,760
during the homecoming float contest,
members of Zeta Beta and Kappa Tau

90
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:24,743
were involved
in rigging their float...

91
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:26,770
to eject beer.

92
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,685
That's what this meeting is about?
Frannie's stupid coming float?

93
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,519
And by stupid, I mean really neat.

94
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,565
The float gag
was extremely disturbing

95
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,527
to members of the campus
and community.

96
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,975
- Someone is gonna have to pay.
- I saw you with beer, Ash.

97
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,325
- It was homecoming. Everyone had beer.
- Please,

98
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:46,243
everyone knows you hate my house.

99
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:48,245
I like the english tudor style.

100
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:49,663
Me too.

101
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:52,416
As the judicial committees
for panhellenic

102
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:56,295
and ifc, it is our responsibility
to police our own.

103
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,798
Someone must be held accountable
for rigging the I-kap's float.

104
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,967
Steve.

105
00:05:05,793 --> 00:05:06,889
Right, sorry.

106
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:09,962
Forty percent of us on ifc

107
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,686
voted that your prank
was totally rad,

108
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:16,607
but 60 percent thought
it was uncool.

109
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,044
So, Cap,

110
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,863
we're gonna have to suspend
KT's social calendar for two weeks.

111
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,199
Two weeks!?

112
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,034
Starting sunday.

113
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:32,907
That means we have this weekend
to throw a last-minute rager.

114
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,927
Awesome.
The Kappa Taus accept our punishment.

115
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,421
Good for us. Dobler's?

116
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:42,987
Not so fast, Ashleigh.

117
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,222
At panhellenic,
we hold our girls to a higher standard.

118
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:52,116
Your individual punishment
as the perpetrator of the prank:

119
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,645
we'd have to notify the university,

120
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,605
and you could be suspended...

121
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,400
- Even expelled.
- Oh my God! From what?

122
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:01,360
From... The university.

123
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:02,991
Oh, my God!

124
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:12,265
Dr. Stephanopoulus had me focus
on improving molecular packing

125
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,332
for higher mobility,
which was incredible!

126
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,234
And I've already put the feelers out
for a few side projects

127
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,170
to get involved with on campus.

128
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:23,452
But I missed you.

129
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,666
How were things around here?

130
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,129
They were weird.

131
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,976
I'm just glad you're here
and we can get back to normal.

132
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,063
I think in the time you were gone...

133
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,316
I really caught up.

134
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,597
You're feeling better about us?

135
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:45,145
In fact,

136
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:48,608
I can't figure out
what I was waiting for before.

137
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Good.

138
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Good.

139
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:59,084
'cause I just picked out the costumes
for our <i>Star Wars</i> wedding.

140
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:03,542
- I'm just...
- I know. Kidding.

141
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:08,093
I look awesome
in princess Leia Buns.

142
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:19,021
So thanks to the iki float's
unsavory discharge,

143
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,333
our ifc brethren suspended
our social calendar

144
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,151
for two weeks, starting sunday.

145
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:27,529
This is my fault.

146
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,699
I helped rig Marc Anthony
before J. Lo tipped over.

147
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,527
- It's Mark Antony.
- I know,

148
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,293
it's pronounced different
in Spanish.

149
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,080
Regardless, it was worth it.

150
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,791
It's two weeks, guys.
Come on, we can survive it.

151
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,280
We just have to throw such
a big party this weekend

152
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:43,253
that it'll take us two whole weeks
to recover!

153
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,300
Now, we need word to spread fast,

154
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,762
which means we need a killer theme
to pack this place like never before,

155
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:53,972
- and we only have a few days.
- How'bout beer?

156
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,015
Too obvious.

157
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:56,391
No, girls!

158
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,559
No girls?

159
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,144
No, comma.

160
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,772
Girls, exclamation point.
Girls are the theme.

161
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,691
How'bout the end of the world?

162
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,735
Armageddon! Pestilence!

163
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,003
Guys being flogged
by pigs dressed as nuns.

164
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:12,282
We talked about the end of the world
in art history today.

165
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:15,367
- That's it!
- Art history, baby!

166
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:17,964
Or...

167
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,249
The theme could be
the end of the world.

168
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:25,684
Tomorrow night. Ten o'clock.
Kappa tau.

169
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,549
Prepare for the apocalypse.
And heath, print some fliers.

170
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:29,972
On it.

171
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,501
- What's going on? What are you doing?
- You suck anyway.

172
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,478
Oh man, it's a video from Sheila.

173
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,856
No, it's cool.
See, she's making me a sundae.

174
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,798
She's putting chocolate
on two scoops of...

175
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:47,214
breasts, breasts...

176
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,127
- She's looking for the banana split.
- This is what I'm talking about.

177
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,381
She is the energizer
seduction bunny.

178
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:54,575
I really need Brian
and Sanjay right now.

179
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,713
Yeah, why can't your purity pledge
brothers help you out?

180
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,705
They took a trip
to fire island together.

181
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:02,752
- Fire island?
- Smart guys too with this economy.

182
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,585
They booked a single queen
to save money.

183
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:07,838
Speaking of single queens,
what are you gonna do about grant?

184
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:12,843
No clue. But whatever I do
I can't have sex with him.

185
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,943
Because you'll go to hell?

186
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,932
Because we're in the same fraternity.
Having sex with your brother is like...

187
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,874
Having sex with your brother?

188
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,085
I'm sure that's probably
how they'll look at it.

189
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,892
There's other problems too.

190
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:29,109
What if we break up
and we're still sharing the same room?

191
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:32,076
Wait, I got it.
I got it.

192
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,636
We make an agreement...
no, scratch that.

193
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:36,767
More than an agreement.
A pledge!

194
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:39,075
A pledge to not have sex
with our tempters.

195
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,828
And help each other out with that.

196
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,512
You could be
the first gay purity pledge.

197
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:46,084
Sure I will.

198
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,503
I'm telling you, man.

199
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,952
I'm gonna teach you
the ways of the pledge.

200
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:51,451
The power of prayer,

201
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:54,175
avoiding back rubs,
saying'no'like you mean it,

202
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,679
all of which help you out with Grant.
And you'll help me with sheila.

203
00:09:57,804 --> 00:09:59,223
Until brian and sanjay get back.

204
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,353
- OK, I guess I'm in.
- All right...

205
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,606
Give me your hand.

206
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,399
"God,

207
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,804
"I promise that
until I am joined in marriage,

208
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,987
"I'll have no other intimate partner
but you...

209
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:17,091
"god."

210
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,411
Yeah, that's not creepy.

211
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:23,705
As god is our witness,
we will not have sex!

212
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:24,957
With Grant.

213
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,099
I should just resign now
and get it over with!

214
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:34,402
What was I thinking,
pulling a stupid prank like that?

215
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,027
It's so not-presidential.

216
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:37,780
Someone should throw a shoe at me!

217
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,780
This is all frannie's doing.
She's stirring the whole thing up.

218
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:42,849
Why can't she just leave us alone?

219
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,111
Ash, calm down. This is a crisis, yes,
but it's manageable.

220
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:50,903
Manageable if you were president, maybe!
But I'm in way over my head.

221
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,612
If I don't get expelled
the girls will just impeach me

222
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,367
for my nonexistent leadership skills.
Why did you let me take this job?

223
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:03,245
Oh my God!

224
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:07,541
I'm watching
the professor like a hawk.

225
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:09,835
By reading clues embedded
in the human face,

226
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,675
I can learn my grade moments
before he hands back my paper.

227
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,287
Kappa tau's having this end
of the world party this weekend.

228
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,093
It's gonna be bigger than vesuvius.

229
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,473
What? Is it gonna rain blood
or something?

230
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,549
He scratched his nose
when he looked at me. I aced this.

231
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,228
No, there's a high pollen count today.
Professor Clancy is allergic.

232
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,249
Yeah. Allergic to giving me Bs.

233
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:33,165
Crushed it. It's an A.

234
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,364
Wait... Yeah.

235
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:43,576
That's sloppy grading.
He forgot a line in your B.

236
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,230
Because it's not a B.
It's a D.

237
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:51,084
I can't even repeat
what your face is saying right now.

238
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,718
I can't believe
I just fell into a manhole.

239
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:02,929
I just said "manhole".

240
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:06,642
Why wasn't there a sign
or a cone or something? We should sue.

241
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,734
- The cones should be a brighter colour.
- I'm fine.

242
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,545
Now I have a funny story
to tell everyone at the house.

243
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:20,421
I fell into a manhole!

244
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:22,115
It's not like I could've died.

245
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,575
Well, you could've.

246
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,703
- Really?
- Dying's easier than you think.

247
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,040
You could die slipping in the shower,
backing your car out of the garage.

248
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,236
Heck, if you'd hit the ladder
on your way down,

249
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,134
you could've severed your sacral nerves
and died instantly.

250
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,461
Life is weird.

251
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Death is weird.

252
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,560
Know what else is weird?

253
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,676
I gave up my trust fund.

254
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,393
That's not weird.
That's just stupid.

255
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,191
Probably.

256
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:55,004
But you know what?

257
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:57,879
Yes, it's freaking terrifying.

258
00:12:58,489 --> 00:12:59,956
But I also feel

259
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:01,905
oddly liberated.

260
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,306
- I can't explain it.
- No, I get it.

261
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:09,371
You got rid of something you thought
you need, but that also held you down.

262
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,935
I know how you feel.
Liberating but terrifying sounds right.

263
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,495
Hey, know what else
is liberating but terrifying?

264
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,873
Mortality! Am I right?

265
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:18,371
Sounds good to me.

266
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,000
Mortality contemplated.

267
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,675
Assignment completed.

268
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,934
Totally agree.
Please get us out of here.

269
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,287
Now that you're
an impoverished degenerate,

270
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:29,710
here's a flier
for the KT party this weekend.

271
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,879
So Jordan picked you
over a star football player?

272
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:42,004
Pretty much.

273
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:43,905
That's awesome!

274
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,820
I feel like we should do that thing
with our fists right now.

275
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,787
- A fist bump?
- Yeah! That's it, the...

276
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:56,557
I got a D in o-chem today.

277
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:58,211
My first D ever.

278
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,745
I hate to say it, pal,

279
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,012
but o-chem is what separates
the scientists from the technicians.

280
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,723
I've been juggling a lot lately.
My honors classes,

281
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,349
Kappa Tau, and now Jordan.

282
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,356
You can't have everything in life.

283
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,436
Sometimes you have to choose.

284
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,838
Like you chose Casey over Caltech.

285
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,317
I don't regret it for one second.

286
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,569
I'm not sure
I'm ready to make that choice.

287
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,198
Check with your advisor.
Maybe he can help you.

288
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,616
My advisor hates me.

289
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:35,906
I've never known anyone
who almost died before.

290
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,335
Except my grandmother.
But she actually did die.

291
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,283
Can we stop talking about it,
and focus on the task at hand?

292
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:44,333
- You think a muffin is all we need?
- Trust me.

293
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,282
When I was the IKI mole
I roomed with her.

294
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,356
The more ingredients,
the more confused she gets.

295
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,017
And then, the more she talks.

296
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:53,096
We need some dirt on IKI
to blackmail Frannie. She's our way in.

297
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:57,145
Hi muffin!

298
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,635
It is a muffin.

299
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,524
And it's for you.

300
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:08,789
Moist.

301
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,659
It has chocolate chips.

302
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,371
So Beth, we need to talk to you
about the I-Kap house.

303
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,492
Can you think of anything weird,

304
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:18,677
or possibly bad, going on there?

305
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,964
I think that was an almond!
Or maybe a pecan?

306
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,465
I don't know.

307
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:28,426
They need to clean
the living room curtains...

308
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,804
that's not weird or bad, Beth.
Think.

309
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,844
And enjoy some more
of your tasty muffin.

310
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,043
Walnuts.

311
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,105
Valerie's boyfriend
stays over every night.

312
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,984
They even take showers together!

313
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,067
We can work with that.
Anything else?

314
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,445
A lot of the girls
don't show up for meetings.

315
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:52,117
And oh! There are an awful
lot of plants in the house...

316
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,994
- You just lost me.
- The plants

317
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,539
are all in Joan's bathroom.
And they smell funny.

318
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,919
Joan says they're special plants
that make people feel good.

319
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,354
Can you taste the zucchini?

320
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:18,393
It smells like Hugo Boss
and Brimstone in here.

321
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,055
Well, Grant's not here, so...

322
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,981
we're gonna have to wait
so you can practice what I taught you.

323
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:24,944
Cal, you're back.

324
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,556
- Where you been?
- I was just...

325
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,193
Hanging out with Dale.

326
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:30,951
Good to meet you.

327
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,200
While you were gone,
I hid your DVDs.

328
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:37,997
The guys were trying to get into them,
you know you'd never see them again.

329
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,122
Thanks, man.

330
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,498
I was thinking about going to the gym.
You wanna come with?

331
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,860
Just say no like you mean it.

332
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,383
You know, actually,
I think I would like to go.

333
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:52,200
But...

334
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:55,263
but baby,

335
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:59,063
won't we late for <i>Showgirls</i>?

336
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,502
I know how much you hate being late.

337
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:03,627
What?

338
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,231
Are you guys...?

339
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,901
Oh yeah.
Cal's really shy but we're in love.

340
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:13,529
We're gay together.

341
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:19,537
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
That's awesome.

342
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:21,786
It's fabulous.

343
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:41,239
- What happened to you?
- I fell.

344
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:42,730
I wasn't talking to you.

345
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,522
I was talking to De Niro here.

346
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,107
Is that vomit on the rug?

347
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:52,138
Brenda spilled soup.
What are you doing here?

348
00:17:58,362 --> 00:17:59,662
A little birdie

349
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,539
told us about Joan's magical plants.

350
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,408
So, if you know what's good for you,

351
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,218
you'll tell panhellenic to back...

352
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,420
off...

353
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,047
Of us.

354
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,425
Or else.

355
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,476
Next time
you want to threaten someone,

356
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,921
asking them if it's OK
kinda undermines the whole...

357
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:28,189
intimidation vibe.

358
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,549
And I'm not backing down
because of some...

359
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:34,696
half-baked threat
I know you'll never follow through on.

360
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,364
But I will.

361
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:40,075
Then I guess we'll just have to see
what happens at the meeting.

362
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:48,483
So, I was reading up
on your work in silicon wafers.

363
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,503
It's amazing stuff.

364
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,923
Do you really think brown-nosing
is going to work on me?

365
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:55,759
Is it that frat?

366
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:59,101
- Is the coursework too hard?
- No, it's not that, sir.

367
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,913
I don't get paid by the hour. Speak.

368
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,586
I guess I've been focusing
a lot of time on...

369
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:10,398
My art history... Project.

370
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:11,679
Art history?

371
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:15,209
Why would you choose
a liberal arts class as an elective?

372
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:16,518
I thought it'd be easy.

373
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,740
Those classes seem easy,
because they're stupid.

374
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,183
I tried to have that whole side
of campus razed,

375
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,245
but apparently hippies
need classrooms, too.

376
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,663
Stupid hippies.

377
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,502
This tie-dyed guy in the quad
recommended art history.

378
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,962
Son of a bitch.
They're shameless.

379
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,812
My mistake was not coming to you

380
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,467
for help choosing my elective.

381
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,472
Fine.

382
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:46,077
We'll see what we can do
to get your o-chem grades back up.

383
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,311
Starting this weekend.

384
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:55,842
You sure you're OK?

385
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:56,967
I'm fine.

386
00:19:57,344 --> 00:20:00,078
It's just a stupid manhole.

387
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:02,929
What?

388
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:05,715
Manhole.

389
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:06,955
Sorry.

390
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,982
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

391
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,701
You big bag o'douche!

392
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,801
Welcome back.

393
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,382
Flier?

394
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,598
What's with him?
He didn't even make fun of me.

395
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,991
Cappie always has a one-track mind
when he's planning a big party.

396
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,154
"End of the world party?"

397
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,934
- Can we go?
- You want to go?

398
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:35,537
To a Kappa Tau party?

399
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:37,743
Few things are more thrilling
to a scientist

400
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,863
than contemplating
the end of the world.

401
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,032
Really? I thought it was
the human genome or something.

402
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,204
If it were the end of the world now,
I know I'd want to spend it with you.

403
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:56,129
I have to pee!

404
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,674
Sorry, I just, I have to...

405
00:21:08,982 --> 00:21:10,104
Steady there!

406
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,568
Sheila, you're trying to seduce me.

407
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:40,663
No, I'm just... I'm just really not...
Not ready right now...

408
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,551
No, like, I mean it.

409
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,336
Sheila, Sheila... Hold on.

410
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:50,470
I... I took this purity pledge,

411
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,312
a long time ago and it's very important
to me, that's why I wear this...

412
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
I really...

413
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,614
Oh my god.

414
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:09,661
Dale is my boyfriend.

415
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:13,686
Can you excuse us for one second?

416
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:22,059
I don't want to scare her off.
I just want to slow her down.

417
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:25,093
- Well, what am I supposed to do?
- Stop acting like a weirdo.

418
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:27,808
And come sit on the sofa with us.

419
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,432
Sorry about that, Sheila.
Calvin was joking around.

420
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,685
You know him.
He came over to watch tv with us.

421
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,399
Great.

422
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:39,446
So...

423
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,639
We can watch tv.

424
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,405
Come on, Case.

425
00:22:55,122 --> 00:22:56,210
No Casey?

426
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,876
Bold choice.

427
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,633
I'm sure she'll be here any minute.

428
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,253
Yeah, you don't look so sure.

429
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:08,663
What? Don't think I'll out
Iki's little hemp farm on my own?

430
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:12,103
I know you can't.
I lived with you for three years, Ash.

431
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:15,226
Being passed out in clay aiken's bed
is more threatening than you are.

432
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,312
I still can't figure out
how those girls

433
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,689
ever thought you'd make
a better president than me.

434
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:21,566
Because they wanted change.

435
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,948
Well, they're going to get it. Their
president on a fast-track to expulsion.

436
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:27,030
And... What do you get, frannie?

437
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,698
A third-rate frat house with a

438
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,409
drug-dealing landlady
and wall-to-wall barf.

439
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:35,413
I don't get you. You helped zbz
become the number one house on campus.

440
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,134
So I'll do the same with the I-kaps.

441
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,473
No matter what you do,
no matter what happens to ZBZ,

442
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:43,837
Iota Kappa Iota will always remain
an embarrassment and you know it.

443
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:46,424
And the minute you graduate,
it's going to implode and leave

444
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,497
a steaming, icky-scented hole
in the ground.

445
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,657
That's what you'll be remembered for.
If you're remembered at all.

446
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,423
After a lot of internal discussion,

447
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,062
I'm sorry to say, but we believe
you sabotaged the I-kaps' float.

448
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:16,037
And I'll be referring
your punishment

449
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,206
- to the board of...
- Wait!

450
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,628
I want to drop the complaint.

451
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:26,464
Why?

452
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,146
Because I lied.

453
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,970
I have no idea who sabotaged
my float. I only

454
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:35,903
accused the ZBZs to mess with them.

455
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:39,038
I made the I-kap witnesses
back me up.

456
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,554
You're aware you've wasted
all of our time?

457
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,588
And that you could have gotten
Ashleigh expelled for no reason?

458
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,096
What can I say?

459
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:49,987
I'm just that bitchy.

460
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:54,264
Fine.

461
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:57,453
I'm dismissing this case
for lack of evidence.

462
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,689
I can't believe
I'm missing the party tonight.

463
00:25:07,568 --> 00:25:08,568
Who's this?

464
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,384
Hi. I was just seeing Rusty off.

465
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,982
Happy research. Or whatever.

466
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:18,135
What a lovely tie-dyed vest.

467
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:20,348
Thanks!

468
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:26,399
Bye! Have a good time at the party.

469
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:32,903
- Ready for an all-nighter, champ?
- Yeah, sure.

470
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,238
You so missed it!
You missed me putting a stake

471
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:49,537
in count francula's heart,
put her in her place once and for all.

472
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:51,831
She won't mess with us again.

473
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:54,055
Oh my god! The meeting!

474
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,304
Yeah. Wait, where were you?

475
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,045
I'm so sorry. I've just been...

476
00:26:00,137 --> 00:26:01,378
... having doubts...

477
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:03,876
... about Max and the manhole.

478
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:07,421
- Seriously?
- I know it's crazy.

479
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:10,308
I know I should be happy with Max.

480
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,069
So I made a list of pros and cons.

481
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:14,272
A list of pros and cons? Really?

482
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:15,907
Can I see?

483
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:27,332
Seriously, what's wrong with you?
I almost got expelled!

484
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:29,504
The house could've gone bankrupt!
Where were you?

485
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,797
Making lists.

486
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,927
You used to be this focused, driven
person. When did you become this girl?

487
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,357
Someone who sits around pining?
Making lists?

488
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,281
Second-guessing your choices?

489
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:43,699
Paging Dr. Grey.

490
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,867
No, wait,
you're more like joey potter.

491
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:49,148
- OK, I get the point.
- No, you're worse.

492
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,192
- You're the F-word.
- Don't say it!

493
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,061
- Felicity.
- You bitch!

494
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,654
See? There!

495
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,800
That is Casey Cartwright.

496
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:57,949
Toughen up!

497
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:05,760
I'm sorry, Ash.

498
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:08,042
I'm sorry I let you down.

499
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:09,947
That's all right.

500
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:13,510
You're human.

501
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:18,261
And I'm in love with Cappie.

502
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,247
That's been your problem all along.
You've been bouncing around

503
00:27:25,372 --> 00:27:28,329
in these different love triangles
failing to see the obvious.

504
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,357
Which is...?

505
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:33,108
What's the common point
in these love triangles?

506
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,864
Time to stop
bouncing around, felicity.

507
00:27:39,978 --> 00:27:41,242
I have to go tell him.

508
00:27:56,102 --> 00:27:57,405
Is Cappie around?

509
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,439
You've been avoiding me.

510
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:21,430
- What are you doing?
- Just wait. Something happened.

511
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,094
I almost died.

512
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:26,579
Because of that manhole.

513
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:30,227
I know, it's a funny word.

514
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,902
But almost dying made me realize
I could die anytime,

515
00:28:34,027 --> 00:28:35,890
I could slip in the shower, and...

516
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:39,974
I've... Been waiting,
all this time...

517
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,156
... to feel the way with Max
that I've always felt with you.

518
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:44,506
And...

519
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,116
If it's the end of the world,

520
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:47,896
I want to be with you.

521
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,769
Max is a great guy.

522
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,878
I know. That's what makes this so hard.
I don't want to hurt him.

523
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:04,896
Then don't. Don't ruin it with Max
because of some fleeting thought.

524
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:07,242
This isn't some fleeting thought.
This is...

525
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,237
... what I really feel.

526
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:12,227
- I finally have some clarity.
- You think it's clarity but it's not.

527
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:15,294
It's a post-traumatic stress reaction.
And it'll wear off.

528
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:17,994
And you'll regret
coming to see me tonight.

529
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,475
No, I won't.

530
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:23,287
You'll rember that I am a childish,
lazy, unreliable,

531
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:26,919
unpredictable, unambitious frat guy
who let you down before.

532
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:28,765
And that's why we didn't work.

533
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,702
You don't even want to try?

534
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:42,617
The world isn't going
to end tonight. OK?

535
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:01,382
I was at the house.
They said you were already here.

536
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:13,156
But, Max, I can explain.

537
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:15,990
We...

538
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,768
I was hitting on your girlfriend.

539
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:18,942
See.

540
00:30:19,324 --> 00:30:21,610
I'm not really over Casey, and I...

541
00:30:22,294 --> 00:30:25,948
... thought with you gone
I might have a shot getting her back.

542
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:28,577
And of course, she shot me down.

543
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,078
When will I learn, right?

544
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,668
What the hell is wrong with you?

545
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:36,268
Sorry man,
I know it was a douche move, but...

546
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:37,832
What can I say?

547
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:39,093
I'm a douche.

548
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:06,197
Punch is ready!

549
00:31:10,726 --> 00:31:12,352
What are you guys doing here?

550
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:14,425
I'm gonna go get us some drinks.

551
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:19,452
Strength in numbers, man.
I help you, you help me.

552
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:22,463
I already watched you make out
with sheila for three hours.

553
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:25,550
What do I do the next time she has
one of her hormonal attacks?

554
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,344
You know, menopause is right around
the corner and then I'm screwed.

555
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,159
C'mon, I solved your problem.

556
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:38,895
Sure, dale, why the hell not?

557
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,972
- Great party, douchebag.
- Thanks, numb nuts.

558
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,997
To a new world, gentlemen.

559
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:54,018
Good riddance to the things we hated
and may we not miss the things we loved.

560
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,910
To a new world!

561
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:00,568
You know, I think I'm gonna go.

562
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,512
With all these guys rubbing up
against us by accident?

563
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,094
This is great.

564
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,144
I just want to rub
against my boyfriend.

565
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,456
Oh my god, it's Rusty!

566
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:19,666
God, I need a guy.

567
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,983
You left? Aren't you going
to get in trouble for leaving the lab?

568
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:28,295
- I'll figure that out tommorow.
- Rusty, what are you doing here?

569
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,282
- What are you doing here?
- You blew off hastings? And your grade?

570
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,492
I have the rest of the semester
to figure that out.

571
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:35,369
If it is the end of the world,

572
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,205
- I want to be with Jordan.
- But it's not.

573
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,505
Don't you read the scriptures
I leave on your pillow?

574
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,294
- There's gonna be signs!
- Well I saw a sign.

575
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,463
This.

576
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:47,128
Right here. You, Jordan.

577
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,832
All my friends.

578
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:52,645
This is all I want and everything else
can wait'til tomorrow.

579
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,430
If there is a tomorrow.

580
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,786
Rusty, you're speaking
in tongues right now.

581
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:03,522
It's the four horsemen
of the apocalypse!

582
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:13,115
Has he been hitting on you
this whole time I've been gone?

583
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,622
Did something happen?

584
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,810
No, nothing happened between us.

585
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:20,164
Not really.

586
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,874
I mean, who the hell
does he think he is? It's like...

587
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,884
You know what?

588
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:29,605
That guy's charm
is gonna wear thin one day.

589
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,509
He can't just coast
through life forever.

590
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,510
He just believes in letting things
figure themselves out.

591
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:39,183
He calls it karmic synergy.

592
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:42,060
- OK he can call it whatever he wants.
- And it kind of works.

593
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:43,192
And...

594
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:46,482
He's not stupid enough to think
he can do this for the rest of his life.

595
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,836
He's just going to do this
for as long as he can.

596
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,381
Because he loves it.

597
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:52,884
He loves all these guys.

598
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:56,114
And he's a lot smarter
than people know.

599
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,994
Why are you defending him right now?

600
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,500
Do you still have feelings for him?

601
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,337
Nothing is going to happen
between Cappie and me.

602
00:34:12,455 --> 00:34:13,455
All right.

603
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:18,227
But I don't think anything is going
to happen between us either, Max.

604
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,142
What?

605
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:24,933
You said...

606
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,926
While I was away
you had a chance to catch up.

607
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:29,872
I felt that way when I said it.

608
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:32,633
And...

609
00:34:33,414 --> 00:34:34,613
But now I'm not so sure.

610
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,741
And I can't keep
bouncing around like this.

611
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,330
It's not fair to anyone.
Least of all you.

612
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:46,276
What happened?

613
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:51,839
You're the perfect guy, Max.

614
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:55,202
You're just not perfect for me.

615
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:17,364
Asteroid collision!

616
00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:22,036
Did you talk to Cappie?

617
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:24,584
Yeah, I... Yeah, I did.

618
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,539
I broke up with Max.

619
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,008
Wait...

620
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:34,262
Cappie doesn't want to be with me,
and who can blame him?

621
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:37,795
But I can't be with Max knowing
I really want to be with Cappie.

622
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,017
So that leaves me with...

623
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:42,473
Me.

624
00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:45,324
And I'm... I'm taking me home.

625
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:49,430
- OK, I'll go with you.
- No no, you stay here, have fun.

626
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,107
I could use some alone time.

627
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
OK. You sure?

628
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,195
Positive.

629
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,405
Go, throw some asteroids.

630
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,294
So, I was debating whether or not
to even say anything

631
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,510
I got the message the other day, but

632
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:17,291
I wanted you to know
that your boyfriend's cheating on you.

633
00:36:17,957 --> 00:36:18,967
With a woman.

634
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,145
Yeah, he's not my boyfriend.

635
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:32,231
He's not?

636
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,011
My precious!

637
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:49,196
Hey Max!

638
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,259
Is that beaver's molten
lava madness?

639
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:54,711
It sure is.

640
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,778
- Sorry, Rus, excuse me.
- You're just gonna run?

641
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:01,274
- Where's Casey?
- Rus, please.

642
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,604
Sit down.
I've never seen you drunk before.

643
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:06,144
Well, you've never seen me
dumped before.

644
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,392
Dumped?

645
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:10,907
Yep, pal.

646
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:12,914
Casey gave me the...

647
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:15,713
She gave me the big...

648
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:17,702
Adios.

649
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:23,662
Something clever
that Cappie would say like...

650
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:25,534
Forget about Cappie right now.

651
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:29,830
Not so easy considering
he's the reason we broke up.

652
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:32,958
Casey says
it wasn't 'cause of Cappie,

653
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:35,180
but I know it was.

654
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,225
How do you know?

655
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,963
I saw them come out
of a closet together.

656
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,427
Then she dumped me.

657
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,239
I was wrong, Rus.

658
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:56,001
Never pick the girl.

659
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:59,443
Nope. They'll leave you every time.

660
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:02,708
You can count on it.

661
00:38:35,794 --> 00:38:37,428
What are you doing here?

662
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:44,613
I'm sure you heard
what happened with panhellenic.

663
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,897
I heard that Ashleigh showed you
what sisterhood means.

664
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:49,243
Very forcefully.

665
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:50,412
Please.

666
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:53,240
Ash just give me a way out
of that hot iki mess.

667
00:38:54,155 --> 00:38:55,498
Did you just call I-kap Iki?

668
00:38:56,324 --> 00:38:57,724
There is no more I-kap.

669
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,503
I'm disbanding the house.

670
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:01,713
- Really?
- Ashleigh was right.

671
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:06,157
Iota Kappa is no ZBZ,
and it never will be.

672
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:10,285
Joan the pot dealer was just
the tip of the iceberg.

673
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,850
Half our pledges are total skanks

674
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,779
And the other half
just got skinny for rush

675
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:17,604
and have already gained
the weight back.

676
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,799
This way I can disband that failed
experiment in one fell swoop.

677
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:24,653
So what are you doing here?

678
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:26,007
I was thinking...

679
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:29,825
Maybe you can let back in
some of the ex-zbzs?

680
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,943
A few of the ones
who left might have been...

681
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:35,457
... coerced.

682
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:38,291
And beth is innocent
by reason of stupidity.

683
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,220
I'll have to run that one
past new presidential Ashleigh.

684
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:46,269
And I also came to say goodbye.

685
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:48,742
I'm leaving.

686
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:50,679
Leaving leaving?

687
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,429
For real this time.

688
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:56,698
Finish up my classes...

689
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,631
... graduate, and hit the road.

690
00:39:59,756 --> 00:40:00,772
Let's face it,

691
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:04,169
this place is way too small-time
for me, anyway

692
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Well,

693
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:08,541
you'll be missed.

694
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:14,794
I know.

695
00:40:15,603 --> 00:40:16,455
Right?

696
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,890
I've got the spins.

697
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:37,414
So that guy over there just told me

698
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:40,562
you knocked frannie out
with one roundhouse kick to the head.

699
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,897
At the meeting.

700
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:45,346
I should not drink and brag
at the same time.

701
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:47,778
I am proud of you.

702
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:54,034
I'm proud of me too!

703
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:57,371
I can't wait to see what this new
Ashleigh is gonna do next.

704
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:03,341
You're about to find out.
Wait here for a minute.

705
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:37,574
So Casey broke up with Max.

706
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:42,706
I see.

707
00:41:43,907 --> 00:41:45,061
Because of you.

708
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,675
And she's gonna break up
with the next guy because of you.

709
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,440
And the guy after that.

710
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:58,375
And she's gonna keep doing it,
because for some odd reason,

711
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:02,018
you're the one
she's supposed to be with.

712
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,264
OK, everybody! It's almost midnight!

713
00:42:09,978 --> 00:42:12,595
Let the countdown
to the end of the world begin!

714
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:19,369
It's the end of the world, Cappie.

715
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:21,513
What are you gonna do?

716
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,286
Three...

717
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:24,411
Two...

718
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:25,584
One...
