1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,117
<i>Previously on</i>Greek...

2
00:00:01,256 --> 00:00:03,220
Look, Case, the reason
I broke up with you is...

3
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:05,020
- I dumped you.
- Why do we have to do this?

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,187
Because he's the teacher
and we do as we're told.

5
00:00:07,183 --> 00:00:09,333
I'm not here to coddle you
or inspire you.

6
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:10,627
So you hazed us.

7
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,594
I miss my boyfriend.

8
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:13,855
I want to do that.

9
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:16,467
You'd do that if you wanted to,
but you're committed to your man,

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,465
and that takes character.

11
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:18,756
I'm sorry, Case,

12
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:22,095
but when I think about you
and Cappie, I kind of lose my mind.

13
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:23,448
Do you want to be with her?

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,814
I do. She's the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

15
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:28,361
I hope I didn't hurt you
when I ended things.

16
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:29,645
Who said it's over?

17
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,759
Screw the poor?

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,559
Survival of the richest.

19
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:49,143
Doesn't that seem... Wrong?

20
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:52,581
You want an "A" in Finsterbach's
macro econ class,

21
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,872
then you have to understand Finster
hates anybody below the poverty line.

22
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:59,953
So just ignore chapters 10
through 13 for the midterm?

23
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,339
He calls them the homeless pages.

24
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,997
It's best to just close your eyes
and pretend that they're not even there.

25
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:08,210
Nice.

26
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:11,321
Omega Chi membership
certainly has its privileges.

27
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:15,510
Heads up, coming through.

28
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:20,421
It's like christmas morning.

29
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:23,121
Are you guys group filing?

30
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:26,025
It's midterms. We're studying.

31
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:32,227
Beav, Clemo's past ten midterms
for american history, 312k.

32
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,379
Profiles in courage?

33
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:35,988
Be brave.

34
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:40,287
- You're handing out old tests?
- No. These are just study aids.

35
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:44,242
The sum total of all Kappa Tau knowledge
compiled over the last 30 years.

36
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,349
These are our only weapons against
the insidious administration

37
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,983
and their "C" grade-point average
requirements for fraternity membership.

38
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:53,389
You know, I've never gotten
below an "A".

39
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,917
Ape shall not kill ape!

40
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:03,942
Psychology 303.
From Dr. Freud to Dr. Phil.

41
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:06,530
It's, like, five years old. You got
anything more recent?

42
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:09,248
You'll be fine. Alkin recycles his test
every five years to stop

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,486
people from cheating.

44
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,618
But isn't this cheating?

45
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:16,339
Cheating?

46
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:20,874
Would our esteemed professors continue
to reuse the same tests over and over,

47
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:23,879
knowing full well that future students
could easily recycle them?

48
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:26,924
It's their unspoken gesture
of solidarity

49
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:28,943
against the evil administration.

50
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,266
I think it's incredibly brave
that they're doing this.

51
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,587
Can I offer you a study aid?

52
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:40,383
Alas, poor Yorick.

53
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:42,204
I knew him, Heath.

54
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:46,901
We seem to be a bit light
in the polymer sciences.

55
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:48,946
That's all right.

56
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,469
Hey.

57
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,805
- Ready for dinner?
- But I thought you had

58
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,125
a physics review session tonight.

59
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:57,126
It's optional, and i've already studied
everything. I know it cold.

60
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,082
Besides, we've been going out
for eleven days,

61
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,239
and you know what that means?

62
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:02,830
We've been going out for 264 hours.

63
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:05,347
Our two-week anniversary is coming up,

64
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,358
and I was hoping that maybe...

65
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:22,667
So Travis says he's already done with
midterms and he can fly in for a visit.

66
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:25,001
He gets in tomorrow morning.
Isn't that great?

67
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,070
Super.

68
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,420
Did it dawn on him that we might
still be in midterms?

69
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:32,953
Of course, which is why he volunteered
to tutor anyone who needs it.

70
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,552
- He's really good at that.
- Oh, my god!

71
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:37,887
Rebecca just got a grape seed
brown-sugar rub.

72
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:41,485
I wish my dad'd send me to
canyon ranch to recover from midterms.

73
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,697
It was a gift to us all.

74
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:45,176
Casey, when Travis gets here,
do you want to study...

75
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,167
Excuse me.

76
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:47,183
Hello.

77
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:52,300
Casey, I was wondering if you could
help me find a book in the stacks.

78
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,008
Sorry, already got a study buddy.

79
00:03:58,851 --> 00:03:59,851
Frannie?

80
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,465
Yeah... No.

81
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm good, thanks.

82
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,222
Casey, you and I have been through
an awful lot the past year. You know,

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,791
with the misunderstandings, the
cheating, problems with my parents...

84
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,526
Yeah, but we've been doing better. Only
because we've been pretending that

85
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:19,639
there's nothing wrong.

86
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,260
And sometimes... It's not enough.

87
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,950
- Evan, are you...
- Listen, because I deserve more.

88
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:30,717
And so do you.

89
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:35,914
And i've been thinking about this
a lot lately. And I...

90
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:39,468
We...

91
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:41,900
We can't go on like this.

92
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:47,326
So...

93
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:54,021
Your letters. You're lavaliering me?

94
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:55,706
If you'll accept.

95
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:11,472
You're supposed to say congratulations.

96
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,503
Sorry, congratulations.

97
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:14,747
What's lavaliering?

98
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:17,909
It's when you give your letters
to a girl as a symbol of your

99
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:22,112
commitment to one another. It's the
first step to pinning, engagement.

100
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:23,600
Congratulations.

101
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:25,967
Oh, look at this!

102
00:05:26,252 --> 00:05:27,551
The cartwright kids.

103
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:32,559
You know, you two should band together
and solve mysteries, fight crime.

104
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,838
Got the perfect name for it.

105
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:36,743
There's a sketchy janitor who
I think is up to something.

106
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,971
Casey got lavaliered by Evan.

107
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,558
Hey, that's supposed to be a secret.

108
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,631
- Why'd you tell me?
- Good question.

109
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:46,778
Congrats, Case.

110
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,139
Thanks.

111
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:50,271
Your kids will be very... Aryan.

112
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:53,304
Good luck with midterms, Rusty.

113
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:55,543
Bye.

114
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,351
So when did it happen?

115
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:03,630
Last night, I guess.

116
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:06,878
That means one day till the
candle-passing ceremony,

117
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,898
and another before Evan makes
his presentation on the ZBZ lawn,

118
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:14,695
which means she's still technically
"un-lava-ed" for two more days.

119
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:16,949
I still can't believe
she's with that jerk.

120
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:22,493
And I didn't have a date to junior prom,
which is when Travis called.

121
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:25,381
Except that he thought he was talking
to my best friend Kristen.

122
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,955
Yep, and Ashleigh was so excited
to talk to me that

123
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:30,230
I completely forgot about mixing up
the phone numbers.

124
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:32,706
And obviously I forgot about
Kristen too.

125
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:34,873
And we've been together ever since.

126
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,246
He's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,868
- So you said.
- Five times.

128
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:44,030
Ashleigh neglected to mention the fact
that Kristen is now pre-law at Yale.

129
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,900
Ah, the frat house.

130
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,498
Evan and Calvin moved one of the actives
so you could stay for the weekend.

131
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:54,280
- Wasn't that nice?
- Thanks, evan.

132
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:56,594
- It's Calvin.
- Sorry.

133
00:06:57,011 --> 00:06:58,199
He's really bad with names.

134
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:03,955
- Where can I wash up?
- Upstairs, right past the bedchamber.

135
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:07,024
Okay.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,056
Do me a favor, all right?

137
00:07:12,421 --> 00:07:14,581
Don't tell Travis how drunk I got
at the military mixer.

138
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,096
He doesn't like when I drink too much.

139
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,213
Yeah.

140
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,207
There are five stages to the
hero's journey.

141
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,582
Stage one is the call to adventure,

142
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,506
that's where an act of fate
actually chooses our hero.

143
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,927
Okay, then...

144
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,333
Can i help you?

145
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,899
Uh, yeah, sorry, I'm late.

146
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,495
- You're about two months late,
mister... - Cappie.

147
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:37,744
Hey, Case.

148
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,370
- I thought you dropped this class.
- So did I.

149
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:47,053
As I was saying, stage two is where
the hero proves himself worthy

150
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,600
on a road of travels.

151
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:52,144
We go to stage three, where he achieves
self-knowledge usually through

152
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:53,245
a mystical source.

153
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:55,796
Stage four, he confronts
his true desires.

154
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,243
Then in stage five, the stakes are set.
The hero and the world are transformed.

155
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,212
Now do we have any examples of that?

156
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:04,684
- Uh, yeah. - Prometheus?

157
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,374
King Arthur?

158
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:09,821
Star wars and the Matrix.

159
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,755
You know, those are really
good examples, mr. Cappie.

160
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:17,049
That segues us perfectly into our
midterm essay assignment.

161
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,809
We're going to compare and contrast
literary and cinematic heroes

162
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,307
and their relationship to
Campbell's paradigm.

163
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:25,033
You're gonna be working in teams.

164
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:28,870
My t.A. Posted your team partner's names
on the bulletin board in the hallway.

165
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,572
So that's it, you guys.
good luck.

166
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:40,345
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Some might call it fate... Partner.

167
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,071
You can't be my partner. You've
only been to two classes.

168
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:44,708
Uh, three, including today.

169
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,002
You haven't read the material.
This is ridiculous.

170
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:48,973
Do you really want to go
against the teacher?

171
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:54,478
Fine, we'll write the paper together,

172
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,102
but you have to take this seriously.

173
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,848
This is a big part of our final grade.

174
00:08:58,518 --> 00:08:59,518
It's huge.

175
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,600
And so the adventure begins.

176
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:13,771
So collagen scaffolds don't react
to external positive ions?

177
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,561
- No... Well, I mean, they do, but...
- It's not on the test. I got it.

178
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:19,499
Listen, I gotta finish up
my dissertation,

179
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,417
write a paper on speech pattern
recognition, clean my oven, wash my cat.

180
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:26,293
- And meet me at the library at 9:00,
right? - Yeah, 9:00, library.

181
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:33,905
You're tutored for hastings' physics
midterm by his teaching assistant?

182
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm actually helping him.

183
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,992
Okay, Harville's in my purity pledge
group, and he's been trying

184
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:39,934
to find his way back to the path
of enlightenment,

185
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,018
so I volunteered to help
with his re-virginization.

186
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,637
- His what? - In order to gain a second
virginity, it take significant amounts

187
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:49,628
of prayer and testimony.
So in return for saving his soul,

188
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,658
Harville's graciously offered physics
tutoring.

189
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,249
But between you and me, I think
he's getting the better deal.

190
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:57,532
But why? You already know the material.
Couldn't you have quit the physics part?

191
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,209
Considering hastings sprung all the
new material on us,

192
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:02,395
I'm just chalking this one up
to God's will.

193
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:04,700
New material
for a midterm?

194
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:06,982
Five new chapters assigned at the
review session.

195
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:09,162
Five?!

196
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,947
But the review session was optional.

197
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:14,783
No, Harville's mine. You can't have him.

198
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:32,324
That is for a candle passing ceremony.

199
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:36,042
Please don't tell me you're pregnant.
That would be really weird.

200
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:37,655
Lavaliered.

201
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:44,014
I promised Evan I'd keep it a secret.

202
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:46,755
Oh, not good at secrets.
I get all hive-y.

203
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:48,904
Wow, this is so great!

204
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,291
Maybe one day Travis and I can take
the next step too.

205
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:54,894
It's pretty amazing

206
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:57,249
that you guys have been together
so long.

207
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,615
Since high school.

208
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:01,923
And tack on 750 miles of
separation to that.

209
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,784
Yeah, long distance relationships
are hard, but

210
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,261
that's what makes us so great.

211
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,916
- It strengthens us.
- Yeah, but...

212
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:16,357
Sometimes some people in that situation
would grow apart.

213
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,265
Outgrow each other.

214
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:21,237
But I owe Travis everything.

215
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:24,169
If it wasn't for him, I never
would've gotten into here.

216
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,192
I never would've met you.

217
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,643
Right!

218
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:32,140
But... And i'm just saying
how it's really, really great that

219
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,841
Travis is definitely who you want.

220
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:39,577
Of... Course he is.

221
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:43,577
Just like Evan is who you want, right?

222
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:46,233
Oh, come on!

223
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,600
Who wouldn't want Evan?

224
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,584
Right.

225
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,391
Yeah.

226
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,339
Dr. Hastings, do you have a moment
to talk?

227
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:02,380
We're talking. We're also walking.
Thanks to my high ability to multi-task.

228
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:03,948
Good one, sir.

229
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,319
- About the last class review...
- Unhappy with the new chapters, are we?

230
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:11,615
Aren't review sessions supposed to be
about reviewing pre taught material?

231
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,672
Hypothetically, but then I realized
we weren't progressing fast enough

232
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:17,694
in the curriculum, so I took the liberty
of making this a little lesson.

233
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,459
Science is a rapidly evolving field
requiring the ability

234
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,777
to grasp concepts quickly.

235
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,391
Isn't it more important, though,
that you teach us physics... Sir?

236
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:27,198
It's very simple, Mr. Cartwright.

237
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:29,346
Learn the new material or fail.

238
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:32,136
And I'll be giving the test in room 407.

239
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,369
More space, less cheating.

240
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:41,719
Don't tell me. You're arranging
a kappa tau midterm party.

241
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:43,536
Better, a midterm barbecue.

242
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:45,957
For two.

243
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:49,596
Cappie burgers, on account of you
picking that isthmus guy.

244
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:51,079
His name was prometheus.

245
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,093
You still like yours with sliced
pickles on top?

246
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,736
One of us has to take this
seriously. I bet you don't even have

247
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,449
a clue what film hero you want
to go with?

248
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:58,942
Keanu Reeves.

249
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,419
Not a hero, he's an actor.

250
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:02,094
He is a film icon.

251
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:05,148
I'll write the paper myself and
put your name on it, okay?

252
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,261
Prometheus, a most historic

253
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:10,480
greek god dude,

254
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:14,500
who journeyed on a most excellent quest
to bring fire to mankind,

255
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:17,160
only to incur the wrath of
the odious Zeus,

256
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,699
who chained the dude on
yonder mountain top,

257
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:23,313
where an eagle egregiously scarfed
the dude's liver out for like...

258
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,064
Infinity.

259
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:27,760
Yeah, I full-on read Campbell's book.

260
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:29,700
Since this morning?

261
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,230
That's impossible.

262
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:35,834
A most bodacious masterpiece with
many pages in which i forgoed

263
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,337
an afternoon of non-bogus fun.

264
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:39,611
This is school. It's not supposed
to be fun.

265
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:40,913
Says who?

266
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,512
Anything can be fun.

267
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:44,543
And everything should be fun.

268
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,243
We had crazy fun all the time when
we were going out.

269
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,774
Sex, drinking...

270
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:52,236
Sex...

271
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:54,363
Eating pie in bed.

272
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:58,165
You...

273
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,089
Bought an apple pie?

274
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:03,161
Don't you remember the hell raisers
and heartbreakers party?

275
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:04,155
That was lemon meringue.

276
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:06,241
Or the pumpkin pecan?

277
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:07,465
Halloween.

278
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:09,977
We were dressed up as equine Elvis.

279
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,444
You were the horse's ass.

280
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:16,281
Or that weekend when we got arrested
for protesting protests?

281
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,606
Blueberry cream.

282
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,007
Cappie.

283
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,916
Coconut custard?

284
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:27,612
It wasn't that bad, was it?
I mean, not all of it.

285
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:29,947
It was never bad.

286
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:33,919
It just was what it was,
and then it was time we grew up.

287
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:35,624
Or at least for one of us.

288
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:39,969
Yeah, bummer that one of us had to go
and give up on all that fun.

289
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:44,201
Want a bite?

290
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,510
We should write the paper.

291
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:47,693
Just a nibble.

292
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:51,221
If i do, then can we focus on the paper?

293
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:55,970
What's the harm in taking
one little bite of an apple?

294
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:12,916
I'm not gonna make it.

295
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,795
That was just chapter 17.
I have four more to go,

296
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,237
36 hours to do it.

297
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:20,369
Rusty, you'll get by.

298
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:22,115
You'll cram and you'll survive.

299
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:24,714
All my life, I was who I was
because i was the smartest.

300
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:26,785
I never thought I'd be the guy
who just got by.

301
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:28,815
You know what i don't get,

302
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:33,398
is if you're having so much trouble, how
is everybody else getting through this?

303
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:36,111
But polarity reverses in
a sub-quantum flux.

304
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:37,822
Harville?

305
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,943
I didn't get enough pills.

306
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:44,049
- Just midterms. - Stay with me.

307
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:45,520
I don't understand the polarity.

308
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:48,273
Just gimme like two more...

309
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:50,405
Come on, Harville!

310
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,528
Isn't this, like, prescription speed?
It's what Harville takes

311
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,285
to concentrate. He has
a medical condition.

312
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:04,624
That's what he told me.

313
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,178
I think he just needs to
sleep it off, Dale.

314
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:10,263
No, Harville needs to tutor me.
So I need to find him drugs.

315
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,030
I need drugs. It's as simple as that.

316
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:15,715
All right, I need drugs. Who's got 'em?

317
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,293
I'm not a narc. I'm just...

318
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,080
Just a guy in a bind.

319
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,784
We couldn't do this at the library?

320
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:44,307
So we could fall asleep?

321
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,891
Libraries are too quiet.

322
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,074
Bor-ing!

323
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:49,263
This place is teeming with inspiration.

324
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:51,842
Not to mention refreshing refreshments.

325
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,867
Iblis has only one "s."

326
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:58,079
Since the greek system is just an excuse
to have a bar in your house,

327
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:00,455
isn't this place kind of redundant?

328
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:03,724
There's actually a lot more to
the greek system than drinking.

329
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,008
Sure.

330
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:08,008
How could I forget hangovers and
throwing up?

331
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:09,426
Right...?

332
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:11,130
Calvin.

333
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,302
I'm terrible with names.

334
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,043
Babe, do you think you could go grab us
two glasses of <i>pinot noir</i>?

335
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,426
Sure!

336
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,886
You know, Frannie, Dobler's has
an exquisite wine selection.

337
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,668
Two <i>pinot noirs</i>, please.

338
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,490
Since when do you drink wine?

339
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:30,559
I've always enjoyed a sophisticated
drink with a nice bouquet.

340
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:37,543
I hate Travis.

341
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:41,588
You just hate how ashleigh turns into
a fake, subservient shell of herself

342
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,294
when she's around Travis.

343
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,974
- Same difference. - Not unless this is
the real Ashleigh,

344
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:49,182
and Travis is just bringing out the
person she was always meant to be.

345
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:52,146
Oh, Helva is egyptian, not persian.

346
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,840
You really should've read the book
more closely.

347
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,322
Look, my point is,

348
00:17:56,748 --> 00:18:01,784
maybe she is finally becoming the person
she was meant to be.

349
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:04,875
If that's the case, she'd be better off
not growing up at all.

350
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:06,422
Could not agree with you more

351
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,128
especially if growing up turns you
into someone you're not.

352
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:11,194
Someone pretentious,
boring...

353
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,250
Pie-less.

354
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:17,569
Is this your barely clever, hardly
subtle way of commenting

355
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,082
on my relationship with Evan?

356
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:23,159
It's my barely clever, hardly subtle way
of throwing monkey wrenches

357
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:24,327
into the works.

358
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,514
You want to know what I find
most pathetic about the greek system?

359
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,300
It's all the pseudo-pageantry.

360
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:40,861
You know, the greek letters,

361
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:42,107
the latin phrases.

362
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,107
And nobody here has a clue
to what any of that actually means.

363
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:48,503
- Excuse me, what...
- Hey, let's talk about politics!

364
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,568
I can't listen to this jackass any
longer. I'm going to the library.

365
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:56,865
You can stay here with your refreshing
refreshments and monkey wrenches.

366
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:59,450
Vescere bracis meis!

367
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:00,942
What are you doing?

368
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:14,051
Don't worry, i used to be a latin major.

369
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:51,305
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

370
00:19:58,522 --> 00:19:59,674
In vino, veritas.

371
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,260
Travis?

372
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,516
A round for the house?

373
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:07,042
Come on, let's go.

374
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:08,566
Bye.

375
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:11,545
- Bye, guys.
- Later.

376
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:15,482
Where were we?

377
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:18,867
Stage two. "A hero overcomes obstacles."

378
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,756
Midterms and you decide to go camping.

379
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:39,985
Three hours?

380
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,957
I only allocated 27 minutes for napping.

381
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,864
Then you'll definitely need this.

382
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:49,302
Caffeine.

383
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,708
Trimethylxanthine.

384
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:58,415
I spent all last night trying to learn
five brain-cramping chapters of physics.

385
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:01,331
My brain's fried. Forget what
I studied last night.

386
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:03,168
I can't remember what I learned
three weeks ago.

387
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,936
You'll be fine. You always are.

388
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:06,507
I busted my ass.

389
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:08,943
I've done everything I could.
But I'm gonna fail.

390
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:12,066
The worst part about it,
the game's rigged.

391
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:15,145
Old tests, paid tutors for
cramming, drugs.

392
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,119
College isn't about learning.

393
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,967
It's a four-year course on how
to get by.

394
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,475
Beat the system.

395
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:24,925
The illusion is shattered.

396
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,410
It's supposed to be the last bastion
for education.

397
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:30,448
A place removed from society
where you're inspired.

398
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:33,275
Not discouraged.

399
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:36,856
A place where teachers teach
and students learn.

400
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,827
Yeah, and animated deer frolic
in the quad.

401
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:42,214
Look, nothing is as simple

402
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:43,408
as you'd want it to be.

403
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:46,654
Just when you think you have everything
figured out, someone comes along

404
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:47,910
and complicates things.

405
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:50,445
- Someone?
- Or something.

406
00:21:53,482 --> 00:21:56,282
So with almost everyone cheating,
is it really cheating if you cheat?

407
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:59,995
Honestly, I don't think there are
right or wrong decisions anymore.

408
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:01,942
Everything is relative.

409
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:04,895
So I just need to decide
what's right for me?

410
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:09,147
Unfortunately, the hard part isn't
choosing.

411
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:12,123
It's living with the choice you make.

412
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:22,540
Thank you.

413
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,819
Beav seems pretty happy.

414
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:40,180
He got so excited about
his history midterm,

415
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:44,256
he went online last night and discovered
that JFK wasn't just an airport.

416
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,099
And that Laguardia was a mayor?

417
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,169
No one appreciates a showoff, Spitter.

418
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:50,111
Sorry.

419
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,341
So, i was just wondering

420
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,178
if maybe you can take another look
in the filing cabinets for me.

421
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:58,259
Honors physics?

422
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:00,144
The cookie jar's empty.

423
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:02,028
I need help.

424
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,217
And... And I don't care where or how.

425
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:08,122
I'm willing to do anything.

426
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:20,184
Are you really sure you want to do this?

427
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:23,044
You need to do this?

428
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,903
Yeah.

429
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,897
I'm positive.

430
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:41,038
You pick the hand with the jelly bean
and you go back to your dorm

431
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:44,535
with a burst of fresh blueberry flavor
and no questions asked.

432
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:49,862
You take the other one, and you get
to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

433
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:51,847
The rabbit hole?

434
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,025
So, Neo,

435
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:55,400
which one do you choose?

436
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:16,168
So do you have big plans tonight?

437
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,492
I have more work to do on
that stupid paper with Cappie.

438
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:22,329
And the candle-passing ceremony,
that's tonight, isn't it?

439
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:23,716
Oh, yeah, yes!

440
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,789
The candle-passing. Very exciting!

441
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:29,234
So how is that paper coming?

442
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:32,333
Fine. Surprisingly well,
considering it's with Cappie.

443
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,285
- Yeah. - On the other hand,
he's slightly more motivated than usual.

444
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,779
Like he's turned over a new leaf.

445
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:38,517
Well, I mean, not really.

446
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:41,252
He still came up with the whole...

447
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:42,800
Keanu Reeves approach.

448
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:46,915
Keanu Reeves actually works, kind of,
though, in the construct...

449
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,465
Of campbell's monomyth?

450
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:51,250
Yeah, I know, I know.

451
00:24:53,512 --> 00:24:55,912
Strange things are afoot at the circle K

452
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,916
where keanu must prepare for his most
momentous journey of all.

453
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,478
Saving the world from non-bogus
waterslides, awesome malls,

454
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:09,007
and totally bodacious babes.

455
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,002
It's quintessential outside-the-box
Cappie logic.

456
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:14,844
No, it's smoke and mirrors.
It's parlor tricks.

457
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,818
You know, to prop up a lifetime
of mediocre grades,

458
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:19,957
getting by & avoiding all expectations.

459
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,083
I mean, listen, Cappie is the same guy
I knew in freshman year.

460
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:26,827
Okay, he is smart.
He is full of potential.

461
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:28,418
At the end of the day,

462
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:30,507
he's going nowhere.

463
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,929
As opposed to you.

464
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:33,558
And me.

465
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:38,945
Cappie will probably be president of
Kappa Tau for the rest of his life.

466
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:41,259
Or the social director of a
sandals resort.

467
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,086
You know, in ten years,

468
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:48,856
I plan on being a Harvard law
school grad.

469
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:52,144
I know where I want to be, Casey.

470
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:54,905
Do you?

471
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:11,203
Okay, moving on to new business.

472
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:14,141
Ashleigh...

473
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:16,180
We need to talk about Travis.

474
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:20,196
- What about him?
- We're all sisters here.

475
00:26:20,898 --> 00:26:23,269
We look out for each other.
We stick together.

476
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:25,200
And to put it mildly,

477
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:28,547
Travis isn't exactly quality glue.

478
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,251
You need to dump him.

479
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:34,987
If this is about last night,
he was just joking.

480
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,557
In an unfunny way. He's very dry. Casey?

481
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:42,795
- Uh, Frannie...
- He publicly mocked

482
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:45,835
the entire greek system in front
of everyone at Dobler's.

483
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,002
Not cool.

484
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,874
But I thought everyone liked Travis?

485
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:51,614
- We do.
- We don't. We lied.

486
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:57,488
Ashleigh, even with such obvious pluses
that he's hot and has good fashion sense

487
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:02,129
his many ass-like qualities completely
outweigh his un-ass ones.

488
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:04,245
But he's an ivy leaguer.

489
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,606
Barely.

490
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,022
He goes to Brown.

491
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:09,828
And now I know this must be difficult
for you,

492
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:13,702
so in the interests of helping you out
for the short term, I've made a list

493
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,370
of viable dating alternatives that
won't bring down the house.

494
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:19,549
We have Adam at Lambda Sig.
Alan at Pi Zeta.

495
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:20,680
A whole list just for you.

496
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:22,523
Casey, help me out.

497
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:24,600
Ashleigh, no offense,

498
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:27,256
but you deserve better than Travis.

499
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh, whoops, look at that!

500
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:31,844
Time to bring everyone else in.

501
00:27:32,638 --> 00:27:34,633
I have something special
for you guys tonight.

502
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:36,933
A candle passing ceremony.
I'm so excited!

503
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:39,697
Yeah... Me too.

504
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:23,118
Welcome to the CRU answer center.

505
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:25,243
If you have the cash, we have the
answers.

506
00:28:25,641 --> 00:28:28,636
Press one for english.
Para continuar en espanol...

507
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,447
English literature from beowulf
to the Canterbury tales,

508
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:33,662
press one.

509
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:35,823
Organic chem and physics,

510
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:37,221
press two.

511
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:42,043
For Dr. Hastings' honors physics 205
midterm, press one.

512
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:53,119
Okay, it's time for our anonymous
someone to reveal herself

513
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:54,669
by blowing out the candle.

514
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:57,384
Once around, friendship.

515
00:28:58,054 --> 00:28:59,939
Twice, lavalier.

516
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:02,159
Three times, pinning.

517
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:05,028
Four times, engagement.

518
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:07,088
What's five times?

519
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,094
Murder.

520
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:10,895
Kidding!

521
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:14,293
Okay, settle, girls.

522
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:22,015
"now we pass 'round the light"

523
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:25,533
"let our love glow and warm you"

524
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,498
"let our bonds through the years"

525
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,702
"let our hearts be joined as one..."

526
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,699
you'd have given me warning before
the sorority black-balled him.

527
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,755
Sorry, I tried to talk to you
about this before.

528
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:38,853
I just didn't think that
you would join the mob.

529
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,560
Look, Travis isn't remotely
right for you.

530
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:44,346
And if you weren't so worried about
being single, you'd know that.

531
00:29:44,345 --> 00:29:45,826
So you and Evan are perfect together?

532
00:29:45,975 --> 00:29:47,316
This isn't about me and Evan.

533
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:49,452
Maybe it's about you and Cappie.

534
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,360
But no one knows how you really feel,
do they?

535
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:53,912
What are you talking about?

536
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:57,387
We're just writing a paper together.

537
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:00,265
If that were the case,
why aren't you blowing out the candle?

538
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,872
You're not still upset, are you?

539
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:36,972
Nope, in one ear and out the other.

540
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:40,683
Of course on the way, you drilled a hole
through my brain, not that it matters.

541
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,519
I know how much Travis means to you.

542
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,886
But there comes a time
when...

543
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:50,329
you have to put the past behind you.

544
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:52,737
Excellent advice.

545
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:54,894
Maybe you should take it yourself.

546
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:56,486
I'm looking out for you.

547
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:58,085
Oh, so you're just
being helpful?

548
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,559
Ashleigh...

549
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:03,906
I agree with frannie,

550
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:05,854
but not because of the house.

551
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:10,503
When you're around Travis, you turn
from fun, interesting Ashleigh

552
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:11,969
into boring, horrible Ashleigh.

553
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:13,460
You disappear.

554
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:16,244
And as your friend, I just thought
you should know that.

555
00:31:17,188 --> 00:31:18,200
But I love him.

556
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:20,726
Yeah.

557
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:21,806
Sometimes...

558
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:25,308
You outgrow the people you love.

559
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,633
How romantic of you.

560
00:31:29,057 --> 00:31:31,298
- Where are you going?
- Case, true friends support

561
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,701
one another no matter what.

562
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:37,249
No, real friends tell each other
the truth no matter what.

563
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:40,683
Here's some truth. What you did to me...

564
00:31:41,396 --> 00:31:42,396
Sucks.

565
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:49,239
The midterm's in 13 hours. And it's 40%
of our total grade.

566
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:51,655
Dale, you gotta be careful drinking all
that caffeine.

567
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:55,733
No, my resting heart rate is 145.
That's well within tolerance.

568
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:59,209
- For a hummingbird. - I only have
47 more pages to go.

569
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,293
It's fine.

570
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:51,064
I just bought the highest priced
candy bars on the planet.

571
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:05,658
"Role of noncentrosymmetry in liquid
crystalline and copolymer

572
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:07,019
block self-assemblies."

573
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:14,011
All the formulas are listed
as ingredients.

574
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:31,131
Okay, I'm missing my aviators.

575
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:32,819
I think they're downstairs.

576
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:35,789
Are you sure you have to leave?

577
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:39,304
Yeah, i've got a lot of work to do
back in Providence over the break.

578
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,837
Well, have a safe trip back.

579
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:42,199
We sure are gonna miss ya.

580
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:43,915
Yeah, thanks...

581
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,799
- I'll be down in a sec.
- Okay.

582
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:57,771
Okay, quick question, real fast.
What do you think of Travis, honestly?

583
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,849
Uh... He's...

584
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:02,729
Not my type.

585
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:04,257
Good one.

586
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:06,403
My sisters want me
to dump him.

587
00:34:06,905 --> 00:34:08,065
Well, what do you want to do?

588
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:09,769
I don't know.

589
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:11,193
Ashleigh,

590
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:12,916
it doesn't matter what your sisters

591
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,235
want or what i think.

592
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,775
You date who you want to date.

593
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,695
- But Frannie said...
- No, you love who you want to love.

594
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,709
You know, and if that's a problem,
you just...

595
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:23,764
You keep your private life private.

596
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:25,754
I'm not a very good liar.

597
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:27,053
It's not lying.

598
00:34:27,663 --> 00:34:28,663
It's your life.

599
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:33,788
The only person you have
to be honest with is yourself.

600
00:34:36,972 --> 00:34:37,972
Okay.

601
00:34:40,575 --> 00:34:41,690
30 minutes left.

602
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,913
I suggest that if you haven't begun
the essay questions at the end

603
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:47,300
of page three by now,

604
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,663
you pick up your test, go straight
to the administration,

605
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:52,669
and transfer to something simpler.

606
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:30,155
"Only the hero is chosen by fate... "

607
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:35,890
"and only he can transcend the obstacles
in order to fulfill his destiny... "

608
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:40,218
"to accomplish the impossible... "

609
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:42,925
"and to forever change the world."

610
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:00,291
It's... Great.

611
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,960
We make a good team.

612
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:05,548
Do we?

613
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:27,256
Maybe it is fate.

614
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:33,327
I've got a little a confession to make.

615
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,732
It wasn't exactly fate
that brought us together.

616
00:36:36,636 --> 00:36:37,739
Define "exactly."

617
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:41,048
I bribed the T.A. with a few
bottles of sandusky lager

618
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,226
if he put us two together.

619
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:43,925
So fate was a six-pack of beer?

620
00:36:44,498 --> 00:36:45,498
No.

621
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,682
Two six-packs.

622
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:51,204
Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.

623
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:53,541
I'd have guessed this was
just a big scam.

624
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:54,834
No scam. I just had to

625
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:57,592
convince you that getting lavaliered
was a big mistake.

626
00:36:58,011 --> 00:36:59,820
So I could make a bigger mistake
with you?

627
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,334
Well, not the words I'd choose exactly.

628
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,567
I can't believe it.

629
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:04,854
I have a boyfriend,

630
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:07,745
and I was going to give that
all up for one of your jokes.

631
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:09,015
This isn't a joke.

632
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,662
A joke would be,
"a guy walks into a bar...

633
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,257
Stop, stop!

634
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:16,654
Be a grownup for once.
Have a grownup conversation!

635
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:19,477
A dyslexic guy walks into a bra?

636
00:37:25,773 --> 00:37:28,663
I can't go back to the way it was.

637
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,900
I can't spend the rest of my life
protesting protests and eating pie.

638
00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:35,951
I have plans, goals.

639
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,134
I know. I have them too.

640
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:38,311
Really?

641
00:37:38,612 --> 00:37:40,840
I know where I want to be in ten years.

642
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:42,436
Do you?

643
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:46,897
I want to be with you.

644
00:38:01,476 --> 00:38:04,542
I was thinking if you go
to the Swedish union fusion place.

645
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,988
I heard they have
the best curried meatballs

646
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,772
and smoked salmon naan in town.

647
00:38:08,905 --> 00:38:11,712
Jen, do you know how to calculate
the surface waves of polymer films?

648
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:14,300
No, of course not.

649
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:16,228
Well, neither do I.

650
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:18,621
But the problem is, I'm supposed to.

651
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:20,430
I don't understand.

652
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:22,768
I forgot what learning is about.

653
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:27,235
Why I wanted to study science.
It wasn't about getting good grades.

654
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:29,426
I wanted to learn.

655
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:32,687
I cheated.

656
00:38:33,106 --> 00:38:34,106
You what?

657
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,996
I got desperate.
I didn't know what to do.

658
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:38,518
Well, that's not true.

659
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:41,670
I did, but I cheated anyway.

660
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:45,700
I cheated the school,

661
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:47,300
and worst of all,

662
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:48,852
i cheated myself.

663
00:38:49,646 --> 00:38:52,293
So... What are you gonna do about it?

664
00:38:54,587 --> 00:38:56,400
I am so proud of you.

665
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:58,006
How did Travis take it?

666
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:00,674
He was pretty shook up.

667
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:02,357
Very sad.

668
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,990
Tears?

669
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,159
A few.

670
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,247
Good.

671
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:10,791
So on to bigger and better things?

672
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:14,166
I'm thinking it would be best
to take a few days off from guys.

673
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:17,823
I so understand. The mourning process
can be very helpful.

674
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:19,874
Let's talk saturday.

675
00:39:25,786 --> 00:39:27,727
I'll be at Dobler's.

676
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,690
Excellent. 'Atta girl.

677
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:36,551

- Hey.
- Hi.

688
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:51,680
So i took your advice, and I am keeping
my private life private.

689
00:40:52,276 --> 00:40:53,276
Good for you.

690
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:56,070
But if I have to keep Travis a secret,

691
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,070
what do I do about the winter formal
and the spring mixer?

692
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,248
Well, if you don't have anyone else,
you can always take me.

693
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,123
You'll beard for me?

694
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,417
Strange as it may seem.

695
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,682
Hey, Calvin. You wanna go catch
that game?

696
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,035
That's playing?

697
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:13,348
Oh... You good?

698
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:14,907
Yeah, go.

699
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:16,499
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

700
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:37,009
Hey, Travis, I know you're on the plane,

701
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,061
but I just wanted to say

702
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:41,686
that I had a wonderful time,

703
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:44,393
and I can't wait to see you
next month in Rhode Island.

704
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,004
I love you.

705
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,995
That movie sucked.

706
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,980
I totally guessed the ending.

707
00:41:57,576 --> 00:41:58,612
That's not the point.

708
00:41:58,811 --> 00:42:00,664
The point is, the hero always wins.

709
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:02,526
So it's like one of the rules?

710
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:05,726
Absolutely. I mean, the twists and turns
that they take, that's just

711
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:06,836
to make it interesting.

712
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:10,349
In the end, good will always triumph
over evil.

713
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:11,993
Always?

714
00:42:13,537 --> 00:42:14,596
Without a doubt.

715
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:28,010
There we go.

716
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:35,476
I love you, Casey.

717
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:37,544
I love you too.

718
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,208
Synchro : Babamania, Kasius.
