1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,220
Previously on "Greek."

2
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:04,586
I'm not interested
in being anyone's warm body.

3
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:06,886
I'm gonna go tell Casey
I'm an idiot and I want her back.

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:07,947
I'm done, Evan.

5
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,108
- Finally ready to move on.
- What if I was less of a jealous idiot?

6
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,868
Then I think we could be friends.

7
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:14,938
Casey wants us to be friends.

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,829
And, I said I was on board,
but, I don't think I am, at all.

9
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:21,963
I'll pay you $500
to stay away from Casey.

10
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:24,666
- Calvin Owens?
- A dude sent you flowers.

11
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:26,535
Calvin, you like Michael, right?

12
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,394
Screwing up is what
college is all about.

13
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:31,297
- Learning from your mistakes.
- Time!

14
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:34,586
Had Cappie been allowed to
extend his rare moment of lucidity,

15
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:36,342
you would've realized he was right.

16
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:39,805
- The restrictions have been lifted!
- A toast to Evan Chambers!

17
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:43,963
You're really not
making much sense, Rusty.

18
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:47,908
Oh, my God. This is weird to like and
not like somebody at the same time.

19
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:49,830
Are you as turned on right now as I am?

20
00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:06,368
- How about a movie?
- We could watch a movie here.

21
00:01:09,473 --> 00:01:11,046
You don't have a TV.

22
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:13,717
Right.

23
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:16,808
- We can go to dinner?
- I had a late lunch.

24
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:20,549
- Let's take a walk?
- I'm trying to cut back.

25
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:23,771
You know,

26
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:26,577
Emma won't be back
for a couple of hours.

27
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:28,790
We don't have to go anywhere.

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,174
It's not about have to.
I thought you might want...

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,061
Nope.

30
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,346
We got enough for some bread,
peanut butter,

31
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,435
maybe a couple bags of Cheesaritos,
and three cases of Sandusky.

32
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,480
That's all? We should raise our dues.

33
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:54,967
There might be change
under the TV room couch

34
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:56,900
but Gonzo and his
girlfriend slept there...

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,345
Say no more.
We'll leave it for future generations.

36
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:00,310
Hey guys,

37
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,586
wait up!

38
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,428
Sorry I'm late.

39
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:05,659
Thought you weren't going to make
it because your date.

40
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,743
My "date" took less
time then I'd planned.

41
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:08,850
A lover's spat?

42
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,497
Well, that'd require talking.

43
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:12,250
'Cause all Tina and I do is,

44
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:14,884
- You know...
- If you can't say it,

45
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,569
you really should not be doing it.

46
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,425
Sex.

47
00:02:20,755 --> 00:02:23,750
Usually guys are a lot happier
in these situations, Spittoon.

48
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,571
It's not that I don't like it,
it's just...

49
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:29,140
... it's weird.
I guess she's my girlfriend,

50
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,306
but I don't even know her middle name.
Or her last name.

51
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,504
If you don't talk,
is she technically a girlfriend?

52
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:35,894
What else would she be?

53
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,590
More like a friend with benefits?

54
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:39,839
No, no. No, "friends with bennies" talk.

55
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,621
The girl talks,
usually complaining about other guys.

56
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:45,008
Which makes Rusty a booty call.

57
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,413
That's only if she calls
him for late night drunk sex.

58
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,331
Gentlemen.

59
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:50,282
Gentlemen, Spitter is none of the above.

60
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:53,344
He is, instead,
the embodiment of every man's dream.

61
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,802
You, my very lucky little friend,

62
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:58,315
are now officially a Fff...

63
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:00,343
What you fun...

64
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,547
Buddy.

65
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:03,990
Fun buddy.

66
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,070
Hey, make sure we got
one more case of vodka.

67
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:19,070
You bet.

68
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:22,697
Loading up on wine coolers for
your American Girl spring fashion party?

69
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:25,372
We're celebrating the end
of Dean Bowman's restrictions,

70
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:26,823
and since

71
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,400
I was the one who made it possible,

72
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:31,101
we're throwing a six-way

73
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:33,382
tomorrow night.
All the best houses on campus.

74
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,213
We seem to have lost your invitation.

75
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,802
All right, guys, load up.

76
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:40,132
You used my argument.

77
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:43,082
And it was my argument
that got the restrictions lifted.

78
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:44,999
Right, unfortunately,
that's too long-winded

79
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,713
to fit on the invitation
you're not getting, so...

80
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:03,081
Well, you all know what this means!

81
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,919
We should rush a rich kid next year?

82
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:08,839
Two houses will enter the
ring only one will survive.

83
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:11,628
Cap, it takes weeks of
careful planning to create chaos.

84
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,799
- There's not enough time.
- Not to mention money.

85
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,962
It doesn't matter.

86
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:17,742
A great party's not about money,
it's about a vision.

87
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,061
It's about faith.

88
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:28,587
- How do you spell "brunette"?
- "B-R-O-W-N."

89
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:30,868
Genius.

90
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:33,648
- My thumbs say thank you.
- What are you doing?

91
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,332
Dating is a numbers game,
so I'm making hot guy folders

92
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:40,007
in my address book before
the Omega Chi party tomorrow night.

93
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:43,603
And since we no longer have to deal
with 11:00 PM curfews or noise limits...

94
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,684
The time is ripe
to meet a ton of hot guys,

95
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:49,765
get their phone numbers,
and organize them, then pick a winner.

96
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:51,932
- Gimme your phone.
- No, thanks.

97
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,081
My hot-guy targeting skills suck lately.

98
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:55,479
Jail bait Jonah,

99
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,818
- Shun-me Shane...
- So, what? You're just gonna

100
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:01,292
spend the evening making small talk
with your new "just-a-buddy" Evan?

101
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:03,402
No, I'm totally going
after guys tomorrow tonight,

102
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:05,893
but I decided to let
the universe work for me.

103
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:07,607
According to the book I'm reading,

104
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,312
that's The Secret
to getting what you want.

105
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:13,187
You focus,
send out positive energy...

106
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:15,807
- and the guys will come to you.
- If you say so.

107
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:18,307
I'm sticking with the tried and true.

108
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,989
And I'm going to think
about what would make me happy.

109
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,660
We ran out of hot water!

110
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:36,550
Season 1 - Episode 20
" <i>A Tale of Two Parties</i> "

111

Transcript : [<i>Swsub-sub</i>]

113
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,092
You'll be happy to know
that the water heater will be

114
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:52,003
fixed later this afternoon,

115
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:56,131
Which leads us to tonight's
six-way at the Omega Chi house.

116
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,721
We still need two Sober Sisters to stay

117
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,991
in and make sure the rest
of us get back home safely.

118
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,539
And Betsy,

119
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:09,130
I was kind of hoping that you'd
volunteer considering how much "fun"

120
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:10,529
you've had at past events.

121
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:13,753
And Miss the first party without
restrictions, are you kidding?

122
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,767
Just get some of the pledges to do it.

123
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:19,060
Are there any pledges not planning
on going to the Omega Chi house?

124
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,286
We're not.

125
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:25,183
Really? That's so great.

126
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:28,008
- You and another sister...
- We're going to the Kappa Tau party.

127
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,343
The Kappa Taus are
having a party tonight?

128
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:31,366
They are,

129
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:34,787
they're the only ones who risked having
parties with us when no one else would,

130
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,240
I think we Zetas Betas should go
to their house as a sign of solidarity.

131
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:39,395
Well,

132
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,655
while we can all applaud
the Kts for making a stand,

133
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,407
a sloppy drunken one to be sure,

134
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:49,324
we did officially accept
the Omega Chi invitation, so...

135
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:51,299
Case, I'm a little confused.

136
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,087
That doesn't mean there's a rule
that we all have to go, does it?

137
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:00,796
- I'll get it.
- No,

138
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:02,009
of course not,

139
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:05,150
it's just that perhaps

140
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:08,989
we should schedule another
function with the Kts.

141
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,497
- Like... putt-putt.
- Putt-putt?

142
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,882
On!

143
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,676
Tuesday night,
three weeks from now. Yay!

144
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:18,912
- Meeting adjourned.
- It's your little brother.

145
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:20,796
Should I tell him
you'll talk to him later?

146
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:22,262
No, now is perfect.

147
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,461
What's going on?

148
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,654
I'm having trouble with a girl.

149
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:32,653
Really. What's the problem?

150
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,704
Sex.

151
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:39,918
Come on, Casey, This is a bad idea.

152
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,831
And talking to your
sister about sex isn't?

153
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:44,807
I'm desperate.
I need the female point of view.

154
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,853
I'm a female.

155
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:56,555
If it gets too weird,
you have my permission to leave.

156
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:57,646
Happy to help.

157
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:02,779
So, you're wondering if
it's too soon to get intimate?

158
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:04,360
What?
No.

159
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:07,035
Tina and I are way past that.

160
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:10,269
Wait...

161
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,100
you no longer like her?

162
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:14,645
Honestly, I don't really even know her.

163
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:19,228
Tina and I are fun buddies.

164
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,496
You're not here to brag, are you?
That would just be weird.

165
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:31,995
What I am is just really confused.

166
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:34,863
What if I'm using her?

167
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,707
Do girls do stuff like this?

168
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:39,929
"It can be emotionally
taxing to have uncommitted sex,

169
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:43,469
so once in a while,
have a truthful talk with yourself."

170
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,107
Did you just make that up?

00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,623
I've read every issue from
cover to cover since I was nine.

174
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:57,330
That's impressive.

175
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:01,189
So,

176
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:03,722
do you both want the same thing?

177
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:05,221
Well,

178
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,441
Tina seems to really want this, and,

179
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:12,656
- the sex is great.
- No bragging, remember?

180
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,246
But...

181
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:16,078
something's missing.

182
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:18,529
It was different with Jen.

183
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:26,098
Girls can enjoy this kind
of a relationship just as much as guys.

184
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:29,492
But the real question
isn't just what Tina wants.

185
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,335
It's what you want, too.

186
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:48,436
Maybe it's just me,

187
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,508
but, selling blood for beer
doesn't seem like a good idea.

188
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,167
- Are you kidding, we have three kegs.
- And low blood sugar.

189
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:57,937
Which only means we'll get drunk faster.
I think of that as a "win-win."

190
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,419
It's not going to make
any difference anyway, I mean,

191
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:03,109
three kegs, it's not gonna
get us past the pre-party.

192
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,239
Which is why we scheduled entertainment.

193
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:07,568
Beaver, how's the
Jell-O wrestling coming?

194
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:10,770
One of the Jell-O wrestlers
turned out to be allergic to gelatin,

195
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,985
which means we're left with 87 boxes

196
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:15,864
of strawberry powder and 18 cans
of mandarin oranges.

197
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:18,193
There's always the other wrestler.

198
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,120
Two is art, one is just weird.

199
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:22,734
It's not too late to call this off, Cap.

200
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:24,432
Never.

201
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:25,742
Ben Bennett,

202
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:28,451
I'm putting ou in charge
of the Jell-O shots.

203
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:31,040
- But, we're out of vodka.
- Well, just use water.

204
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,217
You can make Jell-O with just water?

205
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,929
I don't know. Experiment
and hope for the placebo effect.

206
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,847
Just the Cartwright I'm looking for.

207
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,339
I'm all yours, Cap,
as soon as I get back from the dorms.

208
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,826
I have to tell Tina
I can not see her anymore.

209
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,549
- It's her.
- I can't let you do that.

210
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:54,412
Cappie, I know you think I'm crazy,
but I have to get out of this.

211
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,450
It might be everyone's dream,
but it's not mine,

212
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:01,146
and not doing anything
is just making me all... itchy.

213
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,294
Relationships you end in person.

214
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,937
Sex friends you let fade away.

215
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:07,885
If you treat casual sexcapades,
which is what you and Tina have,

216
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,312
like a relationship,

217
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:13,036
you're just gonna end up making both
parties feel embarrassed and awkward.

218
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,854
- But I can't just ignore her.
- That's exactly what you do.

219
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,324
You let her call a few times,
you ignore the calls,

220
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:20,826
she'll eventually realize
that you're a scumbag, and she'll,

221
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,659
you know, move on to somebody better.

222
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,475
- Wait. Now I'm a scumbag?
- But a scumbag with dignity.

223
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,502
But never fear, redemption is at hand.

224
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:30,849
Ice.

225
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,533
- Ice?
- We need three bags.

226
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:36,754
You might find some change
if you fish under the couch pillows.

227
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:37,978
What the...?

228
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:48,127
- Casey, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.

229
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,631
It's just a little free advice.

230
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,711
Frannie, you know you
can always speak your mind.

231
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,387
You were a great president.

232
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:55,931
Well, mostly great.

233
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:00,964
Tonight's party isn't
just about having a good time,

234
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,833
it's about not disrupting our very

235
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,153
delicate relationship
with the Omega Chis,

236
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:07,936
which would be seriously
undermined if Rebecca

237
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:10,002
and her pledge sisters
went somewhere else.

238
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,565
- If you allow even a tiny...
- Hold on.

239
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,867
Rebecca, Mandi?

240
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:17,367
Remember, Sober Sisters
help any Zeta Beta in need.

241
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:20,037
And don't eat the ice cream
on the left side of the freezer.

242
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,686
That's for me when I get back.

243
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,929
Night,

244
00:12:23,238 --> 00:12:24,181
Sisters.

245
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm sorry. You were saying?

246
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:33,166
I was saying, Bravo.

247
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:35,099
Let's go! Let's go!

248
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:51,557
She's in a rock and
roll band I'm in a rock

249
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,881
- I think this might've been a mistake.
- What was?

250
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,995
Inviting Michael on our first date
to a fraternity party

251
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,844
filled with hot guys.

252
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,889
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

253
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,559
But I do.

254
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:15,449
It looks like all the Pledges
made it to the right party.

255
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:17,176
- Imagine that.
- Ladies.

256
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,526
Just to let you know,
we have two fully stocked bars,

257
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:23,651
the dance floor is filling up,
and if anything goes wrong, please,

258
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,455
don't bother telling me, because
I'm going to be busy having a good time.

259
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:29,574
I'll drink to that.

260
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:33,170
Excuse me, girls. I think there's
a margarita with my name on it.

261
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,507
- So, you're having a good time?
- Yeah, so far.

262
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:41,041
Good. Because I want
you to have a good time.

263
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:43,534
I mean, I want us
both to have a good time.

264
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:45,255
It's a party.

265
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,049
Hey, no cuts!
OK?

266
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:51,305
What'd I tell you about cutting in line?

267
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:52,579
Captain Cuts-A-Lot.

268
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:54,673
- Excuse me.
- What's your deal?

269
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,701
Positivity initialized with the ex.

270
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:00,532
Positive energy going
out to the rest of the party.

271
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,515
<i>Hi.</i>

272
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:11,477
Ryan Prince.

273
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:15,025
The cutest sweetest,
smartest, pre-medest...

274
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,805
Most unavailable guy here.

275
00:14:18,747 --> 00:14:21,978
Yeah. Maybe you can send
positive energy his way,

276
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:25,878
and then send negative energy
toward his skanky Tri-Pi girlfriend.

277
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:28,663
Unfortunately,
I don't think The Secret works that way.

278
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:31,801
Then I'll stick to
the traditional approach.

279
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,465
Thinking happy thoughts.

280
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:35,118
See you around, Sister.

281
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,427
Calvin!
Can I talk to you for a sec?

282
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,769
Starting now, you're off pledge duties.

283
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:47,858
I want you to keep
an eye on Casey tonight.

284
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:50,195
- Excuse me?
- OK, let me rephrase.

285
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:53,605
Can you keep guys away from Casey,
as quietly as possible, tonight?

286
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,829
I know you still have
a thing for her, but...

287
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:59,802
Why do you think I'm doing this?
Parties the perfect way to reconnect.

288
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:01,628
There's drinking, dancing,

289
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:04,976
darkness and just enough time
for things to happen naturally.

290
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:07,472
If I make a move too fast,
it'll freak Casey out.

291
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:09,969
I need you to keep the
field clear for a little while.

292
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:13,237
- This doesn't sound like a good idea.
- I'm not asking as a friend,

293
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:15,649
I'm asking you as your big brother.

294
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:17,968
I'll do what I can.

295
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,018
All right.

296
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,462
Stop here. Stop here.

297
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,859
Stop here!

298
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:31,705
Not stopping here.

299
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,589
I bet people are just
being fashionably late.

300
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:38,572
More party goers!
Everyone, look alive!

301
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:02,643
How many?

302
00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:07,129
Fourteen.

303
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:12,512
Ben Bennett said he put in placebos,

304
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,104
- but I'm not feeling it.
- Me neither.

305
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,617
- Maybe we should go faster?
- Good thinking.

306
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:28,021
How long until I become a scumbag?

307
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,707
Give it time, Spitter.

308
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,593
It's a good party, though?

309
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:35,811
This is not a party,
this is a get-together.

310
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:38,354
Pretty soon, someone's
gonna bust out a deck of cards

311
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:41,655
and suggest that we play
a rousing game of Pinochle.

312
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,797
Hey Cappie, we're almost out of beer.

313
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:47,932
OK, think.

314
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:50,066
We need beer.
We need girls.

315
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:52,391
We need girls who can't hold much beer.

316
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,482
Dorm girls. We need dorm girls.

317
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,780
Hoover, Stork, dorm sweep. Let's go.

318
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,304
- You know, your phone's ringing.
- It's Tina.

319
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,504
I want to tell her
I can't do this anymore,

320
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,267
but Cappie told me not to do anything.

321
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:11,679
Gave me the same advice
when I was seeing this Tri-Pi.

322
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,265
Realy? What happened?

323
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,895
She set my car on fire.

324
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:17,973
- I don't have a car.
- You got nothing to worry about.

325
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,011
You know, you can break up
with a fun buddy over the phone.

326
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,716
Yeah, you see, I'm not
exactly that good over the phone.

327
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:29,824
You just need some practice.

328
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,800
Wait.

329
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,039
You be you,
I'll be Tina.

330
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,729
All right.

331
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,220
Rusty, I'm waiting.

332
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,424
Ring. Ring. Ring.

333
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:52,853
Hello, who is this?

334
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,443
Hey, it's Rusty.

335
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:55,850
Rusty who?

336
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:58,528
Just kidding.

337
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:04,314
So, are we gonna get together later?

338
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:07,247
I'm so lonely and you're so good,

339
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,555
especially when you do that thing with,
you know...

340
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,971
I don't think we should
do this anymore, Tina.

341
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,804
So that's it? You get me to sleep
with you, then you treat me like dirt.

342
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:19,237
- Like I'm some piece of meat?
- No... I just

343
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,850
- feel.
- You are such a pig!

344
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:23,405
I hope you burn in hell,
Rusty Cartwright! I hate you!

345
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:24,866
And I'll hate you forever!

346
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:32,814
I think you need more practice.

347
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:35,906
Jell-O shot?

348
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,876
No way, I had Allesandri
last semester, too.

349
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:47,982
So who'd you do the mid-term
heroes project with?

350
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:49,602
That part really blew.

351
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,852
So, at the last second,
the TA tells me I have to write

352
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:55,592
it by myself because of
some new guy that showed up.

353
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:57,275
Weird.

354
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:04,126
I'm sorry, man.
Here, let me help you with that.

355
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,721
- Dude, dude, dude.
- I got it, thanks.

356
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:10,445
- I'll be right back.
- OK. You go get cleaned up.

357
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:13,329
I'll show him where the kitchen is.
Sorry, Casey.

358
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,315
- Hey.
- What's up, Ryan?

359
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,112
Think happy thoughts,
think happy thoughts.

360
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:27,316
Hey, Casey! Casey!

361
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:29,311
Hey.

362
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,188
Hey, you're late.
I was worried.

363
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:41,290
I was grading papers.

364
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:43,258
On a Saturday night?

365
00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:48,275
Now I finally understand
why you like it here.

366
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:50,688
You're like a moose
shy of an Abercrombie ad.

367
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:52,707
No mocking, remember?

368
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,992
I'm kidding. I just...

369
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,959
I don't have a lot in common
with a bunch of fraternity guys.

370
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:59,421
I'm a fraternity guy.

371
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,155
You're a fraternity guy
interested in me. It's different.

372
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:10,597
Damn.

373
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:14,027
Hey, why don't you go get a drink?
Be right back.

374
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:24,660
I didn't know there was
so much to fantasy baseball.

375
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:27,842
Yeah, it's complicated, more
complicated than managing a real team.

376
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:31,022
I spend most weekends
researching triple A shortstops,

377
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:33,313
home/away splits, Obps...

378
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,111
Omega Chi/Lambda Sig boat race.

379
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:37,622
But I was just...
Gonna chicken out?

380
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:41,095
- No way, man. I'm totally in.
- No way!

381
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,106
Great party?

382
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,241
- All right, let's go.
- Go!

383
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,472
Merlot, please?

384
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,886
You know this is a fraternity party.

385
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,017
Michel?

386
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:09,190
- You're...
- Glad you could make it.

387
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:12,962
Evan Chambers, Freshman year,
French 101. You were my TA.

388
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,805
Yeah, of course.

389
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,554
- You don't remember me?
- I'm sorry, not at all.

390
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:21,128
All right. That's all right.
I'm Calvin's big brother,

391
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,324
and just so you know,
I'm OK with it.

392
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,448
With what?

393
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:26,846
My B minus.

394
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,412
French wasn't my thing.

395
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,048
Michel, dude!

396
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,822
The universe
has unreliable taste in men.

397
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,550
How's your approach working?

398
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,967
Six guys'phone numbers, wow.

399
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,089
And I even made out with one of them.

400
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:55,713
Hey! There you are!
I can't remember which one.

401
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,671
A blonde guy, I think.

402
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:01,939
To tell you the truth,
this whole "happy thoughts" thing...

403
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,534
Might be working.

404
00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:08,979
Where's...

405
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:10,746
Kaitlin?

406
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:13,271
We broke up.

407
00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:17,480
Yay universe.

408
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:34,279
Tonight sucks,

409
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,666
and I for one, am not going to trade
in one set of restrictions for another.

410
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:38,859
But we're pledges.

411
00:22:40,231 --> 00:22:42,176
As the daughter of a politician,
let me tell you,

412
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,337
it is better to beg forgiveness

413
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:46,199
than ask permission.

414
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,204
Wait. What are you doing?

415
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,072
I'm going upstairs to slip on
some party clothes...

416
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,880
after I tell our pledge sisters
to meet us at Kappa Tau.

417
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:55,805
Are you coming?

418
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,689
<i>Tina here, again.</i>

419
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,729
<i>Call me back when you have a chance.</i>

420
00:23:07,891 --> 00:23:09,858
<i>Talk to you soon. Bye.</i>

421
00:23:12,596 --> 00:23:15,312
The kegs are floated, man.
What are we gonna do now?

422
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:18,758
As black clouds portend a deathly storm,

423
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:21,457
we are but simple sailors
on a single mission,

424
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,761
to save that which we hold most dear.

425
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:29,019
I think I speak for everyone here.
What are you talking about?

426
00:23:29,197 --> 00:23:31,377
We have no money,
no money means no alcohol,

427
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,985
no alcohol, no party. But,
I have a plan.

428
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,357
- To make money?
- To steal the alcohol and the party.

429
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,214
Fellow adventurers,
it's time for us to implement...

430
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:44,387
The douchebag...

431
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:46,689
... bag.

432
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:48,301
I like it.

433
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:12,232
Good Lord. It's like we died
and went to Gossip Girl.

434
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:14,368
I gotta go to the bathroom.

435
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,780
Didn't I tell everyone to go
before we left?

436
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:19,146
Pee quickly.

437
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,601
That must've been hard. You and Kaitlin
were together for so long.

438
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:28,702
Too long. I know this may sound cheesy,
but I think

439
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:31,079
every relationship has a lifespan.

440
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,203
Once it's over, you can't bring it back.

441
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:36,009
It's not cheesy.
But it's still hard to let go.

442
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:39,844
- Same for you and Chambers?
- Yeah, it's more...

443
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,400
... the story of my life.

444
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,733
It's hard to let go
of old relationships.

445
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:47,325
For us, things just got worse,

446
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:50,324
and before I knew it,
the fat lady was belting out an aria.

447
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:52,058
I didn't know Kaitlin could sing.

448
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,645
- Remind me not to get on your bad side.
- It's very small. I promise.

449
00:24:57,978 --> 00:25:00,045
That was pretty funny.
Kaitlin sing...

450
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:04,024
I'm seeing more of you tonight
than I have... ever.

451
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:07,010
It's just so nice to catch up.

452
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:11,474
Would it be possible to get me a drink?
A beer?

453
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:12,995
Two, please.

454
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:15,785
Light!

455
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,241
What's going on?
You've been buzzing around me all night.

456
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:23,375
You know, I think we don't get to...

457
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:25,783
sort of, you know...

458
00:25:30,123 --> 00:25:34,076
You're stealing the mens for yourself.
That ain't fair, girlfriend.

459
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:40,999
I'm out. You're on your own.

460
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:51,806
I think your little brother
might have just lost it.

461
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:55,653
I think he's a little nervous tonight.

462
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:57,981
First visit to the house with a date.

463
00:25:58,352 --> 00:25:59,771
But, I'll talk with him.

464
00:26:00,203 --> 00:26:03,628
- Are you having a good time?
- Actually I'm having a great time.

465
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:07,480
- How about you?
- Almost too busy to notice.

466
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:14,059
When things kinda calm down,
you wanna have a dance?

467
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:16,547
- Friendly, you know.
- Sure.

468
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:19,142
I'd love to...
dance.

469
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,683
That's it.

470
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:23,624
I'm this way.

471
00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:51,232
I'm sorry about earlier.

472
00:26:51,364 --> 00:26:53,968
- It's kind of hard to explain.
- You don't have to.

473
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:00,349
Who's gonna start the bus?

474
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:05,173
You know. If you're not comfortable
being here, we can always leave.

475
00:27:05,988 --> 00:27:08,826
You made it through the gay
and lesbian film night at the Titan,

476
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:10,663
I think I can get through this.

477
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,651
Maybe I need another drink.

478
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:21,932
- I'll have a...
- Sorry, we're out...

479
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:23,782
of everything.

480
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,521
Refills?

481
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,302
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to buy you a drink.

482
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:45,696
- One's already on order.
- While we're waiting,

483
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,326
I was wondering why no one from
your house is at the KT party tonight.

484
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:52,983
For one, the Omega Chis sent us
an invitation three days ago.

485
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,073
We would've,
but Beaver couldn't find his crayons.

486
00:27:55,193 --> 00:27:58,052
Not to mention you threw yours
together at the last second.

487
00:27:58,172 --> 00:28:00,415
Didn't seem to be a problem
when you wanted us to help you

488
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,879
with the Gatsby party.
Where were the Omega Chis then?

489
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,658
We made our peace with the Omega Chis,

490
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:07,172
Sorry if we seem like
fair weather friends,

491
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,718
but I'm sure we can work
something out with the Kts,

492
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,803
maybe in three weeks,
bring your golf clubs.

493
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,893
Sounds great, as long as you don't make
Rebecca a Sober Sister that night, too.

494
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:18,610
This has nothing to do
with you and Rebecca.

495
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:20,560
It's...

496
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,204
about your problem with Evan,

497
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:26,708
which I can't do anything about.
Don't put me in the middle of your feud.

498
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,424
Feud? What feud?

499
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:42,082
I need to pee.

500
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:46,245
- The line starts down the hall.
- I need to pee now.

501
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:52,550
- Hey, no cuts!
- I have a bladder infection!

502
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:55,863
What's your name?

503
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:02,662
- Your phone's ringing, Rusty.
- This girl I need to break up with.

504
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,297
I love break-ups.

505
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,199
What is she? Relationship, casual date,
random hook-up, booty call?

506
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:10,419
She's a fun buddy.

507
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:15,180
That's an easy one, send her an e-mail.

508
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,550
It's quick, to the point,
personal without being too personal,

509
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,867
easily deleted.

510
00:29:20,556 --> 00:29:21,940
- Really?
- Really.

511
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:23,957
Thank you.

512
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:30,847
Be right back.

513
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:35,692
That's so funny. I was actually
worried about talking with you.

514
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:36,756
Why?

515
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:39,360
We've both always been in relationships,

516
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,865
this may sound a little stalkerish but

517
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:43,937
even when I was dating Kaitlin, I...

518
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:46,650
I always wondered what
it'd be like to date you.

519
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:49,548
And. After so much pressure you didn't

520
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:52,543
want to ruin the fantasy
if reality didn't measure up.

521
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,510
I felt the same way about you.

522
00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:59,543
It's like a Seurat painting, getting
too close is not always a good thing.

523
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,004
But... not tonight?

524
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,107
Tonight...

525
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:06,976
up close

526
00:30:07,543 --> 00:30:08,475
is perfect.

527
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:13,908
Have you seen Michael?

528
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:16,747
I haven't seen him for a while.

529
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:23,100
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

530
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:31,456
I'm sorry if I screwed this up.

531
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:33,166
It's not your fault.

532
00:30:33,308 --> 00:30:34,567
It's mine.

533
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:38,203
What're you going to do now?

534
00:30:39,276 --> 00:30:41,263
I'm, I'm gonna get a drink.

535
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:52,487
We have returned!

536
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:56,827
You look hot.

537
00:30:56,947 --> 00:30:58,817
And you look oddly... clean.

538
00:30:58,952 --> 00:31:01,066
Don't worry, it's only temporary.

539
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:02,865
Can I make you a drink?

540
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,348
I guess I'll see you tomorrow?

541
00:31:22,754 --> 00:31:24,782
I don't know, will you?

542
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:26,881
You've been avoiding me
most of the night.

543
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:29,630
Sorry, I've been busy with pledge stuff.

544
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,881
But, you've been acting like this is
the last place on earth you want to be.

545
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:35,309
I mean, if you're worried
about the guys, don't be.

546
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:37,523
They're not homophobic.

547
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:40,645
Homophobic?

548
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:44,244
I'm not worried about that. Calvin...

549
00:31:44,844 --> 00:31:46,944
I'm the oldest guy in this room.

550
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:48,508
What are you talking about?

551
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:51,982
I was in first grade when you were born.

552
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,955
When I had my first legal drink,

553
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:56,123
you were still in middle school.

554
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:58,600
And now,
I'm in this fraternity party, and...

555
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,490
With someone who is finally old enough
to not care about the differences.

556
00:32:04,343 --> 00:32:06,878
Considering how you ran
around all night,

557
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:09,656
- you have a weird way of showing it.
- I know it.

558
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:13,124
You know, I planned
a much different evening.

559
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:15,707
I was kinda hoping we could talk and

560
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,379
drink, and then,

561
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:21,178
I could sneak you off into
a quiet corner and...

562
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:24,859
Discuss my age issues?

563
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:28,467
I was thinking something
a little more personal.

564
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:03,986
You look,
not so good.

565
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:08,323
I can assure you,
it's nowhere near as bad as I feel.

566
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,000
How's,
Project Reconciliation going?

567
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,336
Thank you.

568
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:17,172
I did my best.

569
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:19,442
You tell her how you feel?

570
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,905
I was far more devious than that.

571
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:27,100
I had Calvin keep guys away
from her so I could make my move.

572
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,834
And how's that working out for you?

573
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,301
Not as well as it did the first time.

574
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,747
Remember Shane?

575
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:40,920
You know why he stood Casey
up after the Mr. Purr-fect contest?

576
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,913
'Cause I paid him to leave her alone.

577
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:46,686
Pretty smart?

578
00:33:48,165 --> 00:33:49,189
Yeah,

579
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,205
brilliant.

580
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:53,394
I distinctly remember you

581
00:33:53,516 --> 00:33:56,333
you telling me to take fate
into my own hands.

582
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,852
Maybe instead of

583
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:07,486
trying to keep all the guys
away from one girl,

584
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:12,290
you should find a girl who thinks
you're the only guy in the room.

585
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:20,526
Guess it's all about timing.

586
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,685
And the right frame of mind.

587
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,239
Yes, totally.

588
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,580
- Steady there.
- I'm Betsy!

589
00:34:31,213 --> 00:34:33,746
Yes you are, and you need to go home.
Did you call Rebecca?

590
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:36,656
Yes, I tried, and I tried, and I tried.

591
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:38,135
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,368
You go home.
I wanna go home.

593
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,971
Hey, you're really cute.

594
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,369
Do you want some of this?

595
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:53,733
It's going straight to voicemail.
Rebecca must've taken off.

596
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:57,823
If you want, I can have some
of my pledges walk her home, or...

597
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,324
Thanks, but,
I need to take care of this.

598
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:03,851
I bet you give really good physicals.

599
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:05,975
- You want some company?
- No,

600
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:07,909
I have to go kill my little sister

601
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,525
and I'm not sure I want you seeing
that side of me yet.

602
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:12,895
But, I'll be back. Promise.

603
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,784
There's no more booze in here anyway.

604
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:18,472
Paging Dr. Prince!

605
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:19,943
Paging Dr. Prince!

606
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:21,706
Rebecca and Mandi went AWOL.

607
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:24,291
Yeah. Come on.

608
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:30,449
It looks like fate might
be on your side after all.

609
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:41,267
"Hi Tina.

610
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,750
How are you?

611
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:44,724
I'm fine.

612
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:52,257
Hey Tina,

613
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:54,750
while I've really enjoyed seeing...

614
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,573
Thank you for the..."

615
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:28,624
President Cartwright!

616
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:30,690
You decided to come
to Kappa Tau after all!

617
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:33,546
Just to make a delivery.
Sober Sister, this is for you.

618
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,644
I'm sorry, I didn't order this.

619
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:39,099
I'm not a this, I'm a she.
Or a her.

620
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:40,663
I'm a she-her.

621
00:36:40,785 --> 00:36:42,895
Not your choice.
You're the Sober Sister,

622
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:45,823
it's your responsibility to take care
of the girls in the house and,

623
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:47,652
I need to get back to the party, so...

624
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,204
I'm not entirely sober, either.

625
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:51,757
Well, all right,

626
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,394
it's only about

627
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:55,588
what's good for the house.

628
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,211
And Betsy.

629
00:36:58,332 --> 00:37:00,980
- And what's good for you, right?
- What's good for me right now

630
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,242
now is this guy I just met at the Omega
Chi party, you screwed that up, too.

631
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:06,732
I'm responsible for
messing up your love life?

632
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,028
You've done it before.

633
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:10,488
- Please!
- Are you allergic to gelatin?

634
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,309
What?

635
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,409
Nothing. It's just something
a lot of us would like to see.

636
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:17,954
Cappie, would you explain to your
girlfriend a pledge is required to do...

637
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:20,912
I think this has nothing to do with me,

638
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:24,397
this is your problem with Rebecca,
which I can't do anything about.

639
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:27,328
So, don't put me in
the middle of your feud.

640
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,409
That's not good.

641
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:41,894
Clean up on aisle three!

642
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:48,539
I'm sorry that I ruined your night.

643
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:51,022
You didn't ruin my night, Rebecca did.

644
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:52,500
You just helped.

645
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:55,830
But I'm afraid this might
be your last party for awhile, Bets.

646
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,348
I need to lay down now.

647
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:04,977
I wasn't sure if you were gonna
come back to the party.

648
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:07,543
I'm sorry about tonight,

649
00:38:07,947 --> 00:38:10,126
the snarky remark
about your ex-girlfriend,

650
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,027
the weirdness with Calvin,
having to leave...

651
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:14,446
Hey. It's OK.

652
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,304
I had a wonderful time.

653
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:18,298
Really?

654
00:38:19,555 --> 00:38:20,717
Without a doubt.

655
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:59,763
What happened to the alcohol?

656
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:01,594
Someone stole it.

657
00:39:02,313 --> 00:39:03,955
I'm pretty sure it was Cappie.

658
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:06,221
And you're not mad?

659
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,723
You know,
it's the funny thing about parties,

660
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,073
you can't predict how
they're gonna turn out.

661
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:14,861
Like relationships.

662
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:19,005
True. But, you know,
the difference is, in the end,

663
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:21,387
parties don't matter.

664
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:31,013
I think we were both right.

665
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:32,429
What do you mean?

666
00:39:33,355 --> 00:39:36,031
I think you can wish
for things to happen, but

667
00:39:36,153 --> 00:39:38,240
ultimately, fate is a numbers game.

668
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,525
Even if you're in on The Secret,
you have to kiss a lot of frogs

669
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,704
before you can find your prince.

670
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:46,969
Well, then that means after tonight,

671
00:39:47,293 --> 00:39:49,137
I'm three frogs closer.

672
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,049
Busy night?

673
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:53,093
I'm closer by one.

674
00:39:54,264 --> 00:39:55,317
You kissed Ryan?

675
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:58,654
Oh my God, what was it like?

676
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,238
Fireworks? Parades?

677
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,001
Disney princess music?

678
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:03,973
He remained a frog.

679
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:07,712
So Ryan Prince is a frog?

680
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:11,255
He tried to catch a fly in my tonsils.

681
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,752
I dated a poker once,
the whole time he was trying to, like,

682
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,800
Jackhammer out my teeth.

683
00:40:22,006 --> 00:40:24,407
I hate the foamers,
the ones with wet mouths?

684
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:26,973
It's like French kissing a St. Bernard.

685
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:30,864
Or the swashbucklers,
back and forth, back and forth.

686
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:34,314
I don't know why someone doesn't
come up with some kissing rules,

687
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:37,516
so when you find the right guy,
there's never a surprise.

688
00:41:10,731 --> 00:41:14,127
If all you wanna do is tell this chick
you're not interested, send her a text.

689
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:16,375
- Really?
- Sure. Beaver, help me out, here.

690
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:20,252
IJWTS,

691
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:23,083
UR, GR8.

692
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:25,027
"I just want to say you are great."

693
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:26,027
Good one.

694
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,755
SLJBF.

695
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:30,929
"So let's just be friends."

696
00:41:34,763 --> 00:41:36,182
You're officially free.

697
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,690
I am. I'm free.

698
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,102
I feel free.

699
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:46,317
Punch?

700
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:50,661
I'm still ticked off you
didn't back me up with Casey.

701
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:52,525
Sure I did.
You're still here, aren't you?

702
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:53,983
That's not the point.

703
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:56,009
Someday you have to make a choice,

704
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:57,810
like if Casey and I were drowning,

705
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,159
which one of us would you save first?

706
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:02,805
Neither, I can't swim.

707
00:42:04,323 --> 00:42:08,073
But, Water Wings aside,
you know what really bothers me? This.

708
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:09,746
This is still Evan's party.

709
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:12,077
Nice, well-behaved, clean.

710
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:15,641
A Kappa Tau affair is usually
screwed up in some sick, depraved way.

711
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,340
But it's huge.
That's what you wanted, right?

712
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,182
Size doesn't matter, well,

713
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,263
I mean, sometimes it does,
but this party it's not right.

714
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,719
That was fast.

715
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:31,890
I don't want to read it.
What did she say?

716
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,944
"Rusty, thanks for letting me know.

717
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,014
By the way, I have crabs."

718
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:42,708
Now this,

719
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:45,652
this is a Kappa Tau party.
Good going, Spitter.

720
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:48,996
Now, leave, and don't come
back for seven to ten days.

721
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:53,688
Crabs?
