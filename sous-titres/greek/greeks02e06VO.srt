1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,714
- <i>Previously on</i> Greek<i>...</i>
- I'm so happy when I'm around you.

2
00:00:02,874 --> 00:00:04,688
And I'm happy
when I'm around you too.

3
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:06,507
You never mentionned
that you knew a KT.

4
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:09,763
Heath... We met during rush.
It's no big deal.

5
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:12,057
Vesuvius is a homecoming legend.

6
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:15,077
It's the party against which
all other parties are judged.

7
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:16,603
Farewell, my sisters!

8
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:20,398
Keep the principles of Zeta Beta Zeta
close to your hearts always.

9
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:24,195
- I'm sure I'm gonna miss Lizzie.
- Really?

10
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,278
Not at all.

11
00:00:25,438 --> 00:00:28,573
We've eyes and ears everywhere.
There won't be any second chances here.

12
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:31,117
We can't desert our sister now.
If Rebecca goes,

13
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:33,119
- I go.
- You're really going agaisnt me?

14
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:36,665
Anyway, I thought I could do
my sister lead duties and offer

15
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:38,416
to relieve your responsabilities.

16
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:41,628
I know what she's doing. She solidifies
her power base among the freshmen.

17
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:43,504
Frannie can't run
for president again.

18
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:46,299
It's against national rules.
She was officially removed.

19
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:47,621
Truce?

20
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:50,387
Friends close, enemies closer?

21
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:52,694
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

22
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:03,478
<i>Verdammt!</i>

23
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,903
What did the Germans do now?

24
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:10,039
I'm sorry.
Part of my RA job

25
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,572
is to plan the resident's
annual Galileo party.

26
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,181
It's this weekend, I've been trying
to find a place for weeks.

27
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:17,260
The Deutsche Hause
was my last hope.

28
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:19,804
I didn't know engineers
had theme parties too.

29
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:22,158
Yeah...
just this one.

30
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:24,513
But, who cares,
it's not important,

31
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:26,953
other things are important.
I'll figure something out.

32
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:29,146
Of course you will,
that's why you're a genius.

33
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:31,010
If you can understand

34
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:34,444
that book, you can plan a party.

35
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:37,767
Wait. Party planner. I'm gonna
put that on my career shortlist.

36
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,398
But you're
an English major.

37
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:40,937
I am, but unlike your major,

38
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:43,414
it doesn't come with
a built-in career path.

39
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:46,234
Everyone speaks English,
which is why,

40
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:49,864
I was thinking, this might serve
as a stepping stone to something else.

41
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:51,517
Like...

42
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,224
- Publishing?
- No!

43
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:56,766
A job at Nationals.

44
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:58,413
I have to go
to this convention.

45
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,624
So I thought if I have to be dragged
away from spending

46
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:04,493
the weekend with you,
which is all I really wanna do,

47
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,142
the least I could do
is make the best of it.

48
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:09,684
Use this weekend
for a little networking.

49
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,493
I have to do something
after graduation.

50
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:15,749
You could do anything...

51
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:17,956
because you're amazing.

52
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:30,916
Once the candy hits the soda,

53
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:32,935
everybody needs to stand back.

54
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:39,829
Waiting will make it
all the sweeter.

55
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:45,960
Ah, good afternoon.

56
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,331
Refreshing mint...

57
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,964
officer?
Sergeant at arms?

58
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:51,239
Commandant?

59
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:53,301
Fire marshal.

60
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:56,888
Just doing the rounds to make sure
all the houses are up to code.

61
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:59,599
We might as well keep moving
because when it comes to codes,

62
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:01,563
the Kappa Taus have them covered.

63
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,394
From Morse to Da Vinci.

64
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,692
There's your first violation,
right there.

65
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,492
There's your second.

66
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:23,655
Greek 206
<i>See you next time sisters</i>

67
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,375
Benj!, Coke, Kasius.

68
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,363
seriessub.com
sub-way.fr

69
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:36,871
Good afternoon, miss.

70
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:39,656
Can I interest you
in a gently used blow-up doll?

71
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:41,854
That's so disgusting.

72
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:44,894
How about a nice throw rug?

73
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:46,687
It's lightly stained,

74
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:49,941
which really just gives it
the nice, antique feel.

75
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:52,735
No... I'm only...

76
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:55,029
Are you in the market for...

77
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:57,059
a wig made of human hair?

78
00:03:57,342 --> 00:04:00,743
I'm on my way to class,
and I just have to use the bathroom.

79
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:05,415
Well, in that case,
it'll be 25 cents, cash only.

80
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:11,733
Dammit!

81
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,910
It's been five hours
and zero sales.

82
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:18,403
What about the Tri-Pi that paid me $3
to shave her initials in my chest?

83
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:19,637
Thank you, pledge.

84
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,081
Let's talk about something
important.

85
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:32,021
Heath, put the beer down.

86
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,902
Beer's for closers only.

87
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:36,070
I said put the beer down!

88
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:38,239
It's ABC.

89
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,026
Always Be Closing.

90
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,668
Now, you've gotta sell,
or you hit the bricks.

91
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:45,872
Or, in this case,
we all hit the bricks!

92
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:48,666
Because that son of a bitch
fire marshal gave us 30 days

93
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,918
to fix all eight of our violations.

94
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,129
And to bring our sprinkler system
to code.

95
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,714
And it's gonna cost us,

96
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:56,215
so we've got to sell.

97
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:00,720
Are we gonna lose the house, Cap?

98
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,226
All we gotta do is raise
six grand really, really, fast.

99
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:17,989
Don't get me wrong,
you look amazing,

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,198
but is that gonna be
comfortable on a plane?

101
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,702
Where did dressing for
comfort ever get anyone?

102
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,121
I dress the way
I want people to see me.

103
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:31,705
Even on a plane. And definitely
when I'm at the ZBZ convention.

104
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,504
You are going to outshine

105
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:36,464
everyone there, anyway.

106
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:41,427
I know.

107
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,015
Evan, I'm not one of those
needy girls who requires

108
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,699
support and encouragement
to prop me up.

109
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,646
But I appreciate the thought.

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,854
We need to go!

111
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:54,756
Don't forget to RSVP to
the Dean's Spring reception.

112
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,901
It's a real honor
we've been invited.

113
00:05:58,463 --> 00:05:59,502
Yes, dear.

114
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:11,399
Who knew there were
so many different shades of pink?

115
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,042
I know! I love it!

116
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,454
- Don't love that.
- What?

117
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,672
How much does it suck
that she got to be here,

118
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,527
just 'cause she's pledge educator.

119
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,692
No sucking. I'm here
to impress Nationals,

120
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:26,373
and since Frannie is
persona non grata with them

121
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:27,622
she can't touch me.

122
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:30,326
Now, where's Tegan?
She's number one on my ass-kissing list.

123
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,872
I'm not leaving this convention
without a summer internship.

124
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,773
And I'm not leaving without
one of those ZBZ beverage cozies.

125
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:37,150
And bookmarks!

126
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:38,555
They're free!

127
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,700
Casey Cartwright?!

128
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,952
As I live and ZB breathe.

129
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:50,705
Come here.

130
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:52,878
I'm so happy to see you!

131
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:55,460
Here, in the folds of sisterhood.

132
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,003
- Hi, Lizzie.
- Wait.

133
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,005
We forgot the secret ZBZ handshake.

134
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:05,123
The registration table
is low on seminar packets.

135
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:06,679
I'm on it, Te Te.

136
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:09,851
Poor Te Te's been spreading herself
thin between Grand Council duties

137
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,189
and the convention.

138
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:14,229
I was hoping to say hi, talk to
her about a summer internship.

139
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,606
But maybe I'll wait until
she's in a better mood.

140
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,928
Good luck with that.

141
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,765
- Mind if I come in?
- Yes?

142
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:30,912
I can't find anywhere to hold
the Galileo party on campus,

143
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,670
so I'm just letting everyone
know it's canceled. I'm sorry.

144
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:39,337
G-darn it! This campus has endless
available locations for undeserving,

145
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:41,663
pervedted students
that want to act inappropriately,

146
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:43,722
but when a group of elite academics

147
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,469
want to blow off some steam,
while debunking Aristotelian physics,

148
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:48,830
everything's booked up?
I call bull-hinky.

149
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,933
Nobody wants to let us drop
objects off the roof. Liability.

150
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:54,420
Did you tell them
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

151
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,479
didn't have a problem
with Galileo doing that?

152
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,981
- No.
- Well, nice negotiating skills.

153
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:01,317
I know who'd let us drop
things off the roof.

154
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:04,403
The Kappa Taus. We need
the money to fix our sprinkler system.

155
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:07,240
Rusty, I don't think Galileo
Galilei would approve

156
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,243
of his theories being evoked in such
an unsanitary environment.

157
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,953
Galileo lived during the Renaissance.
People avoided bathing for fear

158
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:16,963
it'd wash away their spirits,
so cleanliness wasn't really a priority.

159
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,670
Unsanitary environment would add an air
of authenticity to the proceedings.

160
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,647
Know what? I'm not gonna shower
till after the party to keep it real.

161
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,677
- 'Cause that's science.
- What do you think?

162
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,262
I think you should shower.

163
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:33,307
Kappa Tau? Great idea,
considering we have no other options.

164
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,529
Oh, yeah. I'm gettin' there.

165
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,209
I'm sorry, Madam President.

166
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:01,607
It's OK, Lizzie.

167
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,754
OK. Thank you.

168
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,489
Greetings, sisters.

169
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:08,718
My name is Mary-Beth Gentrie-Manning,
and I am proud

170
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:11,929
to call myself Grand National President
of Zeta Beta Zeta.

171
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:14,557
Greetings Madam President.

172
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:18,184
Please stand for the processional
of the Grand Council.

173
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:21,355
<i>Over the years I sing</i>

174
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,407
The first processional
occurred in 1876,

175
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:26,444
as a way to honor
the nation's centennial.

176
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:29,087
Someone even played a fife.
Isn't that awesome?

177
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,490
And scary, that you know that.

178
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:35,550
I read about it in Zeta Beta Zeta:
A History in Words and Pictures.

179
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,748
Ever since I became a tour guide,
I have a new appreciation for history.

180
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:41,174
Like... Mary-Beth Gentrie-Manning.

181
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:44,055
She grew up next door
to Katie Couric's mom.

182
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:47,210
See? History, so juicy.

183
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,304
Of course, we're here today

184
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:56,057
to feel that unique magic
that is sisterhood.

185
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,142
We can feel it in the warmth

186
00:09:58,302 --> 00:09:59,894
of a ZBZ smile that greet us

187
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:02,063
after a long day
of traveling to get here.

188
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,399
From as far away
as California or Phoenix.

189
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:11,364
But that special ZBZ magic
expresses itself elsewhere too.

190
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,908
In our National by-laws. And so...

191
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:17,514
At every convention,
we open up the floor to our sisters.

192
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:19,705
To offer an open forum
to any sister

193
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:22,625
who wants to
suggest legislative change.

194
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,863
I formally propose
that we change the official ZBZ anthem

195
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:31,300
from <i>Our sisters, ourselves,</i>

196
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,302
to <i>Oh, sister, my sister.</i>

197
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,605
Sit down!

198
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,682
Our current anthem
belongs in a funeral

199
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:39,350
and I, for one, am not dead yet.

200
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:41,060
Proposal duly noted.

201
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:47,316
And, once again,
I beg you all to reconsider

202
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,318
the shamefully
superficial rush

203
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,254
standards that our chapters use.

204
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,439
Instead of the prettiest girls
with the best clothes,

205
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,032
we should aim
for inner beauty.

206
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:57,743
Duly noted, again, Regina.
Thank you.

207
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:01,707
Any other proposals?

208
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,036
I have one.

209
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:07,962
I move to overturn

210
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:11,299
rule 16-A, which states
that removal from office

211
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,427
precludes the removed party
from ever seeking that office again.

212
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,601
I can't believe this!

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,532
I know!

214
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:24,895
<i>Our Sisters, ourselves</i>

215
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,644
has been the ZBZ anthem
for over a hundred years!

216
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:34,502
You created me.

217
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,958
You can destroy me.
Is that the game we're playing?

218
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,254
No game, Case, it's simple.

219
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:40,743
I want to be president again.

220
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:42,788
I think I deserve to be
and you don't,

221
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:45,470
if you're this clueless
about how the system works.

222
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,588
Clueless? Please.
I know you can introduce

223
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,796
whatever legislation you want,
but it's a battle to get it passed.

224
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,040
That legislation will get passed
over my dead, cute, body!

225
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,699
Is it an uphill battle
to get legislation passed?

226
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,310
Is it? I need to know
because I just said that it was.

227
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:05,567
What, Casey?

228
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,855
I need to stop Frannie
from getting that ban overturned.

229
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,524
I cannot face that
barracuda in an election.

230
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,865
She taught me everything I know,
she probably held back

231
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:14,278
the good stuff for herself.

232
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,905
Get a hold of yourself!

233
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm sorry. I know better than
to handle a sister roughly.

234
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,397
It's just, I sat Miss Eastern Ohio'65
next to Miss Eastern Ohio'67

235
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:25,790
during the processional.
Well, who knew

236
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,956
that'67 slept with'65's husband
at the'69 pageant?

237
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:31,008
Not me!

238
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:33,502
I'm no help to Te Te
unless I anticipate.

239
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,174
Bad Lizzi, bad!

240
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,244
I'm afraid there's
only so much you can do.

241
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:41,363
Grand Council votes
on every proposed amendment

242
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:43,695
at the end of the convention
in a closed-door session.

243
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:46,863
So, if four out of the seven members
vote to overturn the ban,

244
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:47,997
it's a done deal.

245
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,524
I have got two days to convince
the council to vote against Frannie?

246
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:53,275
It'll take some serious lobbying.

247
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:56,862
Go ZBZ!

248
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:11,804
Hey, guys.

249
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:12,995
Great news.

250
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:16,173
We don't need to do the repairs
ourselves. My dorm will pay us

251
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,178
to have our annual Galileo party
here this weekend.

252
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,845
- Really?
- My RA, Max

253
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,805
is in charge.
He's completely on board.

254
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:24,796
And you'll finally get to
hang out with him,

255
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:26,725
- he's so cool.
- Yeah, well,

256
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:29,228
Honors engineering
is the very definition of cool.

257
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:31,272
And that's just the beginning.

258
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:34,775
We keep renting out the house for party
until we have everything paid off.

259
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,194
So...

260
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,946
we'd be an event hall of sorts.

261
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,449
We can host weddings.

262
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:44,988
I can get ordained on-line,
it'd be a one-stop shop.

263
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,247
Kappa Tau: Party Palace
and Chapel of Love,

264
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:50,916
- featuring Father Cappie.
- How cool is that?

265
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,494
Getting paid to do
something we love.

266
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:55,670
It'd be like getting paid
to have sex!

267
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,382
What are hookers
complaing about?

268
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,509
Just keep in mind, guys,
this will not be

269
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,816
a Kappa Tau party
tomorrow night, though.

270
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:06,360
These are honors engineers.
No booze, no hot chicks.

271
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,146
- Just robots.
- Listen.

272
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:12,395
Even if it's the lamest party
in the history of the Kappa Tau house,

273
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:14,482
at least there will still be
a KT house.

274
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:24,681
I didn't know
you were teaching this seminar.

275
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:27,661
Planning your will at 21, huh?

276
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:30,170
- I'm a planner.
- What do you want?

277
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,438
Now that you mention it,
I did want to make sure

278
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:37,031
I'd have your support
in voting against Frannie's motion.

279
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:39,214
You{\ of all people} know
how damaging Frannie's leadership

280
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,217
- was to the chapter.
- It certainly was

281
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:45,222
I also know how damaging it was
to my authority, not to mention my ego,

282
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,681
when you publicly defied me
during Greek Week.

283
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:51,980
That was an unfortunate situation.
I'm sure you'll agree that...

284
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,372
Frannie is the one
who called to warn me

285
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:56,896
about Rebecca's Greek Week behavior
in the first place.

286
00:14:57,369 --> 00:15:00,277
- Frannie was your eyes and ears?
- It's quid pro quo, Casey.

287
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,122
Frannie demonstrated that she has
Nationals' best interest in mind.

288
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:08,000
Someone like that deserves another shot.
So she gets my vote.

289
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:20,339
I am glad you called.

290
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,689
Frannie's gone and, I don't know...

291
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:26,637
For some reason
I just really needed guys' night out.

292
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:29,938
I just came back
from playing Pictionary with Michael

293
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,184
and his grad friends
for three hours straight.

294
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,657
Don't you think it's a little early
for you guys to start acting like

295
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,650
an old, married couple?

296
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:43,779
The highlight was someone drew a cupcake
that looked like a giant boob.

297
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,435
Everyone started laughing.

298
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:47,530
Grad students are repressed.

299
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,964
Never underestimate
the power of a boob.

300
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,735
Come here.

301
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,249
Speaking of which, do you know her?

302
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,753
She's waving for us to go over
to her table. What do you think?

303
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:02,638
I think I'm gay,
and I think you have a girlfriend.

304
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:05,551
It's harmless flirting.
Not like anything's gonna happen.

305
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,084
What do you say?
Too late...

306
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:13,566
- Mind if we join you?
- You owe me one.

307
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,882
Make sure you keep that receipt.
It's on the nerds.

308
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:25,002
Got it.

309
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,615
Who shows up to a party at seven?

310
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,161
How nice and odd of you
to bring your own fruit punch.

311
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:34,663
- And a ladle.
- And a ladle.

312
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,831
At this rate, we'll be done in time
to have our own party

313
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:41,356
to celebrate our first customers!

314
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,716
I recognize that guy
from Casino Night.

315
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:48,322
Cappie, this is Max.
Ben Bennet, Max.

316
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:52,226
You might want to move
some of this furniture out of here.

317
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,558
We should move
some of this furniture out of here.

318
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:57,135
- Is there an echo in here?
- Unlikely.

319
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:01,442
Anyway,
I wouldn't worry about the furniture.

320
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,666
- This is Kappa Tau.
- I'm sorry?

321
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:06,028
Surely our reputation precedes us.

322
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:11,089
Your honors engineers are no match
for our parties or our furniture. Right?

323
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,369
Don't say I didn't warn you.
If things go wrong,

324
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,954
you can defend us
to the Holy Roman Tribunal.

325
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:23,629
Galileo had to defend
his heretical teachings to the Pope.

326
00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:26,131
This is the Galileo party.

327
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:29,920
So where'd Spitter come from?

328
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,510
That's just something I call him.
It's a nickname.

329
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:35,468
Nice to meet you.

330
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:37,685
Nice to meet you.

331
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,785
What a complete douche.

332
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,741
This party isn't bad.

333
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,053
Even Beav found a cute girl.

334
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:11,876
Yes, but come on,

335
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:14,997
she looks like she's late
for a hobbit wedding.

336
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:18,767
She's still pretty hot.

337
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,641
Gravity!

338
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,415
- These guys are sensitive to sugar.
- It's not sugar.

339
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:26,039
It's ADJ.

340
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:31,666
- Spitter? Translation?
- The punch? Aerosol Death Juice.

341
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:34,449
Homemade from
a special fermentation process

342
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:36,526
developed by some
of our chemical engineers

343
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:38,786
to maximize efficient inebriation.

344
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:42,061
- Translation. The punch...
- No translation needed.

345
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:44,334
So it's like a wine spritzer of sorts?

346
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:48,244
Well, if it becomes need be,
the KTs have a fool proof hangover cure

347
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:50,826
developed by some
of our chemical dependents

348
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:53,635
- that cuts headache duration in half.
- Won't need that.

349
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:57,204
Max already has one
that completely eliminates headaches.

350
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:05,898
I may have underestimated these KTs.

351
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,176
It was pretty nice of them
to provide

352
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:11,033
a nonalcoholic beverage option
for us teetotalers. Right?

353
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:13,197
And this...

354
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,759
This punch is really thirst-quenching...
too, I find.

355
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:20,042
It's funny,

356
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:24,613
I thought I was gettin' a sore throat,
but now I just feel kinda tingly.

357
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,293
All over.

358
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,077
Should we make out?

359
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:46,939
And now, sisters,

360
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:51,885
please open to page 37
of your song-book,

361
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:55,906
and join me in the ZBZ
friendship song:

362
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:58,867
Appreciate the Pink.

363
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,898
I have a great idea.

364
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:14,810
If you'll guarantee me
your support in tomorrow's Council vote,

365
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,159
I will personally bring
CRU's top ten ZBZ sisters

366
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,514
to your alma mater
to act as Rush coaches.

367
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:23,889
Dear, that sounds wonderful.
You have my vote.

368
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,093
Great! Now, will you excuse me?

369
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:46,081
Let me get that for you.

370
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:49,001
- Thanks.
- Hi. I'm Paula.

371
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,574
- Working the room, I see.
- Only way to get things done.

372
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:56,757
It is indeed.

373
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:59,259
I'll leave you to it.

374
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:07,203
I wouldn't waste your time on Bunchie.
She just promised me her vote.

375
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,606
My whole redemption spiel really
resonated with her as a born-again.

376
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:13,942
- Hallelujah.
- That makes three for me...

377
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,653
- And three for me.
- And only Tegan uncommitted.

378
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:19,836
So I've gotta say...
I'm liking my odds.

379
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,534
Now, let's wrap this up

380
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:26,363
with the Sisterhood solidarity song:

381
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:30,500
I Will Never Betray My Dear Sister.

382
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:40,093
I told him not to cut it too short,
but he didn't listen.

383
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:42,804
I think it makes my face look fat.

384
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:45,717
Are you kidding?
No, you look great.

385
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:46,919
Really?

386
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:48,976
You are so sweet.

387
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:51,855
- And you look pretty great yourself.
- Thank you.

388
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,611
So, what's your major, Brianna?

389
00:21:58,855 --> 00:22:01,223
I'm Brianna.
She's Alanna.

390
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,857
She's Alanna, and she's Brianna.

391
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:06,399
I'm Brianna, and she's Alanna.

392
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:10,913
We're gonna go to the bathroom.

393
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:18,753
So Brianna

394
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:23,053
has invited me to go back to her place.
You mind if we take off?

395
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:25,972
Hold on, man,
what happened to harmless flirting?

396
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:29,168
Since when did you become
a Frannie champion?

397
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:31,188
Man, she's in Orlando.

398
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,231
So what she doesn't know
won't hurt her.

399
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:38,668
We're in college.

400
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:43,125
This is the one chance we have
to follow our impulses,

401
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:46,284
and we can do whatever we want
and get away with it.

402
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:49,802
College is about sowing wild oats.

403
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:52,543
Not Pictionary

404
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:55,766
and the Dean's receptions.

405
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:59,756
- The Dean's what?
- Never mind.

406
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:19,737
We're done, Cap.

407
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:22,756
- This is nothing.
- Fame isn't worth it.

408
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,603
Come on, you rule, man. Come on.

409
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:29,585
Pledge, will you get the nerd off the
guys. I'm gonna handle things inside.

410
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:34,188
How are they playing pool again?

411
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,582
I confiscated all the cues.

412
00:23:37,836 --> 00:23:39,421
It's like they're Gremlins!

413
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:55,705
- Say my name in Elvish again?
- Saralonde.

414
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:01,769
- I think I'm falling in love with you.
- Le melon.

415
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,148
Hey! What are you...?

416
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,110
Get out of here!

417
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,169
What are you, animals?

418
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,706
Here, Heath.

419
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,331
Take this and destroy it.

420
00:24:23,598 --> 00:24:26,341
Take Jeremy upstairs.
Guard his tresses with your life.

421
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,780
I'm shutting this party down.

422
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,713
Who knew this would be
a legendary Kappa Tau party after all?

423
00:24:36,304 --> 00:24:39,707
The Kappa Tau house is a respectable
establishment. Full of individuals

424
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:42,357
who know how to hold their liquor,
or at the very least

425
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:44,861
how to dispose of it
in the proper manner!

426
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:48,087
I'm sorry.
It does tend to get out of hand.

427
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:50,282
That's why we couldn't find
a place to hold it.

428
00:24:50,563 --> 00:24:53,787
You know that lecture hall in the
Fine Arts building that was condemned?

429
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:54,829
That was us.

430
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:59,334
It was an unfortunate incident
with a genetically-modified raccoon.

431
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:02,295
It would have been nice to have
that information in advance.

432
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:04,993
Since when does a party getting out
of hand bother you?

433
00:25:05,113 --> 00:25:09,010
I heard you were the biggest partier{\ around}.
Casey said that's why you guys broke up.

434
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,003
- Casey? What do you know about Casey?
- She's my...

435
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:17,144
We're dating.

436
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:29,586
Your gal, Casey,
knows of what she speaks.

437
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,955
I don't know what got into me.

438
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:42,085
Yes, Lizzi, I did tell you to cancel
the Household Etiquette seminar,

439
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,961
but if you had been smarter,

440
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:46,992
you'd have anticipated
that I would change my mind.

441
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:49,961
And don't call me Tete.

442
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,371
Hi, Casey. What's new?

443
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:58,527
And I say new because
it can't possibly be that you're

444
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:00,784
eating the dead by-law horse again.

445
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:03,516
Actually, I had a few ideas
for how to help you.

446
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:05,400
Quid pro quo, remember?

447
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:08,824
I can organize a recruiting drive
for flailing houses.

448
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,355
- Hold a philanthropy...
- That is adorable.

449
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:13,335
You must be great in Rush skits.

450
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:17,211
But seriously, hon, you're not going
to be able to find a quid for my quo.

451
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:22,858
I take that back.

452
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:27,552
If you can fulfill my wildest fantasy,
and get rid of Lizzi,

453
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:29,424
you've got yourself a deal.

454
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:31,709
Get rid of Lizie?

455
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,297
Convince that elfin little pipsqueak
to hit the road.

456
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:35,687
You want me to...

457
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,765
get Lizzi to quit?

458
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:41,144
Well, I can't fire her.
Her record is spotless.

459
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:44,457
She's a "paragon of sisterly spirit."

460
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:47,965
But I also cannot stand
her constant effervescence

461
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:49,339
and springy hair and...

462
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:52,587
And I did not give you permission
to call me by a nickname.

463
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,367
So there you have it.

464
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,827
You perform that miracle,

465
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:00,538
and there might be a summer
internship in it for you.

466
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,577
Gravity!

467
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:24,375
I don't get it, man.

468
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:27,891
This is... this is just wrong.

469
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:30,067
Those two just
don't belong together.

470
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,205
Men and nipples?
Why?

471
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,534
It's not like milk
comes out of them.

472
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:40,139
Actually, some male infants

473
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,675
have been known to excrete
their mother's milk

474
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,482
from their own nipples.

475
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,462
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

476
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,549
You're insane, Chip.

477
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:54,050
It's Dale.

478
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:56,072
Right. Knew it was one of them.

479
00:27:57,386 --> 00:28:00,598
Hey, so what's the deal
with this Max guy?

480
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:01,785
Dude sucks.

481
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:03,526
I'm... Hi, I'm...

482
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,574
Gluteus Maximus,

483
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:08,936
I'm socially awkward,
and I walk with my left foot

484
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,561
turned slightly out
'cause I'm weird.

485
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:12,902
I know!

486
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,654
Hello, guv!

487
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:18,283
I'm Maxi Pad, the kind with
wings because I was in NASA.

488
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:21,580
Too bad I couldn't solve Fermat's
Theorem with a gun to me head.

489
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,340
- Cheerio!
- Cheerio!

490
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:26,085
Maxi Pad?!

491
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,589
Oh, you're too much.

492
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:33,316
- How'd you come up with that?!
- Aw, man, that's just how I roll.

493
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,710
How come we've never hung out?

494
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,501
- I don't know.
- You're awesome.

495
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,828
- I know.
- We should be best friends.

496
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,132
You know what?
We are best friends.

497
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:43,391
Cap'n'Dale.

498
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:48,867
These pants make
my bottom itch.

499
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:50,313
Maxi Pad...

500
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,008
I'm just gonna lay down
for a minute.

501
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:57,414
Bring it in.

502
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,171
- Glass of chardonnay.
- Thank you.

503
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,199
You must be really
stressed out.

504
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:10,506
I'm...

505
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:11,926
I'm weary.

506
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:16,018
This year alone, I've
consulted at 20 chapters,

507
00:29:16,138 --> 00:29:17,759
colonized 20 new ones,

508
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,731
and I, personally, shepherded
three sisters into rehab, one

509
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:24,191
at the expense of
my Tercel's upholstery.

510
00:29:26,202 --> 00:29:28,321
Do you think Tegan
appreciates it?

511
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,522
- Here's your drink.
- Thanks.

512
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:36,493
Lizzi, I hate to
see you like this.

513
00:29:36,613 --> 00:29:39,650
Your natural effervescence
is one of your most winning qualities.

514
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,657
What a shame to have it
so cruelly squelched.

515
00:29:41,818 --> 00:29:42,729
I know.

516
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:46,329
I used to love this job,

517
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:47,970
but now...

518
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,041
You think, maybe, you should {\just}quit?

519
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,122
Quit?

520
00:29:52,366 --> 00:29:53,503
ZBZ is my life.

521
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:55,046
Oh, I know.

522
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:56,809
But...

523
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:58,595
is it a happy life?

524
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,828
Life is short, Lizzie.

525
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:03,823
You're a talented,

526
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:06,887
young-ish woman
with a lot to offer,

527
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,054
and you deserve to work for someone

528
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,641
who appreciates you.

529
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,174
Not some awful wench who

530
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:15,370
badmouths you to everyone

531
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,199
about using ivory dinner plates
instead of cream.

532
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:21,680
She does that?

533
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,028
She did.

534
00:30:33,184 --> 00:30:34,332
Thank you, Casey.

535
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,212
I'm gonna go.

536
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:39,892
And I'm going to tell Tegan exactly
where to stick her ZBZ letters.

537
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:44,012
Ivory and cream
are the same damn color!

538
00:30:59,188 --> 00:31:00,571
I'm kind of busy here, Rus.

539
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,292
Sorry, it's an emergency.

540
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:04,139
Have you seen my roommate?

541
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,146
I'm worried about him.
Dark hair. Glasses.

542
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:09,267
Members Only jacket.

543
00:31:09,387 --> 00:31:11,204
Your roommate? He's nuts.

544
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:15,502
Last time I saw him, he was talking
to himself in a mirror.

545
00:31:15,662 --> 00:31:18,254
Then he started
making out with a pillow.

546
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:19,913
Go away.

547
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:29,287
Has anyone seen Dale?

548
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,390
Has anyone seen my pants?

549
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:36,244
They're like

550
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:40,404
They're like jeans, but they're
made of something else. It's like...

551
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:42,390
Hey, dude, what's up?

552
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:44,023
You look awful.

553
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:50,872
- You've been avoiding me.
- Where's Dale?

554
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:53,242
Not here.
We're all alone.

555
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,406
What's going on?
What's up?

556
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,441
I might ask the same of you.

557
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,046
Tell me,

558
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:01,589
is the rumor true?

559
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:03,841
- What rumor?
- In a blind taste test,

560
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:07,136
do the Cartwright kids prefer
Maxwell House over Folger's?

561
00:32:07,256 --> 00:32:09,582
When I say Maxwell House,
I mean Max.

562
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:12,225
And when I say Folger's,
I mean Cappie.

563
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,018
Oh, my God.

564
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:16,271
Are you jealous of Max?

565
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,502
Only of his fresh-roasted aroma.

566
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:34,958
Can we go?
I'm feeling skitted-out.

567
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:39,030
But the class of'79 is next!
You'll miss Saturday Night ZBZ-ver!

568
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:43,303
I don't know how you did it,
but nice going.

569
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:44,877
You got my vote.

570
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:49,946
I think I'm ready
to call it a night.

571
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:52,398
And miss the cutting
of the Kitty Kat Cake?

572
00:32:52,518 --> 00:32:55,823
Ever since 1932, when flour was
hard to come by during the Depression...

573
00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:57,504
'Night, Ash.

574
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:02,858
So, let me guess,

575
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:04,713
getting things done again?

576
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:05,833
It's done.

577
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:08,905
- You don't sound too happy.
- Really?

578
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:12,577
- I thought I was so good at faking it.
- I'm not good at faking it either.

579
00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:15,371
This morning Mary Beth
Gentrie-Manning

580
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:18,162
caught me rolling my eyes at
the breakfast proclamation.

581
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:20,627
I'm probably on
some kind of list now.

582
00:33:21,177 --> 00:33:23,200
Me too.
The bad sisters list.

583
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,597
I guess there's always
something to compromise

584
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:27,946
- when you going after what you want.
- That's true.

585
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:30,050
I remember when
I was president of my chapter.

586
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,618
Having served that vaunted
post, just like you, my dear,

587
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,641
I know all about compromise.

588
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:38,067
Back in the day, I had a friend
who rushed ZBZ when I was president.

589
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:40,136
She was a nice girl, smart.

590
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:43,744
But not exactly
"ZBZ material," as we say.

591
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:46,456
But since she was
an old friend, I...

592
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:49,650
Realized that loyalty and
integrity were more important

593
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,949
than the image of the house,
so you let her in.

594
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:53,617
I blackballed her.

595
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,798
- I didn't see that coming.
- Neither did she.

596
00:33:57,918 --> 00:33:59,643
She never spoke to me again.

597
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:02,699
And you can bet I'd rather
look back on myself

598
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:04,710
the way you just
described me.

599
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,582
As someone with
loyalty and integrity.

600
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:12,303
Not to mention someone with the balls
to stand up for her friend.

601
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:14,051
But that's hard.

602
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,818
Especially when you're young.

603
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:21,267
So I have the energy to fight.

604
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:23,955
It's just better to
fight smart, right?

605
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,234
Why confront something head on

606
00:34:26,354 --> 00:34:28,099
when you can work around it?

607
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,146
- Play it safe?
- Playing it safe is

608
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:31,847
what you do
when you're afraid.

609
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:34,818
Let me tell you something else
I wish I'd known when I was young...

610
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:37,745
There are very few things
worth being afraid of.

611
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:50,424
- What?
- They killed her, Cap.

612
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:51,722
Killed who?

613
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:55,673
Vesuvius.

614
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:02,710
It's not fair. She was so strong.
And now,

615
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:04,902
thanks to them,

616
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:06,669
she's dead.

617
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:09,126
Come here, I know...

618
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,611
I know.

619
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,552
Where's the front door?

620
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:16,537
Probably rotting in
the ground with Vesuvius.

621
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:19,536
Yep, I know.

622
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:23,458
Man, I'm really sorry, guys.

623
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:26,608
- You OK?

624
00:35:27,263 --> 00:35:28,173
It's OK.

625
00:35:30,749 --> 00:35:31,706
Well,

626
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:34,136
so much for Kappa Tau,

627
00:35:34,256 --> 00:35:36,322
Party Palace and
Chapel of Love.

628
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,551
Hey, Rus?

629
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:46,998
I'm a little
disoriented right now.

630
00:35:47,118 --> 00:35:48,732
Know what happened
to my clothes?

631
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:50,658
Or why I woke up with this?

632
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:56,009
Uh, you took a little too much
sore throat medicine last night, Dale.

633
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:57,989
It made you
feel a little woozy.

634
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:00,692
Oh, well, I would've preferred
that you walked me home.

635
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,146
Next time.

636
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:15,158
Buttmunch

637
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:26,461
Does anyone know
whose pants these are?

638
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:32,206
'Cause they're really
making my bottom itch.

639
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:38,924
That party
was out of control.

640
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,502
But the craziest thing was

641
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:43,120
you showing up afterwards.

642
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:47,386
Yeah, I plead temporary
insanity on that one.

643
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:50,740
So you wish you
hadn't come over?

644
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,108
No! I'm glad I did.

645
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:56,978
So, uh, what now?

646
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:02,319
I don't know.

647
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:06,367
All I know is I'm in college,
and I like to have fun,

648
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:08,539
and I have fun with you.

649
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,441
But what about Michael?

650
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,686
Open up, open up,
open up!

651
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,040
Casey!

652
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:23,494
Oh, you came to say goodbye!
That's so sweet!

653
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:25,784
No! I came to say,
"Stop packing."

654
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:28,416
Stop packing and
stop being afraid.

655
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:33,129
It's time you and I
faced things head on. Ash?

656
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:35,849
It's time to get serious.

657
00:37:36,977 --> 00:37:38,939
And it starts with the hair.

658
00:37:47,736 --> 00:37:48,704
So...

659
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,533
How was last night?

660
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:52,604
Oh, that.

661
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:54,358
Yeah, nothing happened.

662
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,330
Really?

663
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,695
Nothing with Brianna?

664
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:01,741
No. I walked her home, and
then went back to the house.

665
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:05,497
Wait. So you
didn't cheat on Frannie?

666
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,650
You know, I figure
when you cheat on someone,

667
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,101
you're just giving them
a reason to dump you.

668
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:15,075
And I still find
Frannie intriguing.

669
00:38:16,638 --> 00:38:19,456
Not ready for her to dump
me yet. Know what I mean?

670
00:38:19,938 --> 00:38:20,906
I guess.

671
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:29,663
I don't know if i can do this.

672
00:38:29,783 --> 00:38:32,605
I'm not the kind of girls who disturbs
when it says do not.

673
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:35,995
You perfectly coiffed. And rock on
some seriously imposing lips.

674
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:38,813
Now, you go in there
and tell Tegan you're not quitting

675
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:42,280
And from now on, she needs to treat you
the way you deserve to be treated.

676
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:46,545
But if i stay, you lose Tegan's vote,
and Frannie gonna get her way.

677
00:38:47,396 --> 00:38:49,330
I'm not afraid anymore, Lizzi.

678
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,083
Now, you get in there
and start disturbing!

679
00:38:57,522 --> 00:38:58,897
Sorry, sister.

680
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:02,239
Freezi?

681
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:05,451
I didn't give you permission
to call me by a nickname.

682
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:09,475
And i am not going anywhere,
Te-Te!

683
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,396
What do you so smiley about?

684
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:23,415
Sometimes, people smile
when they're happy.

685
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:26,966
By happy, do you mean deluded?

686
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:29,912
Because my sources assure me
that i got this vote locked up.

687
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:31,539
Four to three.

688
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:34,112
Yes, this vote, you do.

689
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,815
But the only vote i care about
is for President

690
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:40,047
and i am happy to have you challenge
me for that, fair and square.

691
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:44,135
Because i can not wait
to kick your ass.

692
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,606
Murderers.

693
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,577
- I don't know if you're welcome here.
- We came to help.

694
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,689
These guys invented a DVR
that detects and records

695
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,476
any pornography playing
anywhere in the world.

696
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:16,933
First you trash our house,
now you're bragging?

697
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:18,586
That's just bad form.

698
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:21,921
I'm just saying

699
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,509
they're geniuses. They can help
get the house back into shape.

700
00:40:25,669 --> 00:40:28,471
Even fix your sprinkler system
and the other violations.

701
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:33,168
I brought you some of my
patented hangover cure.

702
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:34,852
It actually is patented.

703
00:40:35,714 --> 00:40:36,771
Thank you.

704
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:39,928
OK, let's...

705
00:40:40,048 --> 00:40:41,233
You guys...

706
00:40:42,078 --> 00:40:43,569
Looks like we're home free.

707
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:45,286
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

708
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:46,947
Thanks to SuperMax.

709
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,628
We would've figured
something else out on our own.

710
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:07,317
But I have this other

711
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,929
problem that I wanted
to ask you about.

712
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:12,050
Why don't you
just go ask Max?

713
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,394
Max would never be good at this.
He's no good with girl problems.

714
00:41:16,817 --> 00:41:19,298
Girl problems? I'm
great with girl problems.

715
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,606
Causing them.
Complicating them further.

716
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:23,741
Solving them.
Hit me. Come on.

717
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:28,098
There's this girl
in my Literature class.

718
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:31,285
Her name's...
Miley.

719
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:34,627
- Miley Montana.
- Sounds familiar.

720
00:41:34,747 --> 00:41:36,663
She acts one way during the day,

721
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:39,660
but then she's totally
different during the night.

722
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:41,794
I'm so confused.

723
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:49,593
Let me tell you about
this girl I met freshmen year.

724
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:52,270
Oh, Nina. You better
not lose my email.

725
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,424
I will totally be there for
your 30th anniversary party.

726
00:41:57,997 --> 00:42:01,159
You are looking much more chipper
than the last time I saw you.

727
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:04,275
I am chipper, thanks.
And thanks for the advice.

728
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,400
I really enjoyed
meeting you, Casey.

729
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,620
You strike me as a young woman
with a lot of potential.

730
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,355
That's my contact information.

731
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:14,462
If you find yourself
in my neck of the woods,

732
00:42:14,582 --> 00:42:17,176
- give me a call. You got that?
- Thank you.

733
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:20,082
OK, ladies. Chins out, and down.

734
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:22,433
Bodies three-quarters-turned.

735
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:27,442
- Excellent!
- Paula Baker.

736
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:29,326
Why does that sound familiar?

737
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,144
Paula Baker.
One of our most illustrious sisters.

738
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,513
Ten-term Congresswoman from
Maryland's 43rd district.

739
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:38,636
Currently serving on the
House Appropriations Committee.

740
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,131
I know.
I told you history's fun.

741
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:45,023
So is politics.

742
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,028
Maybe I shouldn't be limiting
myself to just the sorority kind.

743
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,854
OK, girls,
this is it!

744
00:42:53,094 --> 00:42:54,991
Big smiles all around.

745
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,536
See you next time sisters!
