1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:01,393
Previously on Greek:

2
00:00:01,518 --> 00:00:03,626
I'm saying I don't want
to throw down with you.

3
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:05,207
- Which means?
- Don't remember?

4
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:07,242
Maybe I hit you too hard
with the pledge paddle.

5
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:09,939
You hit me from
behind and ambushed me.

6
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:11,388
That's pretty pathetic.

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,250
I'm staring out
into the vast, empty ocean

8
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:17,312
that is my future.

9
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:21,073
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- It does. And it feels, terrifying.

10
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:23,860
I'm so happy when I'm around you.

11
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:25,944
And I'm happy when
I'm around you, too.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,365
Casey, what do you know about Casey?

13
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:29,848
We're dating.

14
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:31,701
Good seeing you.

15
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,295
What a douche.

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,672
Our new ZBZ president is Ashleigh.

17
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:36,838
What?

18
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:38,355
Calvin Owens!

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,585
Hell Week, buddy! Let's go!

20
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:41,738
Awkward.

21
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:44,005
Welcome to Hell Week.
Your ass is mine.

22
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,839
Get him outta here!

23
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:51,137
Don't worry about
these love handles.

24
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:53,733
- What love handles?
- Pledge frolicking session in five,

25
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:55,974
those puppies
will melt right off, big guy.

26
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,300
Remember, you may leave for class,

27
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,439
but you go straight there and back.

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,533
No stopping for eating

29
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:05,687
or sleeping or socializing.

30
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,593
Your souls

31
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:09,138
belong to us.

32
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:12,950
Show me angry, pledges.

33
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,893
Come on, angry!

34
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,081
Yeah. That's it.
That's it. Work it.

35
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,626
Now you're sad. You're sad.

36
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,712
I'm lost in the forest.

37
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:27,297
Now, uh... now you're a cobra!

38
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,502
Dude, they painted
my pepperonis blue.

39
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:35,025
It's permanent ink!

40
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,308
We've come this far,
only a few more days,

41
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,588
we're as good as initiated.

42
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:40,739
Initiated?

43
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:45,153
Sure, Rusty. You pledges have
endured many a Hell Week trial.

44
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:47,235
Like, Bobbing for Hairballs,

45
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,070
the Rhinoceros Walk,

46
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,562
and even that rousing game
of Hide the Pickle...

47
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:53,616
we found eventually.

48
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:56,870
I had a sweet hiding spot.
Back in line, sweetie!

49
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:58,774
But what you don't know, Rusty...

50
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,572
- Why do you keep calling him "Rusty"?
- Because, Keith,

51
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,770
"Spitter" is his KT name.

52
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:04,639
And,

53
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:06,551
he has no guarantee

54
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:07,699
of becoming

55
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:09,399
a Kappa Tau. Oh, no.

56
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:11,506
None of you do.

57
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,430
Every Hell Week at least one pledge
is found wanting and expelled.

58
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,609
You'd really kick one of us out?

59
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:18,591
Or more.

60
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:21,170
The brothers will use
a final round of trials

61
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:23,710
to determine which pledges
will become initiated,

62
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:25,751
And which ones will go home...

63
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:26,867
for good.

64
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,818
Just like Dancing With the Stars,

65
00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:31,734
except there's no dancing
and there's no stars.

66
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:34,616
Remember, it's three strikes
and you're out.

67
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,264
Just like baseball,

68
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,665
except there's no bases and
there's really no balls.

69
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:44,584
Now frolic!
Come on, pledges, frolic!

70
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:47,295
Let's see it. Like nymphs,
like nymphs, come on.

71
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:51,174
You're in the woods,
you're frolicking in the woods.

72
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:55,259
You're having a car wash.
Suds are being thrown everywhere.

73
00:02:57,922 --> 00:03:00,308
We've been at this
for three days and

74
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,727
still some of you maggots
can't do 50 push ups?

75
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:04,308
Come on, let's go.

76
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,657
This sucks.
I can't do any more.

77
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:08,314
Come on. It could be worse.

78
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,694
We got another one.

79
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:14,444
God,

80
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:15,951
that stinks.

81
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,460
- There goes Owens.
- Next victim.

82
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:19,799
No, no. Wait.

83
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,580
I got a special punishment
for Calvin.

84
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:24,004
He's got to clean
O'Toole's bathroom sink.

85
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,583
But he manscapes in there!

86
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:27,727
I don't want to hear it.
Let's go.

87
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,930
This does not look
like O'Toole's bathroom.

88
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:45,603
This, Pledge Owens
is our Honor Room.

89
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,307
And you're just here to clean it.

90
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,829
That's it? I don't have to...

91
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,020
use my toothbrush or anything?

92
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,753
Nope. I mean,
consider yourself spared.

93
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,922
Can you do that?

94
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:02,179
Calvin, I can do whatever
I want, I'm the president.

95
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:06,229
Big Bro to the rescue.

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,641
Where to start?

97
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:13,549
No way.

98
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,600
Quit whining, man, you're a pledge!

99
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:25,207
Dude, eat it!

100
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:27,353
Eat the chocolate poo!

101
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:30,105
I gotta be openly mean to you,

102
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:33,154
to offset the homoeroticism
of so many of our rituals.

103
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,235
So eat it!

104
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,454
Damn! That was nasty, bra!

105
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,158
But, dude, I'm ready
to get initiated.

106
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:57,559
That was so real.

107
00:04:58,234 --> 00:04:59,413
Yeah, Beth.

108
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,811
Hey, got a sec?

109
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:06,434
I wanted to talk to you
about the gift exchange...

110
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:09,533
Casey, your boyfriend
is ruining Inspiration Week.

111
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:11,027
One sec, Becks.

112
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:14,946
Hurry or you'll miss Sister Circle.

113
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,444
- He just walked right in.
- It was open.

114
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,795
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:23,075
Come on, don't worry about it.

116
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:25,635
- Sorry, I didn't...
- It's OK...

117
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,968
Thanks for saving me from
all the sister bonding, I need a break.

118
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:36,339
Like a summer of fun break.

119
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,508
Since I'm no longer ZBZ president,

120
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,826
I'm no longer obligated
to prep for next year's rush.

121
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:42,177
It's just you and me.

122
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,263
Barbequing, sipping mojitos...

123
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:46,557
- I got accepted to grad school.
- I know, at CRU.

124
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:48,810
Which I was excited about
the first time you told me.

125
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:50,839
No. A different school...

126
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:52,802
In California.

127
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:54,821
California, Ohio?

128
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:58,182
No, uh, California, California.

129
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,733
Cal-Tech. I applied
before we even met.

130
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:04,541
And I hadn't heard anything,
so I just figured, I assumed...

131
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,028
So, Cal-Tech.

132
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,136
Which means after
our summer of fun...

133
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:20,361
We'd only be two thousand, two hundred
and twenty-nine point three miles...

134
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:22,385
away from each other.

135
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:26,932
Greek 2x10
<i>Hell Week</i>

136
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:29,267
Synchro : 7844, Arrow, Coke.

137
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:31,085
seriessub.com
sub-way.fr

138
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,897
OK, look, here we go.

139
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:38,836
We could book a red eye leaving
for Kona right after your last final.

140
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,278
Evan, we can't.

141
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:45,237
There's so much to do. We have all those
appointments booked with the realtors.

142
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:49,087
Besides, we're going to meet your family
in the Hamptons Memorial Day weekend.

143
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:53,249
Yeah, well I thought we could
do something just the two of us.

144
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,670
Do you not wanna see your parents?

145
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,882
No, fine, whatever. I'll go.

146
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:02,890
Good.

147
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:06,292
Because for a minute there
I thought it was about the realtors.

148
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,810
- I know it's a big commitment.
- No, that,

149
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:10,475
I am actually excited about.

150
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:11,652
Me, too.

151
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,101
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

152
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:29,240
Big Sis, ready for
Sorority Massacre Movie Night?

153
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,204
Yay, done naked girls.
One sec, Becks.

154
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,458
The pledges want more rootbeer floats.
We're out of rootbeer. Help me out?

155
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:38,033
This isn't part of your duties,

156
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,615
Frannie's Pledge Educator,
she's in charge of I-week.

157
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,423
I haven't seen her since yesterday.

158
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,811
Two weeks ago
she was killing for the Presidency,

159
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,830
now she's skipping Movie Night.

160
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:50,264
- I'll get some more rootbeer.
- Thank you.

161
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:52,610
Oh, and let's walk on the wild side.

162
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:54,477
Get regular, not diet.

163
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:57,105
Um, can I ask you a question first

164
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,837
Is it about the Big-Little
gift exchange?

165
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:04,891
It's about you and Travis.

166
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,243
I wanted to know what it was like
being in a long distance relationship.

167
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,019
Well, it sucked.

168
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:14,336
I basically wasted two years of college
dating a total jerk.

169
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,604
We were never around each other
long enough to realize it.

170
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:20,607
Then there's the travel costs,
the phone bills,

171
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:23,609
the trying to have phone sex
when you get spotty reception.

172
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,638
The pressure to make
the most of your visits,

173
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:27,640
not to mention
the fear of him cheating on you.

174
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,875
OK, I get it.

175
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,901
Max is leaving for Cal-Tech
in three months,

176
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,789
and he wanted to know
if we're still staying together.

177
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:39,430
But, it'll be great for you guys.

178
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:42,896
I'm... I'm sure Max
has good cell phone service.

179
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:46,464
How am I supposed to make
this kind of commitment,

180
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:49,240
when we've only dated
for a month and a half?

181
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:51,540
Well, why do you have to decide now?

182
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,787
Just enjoy the next three months
and whatever happens, happens.

183
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:00,204
Get down.
They might see us.

184
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,639
I am going to get dung out.
Come on,

185
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:05,550
they love you over there,
you're the president's Little Brother.

186
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:08,137
- Sure you get special treatment.
- From Cappie?

187
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,535
He blindfolded me and made me
reach into the upstairs toilet.

188
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,269
- OK, that's enough.
- No, it was just peanut butter.

189
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:17,225
- That's actually kinda funny.
- No, he made me eat it.

190
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,779
And it's disgusting again.

191
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:21,606
I'm sure Evan enjoys
inflicting pain on you guys.

192
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:24,692
Not me. If anything,
Evan's intentionally going easy on me.

193
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,148
How do your pledge brothers
feel about that?

194
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:28,565
I don't think they know.

195
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,000
I mean, I've been cleaning
the Honor Room instead.

196
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,326
Which reminds me.
Guess what I found?

197
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:35,699
- What?
- Your old Omega Chi pledge paddle.

198
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:37,661
The one I hit Evan with?

199
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,665
I'd think he would've
torched that by now.

200
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:42,376
It's definitely yours. There's
a nose-shaped dent in it.

201
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:44,385
That was a pretty big swing.

202
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,340
Thanks, man. You almost
made me forget about Hell Week.

203
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:50,301
You wouldn't know hell if it stuck you
in the bottom with a pitchfork.

204
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:52,428
Here, no peanut butter,
just like you asked.

205
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:53,294
Thanks.

206
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,434
Don't forget.
I'm leaving tomorrow at 3:00.

207
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,065
I'll be there. Stop worrying.

208
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,676
- Wait, finals aren't until next week.
- I already took them.

209
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,954
I'm taking off early to Rockdale,
Alabama 4- H circuit with Darwin Lied.

210
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,752
We're opening up for Intelligent-D.

211
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:07,568
- It's gonna be off the hook.
- Rock on.

212
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:08,913
All right, I'm out.

213
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,618
Hopefully the next time you see me,

214
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,331
I'll be a Kappa Tau brother
and not a wash out.

215
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:16,577
Stop worrying, just embrace the
humiliation and you'll be fine.

216
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:17,954
How would you know?

217
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:22,258
Listen, just don't let
them tie a brick to your goat-whacker.

218
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,370
Why? You're laughing.

219
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,654
Everybody laughs
when their feet get tickled.

220
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,446
It's a reflex,
as you know, science dork.

221
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:33,559
Stop! Oh, stop!

222
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,905
We're gonna be fine.

223
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,315
You mean you're OK
with a long distance relationship?

224
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:53,435
But, I am ready to commit to you

225
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,347
an amazing summer with you.

226
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,618
And figuring it out from there.

227
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,203
Summer for now.

228
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,045
That'll be fun.

229
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,257
How much fun?

230
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,533
I don't know.

231
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:12,827
Surprise!

232
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:14,312
Oh, God.

233
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:15,784
So cute.

234
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:17,312
I can do this.

235
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,209
I got the eye of the tiger
and I'm ready to fight.

236
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,310
Let the Trial by Fish begin.

237
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:30,633
Feisty little guy.

238
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,405
Be careful...

239
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,835
I accidentally scooped you
three fish, Rusty.

240
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,000
But, we have faith in you.

241
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,746
Now pledges,
take your cups and first of all...

242
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:54,742
Done.

243
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,139
What do you mean "done"?

244
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,322
Finished.

245
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,133
That was quick.

246
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:06,577
It's empty!

247
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,940
- Where the hell are they?!
- In my belly.

248
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,899
What the hell were you thinking?!

249
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,697
You're supposed to
take care of the fish, not eat them!

250
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:19,964
Why'd yougive us bibs?

251
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,850
This is a baby fish papoose pouch!

252
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:25,545
He murdered the poor little fishies.

253
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:29,210
That's officially strike one,
Sushi Boy.

254
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:31,008
No! Cap! Cap, n... no!

255
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:34,105
I was only doing what you
wanted me to do. Embracing humiliation.

256
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,974
I can't protect you on this one.

257
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:39,041
You're going to have to pass
Judgment Day with flying colors.

258
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,026
Or else!

259
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:57,158
Oh, my God!

260
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,371
Did someone strangle a chipmunk?

261
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,648
Big-Little gifts are so cheesy.

262
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:04,382
Yay, can I please
get a sterling silver ZBZ cat

263
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,652
to put on my shelf
of stuff I'll throw away in a month?

264
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:07,790
I know, right?

265
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:09,664
Can I please get
a ZBZ patchwork quilt?

266
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,187
I'm redecorating my cabin
up at Lake Tacky-Crap.

267
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:16,132
Brenda, this is for you.

268
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:20,262
- Oh, my God! I love it! I love you!
- I love you, too.

269
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,856
Isn't Ivy the sweetest?

270
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:34,267
I got

271
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,952
a blender!

272
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,544
For protein shakes.

273
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:42,366
But if that's true, why did she include
this little bag of margarita salt?

274
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:45,315
It's perfect for the summer.

275
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,383
Fun summer.

276
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,159
So you got any crazy parties
coming up with your high school friends?

277
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:55,601
I do, however, have front
row seats to my parents' divorce.

278
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:57,542
I'll take pictures.

279
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:00,217
But I like your blender.

280
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,894
Did you get
a Big Sis gift for Casey?

281
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,027
Yes. I decided I won't kill her

282
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,766
for kissing Cappie
over Spring Break.

283
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,188
Well, she got you a Little Sis gift.

284
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:14,656
Really?

285
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:15,870
She did?

286
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:19,261
I mean, not that I care.

287
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:22,460
No matter what's
gone on between you two,

288
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:24,700
Casey really does
believe in sisterhood.

289
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:28,162
It's a really nice gift, too.

290
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:42,845
Be seated.

291
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,490
Look only at the candle

292
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,060
or else you fail Judgment Day.

293
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:52,686
So, this is heaven.

294
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:54,544
This is heaven's lobby.

295
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:57,516
If this were real heaven,
there'd be bi-curious Playmates

296
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:59,243
making out in a corner somewhere.

297
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:02,522
Voice of an angel, you.

298
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:03,574
Thank you.

299
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,367
Tell the jury,

300
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:09,116
why do you think
you belong in Kappa Tau?

301
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,698
As you know, I struck down
Evan Chambers with a pledge paddle.

302
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:15,783
I defeated the Omega Chis
at Beer Pong.

303
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:17,795
I made it rain beer

304
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:18,948
with Vesuvius,

305
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:22,700
and I even got the upstairs toilet
to flush after Chili Night,

306
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:25,177
with little to no splatter.

307
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:27,799
Guilty!

308
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:30,337
- Of what?
- Of everything! You beat Calvin

309
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,467
at Beer Pong not their entire house.

310
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:35,395
And you know Calvin's hand
cramps easily.

311
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,930
And made Vesuvius rain beer?

312
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,816
Another minute and that Remington
Hertzog Atmospheric Destabilizer

313
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,655
would have evaporated our blood
and rained it on our mummified corpses.

314
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:45,983
Wikipedia.

315
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,879
In fact, weren't you
initially thinking

316
00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:50,846
about being an Omega Chi pledge?

317
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:53,163
You went
there and ignored our Bid Night.

318
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:55,249
We were your second choice,
remember?

319
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,067
- But I ended up here!
- Eyes on the candle!

320
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,600
Kappa Tau is where I belong.
I did all this stuff all year

321
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:03,609
and it's not good enough?
- "A" for effort,

322
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:04,967
but no, sorry.

323
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:07,386
I'm afraid this is strike two.
Last chance,

324
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:08,791
go forth in the world

325
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,647
and find a way to demonstrate
to us that you are a KT.

326
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:12,600
How?

327
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:14,853
The true Kappa Tau
wouldn't have to ask that.

328
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:16,811
And you gotta do it
before Initiation Night,

329
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:18,305
or don't bother showing up.

330
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,524
Tick-tock, Rusty.
Tickety-tock.

331
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,854
And remember, if anyone asks,
this is not hazing.

332
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:34,542
You are simply
pruning the rose bushes...

333
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:38,567
with your hands,
with no gloves, by choice.

334
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:41,592
I can't. I need a break.

335
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:44,594
You will break when
I tell you to break, Trip.

336
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,551
Evan, he looks broken, man.

337
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,493
Well, then it's
your job to revive him.

338
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:56,060
Come on, Owens, cool off.
I'm gonna go get us some snacks.

339
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,549
How you doing there, Owens?
That fan looks heavy.

340
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:03,525
Look, man, I didn't make
the pledge assignments, what can I do?

341
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:06,786
But you're Evan's pet Little Bro,
talk to him, he's going too far.

342
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:08,916
Come on, man,
we're almost there, OK?

343
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,426
You're almost there.

344
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,164
He's giving you all the easy jobs.

345
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:13,827
The rest of us are dying here.

346
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:17,356
OK, boys, who's up
for mayonnaise pot stickers?

347
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:28,962
Last load.

348
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,754
Nine months of temptation, God,
and I proved myself.

349
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:37,017
And I have to prove to the Actives
why I'm a true Kappa Tau.

350
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:38,252
Well...

351
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:41,522
you could always show them a biopsy
of your decayed liver.

352
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:45,671
Come on, Russ, you'll always
be my little frat boy.

353
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,653
Thanks, Dale.

354
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:53,577
Well, you're off.

355
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:55,469
Yeah, yeah. Till the fall.

356
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:58,403
Sophomore year, baby.

357
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:01,084
- Can't wait.
- I can't wait for this year to be over.

358
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,740
I burned this for you.

359
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:06,915
Darwin Lied cut a new track.
Carpool to Salvation.

360
00:18:07,397 --> 00:18:08,757
I'll save you a seat.

361
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,168
You never have a moment of doubt
that you're right,

362
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:16,438
or that you are right
where you belong, do you?

363
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:20,777
I sometimes wish
I had what you have.

364
00:18:21,063 --> 00:18:22,239
I just have faith.

365
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:26,017
I mean, that cross is just two sticks
tied together without that.

366
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:28,027
You know, and I...

367
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:31,196
know in my heart that the Big Guy
has a plan for all of us.

368
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,325
And I happen to know a little bit
about his plans for you, too.

369
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:37,692
Something that includes
Kappa Tau, I hope.

370
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,784
No. But we are
gonna be roommates again.

371
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:43,417
He told me.

372
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:46,211
Come here.

373
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,482
I applied to bartend here
over the summer.

374
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:06,164
I haven't heard back.
Which is maybe OK,

375
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:09,193
since I plan to spend
the summer maximizing my time with...

376
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:11,216
Max. And then, from there,

377
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,614
you'll re-evaluate the
relationship's staying power.

378
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,687
Long and prosperous, no doubt.

379
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,578
Isn't that the manager?
Why don't you go ask him about the job?

380
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:22,349
Can't just go up and ask him.
That's bad form.

381
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:23,659
I'll call him tomorrow.

382
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:27,289
While you're out you should
buy a gift for Rebec...

383
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:28,567
Unknown number.

384
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,063
Oh, maybe it's the manager.

385
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,774
Hello?

386
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,872
Of course I'm interested.
Totally.

387
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,158
Yes, I'll call you
tomorrow. Thank you.

388
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:46,605
I just got a job.

389
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:49,059
No you didn't.
I just talked to the manager.

390
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:52,653
They're going with someone else.
You have no bartending experience.

391
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:53,733
Not here.

392
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:55,332
In Washington.

393
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:57,095
There's a Dobler's in Washington?

394
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,408
Remember Paula Baker?

395
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:01,535
From the convention, former ZBZ
and current US Congresswoman?

396
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:04,498
She just offered me
a summer internship in DC.

397
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,543
No way! When did you even apply?

398
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,509
I didn't. She just
remembered me from the convention.

399
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:12,569
She had a last minute opening,

400
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:14,883
she thought of me
and she tracked down my number.

401
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,928
Well, this is awesome!
Right?

402
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:22,593
I'd have to be in DC in two weeks.

403
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,810
I screwed, I mean, I seriously
don't know what to do.

404
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,530
I want the internship in DC,
it's the career direction

405
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,390
I've been waiting for,
but I finally found

406
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,854
some incredible guy
who I might lose.

407
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,050
It's so what happened
with Jason going to Paris, remember?

408
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:42,727
I know, right.
So how did you decide, L.C.?

409
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:46,417
I don't know.
I guess I just followed my heart, Case.

410
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,750
Which I guess was
a mistake or whatever.

411
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,599
Because you and Jason broke up?

412
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:52,659
But I wouldn't have known
he was the wrong choice

413
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,881
unless I had spent
the summer with him in Malibu.

414
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:57,000
- Which you saw in season two.
- True.

415
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,129
Also, I could have spent
my whole summer in France

416
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:02,686
wondering if I had
left behind my one true love.

417
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:03,960
But he wasn't?

418
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:06,390
God, no.
I totally should have gone to France!

419
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,341
But what if Max
is more my future than Washington?

420
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,273
What if I suck there?

421
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,641
But, I mean,
it's allabout the "what if?"

422
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:16,130
Either way,
you're always gonna wonder...

423
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:17,122
what if?

424
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,948
- That's so deep.
- I know, right?

425
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:22,898
- Ash, what're you doing here?
- It's fricking L.C.!

426
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,074
I love your hair. How do you get it
so shiny and straight?

427
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:29,142
You never ask me that.
I always go with a ceramic iron.

428
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,310
Ah, genius.

429
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:32,207
So, tell me, L.C.,

430
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,036
what would you do?

431
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:36,381
Casey, the answer's crystal clear.

432
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,075
- It's me, it's me.
- What are you doing here?

433
00:21:47,754 --> 00:21:51,021
- I need your help.
- Good God, what is that smell?

434
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:53,094
- Desperation?
- No...

435
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:55,139
You smell like dog poo.

436
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,907
And your breath,
it's like the pond at Grandpa's house.

437
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:02,366
How did Cappie prove he was a KT
during Hell Week?

438
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:04,528
- I need to know.
- He didn't.

439
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:08,101
If I recall correctly,
I think that assignment

440
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,250
was just for dorky pledges
who were gonna get dung out.

441
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:14,503
- I'm so tired...
- Not the comforter.

442
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:16,000
And freaked out.

443
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:21,802
I can't even remember why I wanted
to join KT in the first place.

444
00:22:22,693 --> 00:22:24,846
Because you were
too good for Omega Chi.

445
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:26,511
Not at first, I wasn't.

446
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:30,604
Maybe that's why
I'm in so much trouble.

447
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:34,356
I need to rid myself
of any last vestiges of Omega Chi.

448
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:36,024
What are you talking about?

449
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:38,646
- I knew I could count on you.
- Don't even!

450
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:41,613
Get off the...

451
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:44,366
- Don't do anything stupid.
- I'm not.

452
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,611
I'm doing something Kappa Tau.

453
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:01,091
For you. Your Big Sis present.

454
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:05,929
Rebecca, that's like,
the sweetest thing ever.

455
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,100
I know.

456
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:11,226
I love it. Thanks.

457
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,676
Becks, listen,

458
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,985
things have been so crazy with Max

459
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:22,298
- that I forgot to...
- Bring this down.

460
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:24,267
You left it upstairs on the dresser.

461
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:27,200
Exactly what I was about to say.

462
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:33,130
What is it?

463
00:23:33,448 --> 00:23:34,821
Something awesome.

464
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,793
Like what?

465
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,477
Don't wanna spoil the surprise.

466
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:41,965
I don't mind.

467
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:44,134
Just open it, K?

468
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:54,227
Thanks.

469
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,559
You up for some competition?

470
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,215
- You know I rock at pool.
- I know. I learned the hard way.

471
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:14,471
Subtle.

472
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:18,313
I just came here to figure out
what to do about a personal matter.

473
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:19,472
On my own.

474
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:22,172
I didn't expect that you'd be here.

475
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:27,861
Handicap?

476
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:29,163
For who? You?

477
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:31,070
Keep dreaming. Rack 'em.

478
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:32,891
I'll break.

479
00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:36,071
So, a personal problem, huh?

480
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,896
Let me guess.

481
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:39,022
Max...

482
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:42,609
is having an emotional affair with his
World of Warcraft teammate, right?

483
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:44,403
He's going to grad school

484
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:45,983
in the fall

485
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:47,823
in California.

486
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:49,825
California, Ohio?

487
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,706
We were going to spend
the summer together

488
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:55,389
here and figure out
what to do about the fall.

489
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:58,965
But I just got offered
a summer internship in DC,

490
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:01,670
I'd have to leave in two weeks.

491
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:03,964
Congrats, Case.

492
00:25:04,478 --> 00:25:06,039
I haven't committed yet.

493
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:10,030
I mean, I don't want to leave Max,

494
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:12,007
but this is

495
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:14,978
a US Congresswoman
we're talking about here.

496
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:18,104
- Paula Baker.
- Paula Baker?

497
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:19,693
Maryland, Fifth District.

498
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,787
Soft on energy,
but a staunch protector

499
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:23,817
of the Loggerhead sea turtle.
I like that.

500
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,182
So, Max

501
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:28,323
or a possible career.

502
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,950
Long distance. That's a...

503
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:35,078
big commitment for a guy
who just started dating.

504
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:37,732
Good shot.

505
00:25:40,817 --> 00:25:41,838
That's it?

506
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:45,881
Great shot? I don't know
what you want me to say.

507
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:48,543
As my friend,

508
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:50,631
what do you think I should do?

509
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,290
You said it yourself.
Max and I just started dating.

510
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:56,542
What if I pass on this awesome
opportunity in DC...

511
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,440
and he's not the one?

512
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:02,016
Fine,

513
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:04,293
as your friend, Case, I...

514
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,372
think you should...

515
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:13,200
bank the nine ball.
Go for the side pocket.

516
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:26,659
And?

517
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:31,296
And...

518
00:26:33,768 --> 00:26:35,201
I think you should...

519
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,351
take the internship instead of Max.

520
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:43,353
Really?

521
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,274
So you're suggesting
I break up with Max?

522
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:49,153
I'm saying that you shouldn't discount
the fact that you spent

523
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,589
the past year trying to find something
to build a future on and...

524
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:54,854
now you may have found it.

525
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:58,463
As for finding the one,
I think if it's...

526
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:01,234
meant to be eventually, it will be.

527
00:27:04,661 --> 00:27:06,434
Thanks for the advice, Cap.

528
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:12,750
Eight ball, corner pocket.

529
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,956
How's your BFF taking
doing it national?

530
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:45,689
That's in the past.

531
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,746
And, I'm here to discuss the future.

532
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:54,426
- Do I hear ticking?
- Just open it.

533
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:01,516
Lovely.

534
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,675
What's the catch?

535
00:28:05,513 --> 00:28:06,882
Just hear me out.

536
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,861
That's beautiful, Frannie.

537
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:11,401
Who knew you could give
as well as you take?

538
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,398
This is just my final,
end of the year gesture,

539
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:16,971
as Pledge Educator.

540
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,326
At least Frannie picked out
her own gift.

541
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,494
- I wanted to...
- Later.

542
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,121
You were saying?

543
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,474
I just noticed that you made the pledges
sleep in the backyard last night,

544
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,620
in the mud.

545
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,198
We left you inside for that one,
didn't we?

546
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,481
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on them

547
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,992
and easy on me?

548
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:56,456
Look,

549
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,844
you're my Little Brother,
you're a Legacy,

550
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:01,579
you're entitled to special treatment,
so just enjoy it.

551
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:03,870
As much as you are?

552
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:06,466
Ever since you signed up for that trust,
you seem to just wanna

553
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:08,875
show off what it means
to be Evan Chambers.

554
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:11,416
That's crap.

555
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:14,816
Maybe so, but you know,
those are my pledge brothers, so...

556
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:17,509
if you're gonna haze them that way,
you gotta haze me the same.

557
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,186
- Fair is fair.
- You serious?

558
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:22,536
I am.

559
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:27,088
You're right. It's not fair.

560
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:29,512
So grab the pledge manual
and follow me.

561
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,905
- Where we going?
- No questions. Move it, pledge.

562
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:55,839
I have to leave in two weeks.

563
00:29:57,692 --> 00:30:00,968
I guess we'll be starting the long
distance thing a lot sooner then, huh?

564
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:12,526
You wanna break up.

565
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,422
I want to be in two places at once.

566
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,479
You're science-y.

567
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,261
Have they made that possible yet?

568
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,389
Funny isn't...

569
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,230
I'm sorry.

570
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:35,962
What if I...
What if I come to DC with you?

571
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,632
Then we'd still have to say good bye
at the end of summer.

572
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:42,844
No chance you'd move to California?

573
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,593
I can't keep making decisions
based on the guys in my life.

574
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:56,316
I need to stay here for me.
I need to take this internship for me.

575
00:30:57,813 --> 00:30:59,762
Guess that sounds kinda selfish.

576
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:02,531
I'm the one leaving.

577
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:04,115
And you have to.

578
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,340
It's what's best for you.

579
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,045
It's not what's best for us, though.

580
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:16,718
I'd better go.

581
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:24,092
No regrets?

582
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:30,562
No regrets.

583
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:30,389
Checkmate.

584
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:40,605
All right, let's get
those blindfolds on.

585
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:00,594
- This isn't the Kappa Tau house.
- Guys!

586
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,243
Come on, hurry up!

587
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,735
What is that?

588
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,375
- Who wants more cookies?
- I do!

589
00:33:19,535 --> 00:33:22,620
Where's Rusty? I hope
he's not kidnapping a Tri Pi for us.

590
00:33:22,745 --> 00:33:25,163
We got in a lot of trouble
for that last time.

591
00:33:25,288 --> 00:33:26,443
Yeah, we did.

592
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:30,021
We can't wait any longer.
Initiation has to be tonight.

593
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:33,634
When it comes to initiation, even I
must abide by the rules. Except for one.

594
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,711
- Naked beneath the robe?
- You, too?

595
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:39,323
I called Rusty's dorm
like ten times. No answer.

596
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,248
Hark!

597
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:46,121
I recognize that girlish
scream anywhere. Spitter!

598
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:48,236
Come on, let's go!

599
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:52,343
Move! Hurry up!

600
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:57,706
We're on our way, Spitter!

601
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:35,287
Take off your blindfolds!
Take 'em off! Take 'em off!

602
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:37,972
- Should we do it?
- It's a trick.

603
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,547
- No one take 'em off.
- He sounds serious.

604
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:44,290
You know what? I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna double check here.

605
00:34:56,454 --> 00:34:58,392
Wait a minute. You forgot this.

606
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:10,293
- Come on.
- Get him outta here.

607
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:24,214
This handshake
symbolizes our sacred bond.

608
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:28,404
Brotherhood, above all.

609
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:30,659
And finally,

610
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:34,886
a Chapter President must choose
one pledge during initiation

611
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,639
to carry the final burden
for his pledge class,

612
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,264
for at least one hour.

613
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:45,978
Calvin Owens has carried
the burden for...

614
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:47,813
over three hours.

615
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:59,257
You can lower the book now, Cal.
You're a brother.

616
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:03,477
Congratulations, brothers!

617
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:06,167
All right.

618
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:09,670
Now listen up. Report to the backyard,
so we can paddle our new initiates.

619
00:36:15,655 --> 00:36:18,055
I'd pick sleeping in mud
over holding that book any time.

620
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,472
It was amazing.

621
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,391
I just can't keep my arms down.

622
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:34,590
- Brother Owens.
- Brother Chambers.

623
00:36:34,948 --> 00:36:36,531
Nice hazing tactic.

624
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:40,703
- Be careful what you wish for, right?
- I may have been a little harsh

625
00:36:40,828 --> 00:36:42,877
with the show off comment.

626
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:45,764
You said what you need
to say to get what you wanted.

627
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:47,326
And I respect that.

628
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:50,837
You and I are not so different.
Here, let me help you with that.

629
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:54,215
What happened to you guys anyway?
Your lip looks pretty bad.

630
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,509
I guess Rusty and I are even.

631
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,846
What, did you hit him
with a paddle or something?

632
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:01,693
I was protecting the house.

633
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:04,058
From Rusty?

634
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,147
Look, he started this
and I ended it.

635
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:08,068
Like I said, he and I are even.

636
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:15,570
Why would you go to the Omega Chi house
during Hell Week and incite a brawl?

637
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:24,436
I guess I thought it was the only way
to prove that I was a Kappa Tau.

638
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:27,007
Not that trying to get that paddle back
was the coolest thing

639
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:30,480
in the world, but you could have just
bought us beer like your pledge bros.

640
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:33,649
- You called me "Spitter".
- Wouldn't know you by any other name.

641
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:36,424
So no more overcompensating.

642
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:38,685
What about all those pledges
that didn't get in?

643
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,836
In the last 50 years
there was only one guy

644
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:43,347
who ever left after pledging,
and he did it voluntarily.

645
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,271
So this whole time you and the Actives
were screwing with us.

646
00:37:50,788 --> 00:37:53,274
You should not have locked us
out of the house last month.

647
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:54,972
That's so messed up.

648
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:58,821
Why you won't think that way next year
when you're doing it to the new pledges.

649
00:38:02,723 --> 00:38:03,792
Come with me.

650
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:10,485
Who wants to get initiated?

651
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,615
I will now read
from the Kappa Tau-ra.

652
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:21,621
- Shalom.
- Shalom.

653
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:27,555
I love that part.

654
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,062
And the crossed
identical arrows symbolize

655
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:33,057
that while we may cross each other,

656
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:35,892
we are all the same
under this hallowed roof.

657
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,235
Blow the arrows.

658
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,933
Blow the arrows.

659
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:43,137
Rise.

660
00:38:44,794 --> 00:38:45,785
Now,

661
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:47,459
you are a man.

662
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:49,330
L'Chaim!

663
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,014
What is this music?

664
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:18,341
Bernie went to Israel last summer
and insisted we use his mixed CD.

665
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:19,610
Just go with it.

666
00:39:28,988 --> 00:39:30,022
Holy crap!

667
00:39:35,911 --> 00:39:37,908
Aren't you supposed to be
at ZBZ's initiation?

668
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:40,881
On my way. But I wanted
to say congrats, first.

669
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:43,350
- Thanks.
- What happened to your...

670
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:46,554
Hell Week gets
crazier every year, huh?

671
00:39:46,715 --> 00:39:48,460
Yeah. It was worth it.

672
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:50,516
I'm a brother now.

673
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:54,353
And I can attest from personal
experience, you are a great one.

674
00:39:56,714 --> 00:39:58,127
- Geez.
- What?

675
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:00,827
Everyone gets a little mushy
by the end of I-Week.

676
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:03,175
I'll have total deniability
by Monday.

677
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:06,934
- Go celebrate.
- Thanks, Case.

678
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,036
Remember, you have three more years.
Pace yourself.

679
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,332
How is your dilemma?

680
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:19,670
I'm going to Washington.

681
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:21,797
You are?

682
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,660
So...

683
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:26,427
good luck.

684
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,433
Thanks.

685
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:00,324
Hi, Dr. Lewiston?

686
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:04,065
Yes, this is Max Tyler from CRU.

687
00:41:19,063 --> 00:41:21,398
Pledges of Zeta Beta Zeta.

688
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:25,588
As you begin your ascent to sisterhood
on the wings of Zetas past,

689
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:28,614
know that those sisters
that came before us

690
00:41:28,775 --> 00:41:31,450
smile down upon you
from Chapter eternal.

691
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:34,896
Before we replace your pledge pins
with the holy badges

692
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:36,277
of an initiate...

693
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:41,752
We're starting initiation.

694
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:43,403
Then I'm just in time.

695
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:46,528
For you, Ash.

696
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:50,511
- Your Active pin?
- I'm moving out of the house.

697
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:53,791
You don't have to deactivate
the sorority just to move out.

698
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:59,103
I do if I'm moving
into another sority house.

699
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:03,522
What are you doing?
You can't join another sorority.

700
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,068
- Pan-Hellenic doesn't allow that.
- I'm starting my own sorority.

701
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:09,321
In fact, I rented the house today.

702
00:42:09,481 --> 00:42:11,227
You rented a whole house?

703
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:14,785
That's a lot of space
for you and your ego.

704
00:42:17,198 --> 00:42:19,039
That's not gonna be a problem.

705
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,042
Let's go, girls.

706
00:42:24,663 --> 00:42:26,922
Bye, Casey. Bye, Ashleigh.

707
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,133
- Bye, you guys.
- No, don't go.

708
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,178
As your president,
I command you to stop!

709
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:34,180
Brenda, you're leaving ZBZ?

710
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,849
For what? To pledge all over again?

711
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:39,133
Who says I'm pledging? And yes.

712
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,960
Shall we?
