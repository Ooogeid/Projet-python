00:00:01,239 --> 00:00:03,051
I want to rush a fraternity.

3
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:04,715
You're not fraternity material.

4
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:07,201
Who would choose to hung out
with the vodka drinkers to whose

5
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:10,576
goal in life is to fornicate on as many
vapid sorority girls as possible?

6
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,630
- That's pretty unfair.
- I'm gonna pray for you.

7
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:14,183
Rusty Cartwright.

8
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:15,477
- The spitter?
- I say he's in.

9
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:16,494
Anybody got a problem?

10
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:18,307
- You're Casey's brother.
- How'd you know?

11
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:19,492
I'm her boyfriend. I'm Evan.

12
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,600
I found out you had sex
with Evan Chambers.

13
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:22,746
I did, rush night.

14
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:23,929
And it was amazing.

15
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,446
Evan Chambers is my boyfriend.

16
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:27,450
- How awkward for you.
- So what do I do?

17
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:30,686
You do what you need to do
to make it right in your mind.

18
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:32,385
How 'bout some breakfast?

19
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:34,475
- Later, Cap.
- We're not gonna cuddle?

20
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:35,547
You're staying with him?

21
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:36,915
Don't you dare judge me!

22
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:38,389
I just want to be part of your life.

23
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:39,555
I'm not gay.

24
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:40,961
We were just drunk.

25
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:43,479
- Who sent it? She didn't do this.
- I bet it's from Rebecca.

26
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:44,738
Someone is holding the camera.

27
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:45,969
- I'll delete it.
- No, wait.

28
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,172
You really want to start this?

29
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,415
It's already started.
Get your crap out of my room,

30
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:50,471
little sis.

31
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:55,854
Spitter?

32
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,109
On a school night?

33
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:58,589
What, the library burn down?

34
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,011
No. I finished tonight's problem set in,
like, record time,

35
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:04,404
so I'm here to let loose.

36
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:05,415
You're in luck.

37
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:07,836
My sandwich and I were just about
to watch the last half...

38
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:08,997
- Care to join us?
- I'm in.

39
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:10,001
All right, let's do it.

40
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:14,572
Zoinks!

41
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:17,196
Looks like we're gonna have
to wait about...

42
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:19,563
12 minutes?

43
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:21,692
Game of pool?

44
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:23,934
Sure.

45
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:29,924
Looks like you pledges are gonna have
to steam clean that later.

46
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:34,002
What, is everyone hooking up tonight?

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,291
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- Me too.

48
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,453
But you know the night...

49
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:49,357
is not over yet.

50
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,519
How...

51
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:05,955
How about I change into something
a little more comfortable?

52
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Be my guest.

53
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,871
Much better!

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760

Brotherhood of Omega Chi Delta,

00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:17,581
the sisterhood of ZBZ would like

61
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,874
to introduce our new pledge class.

62
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:43,447
Back in formation, pledges.

63

Omega Chi Delta,

64
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:01,597
the sisterhood of ZBZ would like
to offer you

65
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:04,149
the privilege of mixing with us
friday night.

66
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:10,275
- What do you think?
- Yeah!

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I believe that's a yes.

68
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,014
Then I guess we'll see you friday night.

69
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:21,775
- I'd say that went well.
- It did!

70
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,041
But can you tell the blonde one that

71
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,998
Zeta Beta Zetas shave every day.

72
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:28,645
Her armpits look like
Colin Farrell's chin.

73
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:34,335
How's my Zeta Beta babe?

74
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,655
I need to get back to the pledges.

75
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:52,049
So if anyone knows who Sarah is,

76
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:53,991
please let Ferret know.

77
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:59,059
All right, next item on the agenda.

78
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:03,602
"D... Fun... Fry."

79
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,174
Do anybody know what that means?

80
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:08,828
Date function friday?

81
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,379
That's it.

82
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:13,669
Our first date function of
the year is friday.

83
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:15,186
That gives you nutbags

84
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:17,054
three days to find a date.

85
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,311
Now, pledges, don't worry.

86
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:21,288
You won't be judged by
how hot your date is.

87
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,861
We prefer the term "evaluated".

88
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:34,166
Man, those ZBZ girls were hot.

89
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,014
Did you see the redhead?

90
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:38,793
What I wouldn't give...

91
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,919
Can we just get this done?

92
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,602
Goats, need a volunteer.

93
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:44,138
Hold on.

94
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,264
Hear what it is first.

95
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:47,880
I need someone to be
the Zeta Beta's errand boy this week.

96
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:49,729
I'm not...

97
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:52,743
talking about panty raids and
pillow fights.

98
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:54,469
All right? This job will suck.

99
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:57,280
You gotta help them plan the mixer,
shop, decorate...

100
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:58,676
All that girl stuff.

101
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:01,989
All right. Who's willing?

102
00:07:06,244 --> 00:07:07,244
Pledge Owens...

103
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:09,351
Shoulda known
my little brother would volunteer.

104
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:13,012
- Way to take one for the team.
- Pledging's all about sacrifice.

105
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:23,104
Come in.

106
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:25,543
Hey, speed bump.

107
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,613
I'm... ready.

108
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,978
We're going to a bar, not a bake sale.

109
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:36,120
- Wear this.
- I'm...

110
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,710
worried I'll get cold.

111
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,421
Exactly. Then Evan gives you
his jacket to keep warm.

112
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:41,856
Duh.

113
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,944
But Evan might not wear a jacket.

114
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,295
And besides,

115
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:47,588
I'm probably not staying over anyway, so

116
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:49,012
I'll have to walk home without it.

117
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:51,489
Wait. You're not staying over?

118
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:54,411
I've got a crazy day tomorrow.

119
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,796
You two aren't having sex,

120
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,870
are you?

121
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,902
Frannie, that's kind of personal.

122
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:01,622
Casey, we're sisters.

123
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:03,991
I've noticed you've been...

124
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,117
really tense, like it's been a while.

125
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:07,413
I know that look.

126
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:09,797
When Blake got the flu,
I was a raving bitch.

127
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:11,487
I just haven't been in the mood.

128
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,760
Look, I know deciding to stay
with Evan was difficult.

129
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:15,832
But it's done.

130
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,922
Now you've gotta try to get back
to normal.

131
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,586
Normal couples do it.

132
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,620
I didn't realize how hard this would be.

133
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:22,638
Well, if it helps you,

134
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,838
you can think about how
you're helping your sorority.

135
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:26,854
The sorority.

136
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,831
The sluts at Tri Pi have been
circling him like hyenas in heat.

137
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:31,284
We cannot afford to lose him.

138
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,852
Come on, little miss Mopey.

139
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,106
It's not like I'm telling you
to kill puppies.

140
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:40,843
You still have feelings for him, right?

141
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:43,115
Of course.

142
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:44,926
Then wear this.

143
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:48,383
So you need a date for friday.

144
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,751
I don't see what the big deal is.

145
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:51,527
For the rest of the house, it isn't.

146
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:53,185
Girls are all they talk about.

147
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:56,791
Man, I'm with you. I am so sick of
hearing guys talk about getting laid.

148
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:58,288
Calvin, I could not agree more.

149
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,452
When is the greek system gonna realize

150
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,897
that sex before marriage is like
slapping God in the face?

151
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,854
Not exactly what I meant.

152
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:07,110
Why don't you ask some of
the brothers to set you up?

153
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:10,089
I'm already "Spitter",
the kid who can't drink tequila.

154
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:11,938
Imagine what they'll call me

155
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:14,083
when they realize I've never been
on a date before.

156
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:16,174
- What? How is this possible?
- What?

157
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,855
You saw my small talk skills
during rush.

158
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:22,460
Adding breasts to that scenario
just makes things a lot worse.

159
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,669
- You've been on a date?
- Yeah, tons of 'em.

160
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:25,908
I'm a virgin, not a leper.

161
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:29,594
I may have the answer to your problem.

162
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,110
Really, Dale. Enlighten me.

163
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:32,636
The purity pledge organization.

164
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:33,745
What is it?

165
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:36,150
The fastest growing abstinence group
in the country.

166
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,988
For believers who have pledged
to save ourselves for marriage.

167
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:41,310
Guessing there's a lot of
secret handshakes?

168
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,649
No, actually, we wear rings.

169
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:44,017
It's a symbol of my promise.

170
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,110
It's cool?

171
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,443
You should come to my friday night
rap group. We talk about girls,

172
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:49,461
sin, temptation.

173
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:50,755
You know, fun stuff like that.

174
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:53,528
I appreciate the invitation,
but I think I'll pass.

175
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:54,601
All right, just remember.

176
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,809
Your virginity is a precious gift
from God.

177
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:00,636
Got it. Thanks.

178
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:02,862
You have to help me.

179
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,946
I'd love to teach you about the ladies,

180
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,318
but I gotta help the Zeta Betas plan
friday's mixer.

181
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,555
Speaking of Zeta Betas,
why don't you ask Casey?

182
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:11,201
She knows a house full of girls.

183
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:13,588
I was hoping it wouldn't have to
come to that.

184
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:15,747
So, Casey, you doing okay?

185
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:16,972
I'm good.

186
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:21,548
So that major weirdness between you
and Evan today was just my imagination?

187
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:23,824
Come on, Case. You're my best friend.

188
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:24,843
Here's my girl!

189
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:26,802
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,041
It's... It's okay.

191
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:29,722
Excuse me a minute.

192
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,200
She's cleaning up another one
of your messes.

193
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:35,012
Look, Ashleigh, I screwed up.

194
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:36,510
All right? I realize that.

195
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:37,989
And I'm trying to fix it.

196
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:39,524
And how's that going for you?

197
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:45,651
To be honest,
I feel like everything I do...

198
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,814
I'm just making it worse.

199
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:52,165
- Do you really wanna be with her?
- I do. She's the greatest thing

200
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:53,191
that ever happened to me.

201
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:55,711
You gotta win her back.

202
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,505
And just who am I competing against?

203
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,371
Evan, the skeezy dirt bag cheater.

204
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,664
That's who she sees right now.

205
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,792
That Evan bites.

206
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:06,483
You need to reintroduce her to
the Evan she fell in love with.

207
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,282
- How do I do that?
- It's simple.

208
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:12,057
You've gotta rebuild your
entire relationship from the ground up

209
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:16,311
and to show her that you respect her and
desire her and that she can trust you.

210
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,252
You've got to court her all over again.

211
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:19,382
All right.

212
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:20,714
I can do that.

213
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,265
And that means no sex.

214
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,370
- Why not?
- 'Cause she's not ready, I don't care

215
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:28,255
what she says. She's not gonna be ready
until she feels safe with you.

216
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:29,549
So for now,

217
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,971
<i>you're McDreamy, not McSteamy.
--> Grey's Anatomy</i>

218
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:34,600
All right. All right.

219
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:35,969
I got it.

220
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:40,147
- How would you define...
- Anything below the neck.

221
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:43,852
Looks like I got most of it out.

222
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:47,088
Hopefully, you won't be wearing it
much longer, right?

223
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,009
Right.

224
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:54,722
I'm back.

225
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:56,366
There she is.

226
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:58,566
You look stunning.

227
00:11:58,807 --> 00:11:59,807
Look at that.

228
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,043
I'm sorry about your drink.

229
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,170
I wanna make it up to you.

230
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:04,511
And how are you going to do that?

231
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,156
I'm going to...

232
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,950
take you out to dinner tomorrow night.

233
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,299
Well, what about tonight?

234
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:12,784
Got a headache.

235
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,263
It's up here.

236
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,386
It's a bad headache, and,
you know, besides...

237
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:20,579
Tomorrow night,
I can have you all to myself.

238
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:22,545
It's good stuff.

239
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,670
So I'll...

240
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:28,426
pick you up at 7:00?

241
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,833
All right.

242
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:32,571
I'll see you tomorrow.

243
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:39,978
Hey, Casey.

244
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:41,921
What's up?

245
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,102
The library burn down?

246
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:47,308
I go other places, you know.

247
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
I need a favor.

248
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,137
It's happy hour.

249
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,506
You'd better need a kidney.

250
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:54,538
I have to find a date
for my date function friday.

251
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:56,722
Please set me up
with one of your sisters.

252
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:02,583
You're serious.

253
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,283
I have nowhere else to go.

254
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,130
Okay. Meet me at the house
tomorrow morning.

255
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:11,185
All right.

256
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:13,488
Let's...

257
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:16,215
start with high fives, work up to hugs.

258
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:19,126
Tomorrow morning then.

259
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:20,630
Tomorrow morning.

260
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:32,091
The social committee meeting is now
in session.

261
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,606
You may notice
we have a boy in our midst.

262
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:36,057
This is our Omega Chi pledge.

263
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,883
He's gonna do the crap
for the mixer we don't wanna do.

264
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:40,557
- Say hi, pledge.
- Hi.

265
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,781
Okay, back to business.

266
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,518
It is now time to announce
the mixer theme.

267
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:46,491
I have thought long and hard about this,

268
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,164
and I have come up with something
truly monumental.

269
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,533
The theme for the mixer will be...
Wait for it...

270
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,121
"Pimps and hos".

271
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:58,503
That was the theme for the last
three mixers, Ashleigh.

272
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,301
- Because everyone loves it.
- No.

273
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:01,394
You love it.

274
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,593
The rest of us are over dressing
like hookers.

275
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:05,811
What else do you have?

276
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,771
How about a graffiti mixer?

277
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:10,567
I have an idea.

278
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:13,949
Did he just speak?

279
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:18,349
I was thinking military mixer?

280
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Think about it.

281
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:27,465
A room full of hot guys in uniform.

282
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:31,071
And girls, of course.

283
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,302
We'll call it
"the don't ask, don't tell mixer."

284
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,182
Meeting adjourned.

285
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,747
Pledge, let's go shopping.

286
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:50,184
I have a name, you know.

287
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I'm sure you do.

288
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:54,589
I don't know, casey.

289
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,808
This just isn't my style.

290
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,293
Then we're on the right track.

291
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:58,772
Look, girls are fickle.

292
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:02,211
82% of our first impression is based
on how you look.

293
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:03,746
Did you just quote a statistic?

294
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,336
I'm Phi Beta Kappa in flirting.

295
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,908
Trust me,
this new look will get you noticed.

296
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:11,033
I bet mom and dad will notice
when they get their credit card bill.

297
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:14,491
Please. If your wardrobe isn't
an emergency, I don't know what is.

298
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,192
I can walk next to you without
feeling like I'm doing you a favor.

299
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,132
- Morning, little lady. Evan.
- Hey, Cappie.

300
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:21,317
Spitter?

301
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,673
What have you done?

302
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:28,391
The impossible, right?

303
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:31,127
Look at how handsome he is.

304
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,289
Turning your brother into
your boyfriend is kinda creepy, Case.

305
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,788
Spitter, are you still in there?

306
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,767
Let's all ease up on my face.

307
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:40,670
Rusty asked me to help him find
a date for your date function.

308
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,352
Now he actually stands a chance.

309
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:45,716
Did you ever stop to think about
what kind of girl this might attract?

310
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,160
A girl with standards, perhaps?

311
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,821
Or maybe a girl who chooses style
over substance.

312
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:54,407
A girl who only cares about appearances.

313
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:57,833
Would you really want him in such
an empty, soul-sucking relationship?

314
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,236
I just want my little brother to have
what I have...

315
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:02,661
A relationship that's deep
and meaningful.

316
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,804
With lots and lots of hot lovemaking.

317
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:07,043
Come on, Rusty. Let's go.

318
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:08,781
Rusty's coming with me.

319
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,463
He asked me for help.

320
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:12,525
And he looks like he's about
to overdose on khaki.

321
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,114
Spitter, you decide. Your sister...

322
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
or your brother?

323
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:22,957
I don't know, Casey. I'm sorry.

324
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:24,067
This just isn't me.

325
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
Fine.

326
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:27,637
Good luck.

327
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:28,968
You'll need it.

328
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:33,629
She means well.

329
00:16:34,904 --> 00:16:36,069
Where'd you park your yacht?

330
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,583
Check it out.

331
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:40,933
Little army men.

332
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:42,357
And we need those why?

333
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:46,036
To make miniature battle scenes
in the bathrooms with votives.

334
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:47,905
Ambience.

335
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,420
You're really into this.

336
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,748
I just think this mixer should be one
for the records.

337
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,429
You know, we're the two best houses
on campus, right?

338
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:57,466
Good point.

339
00:16:57,724 --> 00:16:59,979
I just wish my boyfriend would come up
for it.

340
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:01,712
Long-distance relationship?

341
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,230
Sounds hard.

342
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,539
What's hard is spending all this time
planning mixers

343
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,945
so that everyone else can hook up.

344
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:10,162
What about you? Got a girlfriend?

345
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,607
Me? No.

346
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:14,288
I just haven't met the right person yet.

347
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:16,728
Dinner was amazing.

348
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:19,409
So what should we do now?

349
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,931
I've got the answer in my back pocket.

350
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:25,723
I was hoping it was
in your front pocket.

351
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:32,619
Tickets.

352
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:34,651
To the midnight showing of...

353
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,279
"Gone with the wind".

354
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:39,067
Remember how you said
you always wanted to see that?

355
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:41,271
How... romantic.

356
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:43,047
We don't wanna be late.

357
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,505
College.

358
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,593
You can almost smell
the raging hormones.

359
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:50,611
Really?

360
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:54,661
Well, you could, but the stench of
your fear's a bit overpowering.

361
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,399
Spitter, what are you so afraid of?

362
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,676
Rejection.

363
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:58,952
Humiliation.

364
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:00,302
And clowns.

365
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,023
Well, those are scary things.

366
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,075
But let's try and maintain perspective.

367
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:06,705
You're asking a girl out on a date,
that's it.

368
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:09,457
It may comfort you to know that
when it comes to the softer sex,

369
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,934
I wasn't always gifted and talented.

370
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:13,284
- Really?
- Yeah.

371
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:15,091
Fifth grade was a bitch.

372
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,809
- But I rose above it, and so can you.
- How?

373
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:19,216
It's simple.

374
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,118
The secret to flirting, dating,
and hooking up...

375
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:23,192
It's all biology.

376
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,004
Don't you mean anatomy?

377
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:28,073
Can't you see I'm in lecture mode?

378
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:30,071
Where was I?

379
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:33,325
Biology.
There's this guy named Chuck Darwin.

380
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
Now, he proved

381
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:38,015
that mankind has evolved over billions
and trillions of years.

382
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:39,337
Darwin showed

383
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:43,163
that every aspect of human behavior has
an evolutionary purpose.

384
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:44,828
Right?

385
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,417
Chatting up girl is in our genetic code.

386
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:49,266
We're programmed to be able to do it.

387
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:51,873
Why? So we can boink and make babies.

388
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,334
It's survival of the flirtiest.

389
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:55,349
So you're saying I'm becoming extinct?

390
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,109
No. No, I'm saying evolution has
made us good at this.

391
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:00,941
You need to get out of your head
and just trust your instincts.

392
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:04,655
The ability to attract a female is
hardwired into your DNA.

393
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,308
That actually makes scientific sense.

394
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:08,318
Of course it does.

395
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,631
I was a bio major once.

396
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:11,374
Now let's go make Chucky D. proud.

397
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:16,564
Looks like someone had a night of
fiery passion.

398
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:18,193
Someone did.

399
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:19,929
Scarlett O'Hara.

400
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,815
Role play. Kinky.

401
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,718
No. Evan took me to a midnight movie.

402
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,095
I'm starting to think he's the one
avoiding sleeping with me.

403
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:31,286
What?

404
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:33,170
This month'smode...

405
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,686
"Treating and beating cheating."

406
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,685
It says "couples who don't reestablish

407
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:39,237
"their physical relationship
within two weeks of infidelity

408
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:42,529
"have a 2.5% chance of
long-term success."

409
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:44,282
really? And why is that?

410
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:48,091
Because one person stops seeing
the other in a sexual way.

411
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:50,915
What if that's happened to Evan?

412
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:52,396
That's ridiculous, Frannie.

413
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:55,964
Who do you think he fantasizes about
when he's playing solitaire?

414
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:58,613
- Me?
- I hope you're right.

415
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:01,645
But his most recent naked memory is of
Rebecca Logan.

416
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,802
All I'm saying is you have to
reestablish

417
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:12,890
your place as the object of
his fantasies.

418
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:17,384
As God is my witness,
I will rock Evan's world tonight.

419
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:26,742
If I find one drop of paint
on the floor, I'll gut you.

420
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:29,572
Have fun!

421
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:34,351
Calvin was just getting his backpack.

422
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:35,944
Calvin would be me.

423
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:38,052
I'm a dork. This is Casey.

424
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,676
- Rusty's sister.
- Genetically speaking, yes.

425
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:42,713
Rusty's my man.

426
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,228
Did you help him find a date?

427
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:47,095
Let's just say we agreed to part ways.

428
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:48,761
Gotcha.

429
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:50,997
Well, I should get going.

430
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:52,772
This has been really fun, Ash.

431
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:55,775
Nice break from
Alpha male fraternity life.

432
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:57,383
I had fun too.

433
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:02,605
Nice to meet you.

434
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:06,956
You have a boyfriend.

435
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,330
Please. He's like my personal assistant.

436
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:14,209
Plus, he's really into it like planning,
shopping, decorating... All that crap.

437
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:15,881
Which is weird for a guy.

438
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,330
I've never met one who was
into that stuff who wasn't...

439
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,267
- Oh, my God!
- You mean he's...

440
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:21,292
Got a crush on me.

441
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:24,083
Not where I thought
you were going with that. But...

442
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,109
I see your point.

443
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:26,554
So he fancies you.

444
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,092
It's adorable.

445
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:29,668
It's anti-adorable.

446
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:32,341
Did you forget Sam,
the stalker freshman year?

447
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,353
Creepy Craig last semester?

448
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:36,024
You do attract the crazies.

449
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:38,064
Right? I mean, I've seen this before.

450
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:39,893
Soon he's gonna be stealing locks
of my hair

451
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,280
and carving my name into his arm.

452
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:43,597
I need to shut him down before
this becomes drama.

453
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:46,786
The date function is tonight.

454
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,491
I don't think I have time to bulk up.

455
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,067
We're not here to work out.

456
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,815
The gym is the ideal place
to meet women.

457
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:54,320
How? How so?

458
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:56,827
Think about it.

459
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,977
A totally non-threatening environment,

460
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:02,281
all filled with women in tight clothes,
all high on endorphins.

461
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:05,034
Chuck Darwin would call this
the Galapagos Islands of dating.

462
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:08,315
Let's find you a friend.

463
00:22:11,904 --> 00:22:13,860
Good choice. Make me proud.

464
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,518
Remember. Trust your instincts.

465
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:51,679
Small ones give the best burn.

466
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,643
Your biceps are very bulbous.

467
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:06,548
Is that an insult?

468
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:08,086
No. No, not at all.

469
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:11,029
Bulbous is an adjective meaning bulging.

470
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,114
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

471
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,146
I have one of those word of
the day calendars.

472
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,456
That was today's word.

473
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:18,848
And when I saw your arms, I thought,

474
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,906
what a perfect opportunity to use it
in a sentence.

475
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,867
At least it's just bruised.

476
00:23:47,113 --> 00:23:48,386
My toe or my ego?

477
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,949
Lucky for you, I was a psych major once.

478
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,571
Now, I've diagnosed your condition,
and while more serious than I thought,

479
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,015
- there is a cure.
- Really?

480
00:23:56,072 --> 00:23:57,378
What's the matter with me?

481
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,566
You're suffering from virginitis.

482
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:02,703
What makes you think I'm a virgin?

483
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,089
Rusty, this is serious.

484
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:08,114
Right now,

485
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:11,189
your innocence is cute and endearing,

486
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:14,056
but if left untreated,
your 30s will not be pretty.

487
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:15,609
It's not that big of a deal.

488
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,552
I your virgin mind,
women are like these...

489
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:23,527
mythical creatures.

490
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:25,717
Like unicorns. With breasts.

491
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:27,311
But let me tell you something.

492
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:28,312
That's a myth.

493
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:30,650
Women are normal people with breasts.

494
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:33,270
And you need to have sex with one
so that you can see that.

495
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:36,080
How am I gonna do that when
I can't even find a date for tonight?

496
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:37,865
Look, I've taken care of everything,
okay?

497
00:24:38,017 --> 00:24:39,513
You have a date with Lisa Lawson.

498
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:41,582
She's an old friend who's very...

499
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,266
friendly.

500
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:44,849
- Cappie, I don't know...
- Relax.

501
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:47,374
Tonight is your inaugural bal.

502
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:49,466
It's gonna be fun.

503
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,799
Hello.

504
00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:00,482
I'd like you to meet Brian,
Sanjay, and Ted.

505
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:01,565
Nice to meet you guys.

506
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,287
These guys are
my purity pledge brothers.

507
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:05,394
We're like a fraternity, but for God.

508
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:07,426
Purity pledge... Activate.

509
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:09,458
Amen!

510
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:12,565
Awesome.

511
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:15,259
Well don't mind me.

512
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:16,721
Actually, you're why they're here.

513
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:19,037
- Me?
- I know you're hoping

514
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,749
to lose your virginity tonight, so
I thought what a great chance

515
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,882
for the guys to hear firsthand
from somebody on the brink of making

516
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:26,574
such a colossal mistake.

517
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:29,382
- Dale, I don't feel like I'm making...
- Who's got a question?

518
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:30,405
Anybody? Brian.

519
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:32,247
Are you in love?

520
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:33,310
No.

521
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:36,325
Have you both been tested
for the full array of STDs?

522
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:37,522
No.

523
00:25:37,523 --> 00:25:40,427
- What will you do if she gets pregnant?
- Enough! Look.

524
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:44,046
I know you guys think virginity is
like this precious gift,

525
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:45,353
but you know what?

526
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:46,499
It's not.

527
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:48,115
It's a big fat burden.

528
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:52,439
It's one that's making me feel
like I'm this lonely, awkward loser.

529
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:54,261
And I'm tired of feeling that way.

530
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:56,616
And tonight,
I have a chance to change that.

531
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:59,046
So I'm gonna give my gift away.

532
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:01,936
I'm gonna give it to a girl named Lucy.

533
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:05,904
Or laura.

534
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:09,170
Or something that begins with an l.

535
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,865
Can it, Ted.

536
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,371
Let's pray for him.

537
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:30,058
All hands on deck.

538
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:34,505
You fell for me.

539
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:35,818
Put me down.

540
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:40,059
Thank you, pledge.

541
00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:41,858
Please have that ladder removed.

542
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,301
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:48,979
Land ho!

544
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:49,998
Why, thank you!

545
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,316
- You're looking pretty dapper yourself.
- Thank you.

546
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:54,652
I just hope Casey likes her man
in uniform.

547
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:57,458
Well, just make sure you're an officer
and a gentleman tonight.

548
00:26:57,477 --> 00:26:58,477
Yes, Sergeant.

549
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:24,379
I want you to stay loose.

550
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,933
Don't get caught in the corner.

551
00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:27,869
You just gotta look her in the eye.

552
00:27:28,268 --> 00:27:29,268
And talk.

553
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:33,129
What's her name again?

554
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,179
Lisa Lawson.

555
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:41,327
What if she doesn't like me?

556
00:27:41,508 --> 00:27:42,628
Come on, Spitter.

557
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,843
What's not to like?

558
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:46,331
Besides...

559
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,172
She likes everybody.

560
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:52,026
There she is now.

561
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:54,703
That's her?

562
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:55,874
That's her.

563
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,950
Godspeed.

564
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,259
I remember you.

565
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:06,645
You spit on me.

566
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:08,992
Sorry.

567
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,346
You're cute.

568
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,574
How about making it up to me by
getting me a drink?

569
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:15,201
Sure.

570
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,620
Ten-hut!

571
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:35,016
Now, is that any way to greet
your commanding Officer?

572
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,915
You've got to follow orders.

573
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:38,681
If I remember correctly, you like that.

574
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:39,817
Look...

575
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:41,508
Rebecca,

576
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:44,128
I made a huge mistake hooking up
with you.

577
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:47,565
I love my girlfriend.

578
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:51,643
I got that sense when you were
taking my bra off with your teeth.

579
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,085
Hiya, Soldier.

580
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:12,751
Care to dance?

581
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:47,848
Your skin is very taut.

582
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:53,110
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

583
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:57,002
That sounded like I wanted to
make a coat out of it.

584
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,648
I'm just really bad at talking to girls.

585
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:01,730
Especially pretty girls.

586
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:05,504
Since you're the prettiest girl
I've ever seen, this is especially hard.

587
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:08,637
You know, we can get a little closer.

588
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,755
I'm guessing this is your first time.

589
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:17,179
Do I have virgin written on my forehead?

590
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:19,400
I was talking about dancing.

591
00:30:20,255 --> 00:30:21,255
Gotcha.

592
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:23,805
Don't worry.

593
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:26,469
I'm a good teacher.

594
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:52,262
God, you look amazing

595
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:54,388
I wanted tonight to be special.

596
00:30:54,597 --> 00:30:56,002
Well, it is. It is special.

597
00:30:57,695 --> 00:30:59,783
I got something that'll make it
even more special.

598
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:04,910
I booked us a room
at the University Inn.

599
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:07,643
Why would you do that?

600
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:09,143
Because...

601
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:11,213
I would like us to have sex.

602
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,485
Tonight.

603
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:16,225
Okay. Tonight.

604
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:17,337
Tonight tonight?

605
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:18,869
Yeah.

606
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,250
Let's go now. I can't wait.

607
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:29,243
After this dance.

608
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:56,692
Cap,

609
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,496
do you mind if we use your room?

610
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:02,008
Nothing could possibly make me
more proud.

611
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,184
Could you snap one of me?

612
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,912
I want my boyfriend to see
how hot I look.

613
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,836
Wait. I have to work all my angles.

614
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:28,565
- Ash, let's get a picture?
- Oh, my God!

615
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:30,578
Can I just get one moment of peace?

616
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:33,399
Listen, I know you're in love with me
and I know you see me

617
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,476
as this perfect specimen of
the female form, and you're right.

618
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:38,723
But I have a boyfriend.

619
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,733
So shove off, Sailor, and respect
my boundaries, and just...

620
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:43,343
leave me alone!

621
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,648
I'm gonna run upstairs,

622
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:51,015
I'm gonna grab my wallet,

623
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:52,535
and I'll be right back.

624
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:02,369
Rusty's buddy.

625
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:04,976
Did my little brother find a date?

626
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:06,439
Yeah. Cappie set him up.

627
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:07,974
I wonder who it is.

628
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:11,107
- He said Lucy Lawless?
- Lisa Lawson?

629
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:12,778
Yeah, that's her. You know her?

630
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,588
Everyone knows her. She's slept with
half the male student body.

631
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:16,898
She's the virgin whisper.

632
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:19,425
Do me a favor.

633
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:21,305
Tell Evan I'll meet him at the hotel.

634
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:39,714
Something's vibrating.

635
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:42,308
It's my cell phone.

636
00:33:45,477 --> 00:33:46,477
Mom?

637
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:50,351
I'll call you later.

638
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,751
Where were we?

639
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,287
Lisa, wait.

640
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:01,080
- Did it happen already?
- What?

641
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:03,728
Oh. No.

642
00:34:04,804 --> 00:34:05,893
It's not that.

643
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:08,159
It's just...

644
00:34:09,386 --> 00:34:11,455
This isn't really
how I imagined my first time.

645
00:34:12,865 --> 00:34:13,919
Don't get me wrong.

646
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:17,640
You are way better than
I have ever imagined.

647
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:23,410
It's just... I just thought
it would mean some... More.

648
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,357
That's sweet.

649
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,656
I felt that way once too.

650
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:33,135
- What happened?
- Well, I had sex.

651
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:37,168
Turns out it was like crazy fun.

652
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:56,757
Where is Rusty?

653
00:34:57,008 --> 00:34:59,880
- Good evening to you too.
- Cut the crap. I need to talk to him.

654
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,649
- What's the big emergency?
- Lisa Lawson, Cap?

655
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:05,251
She's even easier to get
into bed than you are.

656
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:06,365
Really?

657
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,936
Damn it, I'm losing my edge.
But I'm afraid you're too late.

658
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:11,085
Rusty and Lisa are indisposed.

659
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,865
Undisposed? Predisposed.

660
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:16,828
They're up in my room doin' it.

661
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:20,805
One sec.

662
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:26,910
Whoa there, doll. You do realize
what you're about to do.

663
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:29,405
I'm stopping Rusty from making
a huge mistake and probably

664
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:32,126
- ...go blind in the process.
- What is the big deal? He's 18.

665
00:35:32,245 --> 00:35:34,980
He can vote. But he can't hook up
with a really hot girl?

666
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:38,196
- Jeez, Case, this is just sex.
- No, it's not.

667
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:41,233
- It's his first time.
- Okay, so it'll be brief, but still.

668
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,324
Have you forgotten about our first time?

669
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:49,179
You can be as cocky as you want.

670
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:51,689
But it was more than just sex.

671
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:54,547
It was pretty amazing, right?

672
00:35:55,094 --> 00:35:57,764
It was awkward, uncomfortable,
and terrifying.

673
00:35:58,408 --> 00:35:59,470
But...

674
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:01,722
We were in love.

675
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,837
It was a perfect moment in time
that I look back on

676
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,928
with no regrets.

677
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,821
Rusty deserves the same.

678
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:15,581
Stay here. I'll go in.

679
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,565
Avon calling

680
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:31,509
Rusty isn't in there
with you by any chance?

681
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,311
He went home.

682
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:35,627
Carry on.

683
00:36:38,484 --> 00:36:39,931
Did you want the light on or off?

684
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:55,728
You look like you could use this.

685
00:36:58,284 --> 00:36:59,313
You doin' okay?

686
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,501
I miss my boyfriend.

687
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:03,560
I wanna do that.

688
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:08,680
Well, think about it this way.

689
00:37:09,131 --> 00:37:10,579
You could do that if you wanted to.

690
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,117
- And your point is?
- My point is you're gorgeous

691
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:17,206
All right? And any guy in here
would want to make out with you.

692
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,326
But you're committed to your man,
and that takes character.

693
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:22,498
That's so sweet.

694
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:25,554
It's making me a little nauseous.

695
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:27,999
Here.

696
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,224
Hurl into this.

697
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:35,325
You're a real nice guy, Calvin.

698
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:38,542
At another time, it might
have been you and me.

699
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:40,762
Perhaps.

700
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:44,462
How 'bout I help you home?

701
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:46,553
Thanks.

702
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:49,600
But i am perfectly fine.

703
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,619
Okay, you can help me.

704
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:07,118
Why the long face?

705
00:38:09,084 --> 00:38:11,079
Case, I just wanna be alone right now.

706
00:38:11,594 --> 00:38:12,816
Okay.

707
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:19,057
You should know I'm a bad listener.

708
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:23,537
You should also know I'm proud of you.

709
00:38:23,955 --> 00:38:25,145
What for?

710
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,555
Uh... How do I put this?

711
00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:34,023
I know you could have studied tonight.

712
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:37,047
- Is studying a euphemism for...
- Yes.

713
00:38:37,337 --> 00:38:39,975
- Just go with it.
- Gotcha.

714
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,035
Tonight was completely study-free.

715
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,252
I'm not sure if I'll ever get
the chance to study again, actually.

716
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:50,279
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Come on.

717
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:54,592
You said yourself that i'm not exactly
the most desirable study buddy.

718
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:56,137
I was wrong.

719
00:38:59,418 --> 00:39:01,926
I was trying to make you
into someone you're not.

720
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,895
But you've always been an individual.

721
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:07,083
It's something I envy about you.

722
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:10,976
Let's not get carried away.

723
00:39:11,297 --> 00:39:12,617
Let's not get carried away.

724
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:14,161
Listen...

725
00:39:14,574 --> 00:39:16,344
you'll know when it's time to study.

726
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:21,202
Someday you'll meet
someone you love and trust,

727
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:24,129
Someone you feel safe with.

728
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:26,991
You deserve that.

729
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:30,690
So do you.

730
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:47,206
There you are.

731
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:49,297
I missed you.

732
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:54,155
Evan, um...

733
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:55,956
This isn't working.

734
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:58,867
I agree. You wanna move to the bed?
Let's move to the bed.

735
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:00,305
No, i meant...

736
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:03,554
This isn't working.

737
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:07,544
I thought this is what you wanted.
You rented the room.

738
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:11,034
I was trying to force myself
to sleep with you.

739
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,373
Well, that... That killed the mood.

740
00:40:16,908 --> 00:40:18,924
Glad to hear this is
such a chore for you, Case.

741
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,356
I'm just not over what happened yet.

742
00:40:21,817 --> 00:40:24,343
- I thought you didn't want to talk
about that. - I didn't.

743
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,478
I don't.

744
00:40:25,736 --> 00:40:28,213
- But, Evan, what you did really hurt.
- Don't do that.

745
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:31,366
- Do what? - Make me out to be
the only bad guy here.

746
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:34,358
All right? We're even.
That's what you said.

747
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,516
I'm not an idiot. I know what you meant.

748
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:38,077
Don't play this off as my fault.

749
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:40,554
- You started this.
- Yeah. And you ended it.

750
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:43,049
I did what I did out
of anger and betrayal.

751
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,807
What's your excuse?

752
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:48,989
- You know what? Just forget it.
- No. No, I wanna know.

753
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:50,727
Why did you do it?

754
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,076
- I don't know.
- ...how you just tripped

755
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:55,167
- and fell into bed with her?
- I freaked out!

756
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:56,711
- About what?
- About us.

757
00:40:57,901 --> 00:40:59,156
We're in college.

758
00:40:59,649 --> 00:41:00,903
I don't know if you've noticed,

759
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,853
but college relationships are not
exactly built to last.

760
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:07,231
I see.

761
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:09,676
So in your head,
we weren't that serious.

762
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:14,244
No. No. In my head, we were too serious.

763
00:41:14,984 --> 00:41:16,593
I pictured forever with you.

764
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:21,372
We were the perfect married couple.
We had three kids and a volvo.

765
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:24,270
We had a beach house in the outer banks

766
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:26,102
with a Jack Russell terrier named
Schnitzel.

767
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,482
- What's so bad about that?
- It's not bad.

768
00:41:29,673 --> 00:41:30,831
It's wonderful.

769
00:41:32,738 --> 00:41:34,057
Look, it just... It just felt...

770
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:36,502
So final, you know?

771
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:38,914
Permanent.

772
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:42,682
I wigged out and...

773
00:41:43,422 --> 00:41:45,062
Well, you know the rest.

774
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:48,183
I still think about that future.

775
00:41:48,987 --> 00:41:50,403
I am not ready to give up on it.

776
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,413
How about...

777
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:08,019
We try to get through fall semester

778
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,432
before we worry about the future?

779
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:14,857
Agreed.

780
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:20,807
Now it's my turn to ask you a question.

781
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:23,532
- Look, things between Cap...
- Can you forgive me?

782
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:30,864
I can.

783
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:45,391
You wanna see Iffrasier'son?

784
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:48,615
I could go for some serious cuddling.

785
00:42:58,712 --> 00:42:59,767
Fyi.

786
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:03,035
I am not driving a Volvo.
