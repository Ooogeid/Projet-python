00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:01,198
<i>Previously on</i> GREEK

2
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:04,133
I've been through an awful lot
in the past year. And, sometimes,

3
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:05,591
it's not enough.

4
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:07,022
Evan, are you about to...

5
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:09,111
Your letters.

6
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:11,820
- Casey got lavaliered by Evan.
- It was supposed to be a secret.

7
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,770
I thought this was just a fling.

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,999
I realize that...

9
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:16,821
I really like you.

10
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:18,472
And I don't know what that means.

11
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,078
I would like to find out.

12
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:22,878
Travis isn't exactly quality glue.

13
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,134
You need to dump him.

14
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:25,735
But I thought everyone liked Travis.

15
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:27,681
It doesn't matter what your sisters...

16
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:28,911
want or what I think.

17
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,520
You love who you want to love.

18
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:32,724
If that's a problem, you just...

19
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:34,447
keep your private life private.

20
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,284
Friends tell each other the truth.

21
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:37,833
What you did to me sucks.

22
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:40,369
Sometimes you outgrow
the people you love.

23
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:46,278
I saw that first.

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,820
Look.

25
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:49,826
Going after something else that's mine.

26
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:52,704
- It must be Monday.
- It's tough to avoid when you think

27
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:53,821
everything is yours.

28
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:55,817
- Is it?
- Speaking of yours.

29
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:58,724
Is that Jen K. wearing your skirt?

30
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:06,100
to prepare you.

31
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:10,112
I was talking to this girl
in my spanish class.

32
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:13,568
And she says she knows this guy who
worked on <i>Laguna Beach</i> second season,

33
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:14,688
and he says

34
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,939
that it's not really real,

35
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:19,591
which, if you think about it,
makes a little bit of sense.

36
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:21,342
Reality just isn't that good.

37
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:22,597
What do you think?

38
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:23,935
Whatever.

39
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,903
I know breaking up sucks.

40
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,197
You and Travis had a long history.

41
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:33,036
But it'll help if you just
get your mind off things.

42
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,268
Forget about him.

43
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,403
- I'm fine.
- So,

44
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:41,158
<i>National</i> just called asking
about our philanthropy hours,

45
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,339
which we have very few of,

46
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,497
thanks to an ex-sister/philanthropy
chair named Libby.

47
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,932
The last thing we need is <i>National</i>
on our backs.

48
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:49,936
The good news is

49
00:01:49,937 --> 00:01:52,835
Libby did set something up
with an after-school program called

50
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:54,151
the "Bible Bunch."

51
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:55,978
The bad news is
she didn't follow through,

52
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,556
we need to set something up pronto.

53
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:58,557
No worries.

54
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,517
The dynamic duo are on the case.

55
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:01,909
Thank you.

56
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
I can't help.

57
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:09,007
You can do this.

58
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,576
It's just what you need
to get over Travis.

59
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:14,007
You handle wardrobe.
Think charitable, non-profit.

60
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,625
I'll call bible bunch,
set up a meeting...

61
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:16,635
Really. I can't.

62
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:18,624
I have a paper to write,

63
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:19,711
a project.

64
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:23,081
I'm also growing out my bangs,
which requires extra sleep.

65
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,121
But I need you.

66
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,988
And it will take your mind off things.

67
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:30,081
Come on.

68
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:32,425
We're Mary-Kate and Ashley.

69
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:33,729
Sorry,

70
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:35,637
I just have a lot going on right now.

71
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,296
Looks like Mary-Kate lost her Ashley.

72
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:51,637
Basic scuba.

73
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:52,946
That'd be fun.

74
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:55,386
Or not.

75
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:56,784
It's your elective.

76
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:58,277
It could be our elective course.

77
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,509
Should we take a class
together next semester?

78
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:02,611
- Why didn't I think of that?
- I don't know.

79
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,577
You're such a smart guy though.

80
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:06,278
I bet you're full of good ideas.

81
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,677
My boyfriend from high school

82
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:09,475
never thought of anything like that.

83
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:11,126
Your high school boyfriend?

84
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,096
Grady.

85
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:15,847
He never initiated, especially
in the romance department.

86
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:17,124
Like what?

87
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:22,654
Like our first date,

88
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,197
our first kiss.

89
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,493
Ignore it.
You were saying?

90
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:28,736
I was the one who was always
pushing things forward.

91
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,421
You know, and then
finally I broke up with him.

92
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,649
Right,

93
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,739
Right, not like ours
where we held hands,

94
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,159
we kissed the first night.

95
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:37,326
Exactly.

96
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:38,766
It's funny because...

97
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:42,391
before you mentioned it, I was thinking
we should take a class together.

98
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,161
Who is <i>SkynyrdAngel501</i>?

99
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,894
Dale, I'm right here.

100
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,407
I promised I'd leave you guys alone
until 10:00, but look,

101
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:49,632
here it is 10:20.

102
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,327
I don't appreciate you taking
advantage of my good nature.

103
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,968
My interpretation was that you'd
actually leave the room.

104
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,793
There's two names on that door.

105
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,044
- Go read 'em.
- It's fine.

106
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:00,295
I have to meet somebody downstairs.

107
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:04,974
Will you walk me to class?

108
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,518
I was just gonna suggest that.

109
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:14,244
Yes, I was going to suggest that.

110
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Stop <i>AIM</i>-ing me.

111
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:20,152

- Cleaning?
- The house is a mess.

116
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,890
Have you seen the surface build-up?

117
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:37,698
There's mold growing on mold.

118
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:40,757
It never bothered you before.

119
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:44,712
The keg explosion of '06.

120
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:46,188
Good-bye, old friend.

121
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:48,964
I actually came to get your advice
on something.

122
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,528
I think I'm ready to use the L-word

123
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,775
with Jen.

124
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:54,356
That's a pretty bold move.

125
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,177
What makes you think she's a lesbian?
Is it a deal-breaker?

126
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,849
Not that L-word.

127
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,858
I want to tell her I love her.

128
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:04,111
If you need to say "I love you,"

129
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,605
call your mom.

130
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,549
All right, listen, young padawan.

131
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:14,275
"<i>Love</i>"...

132
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:15,922
was invented by women

133
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,090
to rob men

134
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:18,733
of their reason

135
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:21,127
for living and their manhood.

136
00:05:21,574 --> 00:05:23,161
Love is a vicious trap.

137
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,850
It's an e-ticket ride straight
to the depths of hell.

138
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:28,476
Can't be that bad.

139
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:29,971
Yeah, until it's over.

140
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,884
And you're curled up with a...

141
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:34,214
pint of ice cream watching
<i>Never Been Kissed</i>

142
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,149
and writing in your journal.

143
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,004
So just kick back, relax.

144
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,340
Don't ruin everything by making it all

145
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,090
serious and mushy.

146
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:45,574
You're wrong.

147
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:48,396
I need to make a move,
a bold move.

148
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,380
Standing still's the worst thing
I can do.

149
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:51,699
You're...

150
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,395
defying the master?

151
00:05:55,374 --> 00:05:56,449
Be careful, spitter.

152
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,089
Remember what happened to Anakin.

153
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,711
Cap, I'm ready.

154
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,561
You've only been dating her for 3 weeks.

155
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,025
When you know, you know.

156
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,324
I'm gonna tell her.

157
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,130
My big bro's gonna be happy for me.

158
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:08,873
Well, I'm worried for you.

159
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,034
Does that count?

160
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:18,776
Excuse me.

161
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,994
I'm looking for the director
of the after-school program.

162
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,134
That'd be me.

163
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,025
Casey Cartwright, Zeta Beta.

164
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:39,224
I'm here about volunteering.

165
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:40,325
Rusty's sister?

166
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:42,494
I'm his roommate, Dale Kettlewell.

167
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:44,823
You're the confederate flag guy.

168
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,200
Thank you.

169
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,016
You don't look anything
like your brother.

170
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:51,198
Thank you.

171
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:54,612
I pretty much gave up on you
after I never heard back from Libby.

172
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:58,047
Let me assure you, that is not
the Zeta Beta way.

173
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:01,173
I just chalked it up
to the unreliability of organizations

174
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,373
whose sole purpose seems
to be personal pleasure,

175
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:06,307
bodily self-destruciton,
and the relinquishment of all virtue.

176
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,583
So what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like that?

177
00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:15,810
Our sorority is all about philanthropy.

178
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:17,416
How can we help you all?

179
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:18,697
Immediately?

180
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:21,561
Let's see.
The basketball court needs repainting.

181
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,757
The gym floor needs waxing.

182
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:26,262
You could hose bird feces

183
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,302
off the building exterior
with a pressure washer.

184
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:30,133
It's more fun than it sounds.

185
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:32,531
So many to choose from.

186
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,789
This is a great room.

187
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,414
It'd be perfect for a party.

188
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,571
Or...

189
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:40,435
I know, a show.

190
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,563
A show.

191
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,106
Something for the kids.

192
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:44,470
We have the perfect thing.

193
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:46,016
Called "leading a good life."

194
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,418
It's a catchy title.

195
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:48,875
- It sounds positive.
- It is.

196
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:52,167
It's an "edu-taining" musical

197
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,198
that covers everything
from dental hygiene

198
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:55,544
to menopause.

199
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:58,585
Well, these kids could use
some old-fashioned values.

200
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:00,398
It would be perfect.

201
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,197
I don't know.

202
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:04,825
The bible bunch kids
are serious at-risk youths.

203
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,754
Some of them are gang members.

204
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:08,906
Some are even atheists.

205
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,932
Let's give it a shot.

206
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:18,780
Amen.

207
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:25,613
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

208
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,641
<i>Waiting for Godot</i>?

209
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:32,356
More like, "Waiting to go home".

210
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,578
- I didn't think it was that bad.
- What?

211
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:36,237
- You liked it?
- No.

212
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:39,351
I thought it was kinda slow
and a little pretentious,

213
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,258
at least we tried something new.

214
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,343
Why can't we do something old
that we know is fun?

215
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:45,775
Like bowling? Again?

216
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,867
Look, you can only enjoy it
so many times

217
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,639
before you start to understand
why it's not a real sport.

218
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,024
Okay, this is dumb.

219
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,473
Go grab some ice cream?

220
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,781
Actually I'm pretty beat.

221
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:02,727
You know, and I got that chem lab...

222
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:05,236
in the morning. So...

223
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:08,810
Probably wouldn't be bad
to get a decent night's sleep.

224
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:11,661
See ya later.

225
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,613
Ash, you should have been there.

226
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,432
The outfit worked like a charm.

227
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:26,004
And he loves "leading a good life."

228
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,446
Great.

229
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:33,197
You think Frannie'll be
Marie Antoinette again?

230
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:37,710
I need to find a replacement
for the fuzzy bunny.

231
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,887
Any ideas?

232
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:42,062
Are you listening to me?

233
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:46,197
Fuzzy bunny.

234
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:48,355
G'night.

235
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:55,849
If you're not gonna help with the show,

236
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,762
the least you can do is talk to me
about it when I come home.

237
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,254
Is that too much to ask?

238
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:02,247
I had a hard day too.

239
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,995
But you didn't ask me about that.

240
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:05,820
Right, sorry.

241
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:08,158
How are those bangs coming?

242
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,653
I've apologized, like,

243
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,237
50 times for being part
of the anti-Travis mob.

244
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,929
Even though I still think dumping him
was the right decision.

245
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:25,277
Now, you need to stop moping

246
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
and move on.

247
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:29,078
It's not about Travis.

248
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:31,555
This is about you not suqporting me.

249
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,358
I am supporting you...

250
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,978
by supporting what's best...

251
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,530
- for you.
- What's best?

252
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:37,864
According to who?

253
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,561
Maybe you're just too close
to the situation

254
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,160
to have a healthy perspective.

255
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,211
Maybe you don't know everything.

256
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:48,360
I did what everybody else wanted me
to do about Travis.

257
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,678
At least let me feel
how I wanna feel afterwards.

258
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:53,911
Fine, I mean, if you wanna

259
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:57,269
brood and withdraw
and blame me.

260
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:59,458
Where are you going?

261
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:00,557
I'm moving on.

262
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:04,976
If you find my behavior so annoying,

263
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:07,289
then I'll spare us both
and sleep downstairs.

264
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,844
- Fine?
- Fine!

265
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:27,789
I love...

266
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:31,196
Chimichangas.

267
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:36,347
Have you ever noticed
how the majority of the dishes are

268
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,146
made from the same three ingredients?

269
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:40,936
Every dish is meat, cheese,
and tortilla.

270
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,500
I know!
It's in everything.

271
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:44,933
Burritos, tacos, enchiladas.

272
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,753
It's all the same basic combo.

273
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,319
Did you do something with your hair?

274
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
What?

275
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:52,920
Well, I really love...

276
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:56,510
It.

277
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,411
Thanks.

278
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,671
Anywho, so I used to work
at this little mexican restaurant

279
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,569
for, like, a week. And they had five
or six big pots on the stove.

280
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,859
And no matter what you order,
it came out of those pots.

281
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:09,696
That's crazy.

282
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,587
I know, and there was a sauce
for the taco...

283
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:13,767
I love you.

284
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,870
Thank you.

285
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:47,035
What the hell are you doing?

286
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,134
Sorry, I didn't expect anyone
to be sleeping on the couch.

287
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:58,466
Three-second rule.

288
00:13:00,298 --> 00:13:01,766
What are you doing down here?

289
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,292
Don't tell anyone,

290
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:06,628
but the cook stashes cheesaritos for me
behind the paper towels in the pantry.

291
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,929
It's a little trick I learned
in my father's townhouse.

292
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,020
He always said fat was a bad photo op.

293
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:14,089
I guess that explains why the cook's
fingers are always slightly orange.

294
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:15,839
I thought it was
some weird skin disease.

295
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,890
My dad said that about our cook too.

296
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:20,695
So why are you down here?

297
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:21,943
I couldn't sleep.

298
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:24,946
Was that before
or after your gigantic fight with Casey?

299
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,495
I'm right next door.

300
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,398
It wasn't a fight.
It was a disagreement.

301
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:36,538
She just always thinks she knows
how to manage my life.

302
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:38,436
And a lot of the time, she does.

303
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,896
No, I get it.
Friends fight.

304
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:43,946
What?

305
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:46,419
I just never thought of you
as a person with...

306
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,010
friends.

307
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,391
I have several.

308
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:53,625
Like my best friend in DC.

309
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:55,444
She and I used to fight constantly.

310
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,100
We always made up though.

311
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,569
I really miss her now.

312
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,157
Would you prefer I drop them
on the ground first?

313
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:17,445
In here, spitter.

314
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:20,802
You're still cleaning?

315
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:22,722
Dirt works 24-7.

316
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,945
So my dinner with Jen K. was a disaster.

317
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,864
I'm not going to say,
"I told you so."

318
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,980
but you completely screwed up
by not taking my advice, didn't you?

319
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,231
You were right.

320
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:48,355
It was horrible.

321
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:49,635
I said it,

322
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:51,314
and she thanked me.

323
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,032
I mean, do you say, "you're welcome"
to something like that?

324
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:57,857
Then we just sat there
for the next hour.

325
00:14:58,604 --> 00:15:01,166
Eatin' dinner, complete awkward silence.

326
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,051
Well, at least she's polite.

327
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:07,833
Maybe it'll just blow over,
and she won't even notice.

328
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:10,862
Maybe I just need a break
from girls for a while.

329
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,891
Well, your instincts aren't all bad.

330
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,894
I have a surefire way to do that,

331
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,584
if you can trust me.

332
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:23,979
I'll never doubt you again.

333
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:25,415
Good.

334
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:27,532
Then it's off to...

335
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:31,426
the lunch buffet.

336
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:36,379
Here's your toothbrush.

337
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:41,009
Why does it taste like corn chips
and feet?

338
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,625
Don't you worry about that.

339
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:45,042
You just worry about
what you're gonna order at...

340
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:46,546
the lunch buffet.

341
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,357
I have class!

342
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,521
Come after.

343
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,078
Send out the bat signal
to all interested parties.

344
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:56,604
At least he stopped cleaning.

345
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:57,882
- Good job.
- Wait!

346
00:15:58,105 --> 00:15:59,305
What's the lunch buffet?

347
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:02,284
Caitlin will be playing
the role of dental floss.

348
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:04,625
Eva, you will be the pine cone.

349
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:07,542
And Frannie will direct
and embody the beautiful,

350
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,608
yet powerful, Marie Antoinette.

351
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:11,289
I know, right?

352
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,671
Actress, director...

353
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:13,915
Double threat.

354
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,632
So, Case... what about you and Ashleigh?

355
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:19,073
Actually,

356
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,396
Ashleigh seems to have
a lot of stuff going on right now.

357
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,967
I thought Jen K. could sub in.

358
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:27,474
Sub in for Ashleigh?

359
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,886
Are you okay with that, Ash?

360
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
It's fine.

361
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:36,108
I'd prefer a dance with a little
more freedom anyways, so...

362
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:38,916
I'd love to pair up with a new partner.

363
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:39,917
Like who?

364
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:43,667
Rebecca who?

365
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:50,708
We have some amazing ideas
for the sweet tooth number.

366
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,705
Maybe we'll dress up as cupcakes.

367
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:54,729
You have the body for it.

368
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:56,836
Let's get to work.

369
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,419
Okay, great.

370
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,286
You guys haven't seen Heath, have you?

371
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,069
I just need some notes from class.

372
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,021
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

373
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:11,685
I'll just get the notes later then.

374
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:13,640
You care to join us for lunch?

375
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:15,992
We're going to get our minds off girls.

376
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:19,179
All I know is "lunch buffet."

377
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,020
Man's gotta eat, right?

378
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:23,206
Sure.
Why not?

379
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:54,503
Welcome to the second happiest place
on Earth.

380
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,167
Let me show you guys around.

381
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,512
You expect a strip club
would be bigger... 

382
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,031
Cleaner.

383
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,055
I can't say I've had
too many expectations on the subject.

384
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:10,641
This is the lunch buffet.

385
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:12,590
Complimentary I might add.

386
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:14,768
They serve casserole.

387
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,115
No, those are buffalo wings.

388
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:18,893
Minced meat pie?

389
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:20,332
Warm taco meat.

390
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,952
Enough of "name that tray."

391
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,563
What, you don't like tacos?

392
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:25,067
That, and I'm about to puke.

393
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:27,097
Don't worry.

394
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:30,854
All right?
The food gets better after a few rounds.

395
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:41,319
Fake.

396
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:44,277
Fake.

397
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:49,305
I bet she has back problems.

398
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:54,401
Look where she's puttin' those bills.

399
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:56,292
Which'll go right back into circulation.

400
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:59,424
You know, by the end of the week,
it could end up under some kid's pillow

401
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,268
from the tooth fairy.

402
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,620
Lunch is on me today, guys.

403
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:11,329
Three beers.

404
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,293
What do you guys want?

405
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:15,591
Coke.

406
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,757
Excuse me, miss, do you...

407
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,867
Do you take student health insurance?

408
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,225
Yes, I do.

409
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:26,467
How'd you get wrangled into this?

410
00:19:26,688 --> 00:19:28,673
What's the worst thing you can imagine?

411
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:29,941
This.

412
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:33,279
Try telling your girlfriend "I love you"
and getting a "thank you" back.

413
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,066
Hey, man, don't...

414
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,617
Don't panic, you know.

415
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,489
I'm having trouble
with my he-friend too.

416
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:42,698
That's dating.

417
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,909
It's all about communication.

418
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,453
Maybe I should call her.

419
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:49,988
Face-to-face is usually better
in these situations.

420
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:51,694
She said, "thank you"
to my face.

421
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,091
Right.
Probably better to call.

422
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:01,896
<i>Hello?</i>

423
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:02,886
<i>Rusty?</i>

424
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,942
- Say something!
- <i>Rusty?</i>

425
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:11,666
I feel like we could have
planned that better.

426
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:15,739
In less than 24 hours I went
from boyfriend to moron to stalker.

427
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,754
Honeys, I'm home!

428
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:28,407
Out.

429
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:30,456
Let's try it again, all right?

430
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:59,078
Are you okay?

431
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:01,227
Just scouting out the other acts.

432
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:04,164
Maybe I should just stand, and you could

433
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:05,414
dance around me.

434
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,275
Trust me, you'll be fine.

435
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,165
There's a great dancer in all of us.

436
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:12,473
Yeah, buried deeper in some than others.

437
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:14,481
But they don't have me as a teacher.

438
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:18,603
All right.

439
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:21,889
Let's go.
Five, six, seven, eight.

440
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:28,268
I'm okay.

441
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:33,656
I don't want to put any pressure on you,
but the show is tomorrow.

442
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:34,858
I know.

443
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,764
I'm just a little preoccupied.

444
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:40,389
Rusty said "I love you."

445
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:46,299
After three weeks?

446
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:48,043
What did you say?

447
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,039
Thank you.

448
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,023
At least you were polite.

449
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,140
You don't feel the same way?

450
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,417
I don't know.

451
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:00,098
I mean, he just kind of took me
by surprise, you know?

452
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:01,652
Just know...

453
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:03,787
Rusty's new to all this.

454
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:08,308
I was just in the neighborhood.

455
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,278
I thought I'd come by,
see how our show's doing.

456
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:11,730
Really, really well.

457
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,727
You.
Hello.

458
00:22:17,524 --> 00:22:18,729
I'm just gonna go...

459
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:20,794
away.

460
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:25,399
Well...

461
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:28,294
Thanks for stopping by.

462
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:30,154
This is for you.

463
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:32,623
It's just some guidelines I typed up
last night.

464
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,398
Content control.

465
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,215
<i>All lyrics should be printed
and presented prior to performance</i>

466
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:40,497
<i>for approval.</i>

467
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:43,668
<i>Please ensure there is no nudity
during any part of the performance.</i>

468
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:44,913
Or implied intercourse.

469
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,502
<i>Side-breast and buttocks crack
is also prohibited.</i>

470
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,085
<i>Displays of anti-social behavior,
gang activity,</i>

471
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,429
<i>vulgarity, or the occult are prohibited.</i>

472
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,831
<i>See next page.</i>

473
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:59,680
- I'm sure we can handle this.
- Great.

474
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:04,155
One more thing,
I have great news.

475
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:06,312
I want my band to play.

476
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:08,215
You have a band.

477
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:10,229
We call ourselves <i>Darwin Lied</i>.

478
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:12,665
That I'm sure...

479
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:15,577
I'm sure is awesome, but we can't break
the continuity of the show.

480
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,791
The dental hygiene section...

481
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,340
It comes before table manners.

482
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,059
We'll come on afterwards.
You know.

483
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,611
Really go out with a bang.

484
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,994
Our show is more of a sunny experience.

485
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:30,854
Well, I admit <i>Darwin lied</i> has
a punishing sound,

486
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:32,903
but we're pretty positive too.

487
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,469
They're my purity pledge brothers.

488
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,371
Maybe...
Maybe you can work the lights.

489
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:42,256
You know, maybe we'll just scrap
the whole show, just use the band.

490
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:48,365
I guess you're in.

491
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:49,794
Great.

492
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,319
Trust me, you have no idea
how hard we rock.

493
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:57,667
Good to see...

494
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,472
Your first lap dance.

495
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:14,865
I remember when Egyptian Joe
treated me to my first,

496
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:17,065
and 17 through 20th.

497
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,791
Do you like?

498
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,506
She had Jen K.'s watch.

499
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,228
Spitter, what possessed you
to ignore my advice?

500
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,601
Have I ever led you afoul, like...

501
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,321
really afoul?

502
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:30,579
Like, of the law?

503
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,779
- I did it because of a law.
- Which one?

504
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,155
And together we'll fight it.

505
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:35,870
Newton's first law of motion.

506
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:37,078
It deals with inertia.

507
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:42,197
In an isolated system, a body at rest...

508
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:43,729
Your love life...

509
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:47,814
Will remain at rest unless disturbed by
an unbalanced force,

510
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:49,823
you and your L-word.

511
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,979
You were a physics major for a while.

512
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,103
Bingo.

513
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:59,707
I thought she was telling me if I didn't
take control of the relationship

514
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:02,009
and keep it moving forward,
then I'd lose her.

515
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,135
Relax.

516
00:25:13,727 --> 00:25:17,576
You see how we make rash decisions
when we disregard medical advice?

517
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,964
What you need is more lap dances, stat!

518
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,420
Should we get a lap dance?

519
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:28,944
You know, just to say we experimented
through college?

520
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,401
What are you doing here?

521
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:33,604
Rusty invited me.

522
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,811
Don't worry, I'll try not to hit on you
too hard in front of your brothers.

523
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:40,276
Relax.

524
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:42,874
- It's fun.
- It's not that. It's...

525
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:46,309
After I saw you last night,

526
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:47,569
I met this guy.

527
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:50,353
We hooked up.

528
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,041
With who?

529
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,628
It doesn't matter.

530
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,091
I was... I was mad at you.

531
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:00,668
It was stupid.

532
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:03,579
It'll never happen again.

533
00:26:07,694 --> 00:26:08,730
It won't.

534
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,704
I'm leavin'.

535
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:17,601
Why?
What's wrong?

536
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:18,951
Relationships suck.

537
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,838
Wait!
What...

538
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,987
Lunch today was great.

539
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:26,038
Time to round 'em up.
Let's go.

540
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,467
I think Cappie's gonna be a while.

541
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:36,855
<i>Did you finish it already?</i>

542
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,321
So it looks like your plan's working.

543
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,750
Casey's definitely sitting up
and taking notice.

544
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:50,630
Is it just me, or is there, like,
this weird vortex in this house?

545
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:52,855
Casey's at the center of it,

546
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:55,063
and we're all defined
by our relationship to her.

547
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:57,291
You're the sidekick.

548
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:58,294
I'm Satan.

549
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:01,172
I think you've done plenty to earn
the Satan name.

550
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:02,741
But that's not all I am.

551
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,765
Any more than all you are
is her sidekick.

552
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,531
- Could we please not use that term?
- Exactly.

553
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,570
We should be defining our own terms.

554
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,796
Casey's still my friend.

555
00:27:14,478 --> 00:27:16,625
I just don't want her
to keep seeing me as...

556
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,418
- What you said.
- Exactly.

557
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:24,339
Look, just 'cause you and I shared
a snack food and a dance

558
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:25,798
doesn't mean we're friends.

559
00:27:27,702 --> 00:27:29,334
But we don't have to be enemies either.

560
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:31,385
Just because of who we are to Casey.

561
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:37,318
For what it's worth,

562
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,548
I was appalled by the way our sisters,

563
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,075
Casey included,

564
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:43,157
ganged up on you to dump Travis.

565
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:45,811
Why would you care?

566
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,584
Because I've seen it before.

567
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,393
My dad almost divorced my mom
because she didn't poll well.

568
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:57,465
But there was a 4% margin of error,

569
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:59,036
so they're still together.

570
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:09,080
They're bringing the check now,
so we can go home.

571
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,702
We are home.
We got everything we need right here.

572
00:28:13,077 --> 00:28:14,079
Not everything.

573
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:17,754
You still hung up on that little minx?

574
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:19,102
After all this?

575
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:24,041
I had a little minx once.

576
00:28:25,382 --> 00:28:27,815
She was the fairest
of all the forest creatures.

577
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,816
But I let her get away.

578
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:32,915
Bad Cappie.

579
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,489
All this and the cleaning,
that was about a girl?

580
00:28:41,212 --> 00:28:42,662
We better get going.

581
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,416
I'm not leaving!

582
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:48,479
I can... I can sleep in the booth.

583
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:51,428
I can live off the casserole,
and I'll dance on the stage

584
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,931
to work off the casserole.

585
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,133
It's been nice knowing you, Spitter.

586
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,100
Take care.
You and your family.

587
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,660
There's something definitely wrong
with him.

588
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:06,478
He's fine.

589
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,737
I hear you,

590
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:09,483
but drunk and sloppy Cappie...

591
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,620
is way better than mop and scrub Cappie.

592
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,640
Your friend's credit card was rejected.

593
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:16,565
I hope for your sake
that you've got some cash.

594
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:20,382
$275?

595
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:22,156
He said he was buyin'.

596
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,666
None of you have any money
to cover Cappie?

597
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,680
Well, lucky for you I am
an amazing boyfriend.

598
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:47,493
By the way, why couldn't
Ashleigh play the lizard?

599
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:49,672
We're kinda in a fight.

600
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:51,876
She's bummed about her break-up
with Travis,

601
00:29:51,888 --> 00:29:54,659
and she's taking it out on me
because I didn't like him.

602
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:56,885
I thought I'd give her some space.

603
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,235
And she said thank you

604
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:01,817
by pairing with Rebecca,
which is fine by me.

605
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,663
I'm not her punching bag.

606
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:07,261
Yeah, you seem fine.

607
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,759
So if Ashleigh asked you to dump me,
would you do it?

608
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:14,796
It wasn't just me.

609
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,643
It was Frannie
and the standards board too.

610
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:18,844
But you know how much
your opinion matters to her.

611
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,863
She's been your biggest fan
since freshman year.

612
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:24,719
During rush,

613
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:27,033
I was actually close
to taking a bid at Tri-Pi,

614
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,527
and Ashleigh found out that
one of the girls hated me

615
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:31,536
and was gonna ding me out
two weeks later,

616
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,802
and she keyed the girl's car.

617
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,911
You never told me that.

618
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:40,625
Someone keyed my car this rush.

619
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,207
But like I was saying,

620
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,169
we totally know each other.

621
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:48,324
We share the same opinions
and feelings about stuff.

622
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:50,186
We were always so in sync.

623
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,396
Now it's all...

624
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:53,912
weird.

625
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:57,665
If you're that much in sync,
I'm sure she feels the exact same way.

626
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:59,835
Yeah, she probably misses you too.

627
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:03,834
Yeah, that's you.

628
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,400
Hello?

629
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,356
<i>Check out the sexy librarian.</i>

630
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,085
I'd like to check you out
and get a late fee.

631
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,448
I'm not a stripper.

632
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:20,968
Good work, guys.

633
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,569
Save us, WonderWoman.

634
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:24,831
It's for "leading a good life."

635
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,510
I bet it is.

636
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,059
Guys.
My sister.

637
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,531
You want me to bail you
dorks out or not?

638
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:31,697
Please.

639
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,925
Your girlfriend doesn't say I love you
after 3 weeks,

640
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:40,529
and you end up in strip club?

641
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,572
She told you?

642
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:44,227
We're in a sorority,
not a secret society. That's what we do.

643
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:46,843
What'd you guys do?
Taser him?

644
00:31:47,737 --> 00:31:49,042
Come on.
Let's go.

645
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,636
That better be a 20, bro.

646
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:05,545
He's messed up.

647
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,699
I think some girl dumped him
or something.

648
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:15,692
275 bucks?

649
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:18,499
This is so typical Cappie.

650
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:22,585
What are you not saying?

651
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:29,101
Cappie and I may have revisited
our history recently.

652
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:30,888
Things kind of...

653
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,288
escalated.

654
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:34,557
Escalated how?

655
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:37,367
We kissed.

656
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,472
That's it. It was a big,
stupid lapse of judgment.

657
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,660
You're his minx.

658
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:46,198
His what?

659
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:48,815
I thought it was over between you guys.

660
00:32:49,615 --> 00:32:51,610
Just because we stopped dating,
doesn't mean...

661
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:53,372
all the feelings were gone.

662
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,040
You've been dancing around this
for 2 years,

663
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,756
when he finally tells you how he feels,
you dump him for Evan?

664
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:01,171
Surprising, right?

665
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,685
You led him on, Case.

666
00:33:03,158 --> 00:33:05,400
He probably thought all he had to do
was make his move.

667
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:06,967
And then when he finally opened up

668
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:09,049
and said something monumental,
you broke his heart.

669
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,547
Did you at least thank him?

670
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:14,706
We weren't right for each other,
and he knew it.

671
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:16,903
Evan and I have plans,

672
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:18,432
goals, ambitions.

673
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:19,948
Cappie has...

674
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:21,298
Kappa Tau.

675
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,804
What about love?
Do you love Evan?

676
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:34,074
Of course I do.

677
00:33:34,622 --> 00:33:36,547
But love isn't simple, Rusty.

678
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:41,569
And considering
what you're going through right now,

679
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:44,928
you of all people should
appreciate that.

680
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:56,848
You're psychic?

681
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,612
Waxed floors, remember?

682
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:03,691
I know that depressed shuffle anywhere.

683
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,659
What's with this welt on my head?
Did I enjoy it?

684
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:10,411
Absolutely.

685
00:34:11,197 --> 00:34:14,131
Although yesterday's excursion
has opened my eyes

686
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:15,471
to the perils of women.

687
00:34:15,614 --> 00:34:16,962
It's just a bump, spitter.

688
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:18,795
No, I mean relationships.

689
00:34:18,972 --> 00:34:20,006
They suck.

690
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,906
I never wanna go through
what you did with Casey.

691
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:26,792
I think I missed something.

692
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,859
She's the one who bailed us out
and took us home.

693
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:30,285
She told me...

694
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:31,846
About you two.

695
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:34,921
I should have taken your advice
in the first place.

696
00:34:35,597 --> 00:34:37,095
But you were right, spitter.

697
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:38,535
I was wrong.

698
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:42,159
What about?

699
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,440
Saying the L-word.

700
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,783
I said it, but I'm not even sure
if I meant it.

701
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,334
At least you said it.

702
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:51,541
By the time I came clean
to the pretty Cartwright,

703
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:53,948
the Evan train had
already left the station.

704
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:57,216
So...

705
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,389
how do you know...

706
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:00,625
when you mean it?

707
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,671
I don't know.

708
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:04,582
I guess it's a kind of...

709
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,779
burning, itching sensation.

710
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:09,234
But, you know, in a good way.

711
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,961
So you think if you would have told
Casey how you felt sooner,

712
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:15,597
you two would be together?

713
00:35:15,598 --> 00:35:16,664
Maybe.
Maybe not.

714
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:18,214
Maybe she just would've said...

715
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:20,341
"thank you."

716
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:23,268
The point is,
it's not some law or equation.

717
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:25,329
You can't predict the outcome.

718
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:26,989
Then why go through with it

719
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:28,234
all you know is

720
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:30,290
if it doesn't work out,
you'll be destroyed?

721
00:35:30,348 --> 00:35:34,209
Because what you get before it ends,
no matter how it ends,

722
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:35,408
can rock.

723
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,776
The truth is I wouldn't trade my time

724
00:35:38,918 --> 00:35:40,221
with Casey for anything.

725
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,203
Even a night with the naughty nurse?

726
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:50,286
That would explain the stethoscope.

727
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:58,971
Two minutes!
Let's go, ladies!

728
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:02,328
I need Casey's eyebrow pencil.

729
00:36:02,387 --> 00:36:04,037
It's the perfect color.

730
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:08,970
You know what?
I'm fine, thanks.

731
00:36:15,354 --> 00:36:17,186
Jen K., why aren't you dressed?

732
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:21,732
Come on, everyone!
Come on. Please!

733
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:25,157
Find that phone!

734
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:40,592
Give me that!
Who didn't turn off their phone?

735
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:41,835
It's mine.
I turned it off.

736
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:42,732
Sorry.

737
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:47,200
Let's go!
We're on!

738
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:05,446
You left without saying anything.

739
00:37:05,447 --> 00:37:07,495
Probably better you didn't hear
what I had to say.

740
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:09,206
I messed up.
I know.

741
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:11,189
We should have talked about it first.

742
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:12,967
Talk about it?

743
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:14,527
Before you cheated on me?

744
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,911
I'm not sure I even really
cheated on you.

745
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:19,490
I mean, this isn't exactly
a traditional courtship.

746
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,117
You always said you wanted
to keep things loose.

747
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,224
So now you can be free...

748
00:37:27,388 --> 00:37:28,507
to play the field.

749
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,417
If you want.

750
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:33,556
Totally.

751
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,122
Guess I'll see ya around.

752
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:18,533
I don't love you.

753
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:21,396
What?

754
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:24,794
I only said it because I wanted to prove
that I wasn't like your ex.

755
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:27,971
That I could take the initiative
in the romance department.

756
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:29,158
I just...

757
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,570
I took it a little too far.

758
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,305
So you don't love me?

759
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:38,462
I mean, not yet.

760
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:41,834
Well, maybe I do.

761
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:44,407
I don't know.

762
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,656
I'm not sure.

763
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,806
Look, here's what I do know...

764
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,986
I just... I want an experience that...

765
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,006
I wouldn't trade anything for, and
I want that experience to be with you.

766
00:38:57,522 --> 00:38:58,532
Thank you.

767
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:02,593
Me too...

768
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
With you.

769
00:39:06,114 --> 00:39:07,315
Can you...

770
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:09,621
What the hell was this show?

771
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:10,679
I'm stuck.

772
00:39:18,935 --> 00:39:20,270
<i>Not all angels are in heaven.</i>

773
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:22,195
<i>This song's for you, Casey Cartwright.</i>

774
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:05,951
Travis says he's sorry he had to

775
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,825
cancel your visit to <i>Providence</i>
next week,

776
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:09,485
but he misses you...

777
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:10,709
A lot.

778
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,281
So now what?

779
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:16,308
Now I apologize.

780
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:18,805
First for judging your love life.

781
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:21,530
I'm in no position to be judging
or organizing anyone else's.

782
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:23,841
Wanna talk about it?
Is it that bad?

783
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:26,116
No, Ash, for once
we need to talk about you.

784
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,293
We think alike so much,

785
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:30,314
I just assumed that applied
to everything.

786
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:33,079
I quit checking in on what you need.

787
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,332
That's the second apology I owe you.

788
00:41:36,904 --> 00:41:37,904
Accepted.

789
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:40,715
I know you want what's best for me.

790
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:45,916
I missed my Mary-Kate.

791
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,638
I missed my Ashleigh.

792
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:53,549
I love...

793
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,847
The cottage cheese on the ceiling.

794
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:01,747
I love...

795
00:42:02,756 --> 00:42:04,005
this song.

796
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:09,082
I love my comforter.

797
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,146
I think I might love you.

798
00:42:19,274 --> 00:42:20,530
I think I might too.

799
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:34,290
We can still move
our relationship forward.

800
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:36,850
If you want to.

801
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,039
I'd love that.
