<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,336
- Where's your car?
- I think it got stolen.

3
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:06,213
- Dude, what's going on?
- I'll call you tomorrow?

4
00:00:06,812 --> 00:00:08,132
I don't know what I'm doing.

5
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,020
You're dating
Rusty's little brother.

6
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:12,720
I go to the wedding.
I keep my feelings in check.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,580
Then I can stop worrying
about doing something stupid.

8
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:17,224
- Like{\tell her} how you feel?
- Exactly.

9
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,301
We shouldn't be doing this.
I'm dating Andy.

10
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:22,044
- I know...
- No, I have to go.

11
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:25,566
This is Robin Wylie, my big sis.

12
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,361
Bride-to-be has to kiss a girl.

13
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:30,992
Robin's gay.

14
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,706
- Maybe I could give you a call?
- I'd like that.

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,744
Are you sure you're OK
with what Max did?

16
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:40,518
What Max did was kinda overwhelming.

17
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,651
I'm sorry about
you giving up Caltech.

18
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,252
- I didn't want to lose you.
- We're supposed to be a couple.

19
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,797
Travel together down a shared path.

20
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:51,425
You're so far ahead,
I don't even see you anymore.

21
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:54,092
- What now, then?
- Slow down for a while?

22
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,681
Let me catch up?

23
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,337
Is this Comic-Con?

24
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:18,886
Funny and beautiful.

25
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,247
Dr. Magda Stephanopoulos is here.

26
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,748
She's a super-scientist.

27
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:25,334
Like a bipedal Stephen Hawking
in pumps.

28
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,340
- That's why the crowd?
- She's recruiting for an open spot

29
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:30,128
on her project research team
at Oxford.

30
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:32,557
- Is that why you're here?
- It's grad students only.

31
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:35,451
- I'm doing work study for Dr. Broom.
- Max's advisor?

32
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:38,889
Do you know where Max is?
He's not in his office.

33
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,521
He put him in a storage closet.
Room 108.

34
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,909
- We call it...
- The broom closet?

35
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:45,938
That's so much better.

36
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:49,358
That way?

37
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:59,399
Wow. This is... cozy.

38
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:03,440
It's really nice.

39
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,291
It's good. I've been...

40
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,835
grading some papers
on low-grade polymers.

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,637
They're good, too.

42
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,631
- You wanna grab lunch?
- I have to finish grading these{\by tonight}.

43
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,910
And...

44
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,843
these too.

45
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,108
- Let me help you beat this guy.
- Jump in.

46
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,885
I'm late for a team dinner as it is.

47
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:37,656
And we win it.
Thank you very much.

48
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,117
You win a week of toilet duty, pledge.
Enjoy.

49
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:47,193
Congratulations
on the Wisconsin game Saturday.

50
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,255
- Thank you.
- I'll bet Jordan was really excited.

51
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,860
Assuming you've seen her
since you got back.

52
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:54,924
- I saw her last night.
- Awesome.

53
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,355
I actually wanted to ask you
about that wedding?

54
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:03,703
- You do?
- Jordan... She's acting really strange.

55
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:07,186
And kind of distant. I know you guys
went to the wedding together.

56
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:10,564
Did anything happen
that would make her act so weird?

57
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:12,077
She...

58
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:15,548
- She had the swordfish.
- Stop!

59
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:16,867
Get back here!

60
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:21,655
Stop running! Stop!

61
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,395
What the hell was that?

62
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,254
I was sleeping off a big burrito{\in the basement}...

63
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,663
A bookcase fell. I woke up.

64
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:37,734
Some Omega Chi pledge...

65
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:40,511
... tried stealing a trophy.
I chased him.

66
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:42,680
Can you make oxygen?

67
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,021
OK. He must have snuck in
through a basement window.

68
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:47,601
- Pledge Andylicious, secure the window.
- I got it.

69
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,026
Stealing trophies...
So unoriginal.

70
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:56,569
What about the door
to the secret scary place?

71
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:05,411
Anyone know about this?

72
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:07,454
Let's see how far it goes.

73
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,741
- That's what she said.
- Good one.

74
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,552
Let's move this.

75
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:27,815
"Property of Cyprus-Rhodes
Biology Department, 1952."

76
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,372
VO: Kappa Team

77
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,269
seriessub.com/sub-way.fr

78
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:48,173
{\pos(192,240)}Thanks Joe. Say hi
to your mother for me.

79
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:52,082
Gentlemen, we are looking
at the fruits of Kappa Tau thievery.

80
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,087
{\pos(192,240)}We stole all this stuff?
Was that the night we drank absinthe?

81
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,422
{\pos(192,240)}Actually, we didn't do this.
Our KT alumni did.

82
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,092
You see, once upon a fraternity,
this house was full of kleptos.

83
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,802
- {\pos(192,240)}That's people who steal things.
- I know.

84
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:06,331
{\pos(192,240)}What's an alumni?

85
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:09,261
{\pos(192,240)}According to Egyptian Joe,
our old brothers

86
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:13,092
{\pos(192,240)}would steal any campus item
they could get their sticky fingers on.

87
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,419
{\pos(192,240)}I think those
are the original hands stolen

88
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:19,437
{\pos(192,240)}from the CRU clock tower in 1982.

89
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:23,363
{\pos(192,240)}And this is
the silver protractor awarded to Psi-Phi

90
00:05:23,593 --> 00:05:25,699
{\pos(192,220)}for their number one GPA,
ten years straight.

91
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,243
- Dorks.
- No way.

92
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,163
This guy is the Omega Chi founder.

93
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,499
{\pos(192,230)}- We got their founder.
- Are you kidding me?

94
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,419
{\pos(192,230)}What if that Omega Chi pledge saw it
and he tells someone?

95
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:38,594
{\pos(192,230)}Good point.

96
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,702
{\pos(192,220)}He didn't see anything.

97
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,086
{\pos(192,220)}- Trust me.
- Maybe

98
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:46,348
we should come clean anyway. If someone
messed with something of mine,

99
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:47,650
I'd rather they tell me

100
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:50,057
{\pos(192,220)}and deal with it straight on
than hear it from someone else.

101
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,977
- I'd probably thank 'em.
- Boring. I say we keep it.

102
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,805
- I think we should return it.
- I think my burrito gave me gas.

103
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,315
{\pos(192,220)}While I think we all appreciate
this verbal game of wits,

104
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,484
I think we're ignoring
one important fact here.

105
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,821
I saw swords down there.

106
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,455
- Let me take you on a real date.
- Like in public?

107
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,434
{\pos(192,220)}Just the two of us?

108
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,809
{\pos(192,220)}Nice clothes...

109
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:28,789
{\pos(192,220)}dinner... dancing.

110
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,060
{\pos(192,220)}Although, I couldn't imagine you
any more beautiful dressed up

111
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,477
{\pos(192,220)}than you already are.
But still...

112
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,602
I{\pos(192,220)} think it might be too risky.

113
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:42,238
{\pos(192,220)}For the president of the sorority?
What are they gonna do? Revolt?

114
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:43,713
You have no idea.

115
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:47,727
{\pos(192,220)}I have to show them that I, too,
must play by the rules.

116
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,776
{\pos(192,220)}What rule is that? Thou shall not get
in thy hasher's pants?

117
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:01,128
Thank God. We've been stuck
in here for over an hour.

118
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,016
Is the tornado drill over?

119
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,854
Robin's phone number?

120
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,570
Are you two friends or something?

121
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:15,726
Not sure.

122
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,985
About Friday...

123
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:28,238
Should I schedule
that special delivery?

124
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,534
I think it's best if we stick
to our usual delivery schedule.

125
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,363
How was your weekend?

126
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:07,945
We were at the wedding together,
remember?

127
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:09,775
Right.

128
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:13,158
I'm stupid.

129
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,257
Andy's my little bro,

130
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:20,707
and I never, ever
should've kissed you.

131
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,543
It's OK. I mean, I kissed you back.

132
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:28,507
But the most important thing right now
is my relationship with Andy.

133
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,056
He's a good guy.

134
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:36,014
We have a lot of fun together.
I need to give it a chance.

135
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:37,887
Of course you do.

136
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:43,214
Can we rewind
and go back to friends?

137
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:46,150
Absolutely. Friends again.

138
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,321
- We'll pretend like it never happened.
- Like what never happened?

139
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:52,866
That...

140
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,768
Listen, that noise in class?
That was just my shoe.

141
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:58,871
You know?

142
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,084
Real swords make the best sound!

143
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:07,978
- What was that?
- Echo.

144
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,886
- Definitely an echo.
- No, it's the door!

145
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,555
Quick! Human shield!

146
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:22,561
It's the Abercrombie lady.

147
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,688
We're all set on twill shorts,
but thanks.

148
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,691
We want our bust.
Come on. Give it up.

149
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:29,748
"Our bust."

150
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,153
Too easy. Pass.

151
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,071
- Our pledge saw it.
- What pledge?

152
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,940
The one who was in here.

153
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:38,830
Too bad I didn't hit him with a paddle.
We do this to each other's pledges?

154
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:40,621
I know you have our founder's bust.

155
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:45,713
Snooty-looking bronze dude?
Looks like he's floggin' the dolphin?

156
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,804
- Haven't seen it.
- We'll give you 24 hours to return it,

157
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,979
- or we'll come and take it.
- You're welcome to try.

158
00:09:52,104 --> 00:09:53,592
Not that we have it.

159
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:58,096
Nice sword.

160
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:01,245
The Archeology Department's been
missing a pair.

161
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,809
Kinda like you.

162
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,230
Twenty-four hours.

163
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:15,176
I guess that kid saw more
than I thought?

164
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,866
Really, Beav? We need to get
this stuff outta here right now.

165
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,367
He said we had 24 hours.

166
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:21,370
I'm worried about
a police raid in 24 minutes

167
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,331
Chambers called the cops at
the Gatsby party and he can do it again.

168
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,167
Why don't we just give him
the bust back?

169
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,257
I got it. We'll sneak everything back
to its owners,

170
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,924
so no one can prove we had it.

171
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:37,222
- Didn't I just say that?
- Except for Omega Chi's bust,

172
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,790
Which we'll throw in the Cyprus River
out of childish spite.

173
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:42,975
And we'll drink while we do it!

174
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:52,985
Sorry I'm late.

175
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,138
Let me guess...
Cement emergency.

176
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,122
Cement, cement.

177
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:00,117
But there are rewarding parts, too,
right?

178
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,358
Absolutely.
Of course.

179
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:07,484
- It's Weird Science.
- Weird can be fun, though.

180
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:10,673
It's Weird Science.

181
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:17,054
- Let's go to Dobler's.
- I've never seen it on the big screen.

182
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:19,756
Since we've been going out,
you've watched it

183
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:21,221
three times that I know of.

184
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,391
Do you know how many times I've tried
to make a real woman out of a doll?

185
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:27,978
Come on... This movie is what made me
want to get into science.

186
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:31,412
- I thought that was Kevlar?
- That's just what I tell people.

187
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,093
It goes down easier
than Kelly Le Brock.

188
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,278
You picked our last Friday night.

189
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,732
Sandwiched between two trips
to Dobler's.

190
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:41,825
- Because Dobler's is fun.
- The first ten times.

191
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:46,051
And how many times have
we gone to the dinosaur museum?

192
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:49,374
Come on... How times have
I waited while you tried on clothes?

193
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,836
- I drive us everywhere.
- I gave up grad school for you.

194
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,052
That was a joke.

195
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:05,182
We'll go to Dobler's.

196
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,069
He can bus my table any day.

197
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:20,622
- Stop that.
- So go on a date with him.

198
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:22,523
{\pos(192,220)}What's the big deal?

199
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,620
{\pos(192,220)}Can't like this idea of sneaking.

200
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,130
{\pos(192,220)}Travis was the only other guy
I ever seriously dated,

201
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:33,296
{\pos(192,220)}and with him, I'd see him for like
a weekend and then he'd be gone.

202
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,797
{\pos(192,210)}And... What happens if
regular dating is boring?

203
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,476
You're really
into this secret hook-up thing.

204
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,385
Is this about Fisher?

205
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,553
Becks knows.

206
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,848
Calvin was just giving me advice.

207
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,225
'Cause he and Heath used
to sneak around last year.

208
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,018
That's right. You're gay!

209
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,814
According to my gentleman friends.

210
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,483
How did secret-dating Cappie work?

211
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,214
Secret sex spies was the best.
We did it in the library,

212
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,192
my car, your car, church...

213
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,158
- So what happened?
- We went out and everything fell apart.

214
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:09,204
See? Can you explain that to Fisher?

215
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,415
You're never gonna know
unless you try.

216
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:13,708
Look,
my advice is just take baby steps.

217
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:16,002
Or... split the difference.

218
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,423
Go on a real date, but someplace
where no one else will recognize you.

219
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:23,176
I know the perfect place!

220
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,989
About that shipment...

221
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:36,959
I'm just trying to understand
why you said it.

222
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,146
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:41,361
I don't know where that remark
came from.

224
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,280
Can we please move on?

225
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,033
I just really hate
to see you unhappy.

226
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,669
I'm happy with you.

227
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,414
I'm still in my general field
at a top-notch university.

228
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,332
I have everything I need.

229
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,002
I saw your face when Dr. Broom
dumped those papers on your desk.

230
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,589
It's the same face you get when you talk
about the Mars Polar Lander crash.

231
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:03,550
She would have been fine
if they'd uploaded a software patch...

232
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,012
Wait. What about that solar panel thing
Dr. Stephanopoulos is doing?

233
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:10,281
- You know about that?
- You're the smartest guy in your class.

234
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:13,143
- You should introduce yourself.
- It's not about being the smartest.

235
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,134
Without a recommendation
from my advisor,

236
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,189
I won't get face-time
with Stephanopoulos.

237
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:21,109
And in case you haven't noticed,
Dr. Broom isn't exactly a fan of mine.

238
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,185
But, it's worth a shot.

239
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:27,532
I'd have to move to Oxford
for a month.

240
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:35,212
This is your dream.

241
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:39,061
And joking or not, I can't live with
"I gave up grad school for you."

242
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,630
I'm worried
we'll never get past this.

243
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:46,090
Maybe leaving for a month
will be good for both of us.

244
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:49,644
All right.

245
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:51,348
I'll try.

246
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,060
Now, can we go see Weird Science?

247
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,439
Jeremy, this goes
to the Track and Field Building.

248
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:01,645
Stay sharp.

249
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,319
Jeremy, wait.

250
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,240
Keep it down. Like scissors.

251
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,504
You never finished telling me
about the wedding.

252
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:16,245
- Really?
- Jordan won't even talk about it.

253
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:20,925
I know, in wedding things happen,
so she must be embarrassed about this.

254
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,215
She didn't do anything
she should be embarrassed about.

255
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,301
But, something did happen.

256
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:33,224
Look, Rus, just tell me. All right?
I'd rather break up with her now

257
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,768
than keep imaging these wild scenarios
in my head. They're driving me nuts.

258
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,979
She didn't do anything.

259
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:42,637
I did.

260
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,694
I kissed her.

261
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:48,280
What?

262
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:53,076
- You said things happen.
- Not with my big brother.

263
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:56,291
I mean a kiss,

264
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,412
it's the least wildest scenario.

265
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:02,002
So, where does my big brother
and my girlfriend kissing rank?

266
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,297
Is it cool? Kind of OK?
All in the family?

267
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:08,153
- Let me explain...
- No. I don't want to hear it.

268
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:19,950
So stupid.

269
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:25,562
Jordan, hi,

270
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,147
it's Rusty.

271
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:29,871
You need to call me...

272
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,621
- I forgot my jacket.
- Bye, Uncle Jordan.

273
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:55,221
So, how'd it go with your advisor?

274
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,760
- Dr. Broom won't give me a rec.
- What is his problem?

275
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:02,901
- I'm smarter than him.
- You didn't tell him that, did you?

276
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:07,388
And I'm always very polite
when I correct him.

277
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,820
- Can you talk to Dr. Stephanopoulos?
- Not without a recommendation.

278
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,166
There's a reception tonight, and she
and her team leave tomorrow morning.

279
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,821
- Thank you.
- No problem.

280
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:18,845
- Let's go to the reception?
- Dr. Broom didn't want

281
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,203
a bunch of grade students burying her
under a mountain of resumes.

282
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:25,293
- So... you need an invitation?
- Yeah. But,

283
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,421
the reception is at Broom's house.
If he sees me there I'm dead.

284
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:34,203
I was trying to save
your relationship.

285
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,429
Andy knew you were hiding something.

286
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:38,111
So...

287
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:47,251
Hear me out. I was trying to save...

288
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,442
Open up, Rus. It's Uncle Jordan.

289
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,410
- I cannot believe you told him.
- No, hear me out.

290
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:01,903
Andy knew you were hiding something.
I was trying to save your relationship.

291
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:04,397
So you confessed?
You confessed, Rusty?

292
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:05,792
You never confess!

293
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:08,855
Don't you watch 48 Hours?
You deny, deny, deny!

294
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,710
- I'm a bad liar.
- Look,

295
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,007
I just came here to tell you
to stay out of it.

296
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,175
I will.

297
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,490
I promise.

298
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:17,637
I'll never say your name
around Andy again.

299
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,299
Even if he's with you,

300
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,270
I'll just say,

301
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:23,027
"Hey, you."

302
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:26,362
Look...

303
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:29,924
Rusty, I think you and I together
is just a bad idea.

304
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,402
And maybe
we shouldn't hang out anymore.

305
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:35,793
We can still be friends.

306
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,976
I think it'd be better
if we weren't.

307
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:45,742
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:00,755
- Hi.
- Hey, Casey, you're here.

309
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:05,949
It's like you felt my pain
by psychic connection.

310
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:09,608
We are a true brother and sister.

311
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,733
{\pos(192,210)}I'm here for Dale.
What's wrong with you?

312
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,263
I kissed Jordan.

313
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:18,323
And now Andy and Jordan hate me.

314
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,891
Way to go, Sienna Miller.
Did Jordan tell him?

315
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:23,928
I told him.

316
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:28,082
- OK, that was selfish.
- Telling the truth is selfish?

317
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,794
When you do it to make
yourself feel better, yes.

318
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,131
OK, that was selfish.

319
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,673
Now, two of my friends hate me.
So, what do I do?

320
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,162
Give them space and...

321
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:41,615
- Let them figure it out.
- Andy and I are Kappa Tau.

322
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:45,183
That's a bond stronger
than high carbon steel.

323
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,518
I kissed her.

324
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:49,963
I need to make things right.

325
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,024
Hey, Rus. Miss Cartwright.

326
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,664
Dale, I think you have some...

327
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:00,824
... lipstick.

328
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,497
Little warning would have been nice.
I was on a date with Sheila.

329
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,832
The landlady?

330
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:12,502
- What, are you trying for a townhouse?
- No, she's my girl now.

331
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,512
Or, woman, I should say.
She's very mature.

332
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,233
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

333
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:19,968
So, you volunteer
in Dr. Broom's office, right?

334
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,637
Yeah, I'm on a roll lately.
Personally. Professionally.

335
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,497
Are you going to Dr. Broom's reception
for Stephanopoulos?

336
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,057
Who do you think's in charge
of the guest list?

337
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:29,912
And decorations.

338
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,065
I gotta say,
even though the Guggenheim is

339
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,335
Frank Lloyd Wright's
most recognized work,

340
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,508
My personal favorite is Graycliff.

341
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,014
That's really interesting.

342
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:45,238
You didn't call me to talk
about my major, did you?

343
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:50,027
I had an...

344
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,148
... encounter recently.

345
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:54,421
With a member of the same sex.

346
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:57,738
A close encounter?

347
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:00,886
Yeah, and...

348
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,764
- I was wondering...
- When I knew I was gay?

349
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:06,411
Well, I was eight years old.

350
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:09,970
And, I saw Marky Mark
on TV in his boxers.

351
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:13,044
I'd always fantasized about being part
of the Funky Bunch.

352
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,474
Last weekend, I kissed a girl.

353
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:17,890
And I liked it.

354
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,905
- Does that make me a lesbian?
- No.

355
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,740
It just means you can write
a crappy pop song.

356
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,409
I just wish there was a way
to know for sure, you know?

357
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,244
Like a pregnancy test,
but for gayness.

358
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,622
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna take you someplace

359
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,616
where you'll be around the gays, OK?

360
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,292
- You can see how you feel.
- Sure?

361
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,420
So, where does one go
to meet lesbians?

362
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,056
Well, since
it's not lacrosse season,

363
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,571
how about Gentlemen's Choice?
It's ladies' night.

364
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:44,264
Fine.

365
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:45,626
It's a date.

366
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:53,354
Hey, I need to talk to you.

367
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,195
Big brother to little brother.

368
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:57,814
I'd rather not.

369
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,554
Status check. Operation: Booty Free.
Where are we?

370
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:05,073
All accounted for.
No one's been caught and/or injured.

371
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,368
Great. Our mission's almost complete.
Only a few more items to return.

372
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,496
Boys?

373
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,751
- Are you all right?
- We're super.

374
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:18,795
OK. Let's see.

375
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,589
Wade. I have a pair of disco balls
that belong in Gentlemen's Choice.

376
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,197
I have no idea which one.
And, a gramophone.

377
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:26,693
- Did we track the owner on that.
- Beav's on that.

378
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:30,181
And a football from the CRU's 1964

379
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,058
appearance in the Porcelain Bowl.

380
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,512
Your familiarity with this department
makes you the perfect candidate,

381
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:37,480
Andylicious.

382
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,891
I don't really feel like it,
if that's OK?

383
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:42,110
- Of course it's OK.
- You're still gonna do it.

384
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:43,444
I'll go with him.

385
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,905
For athletic support.

386
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,842
Interesting. Go with stealth.
And should you get caught.

387
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,733
This conversation never happened.

388
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:57,458
Fine. Wade, show me what we got.

389
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:16,811
I found these in the park.
They say,

390
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,564
- "Property of Gentlemen's Choice."
- Not ours. Try the other one.

391
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,193
But this one has lesbians.

392
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:27,169
Yes. And a bouncer.

393
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,752
This is an interesting choice
for a first date.

394
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,921
But look at all the perks.
You can check out all the eye candy.

395
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:51,236
And they have signature gay drinks.

396
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:53,845
How about a homo-jito?

397
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,895
Did you think dating me was going
to be boring for some reason?

398
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:02,391
What? No,
I definitely don't think you're boring.

399
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:05,739
- We're just going slow.
- Actually, we're not going anywhere.

400
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:08,051
Except a lesbian bar.

401
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:12,362
When I first met you,
I kinda imagined us doing the whole

402
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,451
going out thing.

403
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,787
I imagined you naked.

404
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:20,741
You see? You're funny
and gorgeous and it would suck...

405
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,519
... just to be your...

406
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:24,295
... fun boy-toy.

407
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:26,531
So,

408
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,299
I'm gonna take off.

409
00:24:33,936 --> 00:24:35,037
Fisher, wait!

410
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,023
Don't tell me this is
your perfect place for Fisher?

411
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,865
I thought I could take him in a fun
place, where there are no Zeta Betas.

412
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,602
And since no one
in the house is a lesbian...

413
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:53,366
Rebecca? What are you doing here?

414
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:00,478
- I kissed Robin.
- I kissed her once, too.

415
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:01,874
Really?

416
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:04,513
And didn't it make you wonder?

417
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:06,003
Wonder what?

418
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,017
I can't believe we're crashing.

419
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,979
You're crashing. I'm Dale's plus-one.
We're gonna sneak you in.

420
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:28,025
Duck!

421
00:25:33,187 --> 00:25:34,934
That's Stephanopoulos with Broom.

422
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:38,574
OK, here's the plan.

423
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:41,563
You're gonna use your super powers
of blending into walls to avoid Broom,

424
00:25:41,688 --> 00:25:44,458
while I sell Stephanopoulos
on my super-talented boyfriend.

425
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:48,084
- Case, that sounds a little half-baked.
- Hello? I'm ZBZ rush chair.

426
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:50,896
My superpower is reading women
and their wardrobes

427
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:54,701
and knowing everything about them, which
tells me exactly how to get what I want.

428
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:56,944
Kind of like Emma Frost.

429
00:25:58,464 --> 00:25:59,464
Totally.

430
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Now,

431
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,724
Dr. Stephanopoulos is wearing
earth tones, so she's down to earth.

432
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,299
Her Via Spiga shoes scream
an appreciation

433
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:09,260
for high-quality function
over fashion.

434
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:13,389
So, she's friendly and accessible, but
no-nonsense when it comes to her work.

435
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,905
- That's a good thing?
- It's perfect.

436
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,744
A little girl chat and then
I hit her with your resume,

437
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,746
"Pick Max, he's a genius." Done.

438
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,457
And why would she take a recommendation
from an English major?

439
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,647
No offense.

440
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,543
Because...

441
00:26:28,113 --> 00:26:29,113
I'm...

442
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:31,505
Dr. Cartwright.

443
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:33,741
Whose plan's half-baked now?

444
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:39,017
- Shall we?
- OK,

445
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,487
You go in the back and sneak in
and I'll meet you inside.

446
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,563
Could we not tell Sheila about this?
She gets really possessive.

447
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:52,564
Andy, come on.

448
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,944
Just listen to me. We are brothers.

449
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:58,241
And brothers work out their problems
by being honest.

450
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:01,198
If brothers were honest, they wouldn't
be screwing with brother's girlfriends.

451
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:04,237
You're right.

452
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,249
Talking is not gonna cut it.

453
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:11,212
- Do you wanna hit me?
- I'm not gonna hit you.

454
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,297
- Please, hit me.
- Would you stop?

455
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,681
You're like a can of soda
in a paint mixer.

456
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:17,576
A can filled
with carbonated resentment...

457
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,145
Would you shut up?

458
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,041
Run!

459
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:46,223
It can't go out like that.

460
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:48,885
{\pos(192,210)}They said if you don't send out some
food now they're not paying us.

461
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,716
{\pos(192,210)}Do they want their chicken cooked?
Because it's still pink.

462
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:55,248
{\pos(192,210)}How pink? Chicken keeps cooking
after it's off the grill, right?

463
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,380
Absolutely. I'm gonna hit the head.

464
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,184
What are you...?
You're scuffing your slacks. Let's go.

465
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:14,744
So, this is
what I have to look forward to?

466
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:16,975
Yeah. Isn't it awesome?

467
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,258
- Chicken?
- You really don't want to eat that.

468
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:23,200
Dale's distracting Broom. Perfect.

469
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,134
- I love your home, sir.
- Yes, me too, Dale.

470
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:27,997
I could talk about it all night.

471
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:31,306
- Would you like to?
- OK, you hide and I'll find her.

472
00:28:31,431 --> 00:28:34,628
When I take your resume in my purse,
come quick so I can introduce you.

473
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:37,044
- Got it.
- OK, hide.

474
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,593
Right now we've got the highest
molecular weight polyethylene

475
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:47,192
that's ever been synthesized.

476
00:28:47,317 --> 00:28:49,750
God, I envy you. You're doing
all this ground-breaking work,

477
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,355
and here I am stuck
in low-grade polymers.

478
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:56,359
- Sorry. Dr. Magda Stephanopoulos?
- Dr. Cartwright.

479
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,763
So, I know about the opening
on your team,

480
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:01,280
and I have a great student for you.

481
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,034
Let me guess?
That's his resume you're pulling out?

482
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,671
I've heard it all before.

483
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,672
Is that Runway Diva Extraordinaire?

484
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:21,165
The company told me
it's on back-order for two months.

485
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:23,783
They told me that, too,
but I pulled some strings

486
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:26,222
and they shipped me some free samples.
Excuse me a sec.

487
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:34,198
- Why'd you wave me off?
- Because my first read was wrong.

488
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,066
She doesn't want the best,
she wants what she can't have.

489
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:39,346
How do you know?

490
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:41,350
She has the new
Runway Diva Extraordinaire.

491
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:43,823
Miss J. can't get any
and they named the lipstick after him.

492
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:50,454
So kissing Robin was pretty great?

493
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,233
Not like it was with Fisher.

494
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,839
It was to get a reaction out
of these guys.

495
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:57,069
It could have been anyone.
Guy, girl, mannequin.

496
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,588
When I did it...
It gave me a reaction.

497
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,342
It's crazy!
You see yourself in a certain way

498
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,587
and then this thing happens
that feels out of your control,

499
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:10,015
but in a good way,
and you're like, wait a minute.

500
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,769
- That's how I feel with Fisher.
- That's how I'd feel with Fisher, too.

501
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,654
You know what?

502
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:20,203
I do have feelings for Robin.

503
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,322
- And I'm gonna call her!
- I can already see you two married.

504
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,618
- In Connecticut or Massachusetts.
- And she isn't hung up on Casey,

505
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,455
so that'll never come between us
like with me and Cappie.

506
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,708
I thought you and Cappie broke up
because you went public?

507
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:36,876
I lied.

508
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,628
It was a much less
humiliating excuse.

509
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:43,012
But now that I'm into girls,
I don't care.

510
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:49,266
That girl has Fisher's haircut.

511
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,014
Come on.

512
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:04,153
Mr. Cappie?

513
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:07,661
You can take him. He can start his
50 hours community service next week.

514
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:09,466
Thank you, Officer.

515
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:12,244
Kids these days...
I blame video games.

516
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:13,829
GTA is the devil.

517
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,252
Where's Andy?

518
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:22,818
Coach bailed him out.
How was it with Huck?

519
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:26,467
Don't worry, I told him I found the ball
and that I was acting on my own.

520
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,114
Good boy. I'd hate to have
to rename you Snitcher.

521
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,107
Let's get outta here.

522
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:43,275
I'm OK.

523
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:46,970
- Anyway, what are you drinking there?
- White wine.

524
00:31:47,095 --> 00:31:48,900
Yeah.
That was my Grandma's favorite.

525
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,450
She was an angry drunk, though.

526
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:55,746
You're going to give me
that resume, now?

527
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,414
Actually, I was just told I couldn't.
I could get in a lot of trouble.

528
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,489
- For recommending a student?
- Well, he's not any student.

529
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:06,799
He is kind of
Dr. Broom's prized mentee.

530
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,724
He interned at NASA, patented
a hangover cure in his free time.

531
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:13,055
He even had a full ride to Caltech,
but Dr. Broom begged him to stay.

532
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:15,099
That's some student.

533
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,976
I think his brain is half bionic.

534
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:21,396
But, promise you won't say
anything to him, right?

535
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:24,136
I'm trying for tenure,
and I could get in a lot of trouble

536
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:26,357
for even talking about Max Tyler.

537
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:31,949
- My lips are sealed.
- Thank you so much for understanding.

538
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:39,171
Go talk to Dr. Broom.

539
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,785
What? I can't. He'll kick me out.

540
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,961
- I haven't even talked to her yet!
- Just go.

541
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:46,046
- Casey...
- Trust me. Go!

542
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,676
There's someone.

543
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,909
Mr. Tyler?
You're not supposed to be here.

544
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:56,432
- No, sir.
- Then, why are you?

545
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,767
And how did you get in? And...

546
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,403
- When did my gramophone come back?
- When do gramophones go out of style?

547
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,624
Mr. Tyler, your place is in the lab
where you can be utilized and not seen.

548
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,455
Now, you need to leave.

549
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:12,256
Chicken, sir?

550
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:16,666
Take two, sir. They're very good.

551
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,694
I'd like to meet that student.

552
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,212
Trust me, he's not for you.

553
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,061
I'll be the judge of that.

554
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,659
So, some good news...

555
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:46,781
- I got my car back.
- Yeah, I saw. Congrats.

556
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,832
Hey, we're about to go
on a little mission to Kappa Tau.

557
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:53,441
Get our bust back. Wanna come?

558
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,658
You gonna bring a bat this time?

559
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:00,923
I'm gonna bring enough guys
so that Cappie knows I mean business.

560
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:04,700
See? You just can't do anything
for fun anymore.

561
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:06,752
You just take it
to the worst possible place.

562
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,658
Come on. This is just
about getting back what's ours...

563
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:11,801
Really?
I don't remember you buying a keg

564
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,717
just before our pledge photo
last year.

565
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,902
Which proves my point.
I'm making it more fun.

566
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:17,313
Evan, it was fun.

567
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:20,265
With squirt guns and stink bombs.

568
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:23,519
Why do you always have
to go to extremes?

569
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,840
Buying a keg is an extreme?

570
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,187
OK, two kegs. But, I promise,
I'm not going down that path...

571
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:32,581
I've heard this, like,
20 times before. All right?

572
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:36,780
I mean, first it was taunting Casey
and then breaking Rusty's nose.

573
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:40,452
And then,
rubbing a townie in Frannie's face.

574
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,746
Well, isolated incidents.

575
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,692
- OK, boys. Pound those beers. Let's go.
- Yeah!

576
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,346
You didn't get it.

577
00:35:03,191 --> 00:35:07,091
- No, I got it.
- Shut up. She loves you. I knew it!

578
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:11,181
Actually,
I think the deciding factor was...

579
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:15,097
She thinks you have a crush on me and
it'll annoy you when I leave tomorrow.

580
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,283
For a month.

581
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:21,452
Yeah.

582
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,746
You're leaving.

583
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:26,547
Yeah.

584
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:29,677
You're really leaving.

585
00:35:42,947 --> 00:35:46,560
Elias Van Patton has inhabited
our sacred home for far too long.

586
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,455
But, before we show Elias to his
watery grave, has anyone seen Wade?

587
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,180
No? Well...

588
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,857
{\pos(192,210)}I can't wait to see the look
on their faces...

589
00:35:57,995 --> 00:35:59,499
{\pos(192,210)}Evan, you're early.

590
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:02,522
{\pos(192,210)}We were just taking out some laundry.
Do you have any delicates you need done?

591
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:04,006
{\pos(192,210)}Give us it or we're taking it.

592
00:36:04,131 --> 00:36:05,148
{\pos(192,210)}- Where?
- Home.

593
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:06,638
{\pos(192,210)}- Home where?
- To our house.

594
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:09,599
- Where are you going with it?
- Well, not the Cyprus River.

595
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,179
Dammit did I just say that?

596
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:15,160
If you don't like it,
we can just go right through you.

597
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,920
- Evan, let it go.
- No, no, it's cool.

598
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,936
I come prepared.

599
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:24,765
Cease and desist, gentlemen.

600
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,392
There'll be no melee on my watch.

601
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,395
Mr. Cappie,
I believe this belongs to you.

602
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:34,567
I took him returning stolen disco balls
to a strip club that I sometimes...

603
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,308
... stake out.

604
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,698
Well, Evan and I were just convening
a joint search party to find Wade,

605
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:44,409
- but you saved us the trouble. Thanks.
- Save it, Mr. Cappie.

606
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:46,495
I packed the beanbag gun tonight.

607
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,586
There's alarms going off
all over campus.

608
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:51,792
Years worth of missing stuff
returned in one night.

609
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,086
We are at Defcon-2, people.

610
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,666
And since I've caught two Kappa Taus
returning these items,

611
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:00,050
I'm thinking it's not a coincidence.

612
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,636
I only need one witness
to confirm this,

613
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,223
and then I will be going
to town on your ass.

614
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:08,429
That's what he said.

615
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:11,061
- Beaver, not now.
- What happens then?

616
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,064
Search and seizure of the property.
Indefinite shutdown of Kappa Tau,

617
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:16,984
followed by disciplinary hearings,

618
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,162
where I show up in my dress blues

619
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:22,447
and see to it
that every Kappa Tau is expelled.

620
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:25,576
Possession of stolen items
violates CRU code.

621
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,664
I was down in their basement!

622
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:31,645
- No, you weren't.
- What?

623
00:37:32,122 --> 00:37:33,618
- Yes, I was.
- No,

624
00:37:34,663 --> 00:37:36,931
you weren't.
Actually, Officer...

625
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:38,914
Our pledge here
has made a terrible mistake,

626
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,924
and has spoken out of turn.
He is wrong.

627
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,567
The Kappa Taus could be
in big trouble.

628
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:46,417
- If you know something...
- I don't.

629
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:48,432
But thanks for Wade.

630
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,777
If that's how you want it.
All right, everybody skedaddle

631
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:55,397
- before I get righteous.
- All right. Let's go!

632
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:10,162
Ash, will you be here to sign
for a shipment tomorrow?

633
00:38:12,752 --> 00:38:14,291
Yeah, if that's what you want?

634
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,710
Yeah. We're out of sporks.

635
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,571
Everyone!

636
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,661
I have an announcement to make.

637
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,445
Fisher and I are dating.
And we're in like.

638
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,862
We totally like each other.

639
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:55,951
And I'm a lesbian.

640
00:38:58,088 --> 00:38:59,694
Yeah, we knew that, too.

641
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,452
- Andylicious! You had us worried sick.
- Did you get in trouble?

642
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:18,427
Coach smoothed
everything over for me.

643
00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:21,212
See? I told you.
It's college football.

644
00:39:21,337 --> 00:39:24,236
- Arrests are the new touchdowns.
- He didn't see it that way.

645
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:29,075
I've been late to team meals
and curfews, partying way too much.

646
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,577
Look, I've been thinking a lot
about my choices lately,

647
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,237
and there's way too much on my plate.
This whole fraternity thing.

648
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:40,626
- It's not for me.
- Rusty had the same problem

649
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:43,741
with Kappa Tau, and Polymer Science.
He can help you balance the two.

650
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:46,040
I don't need any more help
from Rusty, thank you.

651
00:39:46,165 --> 00:39:49,074
OK what's going on?
And don't tell me everything's super.

652
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,820
It doesn't matter, Cap...

653
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,492
It's a done deal.

654
00:39:57,421 --> 00:39:59,563
Thanks for having me, man.
It was fun.

655
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:11,450
You wanna tell me
why your little brother just quit, Rus?

656
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:14,409
- Because I kissed Jordan.
- Who?

657
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:18,081
Michael Jordan? Jordan Knight?
Jordan Catalano?

658
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,125
Don't tell me
that you kissed Andy's Jordan.

659
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,399
I wish I kissed Michael Jordan.

660
00:40:22,842 --> 00:40:24,296
No, it was Andy's Jordan.

661
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:27,831
I liked her
and I saw the opportunity...

662
00:40:29,237 --> 00:40:30,457
... so I took it.

663
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,556
I thought you were better than that.

664
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,200
I'm really excited, Case.

665
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:55,369
It's just... It's one month.

666
00:40:56,215 --> 00:40:58,182
I'll be back. Thank you.

667
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,149
What did Dr. Broom say
about you leaving?

668
00:41:04,772 --> 00:41:05,772
Nothing.

669
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,594
He apparently was...

670
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,793
... throwing up from food poisoning
all night.

671
00:41:10,986 --> 00:41:11,986
Strange.

672
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,887
So...

673
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,322
Watch out for soccer hooligans.

674
00:41:18,483 --> 00:41:19,351
I will.

675
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:22,020
But don't call it soccer.
It's football.

676
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,105
I know.

677
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,482
They'll kick your ass
if you call it soccer.

678
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,526
- I know.
- And...

679
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:30,590
I love you.

680
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:32,918
I know.

681
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:35,283
I love you.

682
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,804
Hey.

683
00:41:56,938 --> 00:41:57,938
Bye, Max.

684
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:02,114
One month, pal.

685
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:05,063
Then we can play
all the Blokus you can handle.

686
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,456
Here. Going away gift.

687
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:11,413
Mama Kettlewell's Preserves?

688
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:12,942
From Dale.

689
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:16,644
He says everyone can use
a little K-Well Jelly on their biscuit.

690
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:26,831
And see if you can get me

691
00:42:26,956 --> 00:42:29,926
a tube
of Dr. Stephanopoulos' lipstick.

692
00:42:52,562 --> 00:42:53,793
Well this sucks.

693
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:57,529
You know...

694
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:00,523
Yeah,

695
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:02,501
it really really does.
