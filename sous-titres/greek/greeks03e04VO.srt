1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:01,459
Previously on Greek:

2
00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:04,189
We'll see what we can do to
get your o-chem grades back up.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,374
Even if I get "a's" in
my other honors classes,

4
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:08,506
i'm still gonna drop
below the required 3.5 cum.

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,415
My "d" is officially a "c".

6
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:12,595
- Wait, that's it?
- It's good enough for now.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,225
You're a good kisser.

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,008
What are we doing?

9
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:19,560
I didn't kiss evan at the
end of the world party. I kissed fisher.

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:20,561
What?

11
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:23,337
I was drunk.
And I screwed up big time.

12
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,316
When someone cheats on me,
it's over.

13
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:28,706
Grant and I kissed. If
anyone from the house saw him,

14
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:30,856
he's screwed, 'cause he
didn't want to come out yet.

15
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,449
We, at pan-hellenic, are
deducting blue ribbon points

16
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:36,873
from sorities whose sisters choose
to participate in the undie run.

17
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:41,117
But it's a 60-year-old tradition
that fosters school spirit and unity.

18
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:42,921
Moving on...

19
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:44,626
Nice work saving the undie run.

20
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:46,652
Some people didn't think so.

21
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:53,010
So pan-hellenic scholarship applications
are due at the end of the month.

22
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:54,656
Moving on...

23
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:58,236
Tomorrow we start our
annual dry weekend, a chance for cru's

24
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:02,220
greek system to prove it can
actually go 48 hours without alcohol.

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,978
This is always so lame.

26
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:05,334
Excuse me?

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,272
Is she looking at me?

28
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,983
I understand it
might be difficult to

29
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:12,154
muster the enthusiasm for
this event you had

30
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:15,516
for running around in your underwear,
but do you have a comment, zbz?

31
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,036
I just said

32
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,872
I think... dry weekend
is a little ineffective.

33
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,014
Houses can't have parties
with alcohol so we...

34
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:28,742
They end up at a packed dobler's

35
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:31,507
or drinking in some
smelly fraternity basement.

36
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:34,986
That's not gonna happen. There
won't be underground partying.

37
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:38,202
Ifc and pan-hellenic are doing
sober patrols of all the houses.

38
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:40,014
And any house found in violation

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,064
faces social suspension
for one month.

40
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:44,395
Great, now it's gonna
be lame and alcohol free.

41
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:47,265
I'm sorry, we're in a small room.
Why do you think I can't hear you?

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,112
It just seems like all you're doing
is telling people what they can't do.

43
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:56,745
If the whole point of dry
weekend is to show people

44
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,385
they can have fun without alcohol, why
not give them something they can do?

45
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,063
Something that's fun.

46
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,641
Like?

47
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,977
Me? OK.

48
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:13,032
I guess we could do a
party, a progressive party.

49
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,111
Where each sority has a
different sober activity.

50
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,721
Like... A drunk-driving
simulator. Or root beer pong.

51
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,724
And karaoke!
Everyone loves karaoke!

52
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:31,150
Since you have such
a good take on it...

53
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:33,502
... you're in charge of dry weekend.

54
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,838
Me?

55
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,647
Moving on...

56
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:44,211
OK, so you combine
silicon tetrachloride,

57
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,951
diphenylmercury and...

58
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,716
Crap, what is it?

59
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,424
What about absinthe?

60
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,535
Absinthe isn't an
organometallic compound.

61
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,217
But it could be the perfect cocktail
for this year's dry weekend.

62
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,708
It's very hip right now.

63
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,281
But dry weekend is supposed
to be alcohol-free, right?

64
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:01,738
Technically, but for the
kappa taus' underground

65
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,061
wet weekend party, i'm reading
about the "green fairy."

66
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,305
Do you really think
it causes facial tics?

67
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,204
Whatever.

68
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:11,977
Why are you giving me this?

69
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:14,037
It's yours. Your mails
still come to the house.

70
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:17,245
- I moved out months ago!
- Yeah, there's a bunch of it.

71
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,113
It's the anchor.

72
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:23,016
Your nickname's Spitter
because you spit on a girl.

73
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,123
- What does anchor even mean?
- Maybe it means "news anchor?"

74
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:30,176
Because I'm always up on what's
going on in polymer science?

75
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,503
Excuse me. You
called spitter "anchor."

76
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:35,094
If I may, what is the derivation?

77
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,172
It's because he got such a low
grade on his o-chem midterm,

78
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:41,636
he's holding down the curve
like an anchor. Get it?

79
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,203
Yeah, I get it.

80
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:48,245
That's my first experience
with nerd-on-nerd hazing.

81
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,274
I still prefer spitter.

82
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,156
Yeah, me too.

83
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,840
Kappa Tau Team

84
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:06,704
you're here!

85
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,009
I was just making our
escape plan from dry weekend.

86
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:12,709
I have movies, pedicures and to honor
the occasion, an in-town bar crawl.

87
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:15,952
The bar crawl is especially
important, because that is

88
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:19,214
where i'm going to meet a new
boy who isn't fisher.

89
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:22,971
I hate to burst your new boy bubble,

90
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,568
but pan-hellenic's enforcing
dry weekend this year.

91
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:29,722
Each sority has to host a sober
party tomorrow night, including zbz.

92
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:31,623
What? Whose dumb idea was that?

93
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,328
I don't know, just some girl...

94
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,071
Are you done with that, ash?

95
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:39,378
I am.

96
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,033
He has been trying
to do that all day!

97
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,212
- What? Make eye contact?
- Yes! And I can't avoid him.

98
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:51,240
I don't want to see him, hear
him, or smell him ever again.

99
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,623
He smells like cupcakes and man.

100
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,706
Speaking of cupcakes and
man, since we're not going

101
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,717
to have alcohol at the party,
we have to have killer food,

102
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,959
which means we'll probably
need fisher to work tomorrow.

103
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:09,780
Stupid dry weekend!

104
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:22,018
Knock knock! Can I come in?

105
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,694
Fancy wrapping paper. Who's it for?

106
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:27,284
It's for my roommate's birthday.

107
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,111
Is he a girl?

108
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,266
OK, what do you want?

109
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:34,166
Can't I just come over to hang out
without having an ulterior motive?

110
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:37,305
OK, you have to get
ashleigh to forgive me.

111
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,922
I've apologized, groveled,
told her I liked those silly

112
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:43,042
arm warmer things she wears.
Nothing's worked.

113
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,929
You kissed her boyfriend.

114
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,349
All right? And if you're
feeling a little bit guilty,

115
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,180
then maybe you should be.

116
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:50,933
Guilt! That's what it is.

117
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,290
Sorry. Hi.

118
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,121
- Is this grant's room?
- Yeah.

119
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,144
Perfect, I'm here to
surprise him for his birthday!

120
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,636
Have you seen him?

121
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,145
Are you his sister?

122
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,646
What are you doing here?

123
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,210
Surprise!

124
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,546
Close family.

125
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:29,355
We having a garage
sale for the lord?

126
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,885
No. No tithing today.

127
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:35,058
Just, putting some of
these things in storage,

128
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:37,500
until me and god
work some of our issues out.

129
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:41,460
I don't really need nana's
crucifixion

130
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:44,813
linens around.
Or my precious moments baby angels.

131
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,561
They're so judgy.

132
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:50,612
Have you heard anyone
call me "anchor?"

133
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,864
I only said it twice.
It was behind your back.

134
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:55,263
But that was it, OK? I swear.

135
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:58,002
Not to god, of course.

136
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,523
This is all because
of stupid o-chem.

137
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,184
I've been busting my butt trying
to make up for this midterm

138
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:05,381
and now I have to deal
with my reputation?

139
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:07,380
What more can I do?

140
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,582
Try being known for
something other than grades.

141
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:13,168
Maybe do an outside project.
I'm thinking about doing one.

142
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:14,716
That's a great idea.

143
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,572
I've been tinkering
with eco-polymers.

144
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,052
There you go. All you
need is a faculty sponsor.

145
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,420
There's only one professor
I know well enough to ask.

146
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:24,651
- What do you want, cartwright?
- A minute of your time?

147
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:27,828
You have exactly one
before my weekend begins.

148
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:37,532
Since I started here at cru, I've
had this intense desire to study...

149
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,350
another book signing? They
expect me to spend my free time

150
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:44,310
at some stupid party to kiss larsen's
ass because he wrote a book?

151
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,326
I personally hate books.

152
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:49,358
And people who write them.

153
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:51,085
Makes sense, given your grades.

154
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,175
Which was exactly why I was thinking

155
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,391
you might consider
sponsoring this idea...

156
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,327
I don't sponsor projects.

157
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,848
I find them to be a waste
of my time and expertise.

158
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:04,015
The thing is, I'm really
trying to make a name for myself

159
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,431
- in this department.
- You mean, besides "anchor?"

160
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:09,088
- You know about that?
- I believe I started it.

161
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,138
And now, it's the weekend.

162
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:23,438
Saw your girlfriend, grant.

163
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:26,569
- She's smokin'!
- Yeah.

164
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:30,091
Yeah, who wouldn't
want to tap that, right?

165
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,163
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about whitney.

166
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:34,197
She and I have been
dating since high school.

167
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:36,043
I'm obviously gonna end things,

168
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,041
but I really wanted
to do it in person.

169
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,019
She's here now.

170
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,420
Hey guys! I hope you don't mind.

171
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:45,292
I put some stuff up in
your closet. It's huge.

172
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,570
You could fit, like,
a person in there.

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,198
You're staying here?

174
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:53,049
Don't worry. Grant and I
won't do anything naughty...

175
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:55,532
... until you're asleep.

176
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,804
What's up?

177
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,641
Jeez, if you vibe that guy
any harder, you might get pregnant.

178
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,771
Tonight is my last chance
to meet a new hot guy

179
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:14,302
before I'm trapped in the house
with my old hot guy. Sober.

180
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:22,685
When did you two get so friendly?

181
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:25,261
We're not friendly. We
just have the greeting down.

182
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:28,339
Trust me, anything longer than an
elevator ride would be totally awkward.

183
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,940
- To dry weekend!
- Cheers to you...

184
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,577
And to weekends... Dry ones.

185
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:36,825
Awkward like that?

186
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:40,299
I hope you guys aren't
planning any stealth parties.

187
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,866
Pan-hellenic and ifc
are patrolling this year.

188
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:46,187
Not to worry. My brothers and
I are amazing at hiding liquor.

189
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,921
Like right now, I may or may not
have a vodka bottle down my pants.

190
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,464
I'm sure I can handle
whoever they send over.

191
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,036
They're sending me.

192
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,647
- What? You have to patrol?
- Nice! A cop on the inside...

193
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:59,681
who knows all your best hiding places.
Under the stairs,

194
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,598
the tool shed, and that secret closet
off your room where we...

195
00:10:02,723 --> 00:10:04,120
... talked.

196
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:07,494
Thanks for the warning. Adios.

197
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:10,501
I can't believe you're ditching me.

198
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:13,792
I'm pretending you're the lemon.

199
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,953
Bitter's not pretty, ash.

200
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:18,529
Who's that?

201
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:20,376
It's katherine.
She was gonna text me

202
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,627
- who I'm patrolling with from ifc.
- Is it a cute boy?

203
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:25,256
And does he have any
non-cheater friends for me?

204
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:27,399
It's a boy all right.

205
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:40,736
- That looks really great, you guys.
- Thanks.

206
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,566
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

207
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,422
It is pretty impressive
that you were able

208
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,639
to put this all together
on such short notice, zbz.

209
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:52,602
- What can I say? I'm awesome.
- And humble.

210
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,239
There's just one little hiccup.

211
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:01,076
Which is kinda funny,
because it's dry weekend.

212
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,695
Anyway, I was wondering
if there was someone else

213
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,106
I could patrol with tonight.
I'd prefer not to go with evan chambers.

214
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,595
Because you guys used to date?

215
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,589
And it didn't end well.

216
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:16,674
Bribes, power and...

217
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:20,009
My point is, it might
be a little awkward.

218
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:21,753
I know, right?

219
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:23,770
What is this, eighth grade?
Way to be powerful.

220
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:27,256
I was thinking, with all your
good ideas on dry weekend,

221
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:30,187
you might even be
pan-hellenic board material.

222
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,039
There's a spot on the board?

223
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:34,374
Janette dropped out to focus
on school, imagine that.

224
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:36,514
If you can't even handle
something as

225
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,440
simple as riding in
a golf cart with an ex,

226
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,408
I think I'm gonna have to find
someone who can. Moving on...

227
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,288
No, don't move on! I can handle it.

228
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,578
I can totally handle it.

229
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:50,058
Yes? Yes! Good.

230
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,894
Yeah, I can.

231
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,690
I know, beav.
It's hard to understand.

232
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,823
The greek council could've
at least had the decency

233
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:01,935
to give us a heads up,
so maybe I could

234
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,976
get a nice buzz on before
the patrols started.

235
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:06,641
That's weird. My nana usually
sends me money for my birthday.

236
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:10,287
- Times are tough.
- She must not love you anymore.

237
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:12,903
Regardless, we can't afford
being on social suspension again.

238
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,901
So this weekend, the kappa tau house
will be closed for business.

239
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,820
One weekend sober, big deal.

240
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:22,280
The rest of my college career known as
"the anchor," bigger deal.

241
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,688
- But you're spitter.
- I've already logged a complaint.

242
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:27,738
- You're just gonna throw in the towel?
- What else can I do?

243
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:30,416
Hastings is the only professor
I have a relationship with.

244
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,826
As with all relationships,
spitter, it's a numbers game.

245
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:36,493
Wade, how many girls
smacked you last weekend

246
00:12:36,618 --> 00:12:38,186
before one would go home with you?

247
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,357
My cheek went numb
after the first dozen,

248
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,885
but then I found a transfer
who didn't know better.

249
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:46,395
See? Just find a high concentration
of professors to hit on.

250
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,336
Sure, you might get
slapped by 99 of them,

251
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:51,637
but all you need is that 100th
professor to sleep with you...

252
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:55,080
- You know, metaphorically.
- Is there a dobler's for teachers?

253
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:57,225
- Where do smart people hang out?
- Computer stores!

254
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,327
- Ethnic restaurants!
- The moon?

255
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:00,862
Dr. Larsen's book signing!

256
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:04,215
There's gonna be tons of professors.
There's gotta be one that'll sponsor me.

257
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,647
And I'll go for moral support.

258
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,671
And the open bar.

259
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:11,625
- Thanks, but I don't think I need...
- Open bar.

260
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,806
Is grant around?

261
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,431
He's down the hall taking a shower.

262
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:24,261
I'm just gonna come back.

263
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,462
Actually, can I talk
to you for a second?

264
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,605
Things seem kinda weird
between me and grant.

265
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,357
How...

266
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:42,446
- terrible.
- And I think it's because of this.

267
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,676
Is grant cheating on me?

268
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,483
No, the "c" is...

269
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,014
It's me.

1
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,406
Of course!

2
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,758
I just assumed from the beautiful
wrapping that it was from a girl!

3
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,510
Should've used a gift bag.

4
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,101
We're all going to Dobler's
for Grant's birthday. You should come.

5
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:14,923
And bring a date!

6
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,730
Is there someone in your life?

7
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,065
Kinda.

8
00:14:19,862 --> 00:14:21,975
- Do I know them?
- Kinda.

9
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:33,392
Look at this.

10
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,285
Cap, to what do I owe the pleasure?

11
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,467
You know, spitter's career,
the open bar.

12
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:39,927
Perhaps a little...

13
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,203
Canoodling.

14
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,342
- I need your help meeting a professor.
- It's a done deal.

15
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,550
I'm so dialed in here.
Gonna find you a match made in heaven.

16
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:50,526
Not that I believe in that anymore.

17
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:51,912
What up, Dr. Giddings?

18
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:54,685
- Maybe you can introduce me to him.
- No, it's a waste of time.

19
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,988
He'll tell you he wants
to work with you, then

20
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,085
when it gets serious, he bails.
He's kind of a project tease.

21
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:01,810
What about her?

22
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:04,819
No, Dr. Alpert's saving herself
until she gets tenure.

23
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,488
What about her?

24
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,606
She's a student. She's irrelevant.

25
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,917
- What about Dr. Larsen?
- The man of the hour?

26
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,019
Come on, it's an impossible get.

27
00:15:21,144 --> 00:15:24,413
I've seen him make national science
grant winners cry like little girls.

28
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:27,425
Anyway, I'm gonna hit the head.

29
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,822
When I get back
we're gonna find you somebody, OK?

30
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:34,063
- Larsen's the one.
- What? He's an impossible get.

31
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,103
Stick to the plan
and play the numbers.

32
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,389
But if I can land a big fish like him,
people will take me seriously.

33
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:40,987
I won't be the anchor anymore.

34
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,151
Foregoing the others
to get the "hot girl". It's bold,

35
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,077
it's risky, and I like it.

36
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,213
I'm going in.

37
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,072
There you go.

38
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,039
Excuse me, Dr. Larsen?

39
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,142
I'm Rusty Cartwright.

40
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:04,864
- I have this idea...
- Hey, the anchor's here!

41
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:10,427
"To the anchor. To engineer

42
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:11,889
is human."

43
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,390
"The anchor?" That's an odd moniker.

44
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,967
I come from a long line of seamen.

45
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:26,248
That came out wrong.

46
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,008
No surprise.

47
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,450
No rager at the Psi Phi Pi house.

48
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:41,202
Remember, we did this patrolling
thing once at the Omega Chi house?

49
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:43,332
We really don't need
to chitchat, Case.

50
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:46,514
Especially about the past.
Let's just get through this.

51
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,127
Apparently we should stick
to elevators.

52
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:51,301
- What?
- Nothing. Brownie?

53
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,467
- You guys are all good.
- Great.

54
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,878
We can start our
Star Trek movie marathon.

55
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,850
Live long and prospect!

56
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:10,098
So disrespectful.

57
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,505
Tell Ashleigh what she's missing!

58
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,099
Thanks to our
burnout brother Nitrous,

59
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:28,046
we have a treat that will delight
all your senses.

60
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,575
I think you'll appreciate
my double entendre when I say,

61
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,155
"These brownies are...

62
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,614
... dope."

63
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:37,423
Now, beam me up!

64
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,837
Then my team and I realized
that by polarizing diodes,

65
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:46,314
we could control the movement
of electrons in a low-pressure space.

66
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,399
Is that right?

67
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:50,490
My team and I are very close
to perfecting a...

68
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:53,199
two-story beer bong, so...

69
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:56,741
That's... Fascinating.

70
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:00,885
Would you excuse me?
I think I see Dale.

71
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:08,920
It's a weird night.
How'd it go with Larsen?

72
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:10,856
I blew it.

73
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,889
Maybe we should go.

74
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:15,677
Or, we can stop
ignoring the obvious.

75
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,078
There's something we both need.
A wingman.

76
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:19,697
I'm listening.

77
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,213
I don't speak science

78
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,017
and you've got no mojo.

79
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,351
Well, I've got plenty of mojo,
and you've got plenty of...

80
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:28,646
You know, science talk.

81
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,735
- I could be your translator!
- And I can be your teacher greaser.

82
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,488
By the time I'm done with Larsen,
he's gonna name a star after you.

83
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,074
- And that star'll be called Rusty.
- Right.

84
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:42,370
- Beaver? What are you doing here?
- Being sciency. Play it cool.

85
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:45,039
Two chardonnays, please? Extra ice.

86
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,676
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

87
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,888
OK, now let's figure this out.

88
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,143
How about over here?

89
00:18:57,364 --> 00:19:01,108
- Studying on a saturday night?
- I'd rather not hang out in my room.

90
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,953
Still freaked out about your roommate
kissing his sister?

91
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,010
I'd just rather not talk about it.

92
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:08,048
- There's something to talk about?
- No.

93
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,345
How fortunate I'm here.

94
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:15,445
- Are you upset because you like Grant?
- How do you know?

95
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,157
No one uses embossed wrapping paper
unless they want to get in guy's pants.

96
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,233
Definitely should've used
a gift bag.

97
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,997
Look, I'm gonna tell you something

98
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:29,877
as a test of your trustworthiness.
If you pass,

99
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,045
maybe I will help you with Ashleigh.

100
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,364
You can trust me.

101
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,055
So Grant and I...

102
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:40,659
- ... are dating.
- Grant's gay?

103
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:47,150
And...

104
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:51,085
He still has a girlfriend.
I mean, why didn't he tell me?

105
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:53,534
And why hasn't he
come out to her yet?

106
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:59,456
Sometimes it takes people
a long time to come out.

107
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,961
Was it that easy for you?

108
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:03,883
Yeah, summer after sophomore year
of high school,

109
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:06,941
- I was working at express for men...
- And that's how everybody knew?

110
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:10,901
Sorry. Continue.

111
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:14,098
And I told some friends
that I worked with.

112
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:15,713
People close to me.

113
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,935
Yeah, it took a while,
but you gotta start somewhere.

114
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,741
I don't know, maybe your girlfriend
should be at the top of the list.

115
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:24,055
Or maybe you should just
let Grant do this his own way.

116
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,228
Can't believe you're telling me to be
more respectful of people's feelings.

117
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,564
Mention this to Ashleigh
when you tell her to forgive me.

118
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:36,441
What are you doing tonight?

119
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,328
Sundae bar's almost ready.

120
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:59,218
I was really hoping you'd find
another hasher tonight.

121
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,335
Yeah, I get it, you don't want me here.
But everybody I know split town

122
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,345
because of the dry weekend, so...

123
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,639
- You're stuck with me.
- No.

124
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,226
My point is this is a social event.
With... Guys.

125
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:14,022
And I'm a girl without a boyfriend.

126
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,651
Yeah, don't worry, Ash.
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

127
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:20,503
OK, good.

128
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,051
Now, see? This is good clean fun.

129
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,117
I feel kind of sick.

130
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:38,630
But not... Sick.

131
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,549
Must have been that red asphaltscreening
at the Gamma Psi house.

132
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,440
Hey, let's just finish
checking here,

133
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,630
and...

134
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,381
And then go on our way.

135
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:53,037
This party clearly sucks,

136
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:55,939
so I'm gonna get the ball rolling
with some karaoke.

137
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,800
Yay! Karaoke!

138
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:18,624
Karaoke.

139
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:23,163
Kar-a-o-ke. That's...
That's a fun word to say.

140
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,292
Is it hot in here?

141
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,205
I love... Music!

142
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,978
I wish I had some maracas.

143
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:37,517
That's a fun word to say, too.

144
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:39,148
Maracas.

145
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,590
It's like a furnace.

146
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:46,893
Did you ever notice
how many cats are in this house?

147
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:49,867
I hate cats! I hate 'em.

148
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,953
They freak me out!

149
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,958
They're everywhere. On the shelves,

150
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,267
on throw pillows.

151
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:00,142
Fake cats.

152
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,755
Do you think cats put us
on their pillows?

153
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,669
You guys are here!
These drunk simulation goggles

154
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:08,284
aren't working.
Is there, like, an on/off switch?

155
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,061
This is awesome.

156
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:19,572
Let's go see
what the kitchen looks like!

157
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:21,752
This way.

158
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:23,157
I guess they do work.

159
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,532
- Hey, Hilary.
- Hey, anchor.

160
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:34,787
This is my friend.
He helped create the first

161
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,873
synthetic polymers
that use hydrogen bonding

162
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,042
to reversibly fold themselves
into nanoparticles.

163
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,335
David Wong?

164
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:46,424
Yes, I am.

165
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,509
I was adopted.

166
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,065
By two gay dudes.

167
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:54,474
- From China.
- I'd love to hear about

168
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:58,221
how you knew nucleic acids were capable
of performing such ordered folding.

169
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:00,878
Or... We could talk about you.

170
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:03,928
But first, let me get you
a glass of wine.

171
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:07,528
Something to dull the senses
before we dive into my folding stuff.

172
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,674
What are you doing? You were in.

173
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,171
I know. Always leave 'em wanting more.
Besides, you helped me,

174
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:17,816
now it's my turn. Thank you.

175
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,832
Do you have any bigger glasses?

176
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,791
Dr. Larsen, I couldn't help but notice
you were dry. Another pinot?

177
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:32,053
Well, thank you.

178
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,223
David wong.
And this is Rusty Cartwright.

179
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:36,390
The seaman?

180
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:40,630
Among other things. Rusty's one
of cru's brightest young minds.

181
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:43,856
Between you and me, you'd be missing out
on a tremendous opportunity

182
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,609
if you didn't hear about his amazing

183
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:47,860
science thingy.

184
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,030
Dr. Larsen, I was hoping that

185
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,548
you might be interested
in sponsoring a project of mine.

186
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:57,064
I'm sure you have a wonderful idea,
but I've already committed myself

187
00:24:57,189 --> 00:24:58,663
to sponsoring another student.

188
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:00,823
- Come over here a minute.
- Yes.

189
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:04,127
Do you gentlemen know
Dale Kettlewell?

190
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,104
Ready? Go!

191
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:22,479
Perfect combo!

192
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,629
Sweet,

193
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:25,119
salt...

194
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:26,094
Cheese!

195
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:29,606
Sorry.

196
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,169
You guys are gonna love those.

197
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:37,458
- So, are you having a good time?
- Cupcakes?

198
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:38,831
They're good.

199
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:42,547
There you go, have a cupcake.
Ashleigh? Cupcake?

200
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:47,088
I said I wouldn't stand in your way.
I didn't say anything about these guys.

201
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,574
Excuse us for a second, please.

202
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:57,096
OK, since Casey's back, I think we can
handle the rest of the night from here.

203
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,764
You think she can handle this?

204
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:01,383
Yeah, no offense to the hashers
of the world,

205
00:26:01,508 --> 00:26:03,546
but I think Casey
can put pretzels in a bowl.

206
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:06,355
That's pretty impressive,
considering she's totally high.

207
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,448
I'm high?

208
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:11,194
That's what it is!

209
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:15,364
No! No! I'm supposed
to be keeping people sober.

210
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,991
Katherine gave me a clipboard!

211
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:18,600
Is this bad?

212
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,149
They were put on sober party patrol,
in charge of the whole greek system,

213
00:26:22,274 --> 00:26:24,665
and they decided to
chuck it all to get high!

214
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,502
Trust me. They sat under that table
for ten minutes pretending to be shoes.

215
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:31,495
That's ridiculous.
Casey doesn't get high.

216
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,429
Would you tell him you're not...

217
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:39,513
I'm gonna go look for them.

218
00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:51,733
Dr. Giddings. You're such a caution!

219
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,932
- What?
- I thought Larsen was an

220
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:59,158
- "impossible get".
- It just happened, OK?

221
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,933
We were talking and found ourselves
bonding over our mutual lack of faith.

222
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:04,287
One thing led to another.

223
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,811
Between you and me,
I think he's only agnostic.

224
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:10,109
Yeah, you know, I think
I like the god-fearing Dale better.

225
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:13,130
- You totally screwed me over.
- Now, spitter, come on.

226
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,800
Now, what's one of the tenets
of a Kappa Tau friendship?

227
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:20,263
Don't ever let a conquest come
between you and a friend.

228
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:23,758
I'm sorry.

229
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:26,018
I'm happy for you.

230
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,896
I just wish I had the opportunity
to pitch my idea to Larsen.

231
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,584
Why can't he sponsor you both?

232
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:34,477
I don't know, it would kind of
pull focus from my project.

233
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:37,530
Come on.
You don't need this as badly as I do.

234
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:42,126
Though I'm not down with JC,
I still have this...

235
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,745
... weird desire
to do the right thing.

236
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:49,041
All right. I guess it would be OK
if you gave it a shot.

237
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,982
Thanks, man. I won't forget this.

238
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:54,922
You need a wingman?

239
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:57,662
This time, I'm flying solo!

240
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,287
- I couldn't find them downstairs.
- They're not up here too.

241
00:28:09,412 --> 00:28:11,843
- Maybe they went outside.
- No, they wouldn't be outside!

242
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:14,150
The one time Casey got high,
she was terrified of trees.

243
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,443
You know. You can...

244
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,154
Just go. I'll find her.

245
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,364
I'm not gonna leave you
when your friend's missing.

246
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,321
I know, i'm a lot of things,

247
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:25,870
but I'm not someone who bails
when there's a problem.

248
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:28,897
I'll go check the pantry again.

249
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:43,421
Katherine will never find us
in here.

250
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:45,077
Relax. Try...

251
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,635
Lavender.

252
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:48,737
That is calming.

253
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:51,818
And one of my favorites,
pina colada.

254
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,544
- I want to taste it.
- No, don't.

255
00:28:55,888 --> 00:28:58,928
It's my job to keep you
from eating beauty products.

256
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,575
- I just got sad.
- I know.

257
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:07,400
I wish we had
real pina coladas, too.

258
00:29:08,472 --> 00:29:10,206
Stupid dry weekend.

259
00:29:12,478 --> 00:29:14,752
I used to have so much fun with you.

260
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,714
Before you cheated on me and hit rusty
with a pledge paddle and...

261
00:29:19,168 --> 00:29:21,600
... paid off a lambda sig
and dated Frannie.

262
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,726
I know, right?

263
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,349
You know, I was a little surprised
to see you tonight.

264
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,071
I thought you'd try
to get out of it.

265
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:33,665
I wouldn't... I did.

266
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:38,526
Yeah, I guess
I left quite an impression.

267
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:45,366
I think I've been
such a jerk because...

268
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:48,393
Whenever I'm around you
it just reminds me

269
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:50,551
of all the bad crap I did to you.

270
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,506
Do you ever wish we could go back
to freshman year?

271
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,298
You, me and Cappie
hanging in the dorms.

272
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,717
Eating ramen. That was so good!

273
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:06,193
You two having contests

274
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:08,170
on who could grow a goatee faster?

275
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,100
Hairy bastard.

276
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:14,004
I hardly ever see him anymore and...

277
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:17,303
You...
You two don't even talk at all.

278
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:19,817
I talked to him.

279
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,336
At the end of the world party.

280
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,782
You... You talked to Cappie?
What about?

281
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:29,108
You.

282
00:30:32,857 --> 00:30:34,456
He was on his way to see you.

283
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:38,193
I told him I didn't think
it was such a good idea.

284
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:41,394
I said...

285
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,924
You guys had been there.

286
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,117
And...

287
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:47,338
It didn't work out then, so...

288
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:49,875
What would be different now?

289
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,582
I really wasn't trying
to mess you guys up.

290
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:57,749
I was just being honest.

291
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,853
You know what?
If he wanted to come, he would have.

292
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,923
That's it! That's it!
I'm trying the pina colada!

293
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:27,962
No, don't! Don't!

294
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,512
I did it once!

295
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,598
- Was it delicious?
- It was nasty!

296
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,379
So nasty!

297
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,314
But you can smell it. Here.

298
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,242
Excuse me. Hey, Dr. Larsen.

299
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:42,933
I know you've already chosen Dale,
but I'd never be able

300
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:46,403
to live with myself if I left this party
without telling you my idea.

301
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:47,821
Please.

302
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:52,618
You know, that kind of determination
is what got me on Charlie Rose.

303
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:55,276
Go on.

304
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:58,547
It's inspired
by environmental factors

305
00:31:58,672 --> 00:32:02,086
and how we're creating new land masses
with all our waste.

306
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,675
I think we can create eco-polymers
from recycled biodegradables.

307
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,559
You mean like turning carbon dioxide

308
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,473
- into synthetic material?
- Exactly!

309
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:11,684
There's a method to use
certain recycled materials

310
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:13,514
in lighter, stronger
and cheaper ways.

311
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:15,724
I'm impressed.

312
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:16,985
Really?

313
00:32:17,274 --> 00:32:20,754
But I only work with students
who excel academically.

314
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:23,439
And since I'd never heard of you
until this evening,

315
00:32:23,564 --> 00:32:25,824
you must not fall
into that category.

316
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:27,756
But I can offer you a position

317
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:30,531
assisting Mr. Kettlewell
on his project.

318
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:34,239
Wait, before you give me an answer,
I think it's only fair that you know.

319
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:36,163
He's an atheist.

320
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:45,569
Isn't this perfect?

321
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:49,443
The four of us on a double date
for my baby's birthday.

322
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,886
Last year for Calvin's birthday
we stayed at this cute little B&B

323
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,583
on Canyon Lake.
Remember how romantic it was, honey?

324
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:58,346
You guys are such a cute couple.

325
00:32:58,471 --> 00:32:59,505
The cutest!

326
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:02,220
You know what would be perfect
right now?

327
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:03,824
Isn't it perfect enough?

328
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:07,067
- Presents!
- No, no, no!

329
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:11,030
I mean, this is the kind of present

330
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,699
that should be opened only
when the time is right.

331
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,955
- Why? What'd we get him?
- Well, it's his birthday.

332
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,578
What time could be more right?

333
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:22,082
Once you open it,
you can't take it back.

334
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:24,585
And I wouldn't want you
to have to open it here,

335
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:27,338
now, just because I gave it to you.

336
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,023
Why don't I just open it later?

337
00:33:29,503 --> 00:33:31,374
Don't be silly. Open it!

338
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:33,223
OK, fine, I'll open it for you.

339
00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:34,803
I'm gay!

340
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,305
And... And I have

341
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,261
inappropriate feelings
for my straight roommate and

342
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:41,138
this gift is proof of that.

343
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:53,245
You're what?!
No wonder you never kiss me with tongue!

344
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,366
- How long have you been gay?
- Enough!

345
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:01,205
Would you two mind
giving Whitney and I some time?

346
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:03,966
- But, Grant, you don't have to...
- Please.

347
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,712
You've been really great
these last couple days.

348
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:12,091
It's time to be honest.

349
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,036
Honest about what?

350
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:18,918
- Let's go.
- We're leaving?

351
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,648
- But it's just starting to get good.
- Come on.

352
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,666
That's the problem in our couple.
We never do anything fun!

353
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,667
That's why I don't date girls.

354
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:32,584
I'm going to take a little break,
but I'll be back.

355
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:34,903
Don't even think about it.

356
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:39,814
Casey and Evan must've left.

357
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:43,622
I can stay until she gets back.
Or I could drive around and look.

358
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:45,249
No more.

359
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,335
You don't get to be the good guy while
I sit around being the bitter bitch.

360
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,502
It's not fair.

361
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,188
Fisher, I'm starting
to feel sorry for you.

362
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,175
But then it goes away
and I want to punch you really hard.

363
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,637
- Then punch me, please.
- No, it'll not make me feel any better.

1
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,471
I was right. Doesn't
make me feel any better.

2
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:09,603
What would? I'm just trying to
make you happy. But

3
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,592
everything I try seems
to make it worse.

4
00:35:11,717 --> 00:35:14,092
Because it does.
It keeps reminding me

5
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:16,283
of what a great guy
I thought you were.

6
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,646
I can still be that guy.

7
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:21,826
Tell me what you want.
I don't know what you want me to do.

8
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:24,622
- You want me to quit?
- I don't know. Maybe?

9
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,568
OK. Then I quit.

10
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,685
- Wait!
- Hello?

11
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:40,769
Where's casey cartwright?

12
00:35:40,894 --> 00:35:42,780
The zbz casey cartwright?

13
00:35:43,486 --> 00:35:44,827
I'm right here!

14
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,251
We totally got this.

15
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:52,987
Dude! Be cool! Be cool.

16
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:04,471
Where have you guys been?

17
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,026
Where haven't we been?

18
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,797
We talked about our lives,
childhood...

19
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:12,646
... time travel.

20
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,387
I'm talking about tonight.
You only went to five houses.

21
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,264
We had issues with
the karaoke machine!

22
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:22,112
So, casey cartwright to the rescue.

23
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:24,515
She's like our sober superhero.

24
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:27,119
I thought you were gonna
take this more seriously.

25
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,257
The whole point of tonight
was to do the patrols

26
00:36:29,382 --> 00:36:31,386
and make sure everyone stayed sober.

27
00:36:31,511 --> 00:36:34,729
But it's clear that what's most
important to you is having fun.

28
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:39,664
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

29
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,161
We may have gotten a
little... Side-tracked tonight,

30
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,549
sure, but casey is a great
addition to pan-hellenic.

31
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,941
First of all, she loves it. Right?

32
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,293
Yeah, the binders, the meetings,

33
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:58,089
the giant copy machine that
makes those cool pamphlets.

34
00:36:58,214 --> 00:37:00,185
How could you not love it?

35
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,712
Right.

36
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,179
We may not have made
it to all the houses,

37
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:07,151
but this is the only dry weekend
that hasn't totally sucked.

38
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,089
That's all because of casey.

39
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:12,562
You're lucky to have her.

40
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:14,335
Thanks, evan.

41
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:19,194
She may be afraid of trees,
but when push comes to shove,

42
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:21,790
she doesn't let you
drink the shampoo.

43
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:24,042
No matter how good it smells.

44
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,410
Thanks, evan.

45
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,809
- Are they stoned?
- Yeah.

46
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:47,702
Nice work getting hilary's
number. You gonna call her?

47
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:50,968
I don't know. She was cute,

48
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:54,687
but for the first time in my life,
I felt a little dumb around a girl.

49
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,677
You're not dumb.

50
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:01,304
And that's not fair for her
to make you feel that way.

51
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,875
What's she judging you on, anyway?

52
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,644
One conversation?

53
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:10,200
- One bad grade on a midterm?
- Calm down.

54
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:14,343
"No one can make you feel
inferior without your permission."

55
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:19,838
It's actually "without your
consent," but you're right.

56
00:38:21,418 --> 00:38:24,072
The good news is you
got in with Dr. Larsen.

57
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,844
Glad you got what you wanted.

58
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:29,755
I guess.

59
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:36,255
Did you see the way katherine
left to go bust the psi phi pis?

60
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,565
She went so fast, she
blurred like a cartoon.

61
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:45,238
Fisher quit tonight.

62
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:50,624
Is that... Good?

63
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,429
I don't know.

64
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:55,696
I thought it was what I wanted.

65
00:38:56,858 --> 00:39:00,407
But if it is,
why do I feel so crappy?

66
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:05,727
I Miss him.

67
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,888
Do you think you
could trust him again?

68
00:39:13,573 --> 00:39:15,227
I think I want to try.

69
00:39:16,278 --> 00:39:19,676
But I drew a line in the sand.
Cheating is a deal-breaker.

70
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:22,728
What does that say about me?

71
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:26,077
It says you're a human being

72
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:28,553
that understands life
isn't always black and white.

73
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:32,760
Deciding to forgive someone
can be a sign of strength.

74
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,362
Like you forgiving evan?

75
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,837
Something like that.

76
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,910
So, how'd it go?

77
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,483
I don't see any blood,
so that's gotta be good.

78
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:58,805
Whitney took it better
than I expected.

79
00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:02,143
She said she knew something
was up when I started

80
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:04,109
shopping at express for men.

81
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:10,311
I just hope I didn't force you

82
00:40:10,436 --> 00:40:13,828
- to come out before you were ready.
- No, I'm glad this happened.

83
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:18,461
I just feel bad
I pulled you into all this.

84
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,325
It wasn't fair.

85
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:24,135
I'm sorry.

86
00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:30,997
Happy birthday.

87
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:47,917
I really love it.

88
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:03,709
You got my check?

89
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:21,705
We're looking for a new hasher.
If you know of anyone.

90
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:26,020
Someone who works
hard, shows up on time,

91
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:28,800
has his own transportation.

92
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:30,778
Like, a motorcycle.

93
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:34,908
I know a guy.

94
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,742
Class m license and everything.

95
00:41:39,722 --> 00:41:41,880
Is he trustworthy?

96
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:44,694
Absolutely. In fact if
you give him a chance,

97
00:41:45,227 --> 00:41:47,648
i'm sure he'll prove it to you.

98
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:50,759
OK then. He's hired.

99
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:54,302
Really?

100
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:57,848
Yeah. But it's only probationary.

101
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:01,775
'cause you really screwed up, and...

102
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,521
I'm not used to
giving second chances.

103
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,235
I know. And you won't regret it.

104
00:42:10,096 --> 00:42:11,652
I hope not.

105
00:42:32,856 --> 00:42:36,275
I understand you turned down an
opportunity to work with Dr. Larsen.

106
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,382
I'm intrigued.
But it could just mean you're stupid.

107
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:42,120
I'd rather take a chance
working on my own project,

108
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:44,946
even if they call me
"anchor" until I graduate.

109
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:48,153
At least I won't be getting
in line to suck up to larsen.

110
00:42:48,278 --> 00:42:50,596
So what, he was on charlie rose?

111
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:53,757
I don't want flash,
I want substance.

112
00:42:53,882 --> 00:42:56,827
Stop trying to sweet talk
me, cartwright. I'll do it.

113
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:59,257
- Do what?
- Sponsor you.

114
00:43:00,488 --> 00:43:03,549
But... I thought you
don't do those things.

115
00:43:03,674 --> 00:43:06,092
Normally, I don't, but
I actually think your ideas

116
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,903
about eco-polymers are not
the worst thing in the world.

117
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:10,993
I never even told you my ideas.

118
00:43:11,118 --> 00:43:13,649
I'm not deaf. I've heard
you yammer on all year long.

119
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:16,456
I just pretend not to be listening
so as not to encourage you.

120
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,666
Does this mean we're a team?

121
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:22,195
I'm already starting
to regret it. Go.
