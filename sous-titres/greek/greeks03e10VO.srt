1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,064
Prevsly On "Greek"...

2
00:00:01,074 --> 00:00:02,872
What's with this...
ZBZ mixer?

3
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:06,884
Aren't they all about mixing with
 those KT losers this semester?


4
00:00:06,894 --> 00:00:10,098
I am starting to wonder. 
...if he's even the right guy for me.

5
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:13,405
- Wow. You can really wear a suit.
- What're you doing?

6
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:15,507
We said we'd come.  Not that we'd stay.

7
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:18,190
Thanks again for paying
our electric bill.

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,557
I may not have money, Trip,
but I am still your president.

9
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:23,142
You may not be for long.

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,554
- Dale, what're you doing?

11
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:30,392
I saw you making all this progress
and realized that you're real competition.

12
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:33,819
I've looked at you like a friend,
and you look down on me like The Anchor.

13
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:34,503
Russ...

14
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:37,662
Cap, I poured my heart out to you at the 
End of the World party,

15
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,520
and you didn't come after me.

16
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,855
But I'm here now.

17
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:09,129
I'm feeling pretty cheap here.

18
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:11,732
You were asleep, and I'm totally late.

19
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:13,770
Ashleigh's gonna wonder where I slept.

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,397
You know, it's killing me not telling her.

21
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:18,041
It's only been a week.

22
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:20,334
And it's been an amazing week.

23
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:27,995
You can't keep putting this off.
You have to tell Evan.

24
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:32,062
We both agreed he should know first 
and you said you'd handle it.

25
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:34,177
It's just tough to get
any alone time with him.

26
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:36,370
Someone's always
in the Amphora lair...

27
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:38,839
...lighting torches...
...electing

28
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,717
the next president...

29
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:47,230
- Oops, I just broke the code.
- Come on, Cap.

30
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,110
I'm just a little nervous because finally,

31
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:56,558
after all this time,

32
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:58,655
we're back to being
friends again.

33
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,678
And you're worried
that friendship will fall apart

34
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,072
when he learns we're together?

35
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,671
Well, not to mention,he seemed
 pretty against it at the End of the World party.

36
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:12,647
But this time we're gonna get it right.

37
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,004
We're three years wiser.

38
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:22,853
Maybe you're three years wiser.

39
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:24,821
So you'll tell him?

40
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:27,628
Absotely. I will e-Mail this morning.

41
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:30,510
- Cap.
- All right, I'll text him. Or E-vite, inviting him

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,967
to the conversation.

43
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:35,318
Yesterday, Ash wanted to know
why I had this smile,

44
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:37,591
and I couldn't think of
an excuse, so I told her

45
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:39,966
I was thinking about the rise
and fall of Mischa Barton.

46
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:44,393
 So you have to tell Evan now.
 Then we can pick this back up.

47
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:46,252
- Pick what up?
- This.

48
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:02,482
- Maybe I should go tell him now. Yeah.
- Then I can tell Ashleigh.

49
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,401
Dale. We need to talk.

50
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:14,061
Really?! We've done so well this past week 
not talking. 

51
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,675
I need half your cable bill.
It's due today.

52
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:17,710
Today?

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,226
You could've told me a little 
sooner, you know?

54
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,230
I wrote you a message
in my grant project notes.

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,489
- I'm surprised you didn't see it.
-  For the love of...

56
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,560
You know what?
I apologized for that already.

57
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,098
Even though I don't think
I had anything to apologize for.

58
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:32,392
 if this is you back with God,
I think I liked the godless Dale better.

59
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:34,266
It'll all be moot when I win
the Innovation Grant today.

60
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:36,268
When you win?
I have a shot, too.

61
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:40,144
I've seen your notes. You still 
haven't gotten your wire to re-conduct.

62
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:42,360
Actually, the same night...

63
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,943
my self-healing wire turned
on for a full three minutes.

64
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:50,453
- Three minutes?
- Just like your mother.

65
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:55,210
All right, well, then I guess...
the better man will win.

66
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,990
I think we both know
who that man is.

67
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:04,184
It's me.

71
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:27,586
I slink down Greek Row looking mighty fine

72
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:30,868
Howling to the moonlight
on a hot winter night

73
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:35,102
Singing the blues while the other girls cry...

74
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:37,369
Stop marki and give it your all!

75
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,592
SongFest is in two days!

76
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,513
The drop-down is on the four!

77
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,977
The four! Let's step through it again.

78
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:49,101
Great job, Beth. The house is so lucky
to have a real Dance major.

79
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,748
And I'm so lucky that it's me.

80
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:56,359
Hey! Where were you last night?

81
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:59,308
- Did you have a boy-girl sleep-over?
- Maybe.

82
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:01,539
Who? The scruffy emo guy from the library?

83
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:03,617
He's scruffy all right.

84
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:06,065
And really awesome.
And someone you know.

85
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,570
Are you ready?

86
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:09,744
Cappie and I are back together.

87
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:11,554
You got back together with Cappie?

88
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:17,687
- Seriously?
- Who cares?

89
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:20,061
Get your asses back in line!

90
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,079
Now!

91
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:24,582
Well, I guess it was inevitable.

92
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:27,463
I want you to know I rarely try
to sleep with the same ex twice.

93
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:28,673
Thanks, Becks.

94
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,577
I'm... almost touched.

95
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,780
Now go dance.

96
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:34,276
And 

97
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,839
five, six, seven, eight!

98
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:38,593
Wow.

99
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:40,978
Wow. That is just so...

100
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:43,795
Wow.

101
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:46,795
"Wow", good? "Wow", bad?

102
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,492
"Wow" could mean a lot of things.

103
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:52,349
No, I mean "wow", I hope you don't
disappear into the KT black hole.

104
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,541
'Cause SongFest is the
second most Blue Ribbon

105
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:56,045
points after Greek Week,

106
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,231
- and you're one of our best dancers.
- I won't ditch you. I promise.

107
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,219
Good. 

108
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,122
Because we are on a mission to take
back number one from Gamma Psi,

109
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:05,355
I don't want any distractions.

110
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:06,441
Hang on.

111
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,989
- Katherine texted me.
- What does she want?

112
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:11,025
I don't know.

113
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:15,512
But I know what I want: an apology for
what they did to us at the four-pack.

114
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,141
Hey, Cap, what's the...

115
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,513
urn-mergency?

116
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,444
It's a good one.

117
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,526
Wait, what's wrong?

118
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:27,624
Well...

119
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:31,852
Let me just start by saying that
your opinion means a lot to me.

120
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,015
OK...

121
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:34,736
You know that I value...

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 you.

123
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,142
Am I getting fired?

124
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:41,202
The opposite actually. Let's think of this as

125
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:43,166
bringing another member into our team...

126
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:44,537
...she'll be working

127
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,478
directly under me...

128
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:48,965
Cap, what're you talking about?

129
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,058
Casey and I got back
together on Thanksgiving.

130
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:01,696
Wow. OK.

131
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,777
You waited all week to tell me?

132
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:04,884
I was just 

133
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:06,765
worried how you'd react.

134
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:09,834
Why? You still think that
I have feelings for her?

135
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:13,397
No. At the End of the World party
you told me not to go after her.

136
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:17,385
Why, do you have feelings forer?

137
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:20,781
No, no. We're just friends.
We're totally just friends.

138
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,705
Man, you know what, I regret
saying what I said at the party.

139
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:25,764
This is gonna be good. This
is gonna be really good.

140
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:28,210
It's great. Nothing is gonna change.

141
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,981
We'll all be pals, you know, like...

142
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,288
...like Harry Potter...

143
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,666
...and, um, you know,

144
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:35,342
the other two.

145
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:36,865
I appreciate that. Thank you.

146
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,833
So... you're OK with it? Really?

147
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:41,073
Yeah. Yeah, of course, man. Congrats.

148
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,654
- Come on.
- Thanks.

149
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,701
And... I'll catch you later, all right?

150
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,633
You know, just tell Casey

151
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,201
that I'll see her at Quidditch practice.

152
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,271
- Another good one.
- You can stop.

153
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:55,881
- I'm sorry.
- OK.

154
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,965
Stop lollygagging, Cartwright.

155
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:07,013
You don't need to be concerned with
your pasty, four-eyed friend. 

156
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:08,768
The judges will be here any minute.

157
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:10,076
OK. I'm almost done.

158
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,899
You seem to be preoccupied
with your competition.

159
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,435
Why don't you go speak to him?

160
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,795
I got nothing to say to him.

161
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,937
I'm not suggesting intelligent
discourse, Dale.

162
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:22,707
If you think he's a threat,
go over and rattle his cage.

163
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:26,276
Never underestimate the
value of the head game.

164
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:27,656
Watch this.

165
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,738
Looking good, Milton.

166
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,150
See that?

167
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,334
I don't know that that's necessary.

168
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:38,829
You want to win, don't you?

169
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,439
Be the best? Come on.

170
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,685
Hey, Rus?

171
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,192
Or should I say Anchor?

172
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:48,960
That's a sweet light bulb.

173
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,324
If I clap twice will it turn on?

174
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:54,150
That's...a good one, Dale.

175
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:57,500
What, you're not going to respond?

176
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,836
You told me not to...

177
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:01,240
He just fired a shot across your bow.

178
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,934
In your people's vernacular, it's on!

179
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,526
Show him what you've got.

180
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:09,153
Hey, Dale, if I'm The Anchor,

181
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:11,934
then you're the canker...

182
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,923
sore... in my mouth.

183
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:17,305
Oh! Anchor told Kettlewell he's
in his mouth! Good one, Ank.

184
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,208
- Just gonna take that?
- Yeah, Rusty...

185
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:25,425
I bet you do have canker sores...

186
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:29,919
...from all the unsavory
women you've made out with.

187
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,997
Oh! Point, Diz-ale! On a comebiz-ack!

188
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,565
It's your turn. Make it count.

189
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,662
At least I didn't lose my
virginity to our landlady,

190
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:41,493
and then ask her to marry me.

191
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:42,545
Oh, my God!

192
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,476
I was doing right by her!

193
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:46,090
You wanna have a conversation?!

194
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,966
Time to focus.

195
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:09,430
So, what are you up to tonight?

196
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:13,129
Oh, I was thinking about
busting up some KTs.

197
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,547
Oh, wait, that's probably you.

198
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:17,587
OK, stop. 

199
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,963
- Can we please put this behind us?
- You're the one who hasn't
wanted to talk about it.

200
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:24,187
Talk about that I like looking
out for my house and brothers?

201
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:28,072
OK, so you'll like looking out for them
but you don't want to be honest with them.

202
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:31,206
- I knew this was about me coming out.
- It's not just about that.

203
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:33,805
It's about this whole Mr. Tough Guy crap,

204
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:37,376
how quick you were to turn on Evan, who,
by the way, is keeping your secret.

205
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,354
And look at Evan: He came
out about his... money.

206
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:43,647
Now everybody treats him
different. I don't want that.

207
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:46,440
So maybe if I show them
that I'm a good brother...

208
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:50,291
-...they'll take the news better.
- Grant, they're gonna take
the news the way they want to.

209
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:53,199
If they have issues with it,
then that's their problem.

210
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,387
There's a lot of better ways
to be a good brother

211
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,534
- You don't understand.
- Grant...

212
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:02,567
...I am the only one in
the house that does.

213
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:13,265
It is simple, costumes revealing
genitals are unacceptable.

214
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:16,549
If you read your SongFest handbook,
it's all spelled out in the rules.

215
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:19,599
I cannot wait for the day when
I am paid to be this organized.

216
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,663
I had to book vendors, organize security...

217
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:24,312
Walk out on our four-pack
to make ZBZ look like losers.

218
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,080
Is something bothering you, ZBZ?

219
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,070
My name is Casey, 

220
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,495
and yes something is bothering me.
You and your sisters screwed us.

221
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:35,203
 four-pack, I don't concern myself
with inter-soritpolitics.

222
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:38,238
You're a part of Gamma Psi. Your house 
went from girl scouts to the Real Housewives

223
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:40,419
of pick-your-city overnight.

224
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,071
Yes, but I'm also
Panhellenic President.

225
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:47,111
People like us have to rise 
above the petty politics

226
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:50,413
that exist between houses,
which I thought you could do.

227
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,379
Which is why I wanted to speak with you.
As you kno there's an Vice President of Judicial.

228
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:57,999
I want you to serve.

229
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:03,283
- What!?
- You have good ideas, Casey, and drive.

230
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,756
and I need a VP of Judicial who 
is not 

231
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,235
afraid to disagree with me.

232
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:10,104
I agree. But not all the time!

233
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:12,948
I'm not afraid to disagree
with you when you're wrong.

234
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,379
Which you are not, 

235
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:15,629
currently.

236
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,695
As VPJ you would oversee
Greek disciplinary action,

237
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,022
you would help draft
new legislation.

238
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,070
Yes, you get your ownlipboard.

239
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,128
- My own clipboard?
- Just FYI. 

240
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,659
Eighty-five percent of VPJs from CRU
go on 

241
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:31,461
to receive JDs or MBAs.If that's something
that interests you?

242
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:33,903
All of those letters
interest me a lot!

243
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:37,276
as a Board member, you're
expected to be impartial, 

244
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:40,385
so you can't  participate in
any inter-sorority competions.

245
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:41,398
<i> So...</i>

246
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,478
So I'd have to drop out
of ZBZ's SongFest skit?

247
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,981
I need your answer by tomorrow. OK?

248
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,524
That's good right there!

249
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:56,620
I'm so happy my big brother
is dating my big sister.

250
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,058
- You've waited a long time to say that, haven't you?
- Maybe.

251
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:02,840
Don't worry. I know you're
her little brother, so...

252
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,442
I'm not worried about her.

253
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,316
How's your project going?

254
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,787
I finished my presentation earlier,

255
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:13,152
but Dale and I are still fighting
over  who's gonna win tonight.

256
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:16,220
Yeah, Daley did  mention you
guys were having some problems

257
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,564
this morning at Krav-Maga.

258
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:18,640
Now listen...

259
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:21,385
Every friendship has its rough patches.

260
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:24,919
And if you're really friends you'll find a
 way to work it out in the End.

261
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,264
Like Harry Potter...

262
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:28,037
and those other two.

263
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,129
OK. Holy crap, you guys,

264
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,455
I'm graduating!

265
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:34,741
What is that?

266
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:39,085
- Crickets!
- Gross!

267
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:40,135
I hate crickets!

268
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:41,725
Ever sincePinocchio.

269
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,635
They're too bossy.

270
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:47,048
They're coming from the fireplace.

271
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,932
"Enjoy your crickets, losers. XO OX"

272
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,485
Wait. The Omega Chis pranked us?

273
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:04,086
The old crickets-down-the-chimney gag.

274
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:06,648
This has Evan Chambers
written all over it.

275
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:10,609
Remember how I said everything
will work out in the end?

276
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,919
Well, maybe I was wrong.

277
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:17,267
How do I look?

278
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,274
Like SongFest gold
and you know it.

279
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:22,987
I do. Try yours on.

280
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:27,966
First, I wanted... I wanted to talk 
to you about my meeting with Katherine.

281
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:30,237
Tell me how it went.
Did you let her have it?

282
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:33,586
Yes. I told her to stop calling
me ZBZ and call me Casey.

283
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:35,731
Wow. And then what?

284
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:40,686
And then she offered me a Panhellenic 
Board position. Wait, she offered you a job?

285
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:43,001
Yeah, Vice President of Judicial.

286
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,695
VPJ, yay!

287
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:51,807
Which means I would have
to drop out of our skit.

288
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:53,705
What?!

289
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:56,236
It's a big opportunity!

290
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,260
No, she's a Gamma Psi, Case.

291
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,691
You went over there to chew her out
 and she bribed you!


292
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,643
She did not bribe me, Ash.

293
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,318
You are under a lot of pressure.

294
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,913
You want to win SongFest...
Yeah. So did you.

295
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:09,434
until Katherine came along.

296
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,812
Crickets?

297
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:16,879
Really, dude?

298
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:18,820
You could've warned me.

299
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,685
They're in every crack of our house.

300
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,725
See?

301
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:25,632
I don't know what you're talking about.

302
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,425
I found this in our chimney,

303
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:30,873
along with the entire cast of "A Bug's Life."

304
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,995
You must've known what
your house was up to, right?

305
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:37,714
Well, you did tag our plaque in
 your Thanksgiving break -in.

306
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:41,373
 This is this about Casey, isn't it?

307
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:43,819
- I knew this would happen.
- What?

308
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:46,559
Things would get all weird
when you guys got back together.

309
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:48,825
Since you're the one
making it weird, Nostradamus,

310
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:51,394
I'm not exactly impressed by your 
ability to predict the future.

311
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:52,615
I was just being honest.

312
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,526
OK, Last time you were honest,
you ended up regretting what You said.

313
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,385
I regret that I said that.

314
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:00,279
OK? I don't understand why you want
to go through that again.

315
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:02,761
You still don't think Casey and I will wk?

316
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:04,362
Hey, I hope I'm wrong,

317
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,192
- but given the history...
- Trust me,

318
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,405
this time it will be different.

319
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,207
Thank you all for participating.

320
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:25,001
Your projects were amazing!

321
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,224
Yes, yes, everyone gets a ribbon,
you're special just for trying...

322
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:29,747
Announce the winners already.

323
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,032
The finalists are...

324
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,109
Samir Nagra...

325
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,120
Yes!

326
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:39,661
Kim Cervenka...

327
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:42,453
- Li Yin Tan...
- Awesome!

328
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,107
Dale Kettlewell...

329
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:45,123
Yes!

330
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:46,360
Was there any doubt?

331
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:50,258
- ...and Rusty Cartwright.
- I did it?!

332
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,195
I did it!

333
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,720
Not bad, for The Anchor.

334
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,132
Your final projects were all so good,

335
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,811
that we need more time to
thoroughly evaluate each one.

336
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:04,189
As a result, we'll announce
the winner next semester.

337
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,980
Thank you all for coming.

338
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:13,895
Hey, man, have you heard anything about
the guys dumping a boatload of crickets

339
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,365
into the Kappa Tau chimney?

340
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:18,380
I'm sure Grant knows.

341
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,637
- Things still bad there?
- Yeah. And getting worse.

342
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,337
Yeah, I know how you feel.

343
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:26,272
Probably not entirely...

344
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:28,014
...but, um, yeah, 

345
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,847
a few of the guys are still
treating me weird.

346
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:32,634
- Stand your ground.
- Yeah, you, too.

347
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,128
Hey guys, 

348
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,563
we're getting a poker game
started. Wanna join us?

349
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:39,520
I'll pass.

350
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,652
Yeah, Chambers. Hundred-dollar buy-in.

351
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:43,642
Can you handle that?

352
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:44,825
I'll pass.

353
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,382
Actually, I'll stake you in this game.

354
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:51,841
Consider it payback for all those
shots you've bought us in the past.

355
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:54,731
Thanks, Grant.

356
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:58,924
You guys gonna make out or play?

357
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:01,681
I'm out.

358
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:05,430
I'm in.

359
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:08,035
Son of a...

360
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:09,972
What the hell is this?!

361
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:12,180
"You hit the...

362
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:14,557
 KT wall."

363
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:19,527
Krappa Tau is gonna pay for that.

364
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:24,484
<i>Gamma Psi tonight</i>

365
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:25,686
<i>Gamma Psi tonight</i>

366
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:28,402
I've never seen so many Gamma
Psis together in one place.

367
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,179
They look like those creepy little
kids from Village of the Damned.

368
00:18:31,189 --> 00:18:34,172
<i>Gamma Psi's the best and we got game </i>

369
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,644
<i>So step back 
Boy, do not approach </i>

370
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:39,700
They're good.

371
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,188
They're good, but they're no ZBZ.

372
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:45,692
I'd feel a lot better if
we had our entire cast.

373
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:47,860
You guys are gonna do fine without me.

374
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,520
<i>Gamma Psi tonight</i>

375
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,607
<i>Gamma Psi tonight</i>

376
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:54,924
Gamma Psi.

377
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:01,022
Hey, Case. I hope you guys are
ready for a little competion.

378
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:04,806
I mean, the Mu Gamma Sigs might give
you guys a run for your money.

379
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:05,965
Natalie, 

380
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:10,425
shouldn't you be protecting
your pot of gold?

381
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:16,011
Casey, that mean girl says
I can't do SongFest.

382
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,264
What? Who?

383
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,161
Katherine, 

384
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,018
did you tell Beth that
she can't do SongFest?

385
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:23,848
Afraid so. Participants have to be
current members of their ho

386
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:27,197
Beth deactivated ZBZ last semester
when she went I-Kap, so...

387
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,136
OK. I'll send her home.

388
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:31,290
- What?
- Oh, you can't use her dance, either.

389
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,415
- What? You can't be serious.
- What?

390
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:35,462
As VPJ frontrunner,

391
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,123
I think you should understand the rules.

392
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:40,390
That just happen to knock us
out the day before SongFest.

393
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,376
You just sabotaged our house,
you can't expect her...

394
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:45,223
I don't have your response
on the VP of Judicial job.

395
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:48,422
I really stuck my neck out for you,
so I'd like your answer now... 

396
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:49,442
please.

397
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,725
I decline.

398
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,403
So you're gonna

399
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:01,798
turn this down so you can dance
in a skit that you don't have?

400
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:03,518
My house needs me.

401
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:05,155
My house needs me.

402
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:06,561
Moving on.

403
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:19,214
to be one of those couples
that holds hands?

404
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,009
I don't know. Let me see your hand.

405
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:23,772
So how did Evan take it?

406
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:27,322
Pretty well. You know Evs.

407
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,731
Did Ashleigh explode over the news?

408
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:33,774
Yeah, she was a little worried that
you'd pull my focus from SongFest.

409
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:36,407
Obviously not. I missed you last night.

410
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:40,371
We were up until four a.m. trying
to come up with a new dance.

411
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,422
And all we agreed on was that
Katherine is another Frannie,

412
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:47,560
- only evil-er.
- So tonight's out of the question?

413
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,429
After SongFest is over, I promise.

414
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,328
- Think you can wait that long?
- Oh, ok. 

415
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:57,956
But any longer and I'm
gonna start without you.

416
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:02,360
- Wow, sweaty much?
- Ok, that is you!

417
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,370
Cap!

418
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:05,658
Oh... Evan, hey.

419
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:09,359
Hey, Case... do you mind if I talk
to Cap alone for a few sec?

420
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:11,857
- What is going on?
- Why don't you ask him?

421
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:14,959
He walled in our front door cause
he didn't appreciated my honesty

422
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,389
This has nothing to do with your honesty.

423
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,374
It's about the swarm of crickets
that's still in our house.

424
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:23,634
Ok you guys, you can't let your houses
get in the way of your friendship.

425
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:26,600
And until you get them to declare a
truce, none of this will ever change. 

426
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,613
- Katie is a stowing up on this.
- Crickets, Evan.

427
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,088
Douchebag.

428
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:45,559
Maybe... what you guys need
is a common ennemy.

429
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:48,661
Cappie. Who did the Kappa
Tau hate the most?

430
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:49,989
Ryan Seacrest.

431
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,098
Oh, no, no, no, wait... wait...

432
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:53,111
Officer Huck.

433
00:21:53,121 --> 00:21:55,758
And who did the Omega Chis hate the most?

434
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:56,862
Liberals?

435
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,577
- Huck.
- So...

436
00:21:58,768 --> 00:21:59,828
maybe...

437
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,397
we got our houses to team up against him.

438
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:04,446
Fight over our hatred for Huck together.

439
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:06,488
Right?

440
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:11,534
Hey! So I thought we could celebrate
the end of this ridiculous competition

441
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:13,950
between you to, with a .... pizza.

442
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:16,121
So? Who won?

443
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:19,579
- They haven't decided yet.
So neither of us won.
- Well, not yet anyway...

444
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:21,815
- Hey!
- You're not gonna eat out.

445
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,214
Guys, what the hell?

446
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:25,995
- He keeps rubbing me the wrong way.
- Is there a right way to rub you?

447
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:29,444
- Ok, this is ridiculous.
- Well, we need to do something soon.

448
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:31,659
Because if I have to live like
this until next semester,

449
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:34,857
- What? You're gonna take me down?
- Oh, I can take you up and down.

450
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,589
- Well, there's only one
way to settle this then.
- Whoa, guys.

451
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,809
And what's that?

452
00:22:40,722 --> 00:22:41,880
Battle Bots.

453
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,390
- You're on.
- You're on.

454
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:49,147
Wait... how about this?

455
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:54,105
I just saw someone on the dancefloor once.

456
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,854
That's fine if you wanna get pregnant.

457
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:01,854
How about this?

458
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,008
Really?

459
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:13,491
You know, I never thought I'd say this...

460
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,224
but without Beth, we're screwed.

461
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:17,851
But we can't let Katherine win.

462
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:20,675
We just have to be the best we
can be with the people we have.

463
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:23,730
You know what, it's just too bad we
don't have someone who can choreograph.

464
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,525
Oh, for the billionth time Abby, you don't
have to raise your hand to ask a question.

465
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:30,465
It's more of a suggestion
actually. For a new dance.

466
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,518
No offense, but what do you
know about choreography?

467
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:35,872
I choreographed three of
my high school musicals,

468
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,898
the third one, was our senior year.

469
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:42,048
Oh, well we are desperate.

470
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:44,267
And we're all in this together.

471
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,721
So...

472
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,256
What you doing Spitter?

473
00:23:50,394 --> 00:23:55,322
I have 24 hours to modify a base-line robot
with standardize weaponry to destroy Dale?

474
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,513
Ok.

475
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:00,887
Gemini wants you to be
careful with your killer robot. 

476
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,148
Who's Gemini?

477
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,999
We came to an understanding.

478
00:24:19,587 --> 00:24:22,037
- An official meeting now?
- No, sorry, I was just...

479
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:24,192
killing a cricket. But I
do have an annoucement.

480
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:26,612
We're gonna finally get
back at Officer Huck.

481
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,140
Rusty has a killer-robot, so maybe
after he kills Dale, we can like...

482
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,808
- attack Huck with it or something.
- We're not gonna need the robot Beav.

483
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,173
We have help this time.

484
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,650
The Omega Chis.

485
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,108
- Cap, are you drunk?
- Nope, I'm serious.

486
00:24:43,118 --> 00:24:44,308
I talmked to Evan,

487
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,153
our houses are gonna pull
off the plan together.

488
00:24:46,163 --> 00:24:49,000
- Why? Those guys are jerk.
- It's not like we can trust them.

489
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,989
Gemini agrees with Rusty.

490
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,445
True, but...

491
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,753
what better way not to trust someone

492
00:24:55,763 --> 00:24:59,005
that to trust them with someone
you distrust more than them?

493
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:03,580
That makes no sense at all.

494
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,198
- Exactly.
- It works for me.

495
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:06,943
Me too.

496
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:08,796
Oh, Gemini!

497
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:13,610
Great. Meeting adjourned.

498
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:19,881
Nailed it.

499
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,880
And so with KT's help we'll
pull off the ultime prank.

500
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,257
And Huck and the school will
remember for years to come.

501
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:34,100
Why do we wanna do anything with the KTs?

502
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,325
Yeah, we don't need them
to screw with Huck.

503
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:40,178
- Huh, that's true, but... I think...
- Was this your idea or them?

504
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:41,791
We came up with this together.

505
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:44,049
Come on, Chambers.

506
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:46,138
Guys, just back off, alright?

507
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:49,087
You guys have been on Evan's ass
ever since he gave up his money.

508
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:50,745
This has nothing to do with money.

509
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:54,059
It's about Evan being who he was
before he gave up his money.

510
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,583
And I'm still that guy.

511
00:25:56,593 --> 00:25:59,906
The Evan Chambers we elected as president 
wouldn't have taken the back seat to anyone. 

512
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:01,074
He's right, Evan.

513
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:02,504
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:06,713
The Evan Chambers I voted for
wouldn't join someone's else plan.

515
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,403
He'd have one of his own.

516
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:11,448
We need a prank that
shows how awesome we are.

517
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,701
Or maybe we'd just need another president.

518
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:21,594
Meeting adjourned.

519
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:25,307


520
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:39,489
Thank you Pi

521
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:43,257
for that wildly inappropriate
rendition of "Wild Things".

522
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:50,826
Next up, we have ZBZ.

523
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,761
This is it Beav, Casey's up.

524
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,057
Maybe she and her buckle will do "Bound".

525
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,399
Can't say I haven't thought about it.

526
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:04,409
ZBZ!

527
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:06,185
What is taking so long?

528
00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:09,141
ZBZ!

529
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:17,786
Well, I guess this means ZBZ
is not coming. Moving on.

530
00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:19,982


531
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:31,308


532
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:34,527


533
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:37,450


534
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:03,904


535
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:08,083


536
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:12,204


537
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:15,489


538
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:19,978


539
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:24,011


540
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:27,747


541
00:28:27,993 --> 00:28:31,567


542
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:36,218


543
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:40,016


544
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:43,693


545
00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:48,644


546
00:28:48,654 --> 00:28:52,715


547
00:28:52,725 --> 00:28:56,577


548
00:28:56,587 --> 00:29:00,454


549
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:01,910
Yo Casey!

550
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,836
Teach me, teach me, teach me!

551
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:33,642
So what, do I start dancing like
right here flesh mob style?

552
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,939
- Ok, no, honey...
- What? Sorry.

553
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:38,950
Case, we're waiting for the results.

554
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:48,344


555
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:49,891
Ash, wow.

556
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:51,389
Who's that girl?

557
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:53,781
Oh... she's a friend.

558
00:29:54,117 --> 00:29:57,011
Congratulations, you were so so great.

559
00:29:57,276 --> 00:29:58,282
Thanks.

560
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,034
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Ok.

561
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:08,005
- So I'm in.
- Well, that means we're both in.

562
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,981
We're waiting further.

563
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:12,425
Do you have any idea what
comes ou of your mouth?

564
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,903
- No, do you?
- Guys.

565
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,653
We'll meet later at the students' union.

566
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:17,800
All right.

567
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:22,985
Hey, richkin.

568
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,445
Wanna grab a drink at Dobler's afterwards?

569
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:28,909
Oh, sorry I gotta raincheck, but
you looked pretty awesome up there.

570
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:30,115
I know.

571
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:39,878
The scores are in.

572
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:44,293
The winner of this year SongFest,
and "15 blue" event points

573
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:45,603
is

574
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:53,242
Gamma Psi!

575
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:01,507
What?

576
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,687
What?

577
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:05,253
We were way better than
these demonic munchkins.

578
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,777
They cheated, they had to.

579
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:08,533
Katherine tailed the votes.

580
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:10,352
Maybe we should temper with them...

581
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:13,859
Yeah, well, even if she did, we
can't prove it, so we're screwed. 

582
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,182
All we need to do is... is
check the score sheets...

583
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:18,808
which would be on her clipboard.

584
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:21,059
So we're gonna ask to see her clipboard? 

585
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:22,953
We don't have to ask.

586
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,357
I guess this is it. No professors...

587
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:34,535
no projects...

588
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:35,983
just you and me.

589
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,319
It had to be.

590
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:40,221
Articulated hydraulic, mano a mano.

591
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:42,966
Well, here's a fair fight.

592
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:47,791
There's nothing fait about this Rust
Fair would be me winning my grand.

593
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:51,686
Because for the last year and a half I'v
spent every waking minute on school.

594
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:54,871
While you've been out with
your girls and your frat bros.

595
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,802
Hey guys, save it for the Battle Bots.

596
00:31:57,812 --> 00:32:01,899
No, no. 'Cause I sacrifize
and I make the hard choices

597
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:03,686
while everything just fall in your lap.

598
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:06,781
You had a D on your midterm, you
almost flake on the extra credit, 

599
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,372
and everything just works out.

600
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:10,206
Hey, I worked hard too!

601
00:32:10,216 --> 00:32:12,932
Not half as hard as I have.
And you know it. 

602
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:14,625
I deserve this.

603
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:16,625
You don't.

604
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,616
Can you believe it?

605
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:22,368
Well,

606
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,444
Rusty, all seems good for you,

607
00:32:25,454 --> 00:32:27,993
you know, school, Kappa
Tau, girlfriends...

608
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,761
all he has is science.

609
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:32,646
And, God, we barely talked this semester.

610
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:35,111
So I just should let him win
because I feel bad for him?

611
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:38,080
No, I'm just saying, this
guy has one thing in his life

612
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,650
take that away from him...

613
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:42,587
You're a scientist, you can do the math.

614
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:53,463
Good thing they didn't leave a single light
on since we're paying their electric bill.

615
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,864
Found a candle.

616
00:33:02,832 --> 00:33:03,841
Jasmine.

617
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,241
What? It's dark in here.

618
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:10,263
That's why we brought our flashlights.

619
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,745
I think they were in a rush to hit
Dobler's. Everyone, start looki

620
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,595
- Ooh! I think I found it!
- Let's see it.

621
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:27,510
OK, the judges gave us
95, 95, 99, and a zero?

622
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:30,747
- Someone gave us a zero out of 100?
- This one judge. Ryan.

623
00:33:31,164 --> 00:33:33,677
He also gave the Gamma Psis a 100!

624
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:34,988
That's so shady!

625
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:38,071
Yeah, all the others gave
Gamma Psi low 80S.

626
00:33:38,994 --> 00:33:40,985
Does that mean they bribed the judge?

627
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,208
Oh! They're like mini-Sopranos.

628
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,948
Well, if that's the case,

629
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,430
then we have our proof.

630
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:47,958
Yeah, let's go.

631
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:57,575
Come on.

632
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,711
We were right, Lambers.

633
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:13,154
This is the ultimate prank.

634
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:15,957
Let's go downstairs, get some
extra rope just to be safe.

635
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,300
- Cap, come on.
- Sure. 

636
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,170
- Guys, you good for a sec?
- Got it, Cap.

637
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:33,879
Guys!

638
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:42,226
Evan, get in.

639
00:34:42,236 --> 00:34:44,109
You guys are bailing?

640
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:47,333
- Run, Cap.
- We're not even done here.
What're you talking about?

641
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:48,970
Evan, hurry.

642
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:51,271
Guys! We can't hold this forever!

643
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:54,148
- They need our help up there.
- Get in the truck. All right.

644
00:34:56,457 --> 00:34:57,903
- You called the cops!
- Sorry, Cap.

645
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:59,695
Listen to me, I'm doing you a favor. 

646
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:01,014
Run!

647
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:02,039
But, wait...

648
00:35:04,206 --> 00:35:05,304
Oh, no, no, no!

649
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:09,595
Oh, my God!

650
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:16,869
Sweet mother of mercy.

651
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:18,812
The Mach 5!

652
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:20,959
- We gotta go.
- What? Where are Wade and the guys?

653
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:23,220
- We can't help.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

654
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:27,026
Oh, dear lord, that's a sticky wicket.

655
00:35:29,176 --> 00:35:30,424
Don't move!

656
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,379
They went that-a-way!

657
00:35:37,597 --> 00:35:41,730
In this corner, standing

658
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,890
a member of a non-academic frat,

659
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,017
It's Rusty "The Anchor" Cartwright!

660
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:50,151
In this corner, he's a born
-again landlady lay-er

661
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:51,708
from Wetumpka, Arkansas,

662
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:53,819
weighing at he-wouldn't-tell-us,

663
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:58,645
the ultimate, extreme circuit boarder,
Dale "The Lightning Rail" Kettlewell.

664
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,844
Please let this be quick.

665
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,471
On your marks, 

666
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,164
get set...

667
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:07,784
...Battle Bots!

668
00:36:26,145 --> 00:36:27,686
Close shave, huh, Rus?!

669
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:31,499
Yeah!

670
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:48,782
Anchor's away, Dale!

671
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:54,224
How does that feel?

672
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,171
What's wrong, Dale?

673
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,233
What's wrong with your robot?

674
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:07,876
This guy's gonna lose to Rusty!

675
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:09,965
Looks like we got ourselves a new Anchor!

676
00:37:15,644 --> 00:37:17,267
No, no, no, no...

677
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:40,969
Dale wins!

678
00:37:44,374 --> 00:37:46,162
Dale wins, everybody!

679
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:52,709
Congratulations, Dale.

680
00:37:53,683 --> 00:37:56,902
Thanks, Rusty. Looks like we finally
found out who the better man is.

681
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:04,570
- Dale! Dale! Dale! Dale!
- Ok...

682
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,118
Dale! Dale!

683
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:15,281
Smells like someone's grilling.

684
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,542
I really hope not.

685
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:20,322
Rebecca, did you remember
to blow out that candle?

686
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:23,302
Guys...

687
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:24,853
Back at the house.

688
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:37,555
We need to talk.

689
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:41,913
Outside. I don't want you in my house.

690
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,472
I'm glad you made it out OK...

691
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:55,375
You planned this?

692
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:56,925
Listen to me, all right?

693
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,675
Yes, we left your guys holding
the cart and called the police.

694
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:00,948
So we'd get caught.

695
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,055
I had to do it to get my house back.

696
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:05,984
And your solution was to get
three of my brothers expelled.

697
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:09,023
Expelled? 

698
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:11,482
God, no, that wasn't the plan.

699
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:13,412
We thought they'd get community service.

700
00:39:13,422 --> 00:39:16,356
- That's a hell of a plan.
- What was I supposed to do, man?!

701
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,617
Give up my house and take a backseat to
you and Casey like I did. Freshman year? 

702
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,838
Come on!

703
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:26,124
When it comes down to
choosing between friends 

704
00:39:26,134 --> 00:39:28,831
and brothers, you have to
choose your brothers.

705
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,662
Yeah,

706
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:36,289
you made your choice pretty clear.

707
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:39,124
Wait. Listen. Listen.

708
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,439
You have the perfect girl,

709
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:46,509
guys who worship you.

710
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,736
My house is all I have left.

711
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:53,223
Well, you're right about that.

712
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:59,794
Oh, and if I were you, I would
go out through the back gate.

713
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:13,709
What happened?

714
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:23,483
Oh! Thank God you guys are OK.
When we heard the sirens

715
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:26,294
I thought maybe you guys
were in the Gamma Psi house.

716
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,937
- We weren't there.
- Thank God,

717
00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:33,086
for a second there I thought that
maybe you guys had started the fire.

718
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:34,328
No, we were there,

719
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:36,541
but we didn't start the fire.

720
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:38,506
We hope not.

721
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:41,875
I left a candle burning, not a campfire!

722
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:45,686
But, maybe you can explain that to the
police since you love talking about it.

723
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:47,558
Oh, my God! The police?

724
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:52,416
We're all gonna go to girl jail like
those prison movies my boyfriend watches!

725
00:40:56,513 --> 00:40:59,303
- It's Katherine!
- Oh, no. That's the mean girl.

726
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:01,032
OK, I got it.

727
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:05,431
Katherine,

728
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,174
- I can't believe this.
- I know. It is surreal. 

729
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:13,149
But I plan on doing everything in
my power to investigate this.

730
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,601
Is that necessary? It
could've been an accident.

731
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:20,493
No, it's unlikely. This is the kind of thing
that rarely occurs unless someone is at fault.

732
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:22,689
And they will be punished severely.

733
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:25,152
You should go easy, I mean...

734
00:41:25,162 --> 00:41:27,600
You don't want to
overdo it, you know... 

735
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:29,407
right?

736
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:33,624
That's big of you, Casey, considering 

737
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:35,904
ZBZ is  the most affected.

738
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:37,976
Wait. 

739
00:41:37,986 --> 00:41:39,176
What are you talking about?

740
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:42,664
Irregularities in SongFest judging.
What are you talking about?

741
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:49,518
I was talking about
your house burning down.

742
00:41:49,983 --> 00:41:51,092
My what?!

743
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:53,300
Oh, my God!

744
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:56,919
She didn't disqualify Beth
for no reason! She...

745
00:41:57,259 --> 00:42:00,645
Which means she really wanted me for the
job. Which means she's not Frannie.

746
00:42:00,655 --> 00:42:02,641
We have bigger problems.

747
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:04,808
You're our president, Ash.

748
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:06,651
What now?

749
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,848
We turn ourselves in, I guess.

750
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,206
- No.
- No?

751
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:23,186
We can't turn ourselves in because
we don't know what happened.

752
00:42:23,196 --> 00:42:26,318
It's an old house. It could've been
electrical, it could've been a gas leak...

753
00:42:26,328 --> 00:42:28,347
- Or a raccoon.

754
00:42:28,357 --> 00:42:30,564
We'll know if we did it

755
00:42:30,898 --> 00:42:32,758
when we get in trouble for it.

756
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:34,791
But until then we say nothing.

757
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:38,072
- I won't breath a word, I promise.
- Yeah.

758
00:42:38,082 --> 00:42:40,024
We all need to promise.
We need to make a pact.

759
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:41,982
Yeah. Yeah, everyone gather around.

760
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:43,857
Put your pinkies up.

761
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:50,674
We, the sisters of Zeta Beta Zeta,

762
00:42:51,245 --> 00:42:54,385
promise never to tell anyone
outside of these walls

763
00:42:54,525 --> 00:42:56,240
what happened tonight.

764
00:42:56,484 --> 00:42:57,484
Yeah.

765
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:03,373
Ok.

766
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:18,800
What are you doing here?

767
00:43:20,137 --> 00:43:22,115
Rain check, remember?

768
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:26,699
I could really use a friend right now.

769
00:43:43,835 --> 00:43:47,332
I can't believe Wade, Ferret
and Jeremy got expelled.

770
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:54,653
I lost four of my best friends today.

771
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,324
Sorry, Cap.

772
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:05,641
Well, it could be worse.

773
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:10,835
At least our house didn't burn
down like the Gamma Psi's, huh?

774
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:12,667
Yeah.

775
00:44:14,315 --> 00:44:17,310
Transcripted by YesCool, and chamallow35

776
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:20,267
Greek comeback on 25th  January
