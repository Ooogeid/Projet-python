00:00:00,121 --> 00:00:02,339
- <i>Previously on</i> Greek
- I'm Rusty Cartwright,

2
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:04,967
I'm a freshman.
I wanna rush a fraternity.

3
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:08,387
- You're not fraternity material.
- You're Casey's little brother?

4
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,848
- I'm her boyfriend.
- I wanna be a Kappa Tau.

5
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:13,475
Let's go.
The reason I broke up with you...

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,792
- I dumped you
- Hey Crappy.

7
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:17,324
It's Cappie.

8
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:22,300
- Your letters?
- Casey's got lavaliered by Evan.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,321
I was hoping you'd want this picture
so you wouldn't forget me.

10
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:27,870
I barely remember anything before you.

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,284
Look at this!
Your people made the front page.

12
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:33,613
You started a witch hunt
and we might be the witches.

13
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,620
I wrote the article.

14
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:39,160
Frannie, I'm removing you
as president effective immediatly.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,659
I have selected an intern president.

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,029
You accidentely outed me
to my entire house.

17
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:50,490
I really wanna believe that if you
had given us any consideration,

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,060
you never would have written an article.

19
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:58,116
Do you truly believe Casey
is over Cappie?

20
00:00:58,387 --> 00:00:59,552
Tell the truth.

21
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:03,114
We kissed but it did not go any further.
Look, Evan, don't go.

22
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:05,641
I'm wearing your letters.
I'm planning with you,

23
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,529
- I love...
- No, you love you!

24
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:10,199
You love what I can do for you!

25
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:11,678
My lady.

26
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:19,792
You ready to get out of here?
Let's go home.

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,327
Welcome back from break
all you students from Cyprus Rhode.

28
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:31,127
The weather today
will be clear and sunny.

29
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,810
Oh my God no more, enough!

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,985
I can't believe you just did that.

31
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:51,994
That was the mixed CD Jen-K made me for
our three and a half week anniversary

32
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:55,257
- and you littered it.
- I have listened to that song

33
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:58,394
every moment of every day
for the past four weeks

34
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:00,749
of what was supposed to be
my restorative break.

35
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,584
It's a really good song.

36
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:05,160
Ok stop, it's ending right now.

37
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:09,046
I've had it with your psychotic mopping.
If anyone should be depressed, it's me.

38
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,927
I was the one who got dumped
last semester, you dumped her.

39
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:15,730
You are in the inpowered position.
You could take her back if you wanted.

40
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,633
- You think I should take her back?
- Hell, no, Ok stop!

41
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:22,117
If I'm in the inpowered position
because I'm the dumper,

42
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,716
and I feel like crap, then how can you,

43
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,916
as the dumpee, not feel like
a pathetic loser?

44
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:32,020
- Do you want to walk?
- Not that you're a pathetic loser,

45
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,500
but how can you not feel like one?
I mean, I feel like one.

46
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,070
I took restorative steps over break.

47
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:41,537
I completely purged Evan from my life.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,403
I deleted e-mails,
threw away love letters, watched Oprah.

49
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,880
I decided to move on and so I did.

50
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:51,014
You can do it too.
Decide to be done with Jen-K,

51
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:54,931
and you will be, decide
this is going to be a great semester,

52
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:57,314
- and it will be.
- You think I can do that?

53
00:02:57,964 --> 00:02:59,314
I know you can.

54
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,598
We are starting anew.

55
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:05,165
I've new things to think about
as president, you have...

56
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:07,565
whatever things
you need to think about.

57
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:09,948
We have a clean slate,

58
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:12,148
and we can write whatever we want on it.

59
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:19,296
So much for a clean slate.

60
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:21,596
Oprah, help me!

63
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:50,798
Stop, I'm serious,

64
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,248
I hate being tickled.

65
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,037
Nice poster,

66
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:00,869
- highly original.
- You're just noticing that poster now?

67
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:04,498
Let's just say I haven't been
in a position to notice the poster.

68
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:12,577
It's 2:17, that's 17 minutes past
when I said I had to go.

69
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:14,924
You know what?
Let's end on an even number.

70
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:18,394
I don't like odd numbers,
it's bad luck in so many cultures.

71
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:24,428
2:18, got to go.

72
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:31,900
- Right, vacation time is over.
- Which means, this is over too.

73
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:34,278
We both said it was for fun,

74
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:35,676
but that's it.

75
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:37,185
Just a fling.

76
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,409
Fling-tastic!

77
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:56,018
I'm sorry,
I think you are in the ZBZ seat.

78
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,843
And I think you guys lost
the privilege to sit here at the table.

79
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:03,110
Oh but look, there is a seat right

80
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:06,435
between the Moo Gamma pig
and the Sci-Fi pie!

81
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:09,795
I don't really care where I sit.

82
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,889
So, you are slumming at our end
of the table?

83
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,355
How was your break?

84
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:26,172
Productive. How about yours?

85
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,262
Productive.

86
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:35,742
I want to thank everybody
for coming on such short notice.

87
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:37,045
Dean Bowman?

88
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,553
You have grown younger,
share with us your magic.

89
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:48,045
Over break, the university
formed a greek task force,

90
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:50,618
comprised of alumni
and administrators

91
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:52,439
to deal with the article.

92
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:55,609
I was appointed their liaison,

93
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:59,678
and this is what we came up with.

94
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,912
You guys can basicaly see for yourself.
It's curfews,

95
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:07,287
cops checking IDs,

96
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:11,291
- higher GPA requirements, wristbands.
- Wristbands?

97
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,428
Good God man, not wristband, come on!

98
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,826
Those of you who don't comply,

99
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:19,623
will be punished
with fines and probation,

100
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,760
If it comes down to permanent shutdown,

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,110
which in the case of the Kappa Taus,

102
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,468
might be doing us all a favor.

103
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:30,452
Why should we all get worked
because the ZBZs screwed up?

104
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:40,670
First let me just say,

105
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:43,320
as intern president,

106
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,193
I'm willing to take responsability

107
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:48,086
for ZBZ's role in this mess.

108
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,903
And I can promise all of you,

109
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,420
that we'll do whatever we need to do,

110
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:55,898
to restore the university's faith in us.

111
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:57,935
But if we want to get through this,

112
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,135
we have to work together.

113
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,136
It sucks that we have
to follow these new rules,

114
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:07,935
at least for a little while,
but I'm fully confident,

115
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:10,568
that we can still have fun

116
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:15,772
You are the last person
we are going to listen to right now.

117
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:16,898
Am I right?

118
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:22,355
Casey is right.

119
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:23,989
I am?

120
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:27,659
I am.

121
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:29,724
And furthermore,

122
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,998
I've been thinking a lot about
a way to start the semester off,

123
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:35,291
with a big rule-following thing.

124
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:37,958
A back to school Carnival.

125
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:40,871
Those were always a blast, right?

126
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,425
And each house can have their own booth,

127
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:46,067
and raise money for whatever
happens to be,

128
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,846
dean Bowman's favorite charity.

129
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,717
Yeah, I like it.

130
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:54,350
I mean showing our unity,

131
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,939
benefiting charity will send a positive
message to the administration.

132
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,700
I mean guys, we can't deny
what happened last semester,

133
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,267
but we can work to move past it,

134
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,000
together.

135
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,518
What happened?

136
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:25,717
What page are we on?

137
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:29,918
I'm telling you, the Crystal Cathedral
puts on quite a show,

138
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:32,880
they had live lambs.
You should come next year.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,350
It's great, Dale.

140
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,312
Man, there is nothing like to smell
a new textbook.

141
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:42,025
I think space plasma physics
smells the best, don't you?

142
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:51,144
Hi, how are you?

143
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:58,778
That was the third Jen-K, this morning.
She has bewitched you.

144
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:01,711
"That was the woman who was deceived
and became a sinner."

145
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:03,461
First Timothy, 2.14.

146
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,875
I don't know how Casey is doing it.

147
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:08,442
It's even harder now that I'm back here,

148
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:09,962
scene of the crime.

149
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:12,342
Yeah, I heard about Casey and her beau.

150
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:14,612
Do you think she's still a virgin?

151
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:26,767
Hey Evan, how's it going?

152
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:27,987
How is it going?

153
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,667
You turned in your pledge pin,

154
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,637
without talking me about it,

155
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,337
it's pretty lame.

156
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:37,664
I thought we were friends.

157
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:39,904
We are.

158
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:43,075
And I would like for us
to still be brothers.

159
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:46,089
The rest of the guys, it's just...

160
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,304
They were surprised.

161
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,929
- You just walked out.
- I walked out,

162
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:56,808
because everyone was looking at me
like I was wearing Ashleigh's chaps.

163
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:00,645
What's wrong with Ashleigh's chaps?

164
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:07,736
I want you to consider
giving Omaga Chi another chance.

165
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:11,348
Alright, we might surprise you.

166
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:20,364
Did you see anyone from school
over break?

167
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:22,681
Like Rebecca...

168
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:25,731
Rebecca who?

169
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:29,914
The senator's daughter.

170
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:32,564
Just a fling.
Nothing more to say.

171
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,460
- Cause now that Casey's free...
- You know what they say?

172
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:41,341
Dump me once,
shame on you.

173
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,043
Dump me seven times,
shame on me.

174
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:47,635
shame on guys who wear braided belts,
they just give me the willies.

175
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:50,351
You know what else give me the willies?
You pimping out your sister.

176
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,968
Do you want Perv
to be your new nickname?

177
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:54,741
You like that?

178
00:10:57,694 --> 00:10:59,635
Evan stood up and defended me,

179
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,635
which, I'm sure, means nothing.

180
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,289
Or maybe he wants you back.

181
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:10,739
Not that you'd care since you're keep
telling me that you two are done, so...

182
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:12,092
That you're over him.

183
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,473
I am! I so am!

184
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,773
But that doesn't mean
I want him to hate me.

185
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:21,173
Maybe he took time to cool off
over break, which means:

186
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,604
maybe, in a distant future,
we can actually be friends.

187
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,800
It's never a good idea
to be friend with the exs.

188
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,933
It always end as disaster.

189
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,233
Imagine if Travis and I
try to be friends.

190
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:37,066
He's still holding my iPod hostage,
'cause I dumped him for Calvin.

191
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,123
Have you talked to Calvin
since the whole...

192
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:42,590
I've left him um-teen millions texts.

193
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:46,290
And I stopped by the Omega Chi's house,
he's already turned in his pledge pin.

194
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,059
I miss him.

195
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,490
This is creepy.

196
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,790
At least, the house is a safe heaven.

197
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,857
This whole war zone field
is really bringing me down.

198
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,607
Are we in the wrong house?

199
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,606
Let me guess.
You girls are Ashleigh,

200
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,472
- and Casey.
- How did you know?

201
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:20,822
I memorized your faces in the composite.
I like to do a little memory,

202
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:22,787
so I never forget a face.
Lizzi.

203
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,122
That's is Lizzi with two ZBZ "Z".

204
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:28,456
- You could totally use that.
- And, who are you?

205
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:31,689
First, and most importantly,
I'm your fellow ZBZ sister.

206
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:36,029
And secondly, I'm here in my capacity
as ZB National Chapter Consultant.

207
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:38,912
To help you girls
with this little sticky situation...

208
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,182
I'll start figuring all out
in the chapter meeting tonight.

209
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,197
Tonight?

210
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,603
But that semester
hasn't even started yet.

211
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:49,997
But 2/3 of the house has already checked
back in, and you know what that mean.

212
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:54,992
Quorum!

213
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,575
Quorum?

214
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,492
The rules very clearly state
that with that many sisters present,

215
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:03,392
- we have to have a weekly meeting.
- Right.

216
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:06,831
Let me get this straight.

217
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:11,142
You're just gonna be staying here
for the chapter meeting.

218
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:18,026
Not just for the meeting. I'm gonna be
here until ZBZ National determines

219
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,609
that you're back on the straight narrow.

220
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,593
I could be anchored a nice long while.

221
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:27,101
I think that deserves a ZBZ hug, don't you?

222
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,759
Hug me! Hug me!

223
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,936
That's really nice, girls!

224
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:41,402
Hi everyone.
Welcome back!

225
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,917
There is a lot to discuss.

226
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,517
But first, let me introduce Lizzi.

227
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,383
Our chapter consultant.

228
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,800
ZBZ alumn for North Central Polytech.

229
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,585
So, to start the meeting...

230
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:59,215
I'm sorry. You skipped right
over the opening chapter call-response.

231
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:02,835
We don't really do that.
It's just formal, it takes so long.

232
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:05,807
Now, we have
so many important matters to discuss.

233
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:08,784
That ritual is such an ethical part
of being a ZBZ.

234
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:10,968
I'm sorry, sorry.

235
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,168
I'm just taking notes for my deal report
to take it at National.

236
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,840
It's no big hoop.

237
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:19,984
But it is what determines what
is required for the disciplinary action.

238
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:22,268
Don't worry!

239
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:24,751
Pretend I'm not even here.

240
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:30,208
- Everyone...
- Fellow sisters.

241
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:32,874
Please repeat after me.

242
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,591
"Living together in love and respect.

243
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
"We pledge to uphold the standards

244
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,345
"and ideals at the ZBZ creed and cabinet.

245
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:46,222
"If we so speak up of these
outside the vault,

246
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:49,970
"may our lips crimble,
and desintegrate."

247
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:06,466
It's been a long break.

248
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:09,341
I'll have to teach the girls
the memory check.

249
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,366
First order of business,

250
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:16,233
the all Greek back to school Carnival.

251
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,689
Applause is disruptive,
and it's disrespectful.

252
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:26,054
So, as ZBZs, if we wanna show
our entusiasmn, we snap.

253
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:31,699
Thank you!
It's so great to have you here!

254
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:44,226
I'm sorry.
My manucurer has advised not to snap.

255
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:45,865
Is your manucurer a ZBZ?

256
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:49,827
I don't think you need to listen to her.

257
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,875
For the Carnival, we're gonna do

258
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,190
our patterned ZBZ kissing booth.

259
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:03,007
- I don't think that's not gonna work.
- You don't?

260
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,761
Do you have another suggestion?

261
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:09,973
We should forgo with the carnival
and focus on the present matter.

262
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:12,664
Your former president left your finances
in a mess.

263
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:15,019
You're very,
very behind your finances.

264
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:18,697
Exactly! This is why the Carnival
is such a good idea.

265
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:20,478
It's for charity.

266
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,681
And it will definitely enhance moral,
which is

267
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:24,998
what my fellow sisters need right now.

268
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:27,881
We are the best house,

269
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,581
then we need to start acting
as the best house!

270
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:32,315
Are you with me?

271
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:38,547
Please, don't touch that.

272
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,914
Are we all on agreement
on the Carnival booth?

273
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:47,464
Yeti pelting it is.

274
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:51,180
Wait till you can see my costum.

275
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:54,267
As long as it doesn't involve
looter and slash tires

276
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,826
which is now forbidden
by the administration.

277
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,273
What the deal with all these new rules?

278
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:03,460
Heard that Tri Pi were having
a councellor Kama-Sutra mixer.

279
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,460
We, who are the KT letters,
are not afraid of some new regulations.

280
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,443
we welcome the challenge.

281
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:16,860
And we don't need some mixer to practice
our ancient tantric sex maneuvers.

282
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:22,544
It's just too bad. Spitter was so wept,
he let us all get pleged.

283
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:25,555
Let's let Spitter have...

284
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:27,646
Where is he?

285
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:33,038
He's a little guy...
Everyone check under your chairs.

286
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:51,115
I take it your got all my messages.

287
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:53,598
All 110 of them.

288
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,874
Do you wanna talk to me?

289
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:01,557
I resign from the house.

290
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,974
I was more hoping
we'd talk about your break.

291
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:06,464
The guy that I was with.

292
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,676
He wants to know who he is,
either he likes it or not.

293
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:15,378
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry to sound to lame.

294
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:18,403
And I also lost my best friend.

295
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:23,065
I cannot believe...

296
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,303
You!

297
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:27,282
Really?

298
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,196
You forgive me?

299
00:18:42,564 --> 00:18:43,814
Let me get these.

300
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:46,981
I know it wasn't intentionnal.

301
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:51,228
I just needed a little time
to get over the shock.

302
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,537
What is this stuff?

303
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,389
Casey's spasing
about the back to school Carnival.

304
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,370
The all Greek fundraiser that we're...

305
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,382
- You won't be there.
- Guess not.

306
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,549
She insisted that I go tonight
to get our ballons.

307
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:13,399
- But it's all good.
- Cause the guy who works there is hot.

308
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:16,401
It's gonna be so fun!
I love you being gay!

309
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:23,518
Just so we're clear. You don't have
to out me every time we hang out.

310
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,573
<i>Hey, Rusty, it's Jen-K.</i>

311
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,556
- What is that?
- Nothing.

312
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,009
Turn it over.

313
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:42,750
<i>Hey, Rusty, it's Jen K.
My battery...</i>

314
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,667
That's why you missed the meeting.

315
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:48,000
Cause you're wallowing
over some old saved message?!

316
00:19:48,683 --> 00:19:51,966
- No, I have a paperdue.
- For a class you haven't started yet!

317
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,948
I'm in honour's engineering program.
That's what we do. Anticipate.

318
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,853
Spitter, you've never
even been late to a meeting.

319
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:01,104
You usually come up early
and set up snacks.

320
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:03,682
Beaver could've really used
some cheesoritos today.

321
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,374
Tell Beaver I'm sorry.

322
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:06,912
It's bros

323
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:09,504
and cheesoritos before hos.

324
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:11,723
You don't let down your bros
for some girl.

325
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,883
This has nothing to do with Jen-K.

326
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:19,833
A cyber shrine! Really!

327
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,939
It's more serious than I thought.

328
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,227
Cappie, she was my first girlfriend.

329
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,703
Well...

330
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,094
The first cut is the deepest.

331
00:20:33,478 --> 00:20:34,780
I just feel like...

332
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,490
I left so many things unsaid with Jen.

333
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,478
Maybe if I just talked to her,

334
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,348
I could get some closure.

335
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,245
We could even be friends.

336
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:46,123
Don't pretend like you wanna see her
coz you wanna be friends.

337
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:48,626
You wanna see her 'cause
you wanna get back together.

338
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:51,671
- Don't fool yourself.
- I can't get her out of my head.

339
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:02,974
Delete the screen-saver.

340
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,433
Both of them!

341
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:11,744
Now the phone.

342
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:24,494
Anything else?

343
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:27,146
- No.
- Good! Alright

344
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,750
Now you can focus on
other better things like

345
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,294
your Kappa Tau brothers.

346
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:34,188
Actually I have a very special
pledge assignment for you,

347
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:36,538
should you choose to accept it
which you must.

348
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:39,677
You need to get a snow machine
for the yeti booth.

349
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,429
The yeti booth?

350
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:44,328
If you were at the meeting,
you'd know what I'm talking about.

351
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:46,058
Snow before hos.

352
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,519
Precisely. Good for you.

353
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:52,356
Snow machine.

354
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:02,909
Remember, girls, that moisturized lip
is essential for a great kiss,

355
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,828
and I don't have to remind you
to use mouth wash tomorrow.

356
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,665
It is a national goal of ours
to uphold the standards of vertuous

357
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:13,127
womenhood, especially in times like this
when 8-year old girls

358
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,339
are encouraged to dress like prostitutes

359
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:17,256
or heiresses.

360
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:19,631
So that means modest clothing,

361
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:22,678
no cleavage bearing,
no ostentatious jewelry

362
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,452
and certainly no...

363
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:27,169
Adulterous red lipstick.

364
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,561
Now I think Casey would agree, right?

365
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:32,980
How can I not agree?

366
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:35,983
That looks so much better.

367
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:43,991
- Maybe I'll try out.
- Can you sing?

368
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:47,937
No but I gotta pick something
if I want my dad to pay for tuition

369
00:22:48,057 --> 00:22:49,671
That was our deal with Omega Chi.

370
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,874
You want to stay with guys
who don't want you?

371
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:55,118
Any other house on campus
wouldn't have reacted like that.

373
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:03,031
- Dale?
- Hey Rusty, Calvin!

374
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:04,762
- U-Sag for?
- What?

375
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:07,020
University students against Greeks.

376
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,100
Seems the time
to start it my way a little bit,

377
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:11,118
after joining a frat
led to nothing

378
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:13,729
but degradation and heartbreak
for my good buddy, I thought,

379
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:16,482
now is the time
to put aside my position.

380
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,858
What?

381
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,759
I'm not in a fraternity anymore.

382
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:22,085
Congratulations, Cal,
welcome to enlightment!

383
00:23:22,205 --> 00:23:24,079
I'll be thrilled to have you join U-Sag.

384
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,221
An ex-Greek'd be a huge coup
for the movement.

385
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:28,427
Now tell me in detail exactly
why you left.

386
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:30,997
- I wanna write this down.
- In detail?

387
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:33,152
They found out I was gay.

388
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:40,681
Gay, homosexual.

389
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:44,051
- I can work with that.
- You can?

390
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:47,370
A intensive prayer environment regimate
can cure that

391
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:51,239
You're a double thread. If I bring in
an ex-gay, ex-Greek to purity pledge

392
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,019
I'm a shoe winning the chaste cup

393
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,813
We'll see those other PP-sockers
trying to top that.

394
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:58,274
- See you, Dale.
- Adios, muchacho.

395
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:43,278
So I just bought some glitter.

396
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:46,697
You can never have enough glitter.

397
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:49,225
Especially for a Carnival.

398
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,148
What booth you guys doing?

399
00:24:54,822 --> 00:24:56,409
I don't know.

400
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:58,542
Pledges are handling it.

401
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,126
What's that?

402
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:07,007
We're just...

403
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:08,512
trying stuff out.

404
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,804
For the kissing booth.

405
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:11,434
Alright, yeah.

406
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:17,061
I always liked that color on you.

407
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,068
I hope you'll

408
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,676
come by our booth.

409
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,763
Because...

410
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:30,850
it's really important
to support charity.

411
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:32,849
- It is, it is.
- I mean...

412
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:40,256
I should...

413
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:42,419
- Yeah.
- Good seeing you.

414
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:44,756
It's really good to see you.

415
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,734
- Bye.
- Bye.

416
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:06,819
Do you mind?

417
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:09,062
I'm studying.

418
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:17,371
I got your text, Madam.

419
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:19,832
I was surprised
that I have an overdue fine.

420
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:22,376
Thought it was all paid up.

421
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,365
I know we said...

422
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:29,074
Vacation isn't officially over
until classes start next week so.

423
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:43,981
No talking in the library.

424
00:26:54,055 --> 00:26:55,529
What time is your Carnival at?

425
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:58,495
Not until 5 but I have to pick up
a snow machine first.

426
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:01,132
Oh, I found this thing earlier and I...

427
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,915
just have no clue what it is.

428
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,254
That Jen's hair thingy.

429
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:10,328
Anyway, have you heard
about this ZBZ kissing booth?

430
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:12,730
I bet she doesn't even know
she left this here.

431
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,327
I think she's having trouble

432
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,045
keeping her hair out of her face,
it always drove her crazy.

433
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:18,463
I was just wondering.

434
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,644
if it would be a good place
to pass out some U-Sag flyers.

435
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:23,444
What if right now she's

436
00:27:23,564 --> 00:27:25,398
pushing her hair back and missing

437
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:28,567
this hair thingy?

438
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:30,514
I can't take it anymore.

439
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:33,322
I have to get rid of this hair thingy
so I can get rid of her.

440
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:36,927
Now I have some new business to discuss.

441
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:41,693
I spoke into him
and I think we can get him to come back.

442
00:27:46,952 --> 00:27:49,786
Calvin is an all-star athlete
and a legacy.

443
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:52,625
Are you really saying
you don't want him to come back?

444
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:55,094
I'm on board with getting him back.
Calvin's a cool guy.

445
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:57,005
No doubt he's a cool guy.

446
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,588
I'm not homophobic. There is some issues
we haven't thought through.

447
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:03,568
- Like?
- Like he lied to us all the time.

448
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,273
To be honest, I'll say what everybody
thinks. It'll be weird to live with him.

449
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:10,484
If he gets drunk and hits on one of us?
If he brings a guy to a formal?

450
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:12,680
A gay frat-guy is just weird.

451
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:19,025
Hey.

452
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,997
I've something real serious
to talk you guys about.

453
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,506
I'm gay.

454
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:42,975
We thought you found out that Beaver
hit on your sister at parents' week end.

455
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,351
What?

456
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:48,262
Dude, she does not look 15.

457
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:50,610
Don't worry man!

458
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,735
Beaver couldn't tell time until he was 12.

459
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:56,238
Come on, let's play a game!

460
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:12,087
I thought you were my Chinese food.

461
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:17,008
No, I missed G here.

462
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:21,597
But I am delivering something.

463
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,652
Rusty....

464
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:26,543
Jen, is the food here?

465
00:29:26,663 --> 00:29:28,187
Who's that?

466
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,662
You have a guy in there?

467
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:33,923
Rusty, you broke up with me.

468
00:29:34,393 --> 00:29:36,946
A few weeks ago.
So you...

469
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,198
You moved on already?

470
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:41,932
I thought we were over.

471
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:44,527
Yeah.

472
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:47,790
- We are.
- So,

473
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:50,876
can I have that back?

474
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:56,882
You know what? No.

475
00:29:58,123 --> 00:30:00,601
Your stupid hair can hang
in your stupid face.

476
00:30:01,045 --> 00:30:03,305
For all I care.

477
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,361
Kissing booth!

478
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:02,446
I promise everyone will get a chance

479
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:05,370
to pelt the ferocious Kappa Tau yeti
with snowballs

480
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,533
as soon as the snowmachine gets here,

481
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:11,054
which could happen any moment now.

482
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:19,013
Where the hell is Spitter?

483
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:24,887
You know they're slipping tongues.

484
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:28,974
I'm sure we'd be doing a lot better
if Lizzi hadn't me dressed like this

485
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:30,893
I look Amish.

486
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:33,129
I don't think it would matter
if we were naked.

487
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,063
We're intentionally being shunt.

488
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:37,006
Like no one even wants to kiss us.

489
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:39,318
I don't know
who's gonna mix with us, ever.

490
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,249
Evan isn't even here.

491
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:47,618
So maybe a tiny little part of me
wants to talk to him.

492
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:51,205
A very small,
all thin twin-sized part.

493
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,468
We'll have to let them
start doing something else at Beaver.

494
00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:07,001
You think rocks would hurt?

495
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:08,979
- He is padded.
- I heard that.

496
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:16,396
- Where's the snow machine?
- Sorry, the hardware store closed

497
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:19,608
before I got there.
But I brought the cheesoritos this time.

498
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,325
Remember, Beaver wanted some.

499
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,455
We can't pelt the yeti with cheesoritos.

500
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:27,574
Why were you late to the hardware store?

501
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:31,954
Come on Spitter, you're killing me, man!

502
00:32:32,347 --> 00:32:34,289
You went to go see her, didn't you?

503
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,001
We can't hold them much longer.
Beav's getting horsed

504
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:41,099
- from all the growling.
- We have nothing to pelt with.

505
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:44,284
Guys, I'm really sorry.

506
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,291
I got an idea.

507
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,739
Who's brave enough...

508
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:55,686
to challenge the fierce

509
00:32:55,928 --> 00:32:57,271
and mighty yeti?

510
00:32:57,513 --> 00:32:58,897
Cast your strength against

511
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:00,524
the feared beast

512
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:03,318
- for 5 $ charitable donation.
- Who's up?

513
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:36,260
I can't believe those losers
are joining the biggest crowd.

514
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:41,021
This would never have happened
if Frannie were here.

515
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:43,393
Speaking of Frannie,
did you hear she gain like

516
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,110
30 lbs during the break?

517
00:33:45,352 --> 00:33:47,154
She's in some fat farm in Wisconsin.

518
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:49,494
Hello Casey!

519
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:53,172
- What are you doing here?
- You know,

520
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,120
just doing some recon,
seeing what U-Sag

521
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,831
is up against.
So I'm here on business.

522
00:33:58,237 --> 00:33:59,237
But,

523
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:01,918
there's always room
for a little pleasure, you know,

524
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
and charity.

525
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,347
Must say charity.

526
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,467
So...

527
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:11,657
Here we go!

528
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:18,446
Oh, goodness!

529
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:20,062
Right in the eye.

530
00:34:20,304 --> 00:34:22,359
You know where med station
would be coz I think

531
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,207
I probably gonna need an eyeflush.

532
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:26,163
- Keep it.
- No, it's...

533
00:34:26,283 --> 00:34:27,569
Take care of you.

534
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:44,628
That's what you get when you mess with

535
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:47,172
the undisputable master
of the Himalayas.

536
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:48,423
Next yeti!

537
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:51,093
Your girlfriend's having some trouble
over there.

538
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:52,925
What you talking about?

539
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:55,097
Casey, bro, it's not pretty.

540
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:58,352
ZBZs are getting served by Tri Pi.

541
00:35:04,116 --> 00:35:05,355
What are you doing?

542
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:07,109
I think we should call it a night,

543
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:09,612
admit we lost the battle one,

544
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:11,738
concentrate on the war.

545
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,741
There's no point at staying out here
as public target to humiliation

546
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:18,079
Forget number 1, we're big fat zeros.

547
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:20,330
Line up, girls.

548
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:22,214
We got customers.

549
00:35:24,553 --> 00:35:27,853
It's not the Omega Chi,
but the Kappa Taus are doing the pinch.

550
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:51,862
Yeti see, and he like.

551
00:35:59,587 --> 00:36:01,978
No, it's just weird if we don't, right?

552
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:03,391
That's for charity.

553
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,331
Totally.

554
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:08,679
No tongue.

555
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:41,832
I hate to interrupt.

556
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,071
Evan, it's just a kissing booth.

557
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:47,076
Don't worry, I know, you can kiss
whoever you want, we're over.

558
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:53,381
I wanna get my lavalier back

559
00:36:54,093 --> 00:36:56,636
- Can we talk about this somewhere?
- One more thing.

560
00:36:57,397 --> 00:37:00,679
The Omega Chi are officially
stripping you the title of Sweetheart.

561
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,125
Given the recent events,

562
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:05,918
the brotherhood

563
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:08,779
is not comfortable maintening
such a close relationship

564
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:10,607
between us and ZBZ.

565
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:14,017
You understand.

566
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:16,487
Keeping up appearance is right.

567
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,494
I'll send a pledge
to pick up my letters.

568
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:27,206
Where you going, Evan?

570
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,356
For such a small girl,
you walk remarcably fast.

571
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:55,747
- I'm sorry about the kiss thing.
- No need to apologize.

572
00:37:56,453 --> 00:37:59,497
We're just a fling, right?
And classes start Monday so...

573
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:02,868
Then, from a strictly
informational standpoint,

574
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,911
Casey and I are over.

575
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:08,463
Just so you're informed.

576
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,421
Do you like to keep informed?

577
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:28,444
Beer n°3, right?

578
00:38:29,427 --> 00:38:32,349
You're got broken up
about me dropping of Omega Chi?

579
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:34,608
Actually, I'm just sitting here,

580
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:39,487
trying to figure out
if I'm a fool or a jerk.

581
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:42,039
You want my who?

582
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:46,953
I just did something
that was not so nice to Casey.

583
00:38:47,195 --> 00:38:49,468
Maybe she deserved it, I don't...

584
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:52,182
I still feel like a real jackass.

585
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,541
You know, one bad moment
doesn't make you a bad person.

586
00:38:58,453 --> 00:39:01,366
You can't judge someone
based on one single mistake.

587
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:05,514
I started to realize
that's what I did to the Omega Chis.

588
00:39:06,854 --> 00:39:08,099
Or maybe not.

589
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:11,061
- What do you mean?
- Well...

590
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:14,931
A few of the guys,
they brought up some issues.

591
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:20,153
And it might take a little more time
than I thought.

592
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:22,447
I'm sorry, man.

593
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:26,238
Trust me though,
I'll take care of it.

594
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:32,613
I went through and now we're just...

595
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:35,550
- 2 friends hanging up!
- Yeah, fair enough!

596
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,119
Cheers.

597
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,362
I didn't hear you knock!

598
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:47,916
Why would I? ZBZ sisters
don't have secret from each other.

599
00:39:49,861 --> 00:39:51,796
So, I know,

600
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:54,513
what happened at Carnival was hard.

601
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:57,708
But I think it taught all of us
a very valuable lesson.

602
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:00,276
It proved that I was right.

603
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:04,277
We can continue on as if nothing
is changed since last semester.

604
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:05,740
Things have changed.

605
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:08,373
You have to accept that.

606
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:09,918
This is a new normal.

607
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:14,009
Petty cash receipt and bank statement.

608
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:17,501
As I was trying to point out,
your finances are a mess.

609
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:20,338
- A mess it's now my job to clean up.
- Exactly.

610
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,262
See, we're on the same wave length.

611
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:26,294
And I know

612
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:28,596
that I've been hard on you.

613
00:40:29,022 --> 00:40:31,783
But it's just tough Zeta love.

614
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:35,750
I would hate for taking
to unappoint you as president.

615
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,607
And I'm looking out for you.

616
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:43,028
I'm so glad that we're sisters.

617
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:45,604
Come here.

618
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,157
Me too.

619
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,082
There's one more thing. There's a boy
waiting downstairs for you.

620
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,023
You!

621
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:23,264
I heard about what happened with Evan.

622
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:25,570
It sucked.

623
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,115
Wait. Why weren't you there
to witness my public humiliation?

624
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,091
I was dealing
with my own public humiliation.

625
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:34,537
I saw Jen.

626
00:41:36,178 --> 00:41:37,200
It was bad.

627
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:42,509
Feel like thinking about her
is screwing anything else up.

628
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:45,048
Talking to me about Jen-K is like

629
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:47,711
talking about Satan in front of Dale.

630
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,439
It's not appropriate.

631
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,939
Evan has plenty
of Satan-like qualities too.

632
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,765
That may be true but,

633
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:57,811
I'm still not over him.

634
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:00,431
There, I said it.

635
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,586
I miss, I miss my Satan.

636
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:09,197
I miss my Satan too.

637
00:42:09,682 --> 00:42:11,443
She's already dating...

638
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,953
whatever Satan dates, I guess.

639
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:19,149
Well, at least you've got your new

640
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:22,910
exciting job as ZBZ president
to concentrate on.

641
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,968
And hey, you've always got your

642
00:42:29,337 --> 00:42:31,511
Kappa Tau brothers
to make you feel better.

644
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:37,446
I've got a little bit of business to

645
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:38,948
take care of.

647
00:42:42,404 --> 00:42:46,143
Not to mention visiting hours
ended 2 minutes ago.

648
00:42:46,882 --> 00:42:48,382
Get out while you still can.

649
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:50,328
Madam president Cartwright.

650
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,045
Good night.
