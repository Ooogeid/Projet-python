1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,467
<i>Previously on Greek...</i>

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,254
- what are the guns for?
- It's for gotcha, the assassin game.

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,215
The object of the game
is to eliminate your assigned target.

4
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:11,761
- We kissed. That was it.
- Yeah, at a KT party.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,222
We're just gonna have to be better
and try to keep it quiet

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,429
if this continues.

7
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:18,392
I didn't kiss Evan at the {\end of the world }party.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,839
- I kissed Fisher.
- What?

9
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:22,063
- I'm such an idiot.
- How can I trust you again?

10
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:22,980
I can't.

11
00:00:30,968 --> 00:00:32,668
Wait, I have a question.

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,816
Yes, I've been tested.

13
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:37,870
- Everything's positive.
- What?

14
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:39,707
I mean negative.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,166
I mean in a positive way.

16
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:48,923
- Dale's not gonna walk in on us, right?
- No.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,509
I mean I guess he could.

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,474
- He probably won't.
- Well, are you sure?

19
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:57,223
Because the whole my dad walking in
on us thing kind of freaked me out.

20
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:59,161
OK. We can go to my room.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,566
- I gotta go to my lab session.
- Are you serious?

22
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:09,110
But if we make it quick...

23
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,861
Yeah, rushing things,

24
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,793
- not so romantic.
- We don't...

25
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:15,018
We could skip ahead a few steps.

26
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:19,269
That's rushing things.

27
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:22,249
You know, we've waited this long,

28
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:24,458
so why hurry now, right?

29
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:26,457
Right.

30
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,630
I have somewhere to be, anyway.

31
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,634
But believe me, it's gonna happen.

32
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:46,177
Oh, reminder, reminder: there

33
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:48,816
are only four more gym days
until Friday's undie run.

34
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,927
It's the titans' game against state,
and what better way to show our support

35
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:54,340
than running around campus in...

36
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,699
very little support.

37
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,106
I did two sessions
of bikram yoga today.

38
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:02,947
I sweated out a small child

39
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:04,915
and I think I pulled my core.

40
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,921
What are those?

41
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:14,175
- Just some cookies.
- That we won't be eating.

42
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,745
I don't know
why he brought those out.

43
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,389
But that does remind me
of some old business:

44
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,476
Fisher and I broke up because
he made out with someone at the{\ end of the world} party

45
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,436
whose name isn't worth saying.

46
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:29,315
You.

47
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:31,903
Activities report.

48
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,282
The gotcha game is down
to roughly 20 people,

49
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,910
including three zeta betas.
The prize money's nice,

50
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,494
but what we really want are points
towards the greek blue ribbon,

51
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:46,624
which is handed out every spring
to the best house on campus.

52
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,125
So I'm trying really hard
to make that happen

53
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,882
because, as you know, I love
zeta beta zeta

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,510
- and all my beautiful sisters.
- Thank you...

55
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,469
you.

56
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,375
Pledge educator.

57
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,890
Not much this week.

58
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:05,538
The pledges are still pledge-y.

59
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,858
Pan-hellenic delegate? Any juicy goss
from our governing sorority body?

60
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,958
First, the board gave a report.

61
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,646
Then they proposed doing an ice cream
social with a different flavor

62
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,835
for each house,
which I said was a lame idea.

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,024
But they said it'd be fun, so I told
those bitches it was a waste of money.

64
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,586
But those bitches wouldn't listen,
so that's when I said,

65
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:27,414
"bite me," and walked out.

66
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:28,874
Bitches.

67
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:33,309
Well, this feels
like a good place to stop.

68
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:34,713
Happy undie run training.

69
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:43,280
I think need to replace Laura.
She's burnt out on pan-hellenic.

70
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:44,890
Yeah, I know the feeling.

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,226
Your report was a little sparse.

72
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,140
I'm so bored with the pledges.

73
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,592
I'm a senior. I should
be doing something more.

74
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:54,407
Last week, my father said
the world better watch out for me.

75
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:57,171
And I'm thinking, why?
Because of my ability to name

76
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:59,613
every guy Carrie Bradshaw
has slept with in season order?

77
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:01,784
- I've always admired that.
- You know,

78
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,618
I could do pan-hellenic.
What do you think?

79
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,161
I think yeah!

80
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,438
Do you think Laura would be OK?

81
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:11,600
Laura, is it OK
if Casey does pan-hellenic?

82
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:13,853
Tell those bitches
I'll see them in hell.

83
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,796
Sounds like a yes to me.

84
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,215
Jordan's dad walked in on us,
which was horrible.

85
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,169
Horribly funny.
Sorry.

86
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:33,814
Then we kept getting interrupted,
and now...

87
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,603
it feels like we're past that point
of sex occurring naturally.

88
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:40,232
We're slipping
back into the friend zone.

89
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:41,666
You want me to talk to her?

90
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,741
She's in Pierson hall, right?

91
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,161
What about you and Grant?
You guys haven't done it yet either.

92
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,360
Boxing rules are still in effect:

93
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:51,135
nothing below the belt.

94
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,417
All we want is a romantic date.

95
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:55,461
Don't you share a room?

96
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,389
We're living in a fraternity house.

97
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,719
We might as well not have any doors.

98
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,552
Anyway, the new plan is to wait

99
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:06,240
till everyone goes
o the date dash at Dobler's tonight,

100
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,560
and then break out
the popcorn and a movie.

101
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,924
{\I see }You're still playing the gotcha game.
You're not the jackass

102
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,271
everyone's talking about?

103
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,180
It's the jackal, OK?

104
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,669
And yes, I'm still playing.
And no, I'm not him,

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,556
I wouldn't mind taking him out.
I heard he already has nine kills.

106
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:24,570
I've been so busy with classes,
I haven't even opened my envelope yet.

107
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,261
What? How the hell
has nobody killed you yet?

108
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:31,087
Rusty, you gotta get in the game!
Open your envelope right now.

109
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,812
I don't even have a gun.

110
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,942
What do they look like?

111
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,302
Check this out.

112
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,186
What{\ the hell} was that?

113
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:59,233
You've had me the whole time?

114
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:02,152
Your envelope... please.

115
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:15,499
No wonder you were asking about her.

116
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,711
- Jordan's your target.
- Correction: your target.

117
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,715
Good luck doing it now.

118
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,854
- Are you covering for Laura?
- I am.

119
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,918
And I'm sorry

120
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:40,939
she told you to, "bite me."

121
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:42,818
So she cleaned it up
for you guys then.

122
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,111
I'm really surprised to see you here.
You sort of fell off the grid.

123
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,417
What have you been up to?

124
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,798
I'm sure you heard
about me and Evan.

125
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:55,364
And then I was dating this grad student,
Max, but we broke up.

126
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,961
So it's been kind of more or less...

127
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:01,326
- You may...
- Riveting.

128
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:02,629
Really.

129
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:10,554
Got it, yeah.

130
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:17,011
I, as president,
note that everyone is here.

131
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,520
Please mark that in the book.

132
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,153
Moving on, I'd like
to introduce Casey Cartwright,

133
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:24,359
former zbz president,
who just had an amazing internship

134
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,654
with maryland's 43rd district
congresswoman, Paula Baker.

135
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,825
I hope this won't
be a one-day visit with us.

136
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,035
Moving on.

137
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,091
- It's your birthday!
- Yes{\, it is}.

138
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:38,499
- Happy birthday.
- Where was the reminder e-mail?

139
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,514
Maybe next year. Moving on.

140
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,377
Update on the library expansion?

141
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,630
Well, the early construction

142
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,673
could be a nuisance to the row,

143
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:50,483
but I think we can obtain
and enforce 8am permits.

144
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,208
So, I'll get back to you, Kat.

145
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:58,032
Moving on. I wanna remind everyone
about our meeting

146
00:07:58,157 --> 00:08:00,660
with the ifc tomorrow
to decide whether or not

147
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:03,357
we are gonna participate
in the undie run.

148
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:04,650
Comments?

149
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,725
I just have to say
that I love the undie run.

150
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,490
Everyone loves the undie run.
And for some of us

151
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,476
who are seniors,
it's our last chance to do it.

152
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:15,949
So... Yay.

153
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,290
OK. I appreciate
your enthusiasm, ZBZ.

154
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,210
We'll take that
into careful consideration.

155
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,336
Moving on...

156
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:27,729
92,

157
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:28,507
93,

158
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,731
94,

159
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:30,688
95...

160
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,803
- What are you guys counting?
- Seconds, Rus.

161
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,138
95...

162
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,984
- For what?
- ... ninety-six.

163
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:53,514
Five for five.

164
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,868
I wish I had
a few good men like you, Beav.

165
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,396
- Thanks.
- Too bad you're the last KT standing.

166
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,163
Actually, beaver is not

167
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:03,083
- the only kappa tau left.
- Old news, Rus.

168
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,542
Jeremy got taken out today
at 0800 hours

169
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,617
while he was chatting up
a hot Tri-Pi.

170
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,799
- Turns out it was a honey-trap.
- -We all know what a talker Jeremy is.

171
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,018
I meant me.

172
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:13,792
I'm still alive.

173
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,289
That's funny.

174
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,812
You're being...

175
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:25,614
Funny.

176
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:29,109
Seriously?
How are you still alive?

177
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:30,343
I don't know.

178
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,197
I've been in the mitchell physics
library, the McGovern science lab

179
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,709
and hart engineering building.

180
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,783
I've never heard
of any of those places.

181
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,660
Exactly.
Do you know what this means?

182
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:40,495
That I'm kinda awesome?

183
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:43,235
No, that being a geek
saved your life.

184
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,169
You're one of our last hopes
of winning the $500 grand prize.

185
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,255
The KT party budget
is woefully overdrawn. We need this.

186
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:53,967
Welcome to Kappa force.

187
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,695
- There's one problem.
- You're slow afoot and you can't shoot?

188
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,829
No, Jordan's my target.

189
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,772
Awkward, but easy.
Just get it done.

190
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,021
I'm on it.

191
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:12,344
He's so young, Cap.

192
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:15,972
- And The Jackal's still out there.
- Indeed, Beav.

193
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,333
The beginning of the end...

194
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:21,277
... is starting.

195
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,452
Now.

196
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,439
Again.

197
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,580
This summer.

198
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:32,952
I'm gonna go again.

199
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,696
So much fun, you guys.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

200
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:43,522
Well, anything beats
the "bite me" girl.

201
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:50,987
Hold that, please.

202
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:20,640
When's your next lab session?

203
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:24,903
In five minutes.

204
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,264
You know, this is the best part
about us waiting.

205
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,385
I feel really safe with you.

206
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:48,152
I don't know. Between my crazy dad
and your crazy schedule,

207
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:51,639
I hope you don't think
I don't want to.

208
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:54,713
You do want to?

209
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:58,179
I didn't want to rush you
but I didn't want to end up

210
00:11:58,262 --> 00:11:59,624
in the friend zone either.

211
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:01,270
You seriously thought that?

212
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,677
We were friends before,

213
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,018
and we have been dating
since mid-terms.

214
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:10,954
I figured if it was something that
you wanted, it would have already...

215
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:13,355
OK. Rusty? Just so you know,

216
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:16,654
I rarely try to swallow
my friends' tongues.

217
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:21,397
Good to know.

218
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:23,981
And trust me,

219
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:25,679
I want to do more.

220
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,540
Tomorrow night?

221
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,428
Sounds perfect.

222
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,206
All clear.

223
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,086
- They're gone.
- All right.

224
00:12:58,169 --> 00:12:59,861
Gay film festival time.

225
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:02,684
Which Hugh Jackman movie
should we watch?

226
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,794
Wolverine, Australia

227
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,338
or Kate & Leopold?

228
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:07,411
K & L.

229
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,962
But you hate that one.

230
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,457
If you kiss me, I will consider it.

231
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,589
- I saw your light on.
- You're here!

232
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,206
- I'm here.
- We're here.

233
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,635
Why the hell aren't you at Dobler's?

234
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:26,729
I just had other plans.

235
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:27,955
And you?

236
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,643
You know,
we're just both taking it easy tonight.

237
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:35,188
I have to study.

238
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:37,232
You're watching a movie.

239
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,082
Yes.

240
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:39,651
After the movie.

241
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:43,960
You guys are watching
Kate & Leopold?

242
00:13:44,312 --> 00:13:45,407
I love this movie.

243
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:47,458
- Seriously?
- No.

244
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:49,153
No. Let's watch Wolverine.

245
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:50,811
Great.

246
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:52,497
It's got Hugh Jackman.

247
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:54,779
Yeah, he's pretty bad-ass.

248
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,134
Why are the girls so grumpy?

249
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,757
They're just hungry
because of the Undie Run.

250
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,475
Cabbage soup isn't very filling.

251
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,223
Or aromatic, Betsy.

252
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,149
Stay out of my life, Ashleigh!

253
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,227
So,

254
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,979
ask me about Pan-hellenic.

255
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,397
How was pan-hellenic?

256
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,315
Awesome. I haven't felt this involved
since I was president.

257
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,652
The only bummer
was running into Evan.

258
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:26,806
I totally get it.
It is impossible to be around your ex.

259
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:29,467
Why can't they just
get the hint and go away?

260
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:33,446
I honestly believed that I'd be

261
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,622
Casey Cartwright-Chambers one day,

262
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:38,710
and now I haven't even spoken to him
in over six months.

263
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:46,259
Someone doesn't care
what they look like at the Undie Run.

264
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,636
Because we can't go.

265
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,059
- Shut up!
- What?

266
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:51,139
Those bitches on Pan-hellenic
voted to dock

267
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,492
three blue ribbon points from any house
whose girls do the Undie Run.

268
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:57,312
- I'm still on their e-mail list.
- Those bitches!

269
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,645
Thank you. Finally,
someone who understands.

270
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:01,787
Katherine has been
turning people against it

271
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,318
ever since she became president.

272
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:06,279
I can't let us run
if we're gonna lose blue ribbon points.

273
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,241
No! I do not go to the gym
five days a week for my health!

274
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,077
Laura, stop eating!

275
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,364
There's a meeting tomorrow.
I can fix this.

276
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:22,879
I did everything right, Cap.

277
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:25,140
I exited the house
through the back gate,

278
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:27,923
I looked over my shoulder
every eight seconds,

279
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:31,721
I even left class
an hour early every day.

280
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,766
Aren't most classes
only an hour long?

281
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,393
What's your point, Heath?

282
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:37,852
Give us a minute.

283
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:42,863
What happened?

284
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:45,819
These happened, Rus.

285
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:48,283
Free drink tickets to Dobler's.
All fake.

286
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:52,830
They showed up for Beaver in the mail
and when he went to redeem them,

287
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:53,919
he was shot.

288
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,705
- By The Jackal.
- No. Who was it?

289
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,871
Tell him, Cap.

290
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:01,960
Tell him who shot me.
I would, but I'm dead.

291
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,065
I think rusty should see these
for himself.

292
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:11,344
- They're pretty realistic.
- Yeah.

293
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:15,697
Kinda like an art student did them,
don't you think?

294
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:18,301
Do you know any, Rus?

295
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:22,280
- No!
- Yes!

296
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,858
The Jackal is Jordan...

297
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,211
... is The Jackal.

298
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,430
- I'm still waiting on that beer.
- Rusty's gonna get it to you, Beav,

299
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,601
because if he'd shot Jordan
like he was supposed to,

300
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:36,703
none of this would have happened.
Why didn't you eliminate her last night?

301
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,129
- I didn't know she was The Jackal.
- Kicking ass at it does, Rus.

302
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,685
You're Kappa Tau's last hope.

303
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:44,883
- When do you see jordan next?
- Tonight.

304
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:47,672
- But I can't shoot her.
- And why not?

305
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,427
Because...

306
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,264
Rus, my spidey-sense is tingling.

307
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:55,555
You haven't had sex with her yet.

308
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:57,413
No, but...

309
00:16:57,838 --> 00:17:00,352
- We have this romantic dinner. As...
- It's a trap.

310
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,728
Numbers are dwindling.

311
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:04,439
You need to kill her
before she eventually gets you.

312
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,342
- I want to have sex with her.
- Kill her, then have sex with her.

313
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:08,610
It's the KT way.

314
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,043
I didn't mean that.

315
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,071
Well, kill her at least.

316
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,537
Which is why we,
the IFC fraternities,

317
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,846
unanimously support all greeks
participating in this event.

318
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:26,369
We'll be there with bells on.
And not much else. Thank you.

319
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,093
We, at Pan-hellenic, are deducting
blue ribbon points from sorities

320
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,220
whose sisters choose to participate.

321
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,471
We were unanimous

322
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,392
in voting against the undie run because
of the negative image it promotes.

323
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,367
- Point of order?
- ZBZ?

324
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,856
Actually, the truth is
we're not really unanimous.

325
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,798
ZBZ fully supports it.

326
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,736
Yes, a couple thousand college kids

327
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,713
running around in their underwear
is a little racy,

328
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:58,743
but it's a 60-year-old tradition
that fosters school spirit and unity.

329
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:04,457
Can I have your attention
directed over here, please?

330
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,547
No, this is not an abercrombie ad.

331
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,049
It's two of our own inebriated greeks
showing their...

332
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,769
What did you call it, ZBZ?
School spirit?

333
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,478
Here's some KTs
defiling university property.

334
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,018
Actually, can I get a copy of that
when you're done with it?

335
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,365
But they're just guys
being guys, right?

336
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:29,384
Here's one that sets us
sorority women back 50 years.

337
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,398
I pulled this from facebook.

338
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,072
This girl is the ZBZ president,
believe it or not.

339
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,032
That bra might
as well say "Grope me."

340
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:39,941
Attention back on me.

341
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:44,313
So while running around in our underwear
might have been in vogue in the'60s,

342
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,791
I think those of us
who are not in fraternities

343
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,002
can all agree
that we should not participate

344
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,571
in this embarrassing event.

345
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,966
You love the Undie Run.
Will you please say something?

346
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,977
You're a TP. You take off your clothes
for a grocery store grand opening.

347
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,087
Look, don't do this. Don't...

348
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,913
Don't ruin our fun
just to prove a point.

349
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,570
Moving on, ZBZ.

350
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:23,940
No, you don't understand. We were
making out when Evan walked in on us.

351
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:26,110
I mean it's a miracle
we didn't get caught.

352
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:29,501
Why don't you just rent a hotel room
and do it already?

353
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,495
Because it's not about
just having sex.

354
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,905
I mean. Not yet, anyway.

355
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,175
It's about dating someone
who's not out of the closet,

356
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:39,385
made even more difficult
because the closet is in our room.

357
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,068
So get out of your room.

358
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,564
Yeah. And go where?

359
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:46,351
Dobler's isn't private, and we can't be
seen leaving gentlemen's choice.

360
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,180
- Which?
- Gay one. I refuse to go to the other.

361
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:51,816
Which leaves no safe place
to hide grant's gayness.

362
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:54,567
In Cyprus.

363
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,756
I had no idea
you were such a gourmet.

364
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:04,913
KT has food network
viewing parties now.

365
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,122
I think Cappie has an oedipal thing
for Paula Deen.

366
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,418
I'm ready.

367
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,073
Get down!

368
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,929
I knew it! Jackal!

369
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,639
Cappie was here the whole time?

370
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,267
You didn't trust me!

371
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:29,228
You tried to shoot me.

372
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:32,605
- Rebecca? Why are you here?
- I thought

373
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,816
vampires couldn't enter
without permission.

374
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,484
- Good one.
- I'm protecting you.

375
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:39,349
- Did you do it?
- If you mean them having sex, no.

376
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,235
If you mean her shooting him, no.

377
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,784
If you mean Jordan peeing herself
when I jumped out, maybe.

378
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,327
And you look hot.

379
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:48,852
- Thanks.
- So you're The Jackal.

380
00:20:49,402 --> 00:20:50,934
Which makes me the jackass.

381
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:53,549
This was all a big lie
so you could eliminate me?

382
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:55,440
No. I meant what I said
about being ready.

383
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:58,745
Go spin your web of lies
somewhere else, black widow.

384
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:01,149
Or should I say, The Jackal!

385
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:02,725
Again!

386
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,977
And Katherine's like, "That's why
we shouldn't be doing this

387
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,461
exercise. Moving on."

388
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,982
You know what I should have said?
"Maybe if the girls in your house

389
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,290
exercised, it wouldn't be
so embarrassing."

390
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:21,279
- Right for the jugular.
- Yes.

391
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,222
If you had said it.

392
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:28,445
Docking blue ribbon points
because we're hot is totally sexist.

393
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:30,288
Keep looking.
We need to find a way

394
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,947
to override the Pan-hellenic
board's vote on the Undie Run.

395
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,141
The undie run is about freedom.

396
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:38,116
It's about america and stuff.

397
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,917
Which is perfect because I've the cutest
american flag underwear for the run.

398
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:43,943
Or had.

399
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:48,449
If Harry Potter can flash
his wand inequus,

400
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:50,900
We should be able to show off
our undies without punishment.

401
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:52,935
Not to mention, we're seniors.

402
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:55,897
When else are we gonna run around
in public in our underwear?

403
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,524
- They're bringing back lilith fair.
- Here we go.

404
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,740
We can override the board's decision
with a petition

405
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:03,154
that has 500 sorority signatures.

406
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,782
Yeah. How are we gonna get
500 signatures by tomorrow?

407
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:11,162
Katherine may have brains
and the support of Pan-hellenic

408
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,958
and a really, really nice laptop,

409
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:14,698
but I have a plan.

410
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:28,459
I need a favor.

411
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:29,597
Really?

412
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:32,847
We've been ignoring each other
for the past six months,

413
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,310
and now you tell me that?

414
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:37,104
- I think it's the least you can do.
- Interesting.

415
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:39,524
I should care what you think, why?

416
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:41,859
You cared enough to buy off my ex.

417
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:45,688
- Nice pull, Case. Door's that way.
- OK, that was uncalled for.

418
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:49,369
This isn't about us.
It's about the Undie Run.

419
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:53,734
Which sounds ridiculous that I'm even
saying it with that much importance, but

420
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:55,957
I know most sororities
want to do it.

421
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:00,687
A mob of half-naked sority girls?

422
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:03,506
Pretty sure we can get behind that.

423
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:06,384
Have you been hanging out
with Cappie or something?

424
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:07,616
No.

425
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:10,135
Come on.

426
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,673
So, what do you need me to do?

427
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,852
Put down your fork
and take off your clothes.

428
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,557
Save the Undie Run.

429
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,310
Save the Undie Run for the sorority.

430
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,109
Save the Undie Run. Thank you.

431
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:29,669
Save the Undie Run.

432
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,915
You're literally down to
your last pair of shorts.

433
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,373
Are you looking for more work?

434
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:40,758
Do you need another fake boyfriend?

435
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:44,380
Actually, you're the closest thing
to a friend I have left.

436
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:47,467
Pretty much the whole house
is mad at me for what I did to Ashleigh.

437
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:48,403
And...

438
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,795
Maybe they have a point.

439
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:54,856
- But I'm working on it.
- We all make mistakes.

440
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:57,977
Move along, Becks.
We need signatures.

441
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:00,671
- Later, rich kid.
- Yeah, see ya.

442
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:04,692
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

443
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,430
I'm just here for the cause.

444
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:21,646
- Status report.
- Chicken legs is safe and secure, Sir.

445
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:24,834
- But he looks a little melancholy. Sir!
- Thank you, pledge.

446
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:33,678
Melancholy?

447
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:36,139
How could I not know
my own girlfriend was the jackal?

448
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:37,624
We figured it out in time.

449
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:40,561
The important thing now is that
you two are the last ones standing.

450
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,438
You need to do her
before she does you.

451
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:44,732
With your weapon, I mean.

452
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:47,944
That shoots. Darts.

453
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,233
- I got it.
- OK.

454
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:52,071
You date someone,
you think you know them,

455
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:53,576
but it turns out you don't.

456
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:57,410
And conveniently, it's easier to shoot
a total stranger than someone you know.

457
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:00,343
Maybe.

458
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:03,084
Because some people are hunters

459
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:05,841
and some people are gathers.

460
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,752
Now, which people are you?

461
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:11,259
A hunter.

462
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,302
A mean hunter.
And what do you hunt?

463
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,930
- Jackals.
- That's right.

464
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,391
Spitters hunt jackals.

465
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:20,493
So, what do we need?

466
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:25,467
Guns.

467
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:27,358
Lots of guns.

468
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:35,443
Spitter, no KT has ever done
anything like this before.

469
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:36,384
I know.

470
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,628
That's why it's gonna work.

471
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,774
I couldn't have asked
for a better first date.

472
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:50,768
Well, the 60-mile drive wasn't ideal,
but the company is.

473
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,133
So how about dessert?

474
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,865
On the house.
I told 'em it was your birthday.

475
00:25:55,948 --> 00:25:59,080
<i>It's your birthday
it happens once a year</i>

476
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,730
It's your birthday
it's time for lots of cheer

477
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:06,254
it's your birthday
enjoy your special day

478
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:10,000
it's your birthday
so be happy and be gay

479
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,658
happy birthday.

480
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:21,745
And grant?

481
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,128
I'd blow out my candle,
but I can't breathe.

482
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:36,927
<i>Chicken legs one, you ready to rock?</i>

483
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:39,832
Like a baby in a treetop.

484
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:43,037
<i>You got a green light on the jackal.</i>

485
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:54,246
Taking my shot.

486
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,798
What was that?

487
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,273
<i>- Damn!
- Get her, Rus! Fire! Fire!</i>

488
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:02,430
Ambush! Get behind the bench!

489
00:27:09,748 --> 00:27:11,344
Wanna party?

490
00:27:20,817 --> 00:27:22,296
I'm out!

491
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,330
<i>Did you get her?</i>

492
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,855
He's out of darts.

493
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,416
Barf. Let's boogie.

494
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:44,558
Did you even open your eyes?

495
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:46,457
Is the bluetooth necessary?

496
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:54,259
- What's this?
- Six-hundred and 88 signatures

497
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:56,644
overriding your vote to bar
sororities from the undie run.

498
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:58,551
No matter what you think,
people want this.

499
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,954
You can check the signatures
for authenticity if you want.

500
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,498
No need.

501
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:05,099
It would probably take a long
time since there's so many.

502
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,412
I guess you got what you wanted.

503
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,428
It's not just what I wanted.

504
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:11,772
It's what everyone
who signed my petion wants.

505
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,123
Some college kids want to do
drugs, but that doesn't mean

506
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:16,835
we should sponsor it, should we?

507
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,683
You're comparing drugs to underwear?

508
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:21,474
Absolutely. They both give sorities
a bad name.

509
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,074
Watch. They're gonna broadcast
the run on some tv show,

510
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:26,193
we're all gonna look whorish.
But moving on...

511
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,289
You just can't accept that I won.

512
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,905
If winning means staking
your reputation on some

513
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,157
stupid and meaningless event
that reinforces

514
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,941
every negative stereotype
about the greek system,

515
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:41,802
then yes, I guess you won.

516
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:43,874
People will think what they think.

517
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,639
An undie run won't change that.

518
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,370
But it won't help.

519
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,624
The sad part is we were all
wondering what Casey Cartwright,

520
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:55,096
former zbz president and congressional
intern, was gonna do next.

521
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:56,936
And now we know.

522
00:28:57,473 --> 00:28:58,922
It's underpants.

523
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,216
So congratulations on your
return to politics, zbz.

524
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:05,160
You should be proud.

525
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,141
Tell me about your cheesecake?

526
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:36,354
I'd love to, Cal, but I got fired

527
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:39,660
for not singing you
happy birthday properly.

528
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,476
I gave up my trust fund.

529
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,174
My parents cut me off,
and now I'm flat broke.

530
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,197
And that's it.

531
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,707
That's my secret,

532
00:29:56,874 --> 00:29:59,634
- what about yours?
- OK. Look, don't worry.

533
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,362
We're not gonna fly a rainbow
flag off the house or anything.

534
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,176
Grant's not even out yet,

535
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:08,221
which is sort of
why we went a town over.

536
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:10,266
I didn't even know he was in.

537
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:15,164
How long have you guys
been... Doing it?

538
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,142
Believe it or not,

539
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:22,127
gay relationships are more than just...
You know?

540
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:23,729
Right.

541
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:25,948
There's real feelings and emotions,

542
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,653
so I'm trying to find those
before the other stuff.

543
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,147
I get that.

544
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:35,841
But why can't you guys
just date in your room?

545
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:38,478
Swat raid! Everybody down!

546
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:41,501
Look at your faces!

547
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:45,072
I see.

548
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:52,183
How's it feel to be a hero?

549
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,769
Not as heroic as I expected.

550
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,561
No, don't do the
wholedark knightthing,

551
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:59,196
where you've saved the world
but you're all angsty in the end.

552
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:02,679
It's fine. It's just
something Katherine said to me.

553
00:31:02,804 --> 00:31:06,017
Maybe the undie run
isn't the best message.

554
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,729
It's not supposed to be a message.
It's supposed to be fun.

555
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:11,784
- Why are you doubting this?
- With Katherine,

556
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:14,853
this feels
like Washington all over again.

557
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:16,456
I think she thinks i'm elle woods.

558
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,587
Who cares what Katherine thinks?

559
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:22,391
- It's a huge victory, right?
- Yes. For us

560
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:23,908
and the economy.

561
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:27,464
You single-handedly stimulated
the local undergarment industry.

562
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:29,879
- Obama can't say that.
- Exactly.

563
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:31,757
I don't need Katherine's approval.

564
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:33,798
It's your senior year.

565
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:37,152
If pan-hellenic's so annoying,
just screw it.

566
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:39,020
Drop out and I'll put Laura back.

567
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,204
You know what? You're right.
Pan-hellenic can bite me.

568
00:31:45,556 --> 00:31:47,374
I'm glad you're here.

569
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:49,156
We need to figure this out.

570
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:52,125
It was smart of Rebecca
to set us up like this.

571
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:55,284
Stop acting like I'm
some stranger on a blind date.

572
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:58,242
- You tried to shoot me, too.
- Which is why it is important

573
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:02,246
to settle this diplomatically...
Jackal.

574
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,894
I just want to be alone with you.

575
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,054
I was thinking the same thing.

576
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,601
Enough of the mushy crap.

577
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,885
Rusty, just give up.
You're never gonna kill Jordan.

578
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,486
You're like dick cheney,
and she's a quail.

579
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:20,269
OK, maybe Spitter can't shoot her
but he can outlive her.

580
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:23,253
We'll just move him into the kt
house until this is all over.

581
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:24,817
He could be there forever.

582
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,022
Or, you know, at least
until he graduates.

583
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,982
Wait a minute.

584
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,520
- I want to be with her.
- She went after you, Rus.

585
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:35,033
Don't be Rihanna.
Don't be that girl.

586
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,056
- I want to be with you, too.
- You want to sleep with Rusty?

587
00:32:38,181 --> 00:32:40,249
You should turn
that toy gun on yourself.

588
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,441
- I refuse to fight any longer.
- Yeah. Me, too.

589
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,146
You know what? I'm sorry

590
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:46,480
but I'm placing
you in protective custody. Let's go.

591
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:47,782
Wait!

592
00:32:49,316 --> 00:32:50,943
- Barf.
- Barf!

593
00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:57,822
Hold that, please.

594
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:01,934
Thanks.

595
00:33:09,414 --> 00:33:11,656
Nice work saving the undie run.

596
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,494
Some people didn't think so.

597
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,868
That's why
i'm quitting pan-hellenic.

598
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,158
Really?

599
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:19,955
I thought that suited you.

600
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,345
My big victory is a dash
across campus virtually naked.

601
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,629
I liked it.

602
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,822
But Katherine doesn't.

603
00:33:31,947 --> 00:33:33,414
And she's right.

604
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:37,206
But how do you
make something meaningful

605
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:39,945
out of a bunch of people
running around without clothes?

606
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:47,590
You coming?

607
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:57,920
I made your favorite, Rus.

608
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:00,633
Grilled cheese and spam.

609
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,238
Lock down! Lock down!

610
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:13,390
Chicken legs one has flown the coop!

611
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,346
I thought we could try this again.

612
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:07,437
No schedule, no dads, no bodyguards.

613
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,400
Just the two of us.

614
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,607
One question:

615
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:14,356
we're definitely not
playing the game, right?

616
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,741
No. Why, are you?

617
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:21,445
No. Are you?

618
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:24,989
Wanna frisk me?

619
00:35:25,114 --> 00:35:26,582
I just said I trust you.

620
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,503
Let me grab some forks.

621
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,887
- Two forks.
- Yeah.

622
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,937
They go great with food.

623
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,763
That reminds me.

624
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,450
A candle.

625
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,374
I thought a little ambient
lighting would be nice.

626
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:05,161
You seem nervous.

627
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:08,070
Not really. If you could just

628
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:10,655
stop with the sudden moves.

629
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,749
If you kept your hands where I can't
see them, I wouldn't have to.

630
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,009
I'm not doing anything.

631
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:20,269
Oh, my god, you're still playing.

632
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,970
Only because you are.

633
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,224
- You didn't deny it!
- Neither did you!

634
00:36:25,781 --> 00:36:27,419
I knew it!

635
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:33,040
Rug burn!

636
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:40,083
This is so stupid!
I just want to be with you.

637
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,282
Throw down your gun and come out.

638
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:45,858
Why should I throw down mine?
You throw down yours.

639
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:13,867
What's going on?

640
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:16,119
Evan had some stuff stolen
from his room.

641
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:18,360
So he's having new locks
put on all the doors.

642
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:22,321
Off of one break-in
that I've never heard of.

643
00:37:22,963 --> 00:37:24,782
He wants us to be safe.

644
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:29,630
So maybe later we could watch,

645
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,892
- Kate & Leopold?
- Yeah, we're still not watching that.

646
00:37:37,116 --> 00:37:39,039
A little something
for the run, ladies.

647
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:40,902
To keep you energized.

648
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:44,303
OK, enough.

649
00:37:46,715 --> 00:37:48,929
Enough what?
I'm just trying to be nice.

650
00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:52,409
- I even shaved for you.
- Stop! Stop being nice.

651
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:54,584
No matter what I do,
you're still here.

652
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:57,061
- Why haven't you just quit?
- I'm not giving up.

653
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,007
Only because I have
to carbo-load for the run.

654
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:12,743
Everybody, keep your clothes on!

655
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,372
Not again!

656
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,964
I guess all we needed were guns

657
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:30,269
and betrayal to get
over the hump hump.

658
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:36,171
I'm disappointed, though.

659
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:38,724
Really?

660
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:42,449
- Oh, no. That was great.
- Thank god.

661
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,311
It's the game.

662
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,563
I'm sad it's over.

663
00:38:47,688 --> 00:38:49,299
It was kind of fun.

664
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:51,369
- It's not over.
- It is now,

665
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:52,900
sucker!

666
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:55,542
Zbz wins.

667
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,498
You're not mad, are you?

668
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:01,295
Your dad could walk in
and I could not care less.

669
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:05,032
<i>Chicken legs one,
are you in there? Are you alive?</i>

670
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:08,736
No, I'm dead and I'm loving it.

671
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:10,334
Go away!

672
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,349
You wanna do it again, jackal?

673
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:18,312
Yes... Chicken legs one.

674
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:23,033
Pop quiz, hotshot.
Which is better: having sex

675
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:26,670
with Jordan or shooting her and
winning beer money for your brothers?

676
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:31,363
If she had a square jaw and biceps.

677
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,647
I know. We haven't had
a debate this lively since

678
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,107
"what's the difference between
a chipmunk and a squirrel?"

679
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:38,628
Remember?

680
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:41,836
Oh, my god! We won gotcha!

681
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,368
Oh, my god!
How did that happen?

682
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:47,552
Thanks to me keeping
Jordan alive all week,

683
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,096
she was able to
shoot Rusty and then they...

684
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,824
Never mind. We won!

685
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,060
This'll totally help us
with greek blue ribbon.

686
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,396
Does this also help you
with my "nameless slut" thing?

687
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,921
Not at all, you.

688
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:10,521
Thank you, everyone, for
coming out to support our cru titans!

689
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,922
But before we show off
our school spirit,

690
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,130
please be sure to drop your clothing
into the boxes provided.

691
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:23,618
Every donation benefits the
local cyprus homeless shelter.

692
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:26,396
Ifc and pan-hellenic council,

693
00:40:26,521 --> 00:40:28,460
thank you for your support.

694
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,449
- Congratulations, zbz.
- Thank you.

695
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:40,936
Are you happy now?

696
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,781
Does it matter to you how I feel?

697
00:40:42,906 --> 00:40:45,432
- I guess not.
- Then why ask?

698
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,863
It's good for everyone.

699
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,551
It's good for the homeless.

700
00:40:50,676 --> 00:40:52,865
And it's a good start for you.

701
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:56,029
So do you wanna...?

702
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:58,868
Yeah, no. I'm not doing that.

703
00:41:04,817 --> 00:41:06,687
You did it! And it's all important.

704
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,051
- I guess everything turned out OK.
- Better than OK.

705
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:13,219
Jessica L. said she'd take
over pan-hellenic now that you've quit.

706
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:14,893
I'm not quitting.

707
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:17,176
I'm just getting started.

708
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,468
OK, then.

709
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:22,497
OK, everybody!

710
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,945
<i>We're a couple of minutes away
from the 61st annual...</i>

711
00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:30,865
You're looking undie-tastic, case.

712
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:34,337
Nice to see you
kicking ass on pan-hellenic.

713
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,701
Watch out, world.

714
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,881
And you watch out for manholes.

715
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:42,745
Manholes?

716
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,255
<i>Remember ladies, keep your hands to
yourself unless you're running past me.</i>

717
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:53,063
On your mark.

718
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,886
Get set.
