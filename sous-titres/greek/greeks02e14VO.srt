1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,471
<i>Previously on</i> Greek...

2
00:00:01,596 --> 00:00:04,462
I hate to ask this,
but I need a rent check.

3
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:05,756
For the house.

4
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:07,131
Of course.

5
00:00:07,864 --> 00:00:09,749
- Where's your car?
- I guess it got stolen.

6
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:11,851
- What's going on?
- Call you tomorrow?

7
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:15,681
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- I'm Fisher, the new hasher.

8
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,934
There's something you should know.
I got fired from the last 3 sororities.

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,847
He said when he walked in
he knew this was the place for him.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,942
All in favor
of Rusty's golden boy Andy?

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,363
- I'm Jordan.
- I met a girl. She's beautiful.

12
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,948
- Does she want to join ZBZ?
- This is Jordan.

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,076
- The girl I was telling about.
- Where you going?

14
00:00:35,442 --> 00:00:37,328
- To make my move.
- Nice!

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,504
Did your girl ever show up?

16
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:43,749
Tough break.
Man, I just met this awesome chick.

17
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,516
Chapter meeting. Three minutes.

18
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:00,225
That means <i>adioso los pledge-os</i>.

19
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,479
Come on. Let's go. Thanks for cleaning.
There's plenty more.

20
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,647
Later.

21
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08,526
- Andylicious!
- My two favorite actives!

22
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,985
What are you guys up to?

23
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:13,076
We showed up early
so we don't have to sit on the floor.

24
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,406
Dibs on the Comfy Duct Tape chair!

25
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,077
Yeah. He really loves the chair.

26
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:26,001
So, when's our next ZBZ mixer?
I had a blast the other night.

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,140
I saw that. I saw that.
It's great.

28
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,798
That girl I was telling you about.
She said she knows you.

29
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,510
No. Not me.

30
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:34,385
- Very doubtful.
- Really?

31
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:36,387
Damn, because man,
I think I really like her.

32
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,056
I was hoping you could talk to her.

33
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,544
See if she likes me back.

34
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:43,771
Pledges out!

35
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,396
You better go, Andy.

36
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,234
We have a very full agenda tonight,
so please, pipe down.

37
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,564
Thank you, Luigi.

38
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,142
My friends, once again

39
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:00,910
we are heading into the heart-warmingest
few days of the Greek calendar year.

40
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:02,829
It's Big/Little weekend, everybody!

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,588
You promise to guide and support him
through every step of pledging.

42
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,047
You'll help him learn
his Kappa Tau history.

43
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,964
You'll make sure
they wear appropriate eye protection

44
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:17,714
when we use them
for the Paint Ball Target Practice.

45
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,714
You guys remember
what happened last year.

46
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,683
Now each pledge has selected
their first choice

47
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,092
and two alternates.

48
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,175
So, let's do this!

49
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:36,269
For his Big Brother,
Pledge Cue Ball has chosen, in order:

50
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,867
Wade, Beaver and Jeremy. Wade?

51
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,859
I'm already pledge educator, Cap.
If I do do both...

52
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:46,277
You said Doo-doo.

53
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,628
- You did say it.
- I pass.

54
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,338
I'll take him. Let me.

55
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,102
Sure you want to do that?

56
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:02,431
I'll pass.

57
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:09,135
Jeremy? You cool with Cue Ball?
Done. Jeremy takes Cue Ball.

58
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:13,901
Up next.

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,364
Please don't pick me.
Please don't pick me

60
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,661
Andy has chosen
Spitter, Beaver, and Ben Bennett.

61
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,955
This should be a no-brainer, right?

62
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,783
Sure. I'll take him.

63
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,064
Spitter takes Andylicious!

64
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:44,297
All right. Who's next?

65
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:53,553
- We need new recycling bins.
- I ordered them yesterday.

66
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:55,145
You're amazing.

67
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:58,303
Hang on.
I'm just gonna grab a snack.

68
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,854
It's me or we have been out
of Fruity Spindles for like a month?

69
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,844
I wouldn't know.
I don't eat those things.

70
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:12,167
Forgot they give you the toots.

71
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,672
No! No, they don't. That's Erica.
I just don't eat them.

72
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,441
I love you, Ash.

73
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:22,742
But if you keep doing
what you're doing

74
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:25,393
some of the girls are really
going to lose respect for you.

75
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:26,807
I'm not doing anything.

76
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,475
That's what I'm talking about.
The pantry is totally empty.

77
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,033
We're down to Saltines, Ash.
Saltines.

78
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:34,398
If that cupboard goes bare
they will turn on you.

79
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,372
Hell hath no fury like a ZBZ jonesing
for her Cheesaritos.

80
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:40,154
Right. Food! Got it. Thanks, Case.
I'll look into it.

81
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,323
- Just looking out for you.
- And as president,

82
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,764
I recognize the problem
and I am on top of it.

83
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,087
-= GREEK 214 =-
"Big Littles & Jumbo Shrimp"

84
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:49,830
VO : Arrow, Walid20-101

85
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,840
Thought we cancelled
the Tri-Pi Grunge mixer.

86
00:05:00,494 --> 00:05:01,567
Very funny.

87
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:05,883
I'll let that slide since you're
loaning me your car. Thanks.

88
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,476
You wanna talk about
what happened the other night?

89
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,895
Look, I'm sorry
I dragged you into that, man.

90
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,256
And I'm sorry
I've been such a jerk lately.

91
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,094
Yeah, man.
Sorry isn't good enough.

92
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:22,196
First, you blow me off,
then you call me to pick your ass up.

93
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:23,944
Who was she?

94
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,875
Just a girl I met in town
a few weeks ago.

95
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:33,624
- We started hooking up.
- What about Frannie?

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,804
You know, I mean it is about her,
but it's not.

97
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:42,971
Mostly, Cal, it's just
boring rich kid trust fund stuff

98
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,306
you wouldn't understand
or care about.

99
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:49,365
But fortunately my brother lands
in half an hour at the airport.

100
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,184
If there's anyone in the world
that will get it, it's him.

101
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:54,103
But, I do appreciate your concern

102
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:56,495
and your car.

103
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:01,098
Thanks, little bro.

104
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:11,659
- We're out of ketchup.
- What? We can't be.

105
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:14,286
- It says right here we have a case.
- This is the last bottle.

106
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:16,959
It sounds like Rusty
having an asthma attack.

107
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,255
We need to order more tissues
to make bouquets for the Brunch.

108
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,838
Seriously? We're out?

109
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,600
So, this Big/Little Brunch thing.

110
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:29,003
That's where you blindfold us
and make us eat dog food, right?

111
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:31,765
Yeah, who told you?

112
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,189
This is the weekend you all find out
who your Big Sister is.

113
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:42,644
OK. I don't get it.
According to this inventory

114
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,918
we should have 20 boxes of tissue
in the store room.

115
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,864
There's nothing in there
but spider webs and glitter pens.

116
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,598
- I'll go check the garage.
- Thanks, Jordan.

117
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,702
When was the last time
you did inventory?

118
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,621
I'm doing it now?

119
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,669
Wait. We don't have a garage.

120
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:59,376
This is the first inventory?
What have you been doing?

121
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,894
I don't know.

122
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:03,464
Stuff.

123
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:09,595
You know, I know what the problem is.
We live in a house full of thieves.

124
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,909
Between late-night treats
and snacks for the walk to class,

125
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:15,767
every girl here uses this pantry
like their personal snack cart.

126
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,113
- But who would take ketchup?
- Or tissues?

127
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,779
We're soon going to find out!

128
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:23,475
Cause as President, I'm going to take
my master key and search every room

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,819
- until I find out.
- I don't know about that.

130
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:26,904
She's right.

131
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:30,115
If you go all <i>Minority Report</i> you'll
lose every friend you have in the house.

132
00:07:30,554 --> 00:07:32,117
OK! Then how about this?

133
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,924
The most important thing
is that we find all the stuff.

134
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:36,803
How about I have an Amnesty Day?

135
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:40,000
Where anyone who finds something
can drop it off no questions.

136
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,086
Like they do with orphans
at the police station?

137
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:43,587
Exactly!

138
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:45,747
Just not as sad.

139
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,934
So, where is the garage?

140
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,227
Where's Dale?
Finally had enough of the babes,

141
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,518
blood and boobs
that make up Art History?

142
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,179
He thought he saw Jesus' face
in a pile of lawn clippings

143
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:03,580
so he ran home to call the news.

144
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:07,312
I've always wondered
what kind of people do that stuff.

145
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:10,030
Now I find out
they're exactly like I imagined.

146
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,828
Andy picked me
to be his big brother.

147
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:18,253
That's great.
I know how much you like him.

148
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,124
Liked him?

149
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,876
The problem isn't whether
or not I like him.

150
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,878
It's whether or not she likes him.

151
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:28,573
If I keep feeling the way I felt after
seeing them make out the other night,

152
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:31,662
I don't see myself being
the best big brother to Andy.

153
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:36,390
Trust me, having to second-guess
your big brother seriously sucks.

154
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:38,767
Problems with Bing?

155
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,006
You know what...

156
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:43,294
I promised that I'd never talk
about Evan in front of you.

157
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:49,061
But, if I hadn't,
I'd say he's really messed up right now.

158
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:52,761
Despite all of his screw-ups,
he's still my big brother.

159
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:54,761
He's been there for me.

160
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,517
I have to be there for him
any way I can.

161
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,132
If you can't make
that same promise for Andy,

162
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:02,573
you've got to find someone who can.

163
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,732
I stood up in front
of the whole house

164
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:07,326
and told them to take
a chance on this guy.

165
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:09,566
If I say I'm not into him
all of a sudden,

166
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,374
Cappie and everybody else
will think I'm a flake.

167
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,470
- Maybe she's not even into him.
- And maybe

168
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,265
he was just using his tongue to help her
get popcorn out of her teeth.

169
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,202
Come on.
A party kiss doesn't really count.

170
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,668
- It doesn't?
- No way. You can't tell me

171
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:26,690
you've never kissed a random guy
at a party just for the fun of it.

172
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,071
- I've not had that experience.
- You know what I mean.

173
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:33,023
These things happen
and they're not a big deal.

174
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:36,977
But, if I were you,
I would make sure

175
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:39,119
before it cost me
a great little brother.

176
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,397
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Jordan.

177
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,234
And a really hot girlfriend.

178
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:58,479
- Folks. Move it out.
- What do you want me to do?

179
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:04,465
Does your brother always give
so little notice before he visits?

180
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,298
Sometimes he just shows up.

181
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,690
He's a great guy.
You're gonna love him.

182
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,967
From all the things
your mother's told me, I can't wait.

183
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:14,321
Prodigal son,
squandered inheritance.

184
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:16,990
How often do you talk to my mother?

185
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,034
Mim and I have become text buddies.

186
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:22,074
And, you should know
she only refers to Patrick as a...

187
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:23,907
quote-unquote black sheep.

188
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:26,842
Well, Mim doesn't like my brother

189
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:30,587
because he turned his back
on her rules and her values,

190
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,988
and had the nerve
to do fine without them.

191
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,220
By the way,
he goes just by B. Sheep these days.

192
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,134
He's got you in a good mood,
which is great for me.

193
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:44,222
And it's good timing...

194
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:47,716
With Iota Kappa's application
turned in to Pan Hellenic

195
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:51,030
all I have to do is fill out
this utilities deposit and...

196
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:52,901
I'm all yours.

197
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,084
Wait. You need another check?

198
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:58,573
- What about the girls' dues?
- That went to the actual bills.

199
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,226
I didn't expect the phones
and cable would be so high.

200
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:04,419
With all the food they eat,
you think they'd bulk up

201
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,707
and generate enough body heat
to turn the furnace off.

202
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,252
Maybe we should get a personal trainer.
Add that to the wish list.

203
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,089
Right. We're gonna go.
We are moving.

204
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,196
Is that any way to say hi
to your older brother?

205
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:18,010
What's up, buddy?

206
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,856
- How you been?
- Good to see you.

207
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:20,928
You too, man.

208
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,680
Well, hello. Patrick Chambers.

209
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,309
Code name the Black Sheep.

210
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,669
Let's go, man.

211
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,061
All right.

212
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,694
Erica, wait. I thought
you couldn't eat Fruity Spindles?

213
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,739
No questions asked on Amnesty Day.
Thanks, Erica.

214
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,957
No problem.

215
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,673
- Amnesty Day is a success.
- Barely.

216
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:44,861
This is small stuff!
Where are the big ticket items?

217
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:48,623
Like the twenty pounds of jumbo shrimp
we got for Big/Little shrimp cocktails.

218
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,460
If that does turn up in a closet,
I say let it go.

219
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:55,297
- Nobody is snacking on jumbo shrimp.
- Maybe it's Frannie and the Ickies!

220
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,870
I thought of them.
I changed the codes to the locks.

221
00:11:57,995 --> 00:11:59,968
There's no sign of any break in.

222
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,569
If it's not someone

223
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:04,181
outside, I guess the next thing
to do is start looking

224
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,308
at the new girls
who moved in this semester.

225
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:14,483
Or boys.

226
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:21,496
Art History's baffling to me.

227
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,597
Like, why are they called
Pre-Raphaelites

228
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:25,870
even though they came 200 years
after Raphael?

229
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,413
Don't ask me.
Every time Summerfield says Raphael,

230
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:32,460
I immediately think Ralphie Wiggums
from <i>The Simpsons</i>.

231
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:35,062
I love Ralph!
"Me fail English?

232
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,860
"That's unpossible."

233
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:41,802
What did you think
of the KT party the other night?

234
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,252
God. Can we please
not talk about that?

235
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,938
I am so embarrassed.

236
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,361
Embarrassed? Why?

237
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,812
How sometimes at a party, you'll kiss
somebody just for the fun of it?

238
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,408
Yeah, I mean, who hasn't?

239
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,140
I haven't. Ever.

240
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,588
- Me too.
- But then at the mixer I had two drinks

241
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,692
and like an idiot
I kissed one of your pledges.

242
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,817
For all I know he's told your house
what a slutty lush I am.

243
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:07,625
Not that I could deny it.
I was a slushy.

244
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,579
- He didn't say you were a slushy.
- So he was talking about it?

245
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,459
If he didn't say I was a slushy,
it means he said something else.

246
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,747
What did he say?

247
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,182
Did he say we did it?

248
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:23,607
Because we did not do it!
That lying dirt...

249
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,303
He didn't say you did.

250
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:27,385
Then what?

251
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:31,129
He said he likes you.

252
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:34,646
He did?

253
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,206
Oh, my God! That rules.

254
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,577
OK. What else did he say?
Tell me everything.

255
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,142
Ash, I'm just saying.

256
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,538
In my house growing up
if something went missing

257
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,541
the first suspect
was always the help.

258
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:57,377
He does have the codes to the locks.
He's new to the house.

259
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,404
It's not a good idea
to accuse someone of stealing

260
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:01,755
because he's the new guy.

261
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,718
That's called
reverse discrimination.

262
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,221
Or reverse sexism or reverse...
something else we shouldn't do.

263
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:10,935
She's right, Becks.
If he was a thief

264
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,601
Ash would have heard about it
when she checked his references.

265
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,146
You did check his references?

266
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,023
- Kind of.
- You're joking, right?

267
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:23,535
What's the point
of calling references

268
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,239
if they're gonna do is lie
about bogus reasons for firing him?

269
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:27,365
Fired?

270
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,826
- The whole house doesn't have to know.
- Why was he fired?

271
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,870
Because he's so handsome.

272
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:34,873
He was sexually harassed
and they didn't want to get sued.

273
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,918
But who told you that
if you never talked to them?

274
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:38,900
He did!

275
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:50,185
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you to realize exactly

276
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,681
how crazy that sounds.

277
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,719
The Beaver Bowl XXI! Beaver on Beaver.
Beaver shoots.

278
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:02,817
He scores right away!
OK. Ball's back in play.

279
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,160
Other team Beaver
setting up for a score.

280
00:15:05,285 --> 00:15:07,097
Come on. Get over there!

281
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,448
Nice save.

282
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:12,661
So, Beav, since you were
Andy's second choice, I was wondering

283
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:16,055
if you'd be interested in taking him
on as little brother.

284
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:18,832
I'd love to.

285
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:23,662
But I can't.

286
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:26,758
Because of Scooby.

287
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:35,540
- Who's Scooby?
- Mickey "Scooby" Skubella.

288
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:38,978
One of the most promising pledges
ever accept a bid from Kappa Tau.

289
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:41,586
He was smart, funny,
a great athlete.

290
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:45,652
He was Beaver's first
and unfortunately last little brother.

291
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,654
They were perfect for one another.
In fact,

292
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,772
they won or placed
in every event during Greek Week.

293
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,668
Only to be disqualified
by a horrific doping scandal.

294
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:59,259
- He was on steroids?
- No. Actual dope.

295
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:01,585
Scooby was a reefer fiend.

296
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:04,689
A problem Beaver did not help him
see the dangers of.

297
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:07,912
He told me he was
a Rastafarian with cataracts!

298
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:14,180
After that, it went downhill for Scoobs.
Dropped out of school.

299
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,754
Which is why,
one day he hitched a ride from some guy

300
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,729
selling speakers out of his van
and was never seen again.

301
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,871
- He was kidnapped?
- No, he went to Florida.

302
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,238
- University of Florida?
- He worked at the airport.

303
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:27,527
- That's beside the point.
- Why is that Beaver's fault?

304
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,114
I'd love to tell you,
but you keep asking questions.

305
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,366
- Sorry.
- The reason it's Beaver's fault,

306
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,040
is he should be looking out
for his little brother.

307
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,435
Oh, man.

308
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,583
I should go check on him.
I'll be right back.

309
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:44,127
It hurts so bad, Cap.

310
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,926
I'm not gonna lie.
You're still the best.

311
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,184
Thank you, sir.

312
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:55,309
Drink-Giver?

313
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,500
- Give us more please.
- Be right back.

314
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:01,722
I'm glad your girlfriend didn't join us.
I got a very strong...

315
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,396
vibe of disapproval.

316
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:06,941
She's all right, though. She's OK.

317
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,873
- That's a ringing endorsement.
- Mom likes her.

318
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,310
Then she's a keeper!
Oh, my God.

319
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:14,487
Come on,
I don't wanna talk about Frannie.

320
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:17,536
- I wanna talk about you.
- OK. Good choice.

321
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:19,815
Patrick Chambers.
Hit me.

322
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,925
You traded it all for a life of...

323
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:25,293
sun, sand and surfboard rentals.

324
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,752
I gotta ask.
Do you miss the family fold?

325
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:31,815
Are you happy to be free
of the responsibilities of the power,

326
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,338
and prestige and the money?

327
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,068
No to the power.

328
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:40,132
No to the prestige
and the money was never the problem.

329
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:42,818
The problem was the ropes
attached to the money.

330
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:45,393
But the thing I regret
is not seeing more of you.

331
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:48,383
- I'm glad you're here.
- I am too.

332
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:50,630
Chamber-Maid?

333
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,713
No way,
what the hell are you doing here?

334
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:58,323
I live here,
and I go to school here occasionally.

335
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:00,787
- Oh, yeah, of course.
- What're you doing here?

336
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,534
Hanging out with my brother.

337
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,016
Have a seat.

338
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,759
Oh, no!
Don't tell me you guys are on the outs.

339
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,577
What about all those summers together
at Camp Kitchywawa?

340
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:21,205
- Those lanyard classes mean nothing?
- That was a long time ago, Patrick.

341
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,852
I remember it like it was yesterday.

342
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,704
The last time I saw you two together

343
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,855
you were covered in mud
from head to toe.

344
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,212
The scavenger hunt with the traing bras.
I've actually modified that

345
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:33,831
- into a very popular pledge prank.
- Good man.

346
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:37,082
That was one of my more
inspired camp activity creations.

347
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:39,647
- I wasn't the one who covered in mud.
- That's right.

348
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:42,071
We had to grease you up with mud

349
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:44,603
because you got stuck sneaking
into the trapdoor

350
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:46,499
under the CIT Girls cabin.

351
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:51,004
Cap, have a seat, man.
Let's get a beer.

352
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:54,758
I'll get another round.

353
00:18:56,622 --> 00:18:57,834
All right. Good.

354
00:18:58,801 --> 00:18:59,836
Good, good.

355
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,018
- Cheers. Here we go.
- All right.

356
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,503
Here's to old times.

357
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:14,068
Natalie, thank you for taking
the time to come over.

358
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,820
I'm sure as President you're busy

359
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,126
with your own Gamma Psi Big/Little
preparations so we'll keep this short.

360
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,311
Not at all.
I love coming to the ZBZ house.

361
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:24,704
- It's so pretty.
- Thanks.

362
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,218
What we really want to talk
to you about is Fisher.

363
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:32,036
He was the best hasher
Gamma Psi ever had.

364
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,130
Polite, thorough, efficient...

365
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,251
Sounds like you really had
the hots for him.

366
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:40,136
We were very satisfied
with his performance, yes.

367
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,432
When you say performance, do you mean
in the kitchen or the bedroom?

368
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,660
Excuse me?

369
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,270
What she means is
did he do any other work for you?

370
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:52,271
He just worked in our kitchen.

371
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:54,226
Until things disappeared.

372
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:55,801
Then we canned him.

373
00:19:57,127 --> 00:20:01,115
- But you never pressed charges?
- Oh, no. We had no solid proof.

374
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,327
Well, that settles it.
Thank you so much, Natalie.

375
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,811
Like, I said, we had no solid proof,

376
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:10,555
but I'm happy to say
since we let Fisher go,

377
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,730
every piece of food in our house
has been left untouched.

378
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:16,293
We know that's saying a lot
at the Gamma Psi house.

379
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:21,174
- What is going on with you?
- I'm sorry, but she is obviously

380
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,857
- a sexual predator.
- She can't even say the word sex.

381
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:27,193
I'm not going to ruin
an innocent guy's reputation

382
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:29,268
based on the word of some Gamma Psi.

383
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:31,961
Especially a guy
you have a crush on.

384
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,052
Fisher is an employee
of the Zeta Beta Zeta house

385
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:36,733
and I am its President.

386
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:38,986
And as its President, I am required

387
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:41,489
to make decisions
that speak for each of my sisters.

388
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:44,117
It is my belief as President

389
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,120
that my sisters would prefer to treat
our employees with fairness and decency.

390
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:51,796
And I do not have a crush on him!

391
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:56,931
She totally has a crush on him.

392
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,574
- I'm fine!
- No. You know my rule.

393
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:03,545
If the drinks are on you,

394
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,389
then the drunks are on me.

395
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,976
I'm not drunk.
This place just has too many stairs.

396
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:12,846
That's right.
We'll get those removed.

397
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,365
Thanks for helping me with him.

398
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:19,559
Are you kidding?
It was good to see him again.

399
00:21:19,684 --> 00:21:20,684
Right.

400
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,640
I should go.
I got that Big/Little party tomorrow...

401
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:35,178
- You should try to start those sober.
- I should try.

402
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,703
- I'll see you.
- OK.

403
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,095
- Have a safe flight back.
- Later, Cappie!

404
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,878
For a second there I thought you guys
were going to kiss.

405
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:49,093
I can't believe Cappie
and I spent two hours together

406
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:51,601
- and no one threw a punch.
- I knew we forgot something.

407
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,612
No. Sit on bed.

408
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:55,816
I need to talk to you.
It's about a girl.

409
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:00,805
Definitely break up with her.
She's just like mom.

410
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,562
- It's borderline oedipal.
- No, it's not about Frannie.

411
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:07,723
I guess it's a little bit
about Frannie.

412
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,400
I've been cheating on her.

413
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,206
With a townie that I met in a bar.

414
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:17,507
She doesn't know my real name
because I don't want her to.

415
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,754
The other night,
I parked my car a few blocks away

416
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,814
so she wouldn't see that
I had money and it was stolen.

417
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:25,843
That's what God made
insurance for, right?

418
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:29,321
Look, ever since I took my trust...

419
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:32,958
Ever since I signed my life away
to the Chambers International,

420
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,683
I've become this person.

421
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:39,220
I buy my way out of everything.
I treat my friends like crap.

422
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:42,407
You'll get used to it.

423
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:44,040
Look at Dad.

424
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,233
I don't want to be like Dad.

425
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,768
When I was sitting in the bar
I was thinking

426
00:22:53,893 --> 00:22:56,499
I should just chuck it all away
and move to Costa Rica with you.

427
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:58,292
Bad idea.

428
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:00,837
Why?

429
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,465
Because without you here,
I'd never find a sympathetic ear.

430
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:06,741
Why would you need sympathy?

431
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,261
Grow up, Ev.

432
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,884
It's a cold world out there.

433
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:15,101
When the fire goes out,
it's nice to know someone with a match.

434
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,870
Thank you.

435
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,915
How much do you need?

436
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,419
Not that much.
Just some getting by money.

437
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,587
How much?

438
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:45,923
Fifty grand.

439
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,964
Large coffee. Black.

440
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:04,859
It's a myth that caffeine
helps a hangover.

441
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:06,732
Nice sales pitch.

442
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:08,653
Why don't you try
pushing the croissant?

443
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:10,837
I hate my job.

444
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,291
So, Joni.

445
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:23,571
What do you do for fun?
Besides debunking caffeine myths

446
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,552
and lighting up this world
with that glorious smile?

447
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,512
OK, forget it.

448
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:32,259
I'll get his.

449
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,390
- Everyone else is getting some.
- Why not you?

450
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,450
I'll have one large cappuccino,
please.

451
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:42,472
You know I had a dream last night.

452
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:46,109
We were hanging out at Dobler's
and you weren't an ass.

453
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,850
Did you know how to say
thank you in your dream?

454
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:49,987
Still an ass.

455
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:52,679
And an idiot.

456
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:56,911
I was really looking
forward to seeing Patrick.

457
00:24:57,606 --> 00:25:00,136
I thought that we had this
brother telepathy thing.

458
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:02,708
He'd know when I really needed him.

459
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,267
First of all, I think

460
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:06,716
you have to be twins for that
telepathy thing to work.

461
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:09,123
And second, I think you've
got the wrong big brother.

462
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:10,225
Why's that?

463
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,593
Because as much as I enjoy
hanging out with Patrick,

464
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,705
he's never done anything
without having something in it for him.

465
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,600
Even the Training Bra Scavenger Hunt was
just a ruse to divert you long enough

466
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,979
so he could score
with Tammy Summers.

467
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:23,794
The Camp President?

468
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,508
- Who told you that?
- She did.

469
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:27,412
She had the softest lips.

470
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,859
Drunk guy's friend.
Your order's up.

471
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:32,989
- He's not my friend.
- He's not my friend.

472
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:37,869
First rule of avoiding
disappointment...

473
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,685
Lower your expectations.

474
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:51,309
Another killer party.

475
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:54,719
- Rock and roll!
- A little birdie told me

476
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,470
you had a talk with Jordan about me.

477
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,263
I just said you liked her
and we spent the next hour deciding

478
00:25:59,388 --> 00:26:02,263
whether she should slip a note
under your door or text you.

479
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,500
Good choice.

480
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:06,896
Thanks.

481
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:16,092
Nice.

482
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:17,485
Pledge Cue Ball!

483
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:21,571
For the next hour,

484
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,123
feel the bonds of brotherhood

485
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:27,192
your new big brother...

486
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:30,201
Who is it? Who is it?

487
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:44,560
We have to talk.

488
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,208
Look how nervous the pledges are.
That's hilarious.

489
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,842
- That was us last year.
- I love being an active.

490
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,069
Nobody chose you
for big brother, right?

491
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:54,367
Don't rub it in.

492
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:56,739
I was a couple guy's second choice
and some thirds too.

493
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,699
How'do you like to be
somebody's number one?

494
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:00,538
Wait, who?

495
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,112
Pledge Andylicious!

496
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,961
For the next hour enjoy the physical

497
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,629
bond of brotherhood

498
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,423
- your new Big Brother...
- Wait!

499
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:23,724
I'm a righty.

500
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,521
Come here.

501
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,886
Seriously? Who?

502
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:40,199
Who is it?

503
00:27:41,374 --> 00:27:42,534
Is he here now?

504
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:46,705
Just tell me later.

505
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,745
Three more shots please.

506
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:54,238
- You got it.
- This is the best way to handle this?

507
00:27:54,363 --> 00:27:57,526
Absolutely. It's the only way
to save Ashleigh from herself.

508
00:27:57,651 --> 00:28:00,403
Until she can admit her crush
on Fisher she won't see

509
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,852
it's getting in the way
of her responsibilities to the house.

510
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:06,017
And believe me, a drunk Ashleigh,
is an honest Ashleigh.

511
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,743
I can't believe
you wanted to do shots.

512
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:11,302
Usually,
you're such a fuddy-duddy drinker.

513
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:12,606
That's pretty honest.

514
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,984
- To Ashleigh!
- To me!

515
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,812
I'm so drunk.

516
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:28,664
She really is.
Believe me, I would know!

517
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,989
Did you steal that shirt
from Blues Clues?

518
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,372
We want to ask you about Fisher.

519
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:41,494
Can you believe that girl Natalie?

520
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:44,437
What a slaggy-slag-slag.

521
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,410
No. She's horrible.

522
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:49,226
She is horrible.
That's a good point.

523
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:52,918
You're sure you don't
have a crush on Fisher?

524
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:54,231
Scout's honor.

525
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,235
But ask me if we're doing it.

526
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,519
So, when does ZBZ do Big/Little?

527
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:08,371
- Tomorrow. We're having a Brunch.
- Go, go, go!

528
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:23,594
- I don't think it'll be as fun as this.
- I'm sure you'll have a cool Big Sis.

529
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:26,722
She is cool.
It's Rusty's sister, Casey.

530
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:27,909
This Rusty?

531
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,998
That's awesome!

532
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:31,903
Rock and roll.

533
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,189
Spitter and Andy.

534
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:40,157
You have completed
your mandatory hour of bondage...

535
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:41,904
Bonding. I mean.

536
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,281
We do not need those rumors
around campus again.

537
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:45,869
Congratulations.

538
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:50,736
The night is yours to bask in the glow
of fraternal impossibilitment.

539
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:54,633
Sorry,

540
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:57,366
I stayed out later
last night than I should have.

541
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:58,663
Enjoy.

542
00:30:00,283 --> 00:30:01,590
Congratulations.

543
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:16,939
I'm going for a hamburger.
You guys good?

544
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:20,943
I better hold off.
I've got early practice tomorrow.

545
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:29,278
I'm so happy you brought me here.

546
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:33,570
What do I do next?
Your my Big Bro, Right?

547
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,131
How are your Beer Pong skills?

548
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:44,507
Terrible. I suck at it.

549
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,487
Follow me, Little Bro!

550
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,220
The key to Beer Pong

551
00:30:48,695 --> 00:30:51,614
is you have to practice
the fundamentals.

552
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:13,120
Remember Andy...

553
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:16,646
Keep that elbow in
and hold the follow through.

554
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,251
- Is this a normal KT thing?
- A true Kappa Tau

555
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:27,968
must learn how to compete
on every level of sobriety.

556
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,921
Follow through.

557
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:50,115
Set 'em up. One more match.
I'll play left handed.

558
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:54,860
Come on, Andy.

559
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:57,623
You're OK.

560
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,850
I think you're the best Presidents
that ZBZ has ever had.

561
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:20,771
Unfortunately, if you want to stay one,
you have to fire Fisher.

562
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:22,027
Why?

563
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:24,076
But I really like him.

564
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,858
You guys have no idea what it's like

565
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,990
to go through college
without a boyfriend.

566
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,871
I mean, you went from...

567
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,449
from Cappie to Evan

568
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:36,752
to Max.

569
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:38,597
And then you went from...

570
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,458
from Evan to Cappie to...

571
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,325
If she says Max I will cut you.

572
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:45,967
I just don't...

573
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:49,464
get why I should
have to give up this boyfriend

574
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,635
if we don't have any proof.

575
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:55,389
She's right.
We need proof.

576
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,153
I totally agree.

577
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:00,199
OK, then this is what we do.

578
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:02,859
You text Fisher.

579
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:06,549
Tell him there's groceries
that need to be put away.

580
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:09,090
Then if all the food is there
in the morning...

581
00:33:09,215 --> 00:33:12,230
We'll know he isn't the thief.
That's a great plan.

582
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,824
I love it!

583
00:33:14,614 --> 00:33:15,614
I love it.

584
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:18,502
- Let's get your phone out.
- Can you get it?

585
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,914
Nice.

586
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:23,800
Down. Yeah, F.
Under F.

587
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:25,271
Press it.

588
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:28,922
Come on. Typey-typey.

589
00:33:29,588 --> 00:33:31,341
What if he is the thief?

590
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:34,206
Then at least you'll know.

591
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,220
And we'll help you find
somebody better.

592
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,733
Why am I the only one who's drunk?

593
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,154
This is it.

594
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:53,598
I guess.

595
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,493
- You gonna make me beg for it?
- No. I wouldn't do that to you.

596
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:04,625
- I need you to answer one question.
- Yes, I stole your toothbrush.

597
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:08,754
Would you tell me to stay the course
if you didn't need me to be your bank?

598
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,549
Why does everything have to come
with strings attached?

599
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,384
There's no strings.
It's a question.

600
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:18,180
You'd enjoy living in a foreign country
working your ass off to pay rent?

601
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,391
- Do you think I would?
- What does it matter?

602
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,797
Your my big brother
and you should want what's best for me.

603
00:34:24,817 --> 00:34:27,481
And help me when I really
don't know what to do.

604
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:33,388
People got to look out
for themselves.

605
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:36,407
It's not personal.
It's just life.

606
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,283
That's it?

607
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:41,506
Come on.

608
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:45,860
You've really got to relax.

609
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,295
Why don't you come visit
some weekend?

610
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,877
Seriously! Get yourself a tan.

611
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,206
Thanks, little brother.

612
00:35:17,842 --> 00:35:18,842
Sorry.

613
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,838
If Fisher is a criminal,

614
00:35:27,636 --> 00:35:29,534
would you guys hate me
if I kept seeing him?

615
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:31,822
Be smart.
Like Anne Hathaway.

616
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:33,569
I'd keep dating him.

617
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:35,335
You would not.

618
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,914
I wouldn't leave him alone
with my purse, but come on? He's hot.

619
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:42,274
Touch him and I'll cut you
even faster than she would.

620
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,172
Freeze!

621
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,203
- Dude.
- You're busted, Fisher!

622
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,418
Wait, wait!

623
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,840
You know him?

624
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:20,969
He's Fisher's roommate.

625
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,248
And he's a thief.

626
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:30,192
<i>Coming up.</i>

627
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,099
<i>Is it a miracle
or a smelly old pile of compost?</i>

628
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:35,696
<i>Meet a local CRU student</i>

629
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:38,769
<i>who claims he found Jesus
in a pile of grass clippings.</i>

630
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,375
<i>After the break!</i>

631
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,484
Did you learn nothing
from the Scooby story?

632
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:52,984
I didn't mean for him
to get that drunk.

633
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:55,712
He's just really bad at Beer Pong.

634
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,403
I guess I got a little carried away.

635
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:03,657
Anyone can become a Big Brother.

636
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:06,411
It's how you act afterwards
that defines you.

637
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:08,684
I didn't really want
to be his Big Brother?

638
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,693
- Why not? Because of the girl?
- No. What girl?

639
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:12,818
Sit down.

640
00:37:13,394 --> 00:37:14,394
Sit down.

641
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:17,995
You think I'm blind?
If there's anyone who understands

642
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,362
how a girl can change the way
you feel about a friend...

643
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:24,324
It's your Big Brother.
Mostly because of your big sister.

644
00:37:24,885 --> 00:37:26,851
Good god this campus is incestuous.

645
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:29,926
He hooked up with her before
I could even tell her I liked her.

646
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:34,293
They're all into each other
and I want to puke around them.

647
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:37,080
I was going to ask Ben
to be his Big Brother,

648
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:39,089
but I was too late for that, too.

649
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:40,803
Why'd you say yes
in the first place?

650
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:43,302
I fought so hard convincing you
to let him in the house,

651
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,087
I felt like if I changed my mind,

652
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,515
you'd question
my judgment as an active.

653
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,268
That was stupid.

654
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,145
Ben can be Andy's big brother?

655
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,315
I'm afraid not.
That's the thing about responsibility.

656
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:59,087
Once you take it on,
there's no getting out of it.

657
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,571
I can't believe out of all
the people on campus,

658
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,039
you're the one teaching me
about responsibility.

659
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,410
And apparently,
a little something about irony.

660
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:21,131
Andy. There you are.

661
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:26,887
Come on, buddy.
You got football practice. 20 minutes.

662
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:34,019
I thought you would feel that way.
I wasn't sure what you would need more.

663
00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:37,109
A little jolt of caffeine?

664
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,114
Or electrolyte replacement?

665
00:38:41,177 --> 00:38:42,498
What do you think?

666
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:44,928
Come on.

667
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:46,751
Come on.

668
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:47,783
Let's go.

669
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:52,369
Rise and shine.

670
00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:56,946
Come on, buddy.

671
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:02,714
Come on.

672
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,134
Open those eyes!

673
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,296
This is unpossible.

674
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:22,357
- Are you, OK?
- A little hangover-induced vertigo.

675
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,695
It'll pass. I hope.

676
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:25,864
Sorry.

677
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,656
Next time we'll go
easier on the truth shots.

678
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:32,244
Are you kidding? I'd do a hundred shots
to find out Fisher wasn't the thief.

679
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,704
How did he take the news?

680
00:39:34,478 --> 00:39:35,539
He felt terrible.

681
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:39,420
He also promises never to get
a roommate off of Craigslist.

682
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:43,665
Of course, you know as his employer,

683
00:39:43,957 --> 00:39:46,174
you still have to keep
your relationship a secret.

684
00:39:48,112 --> 00:39:50,470
A secret boyfriend is
better than no boyfriend, right?

685
00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:52,549
Right.

686
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:56,356
You OK with that, Fisher?

687
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:01,944
Anything for Ashleigh.

688
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:04,007
Great.

689
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,329
I've been trying to get a hold of
you all night. Where've you been?

690
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,295
Saying goodbye to my brother.

691
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:21,135
Turns out
he didn't come here for the fun

692
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:23,964
He just wanted to ask me
for some emergency cash.

693
00:40:28,603 --> 00:40:30,141
I think your mom was right.

694
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:32,971
You're a better person
than your brother.

695
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,161
- What's this?
- This?

696
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:42,189
I guess this is your emergency cash.

697
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,446
Plus a little extra
for that personal trainer.

698
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:50,206
That is so not fair, Evan.

699
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:52,890
I'm surprised you and Patrick
didn't hit it off.

700
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:54,789
You have so much in common.

701
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:58,997
You offered to help me with the house.
This was your idea.

702
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,559
You know I'm not Patrick.

703
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:09,081
Do I?

704
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:34,231
Let's go.

705
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:51,917
What the hell are you doing here?

706
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:54,361
Checking in on you.
That's what big brothers do.

707
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:05,764
All right.

708
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,570
- Is that our boy?
- Yep.

709
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:13,446
Well done.

710
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,698
Well done.

711
00:42:16,651 --> 00:42:18,633
This might not be
as hard as I thought.

712
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:22,607
It's not Andy's fault
that Jordan likes him instead of me.

713
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:26,714
Look at him.
Any guy that can make it

714
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:30,843
to football practice after losing
four straight sets of Beer Pong

715
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:33,300
has probably got
a good amount of Kappa Tau in him.

716
00:42:46,705 --> 00:42:48,130
At least he used to.

717
00:42:50,937 --> 00:42:52,494
You want to get breakfast?

718
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,427
Sure.
Pumpkin pancakes?

719
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,826
You love those.

720
00:42:58,696 --> 00:43:00,828
- Ohio special?
- Yeah, sounds good.
