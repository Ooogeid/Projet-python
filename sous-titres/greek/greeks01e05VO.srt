00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,001
<i>Previously on Greek

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,217
Our first date function of the year
gives you nutbags

3
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,867
three days to find a date.

4
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,066
- That's her?
- That's her.

5
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:09,289
- What if she doesn't like me?
- She likes everybody.

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,216
This isn't really how I imagined
my first time.

7
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:13,867
I just thought it would mean
something more.

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,483
Frannie started doubting my loyalty
to Omega Chi.

9
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:17,691
Are you doubting me too?

10
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:19,740
- Do they know?
- I'm not gonna tell 'em.

11
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,941
Certain things you just have
to accept about yourself.

12
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:23,291
I suck at hockey.

13
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:24,725
- And I'm gay.
- What?

14
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:26,325
Now it's my turn to ask you a question.

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,103
- Things between...
- Can you forgive me?

16
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,857
I'm thinking I'll wear blue to the tea,

17
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:36,375
then black to the president's dinner.

18
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:38,175
Or is black too sexpot?

19
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:39,758
What's wrong with sexpot?

20
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:41,575
You look good in sexpot.

21
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:44,125
And I'm sure
your parents would think so too.

22
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:47,742
Sex-pottery is the first thing
you should bring up with my parents.

23
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:49,242
Come on, be serious.

24
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:50,992
So what shouldn't I bring up?

25
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:53,426
Reality tv.

26
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:56,209
My mother thinks it's beneath contempt.

27
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:57,979
She's on the board at PBS, so...

28
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:00,480
I'll cram in a few episodes
of Masterpiece Theater.

29
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,643
And as for my dad,

30
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,193
he just got burned trying
to buy an IT company,

31
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:07,180
so don't mention technology.
He'll go ballistic.

32
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,077
- Okay, no technology.
- Yeah, no technology.

33
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:11,594
I guess the number one topic to avoid is

34
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:13,377
my brother Patrick.

35
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:15,927
- The one who...
- Lives in Costa Rica,

36
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:17,977
wears mandals, has dreadlocks.

37
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:19,868
That's him.

38
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:24,551
Don't worry, you're gonna be great.

39
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:28,948
It's just that I know
how important they are to you

40
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,099
and the rest of the world.

41
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:33,132
I mean, you're, like, part of a dynasty.

42
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:36,332
The Chambers of Chambers International
and the Chambers Foundation.

43
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:39,982
I mean, your father's being honored
for donating a building to CRU.

44
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:41,298
That's major.

45
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:43,723
I'm used to it, I guess.

46
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,573
I love that it's no big deal to you.

47
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:49,034
It's...

48
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:50,617
Sexy.

49
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,651
Someday,

50
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:53,284
you and I

51
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:55,484
will have a dynasty of our own.

52
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:00,667
In 79 AD,

53
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,750
on some date right around now,

54
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:06,066
the mighty mount Vesuvius erupted,

55
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:08,984
laying waste to the citizens of Pompeii.

56
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,267
Each year we honor those lost souls...

57
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,667
With beer bongs and hotties!

58
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,253
Vesuvius is a homecoming legend.

59
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:23,487
No one on greek row even tries
to compete on this night.

60
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:26,879
It's the party against which
all other parties are judged.

61
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,180
Do we need dates?

62
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:33,847
No, little man.
Dates are for date functions.

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
This is a party.

64
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:36,664
Parties are for random hookups.

65
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:39,677
This is a perfect opportunity for you
to hone your game.

66
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:42,264
I got it.

67
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,431
He's got it.

68
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,292
Crush basket delivery.

69
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,942
What's a crush basket?

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,772
"A crush basket is one
of the many ways a ZBZ girl,

71
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:05,323
or any other sorority girl,
for that matter,

72
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:07,423
can let a guy know that
she's interested in him."

73
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,369
ZBZ handbook.

74
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,036
Do you want some help?

75
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:15,202
Maybe you can pick that up
while I take these in.

76
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:18,269
Crush baskets!

77
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:23,191
I'm Jen K. There are three other Jens
in the ZBZ house.

78
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:25,207
Jen R, Jen B, and Jen Y.

79
00:03:25,324 --> 00:03:27,772
Funny? Jen y, like "gen-y."

80
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:30,789
So what's your name?

81
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,839
Rusty C.

82
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,372
For Cartwright.

83
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,608
Cartwright! There's a Cartwright
in my sorority.

84
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:37,608
We have to memorize everyone
for pledging.

85
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:39,308
Casey Cartwright, junior.

86
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:40,856
ZBZ pledge educator.

87
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:41,906
Favorite color, pink.

88
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,172
One brother.

89
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:45,339
Are you the brother?

90
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:49,706
But Casey and I aren't exactly
in the same social....

91
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,010
circle.

92
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:54,876
As in probably none
of those crush baskets are for me.

93
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,693
One more. This is for Cappie.

94
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,534
From all the girls at Tri Pi.

95
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:08,272
I gotta go. Bye.

96
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,939
Come on. We've got a meeting
to finish up in here.

97
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:15,872
This is for you.

98
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,204
So many Tri Pis, so little shame.

99
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:22,738
What about those two?

100
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:32,512
Ben Bennett and... Rusty.

101
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,728
"From your ZBZ secret admirer."

102
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:43,194
Get the camera.

103
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:45,894
Our little Rusty just got
his first crush basket.

00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,722
Do you realize what this means?

109
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:00,834
The basket isn't from your sister,
I hope.

110
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,534
Somebody already likes me.
I could actually get a girlfriend

111
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:05,664
without having to do all the stuff
I'm terrible at.

112
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:06,818
Like talking to girls.

113
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:09,153
We gotta figure out who she is, so

114
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,717
I don't do something stupid
in front of her without knowing it.

115
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:13,801
Don't rush me.

116
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:14,901
What is this?

117
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:21,651
"Wear this t-shirt to Vesuvius."

118
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:24,500
You're gonna look like a traffic cone.

119
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,227
I guess she'll be able
to pick you out of the crowd.

120
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:28,967
I can't believe she called me sexy.

121
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:30,950
I wonder who she is.

122
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:32,017
Settle down.

123
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,467
She's going to reveal herself
to you at the party,

124
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:38,884
so you just have to avoid doing
something embarrassing for 48 hours.

125
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:39,984
I can do that.

126
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,434
Your fly's open.

127
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,745
<i>I do believe it was he.

128
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,162
<i>How now, my lord?

129
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:50,812
<i>I've been talking with a suitor...

130
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:52,412
Are they even speaking english?

131
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,495
It's Shakespeare.

132
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,562
What do you think?

133
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:57,195
Is it Katie Couric

134
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:58,812
or Meredith Vieira?

135
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:01,628
Neither. What's up with
the bad news anchor fashion?

136
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,043
There are certain expectations
that come with being a Chambers.

137
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,376
They're american royalty.

138
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:08,576
I want to live up to those expectations.

139
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,976
American royalty?

140
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:12,993
So you could be like Princess Diana.

141
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:15,416
- Before the tunnel.
- Exactly.

142
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:22,066
I didn't know middle-aged matron was
in this season.

143
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:31,199
I was thinking, maybe we could spend
a little more time together.

144
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,099
Go do something...

145
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,599
Clothed.

146
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:36,782
You mean something like

147
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:39,199
pick you up in my dad's minivan,

148
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:40,716
bring you some flowers,

149
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,066
pay for a movie, and hope you hold
my hand during the scary parts?

150
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:50,366
What did you have in mind?

151
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,070
I don't know.

152
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:53,487
Grab some food?

153
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:56,254
Well, we all gotta eat.

154
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:03,912
I'll give you a call.

155
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,729
I'm so glad you could come see
the house.

156
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:13,753
Casey's probably gonna be president
of ZBZ next year... Isn't that great?

157
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:14,820
Good for you.

158
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,019
We're so pleased that Evan decided
to run for Omega Chi President.

159
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,902
It's a great thing
to have on that resume

160
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:22,377
if you want to get into politics.

161
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,169
Evan's very political.

162
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,086
Yesterday we were watching Frontline.

163
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:28,869
I don't know many girls your age
that watch public television.

164
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:30,085
All the time. In fact,

165
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:33,402
I just saw the most wonderful adaptation
of Othello on PBS.

166
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:36,402
The staging of Desdemona's murder was
incredibly powerful.

167
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,054
I helped secure the funding

168
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,737
- for that production.
- You're kidding!

169
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,004
You have excellent taste.

170
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,087
I like to think so.

171
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:49,039
That's why you were trying
on all those clothes.

172
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,622
These must be Evan's parents.

173
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,639
A pleasure.

174
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,639
Evan totally has your eyes.

175
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,839
I'm Rebecca Logan.

176
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,556
Casey's my big sis in the sorority.

177
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,590
You're senator Logan's daughter.

178
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,523
We heard you were going to school here.

179
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:02,956
You didn't mention you knew her.

180
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:05,906
Must have slipped my mind.

181
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:07,740
Casey didn't mention you either,

182
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,123
which is surprising because Casey and I
share everything when it comes to Evan.

183
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,290
Right, Casey?

184
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,339
I just read about the new IT company
you're acquiring.

185
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,573
You must be thrilled.

186
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:22,306
It's your biggest deal ever, right?

187
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:23,456
Deal didn't go through.

188
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:25,489
Some political antitrust bull.

189
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:27,842
I'm sorry to hear that.

190
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,425
It's too bad we didn't meet earlier.

191
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:31,995
Maybe my father could have helped out.

192
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:34,192
Next time.

193
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,208
Why don't you join us?

194
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,027
She... Rebecca's a very busy person.

195
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:41,777
Just like your mother.

196
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,310
Besides, you're here to get
to know Casey, not boring old me.

197
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,044
Congratulations on
being honored this weekend.

198
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:50,077
Thank you.

199
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:58,935
Gentlemen, behind this tarp

200
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:01,735
sits an important piece
of Kappa Tau lore.

201
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:05,535
It was built in 1999
by the legendary Kappa Tau

202
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:06,851
egyptian Joe,

203
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,184
who was inspired after a weekend

204
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:11,934
of special brownies, and a real walk
through Hawaii marathon.

205
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:17,384
Last year this baby violated several
local fire ordinances

206
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,400
and one law of physics.

207
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,284
And after eight years at Cyprus-Rhodes,

208
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,650
Joe was forced to leave.

209
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:34,585
His proud creation lives on.

210
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:35,901
I give you...

211
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:37,818
Vesuvius!

212
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:49,956
Let's light this mother up.

213
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
What the...

214
00:09:58,173 --> 00:09:59,706
Well, let's not panic yet.

215
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:14,672
Now you can panic.

216
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:17,422
Wait, what does this mean?

217
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:18,789
This means we're doomed.

218
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:22,389
This could be worse
than the O'Doul's debacle of '05.

219
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,120
Who knew O'Doul's didn't have

220
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:29,729
- alcohol in it?
- Everybody knew.

221
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,146
If only we could figure out
the volcano's instruction manual.

222
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:36,979
It's pretty science-y.

223
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,512
I'm science-y.

224
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:40,312
Give me the manual,
I'll fix the volcano.

225
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:41,346
You sure, pledge?

226
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,495
Because if you do this,
this party is in your hands.

227
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,862
Your small, delicate...

228
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:48,912
Very girlish hands.

229
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,662
This volcano is gonna break
two laws of physics.

230
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:58,329
We're counting on you.

231
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:03,228
Just our reputation as Party Mecca,
my legacy as President,

232
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,062
and your love life ride on this.

233
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:09,178
No pressure.

234
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,236
Come on, time for a shopping trip.

235
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:15,850
You've gotta help me find a new dress
for Mr. Chambers' dinner.

236
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:18,920
You are totally overreacting.

237
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,573
So rebecca logan kind of stole
your thunder at tea... So what?

238
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:24,020
You're forgetting
the most important thing. You're awesome

239
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,120
and their son is totally in love
with you.

240
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:27,203
That's true.

241
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
You're right.

242
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:30,186
I can turn this around.

243
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,903
I'm Casey Cartwright.
Parents tend to love me.

244
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:34,936
Like Derek, my high school boyfriend.

245
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,886
His mom said I was the daughter
she never had.

246
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:40,270
And she had a daughter.

247
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,186
It was so awkward.

248
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,920
What are you worried about?

249
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:47,603
Evan's parents are in a slightly
different league than Derek's.

250
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,453
Which is why I need the perfect dress.

251
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,986
- Are you in?
- Are you kidding me?

252
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,620
You had me at "shopping trip".

253
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:59,087
I mean, this egyptian Joe guy was
a poetry major.

254
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,187
How complicated could
his engineering be?

255
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,670
And then once I fix his volcano, I'll be
on my way to meet my dream woman.

256
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,108
I'll just follow the manual,

257
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:08,608
add a little imagination...

258
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:12,425
And expose myself to the ebola virus.

259
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,675
Why can't people be satisfied
with the way things are?

260
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:17,358
Why do they always need
to push things to the next level?

261
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,175
After setting myself on fire...

262
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,621
What are you talking about?

263
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:24,175
- Nothing.
- What are you talking about?

264
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:27,126
- Nothing.
- Nothing as in you

265
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:29,259
and your top-secret
mystery relationship?

266
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:30,693
It's not a relationship.

267
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:32,426
It's a... thing.

268
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:36,009
<i>2, 4, 6, 8,

269
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:38,126
<i>we won't let you detonate.

270
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:40,392
<i>2, 4, 6, 8,

271
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:42,325
<i>we won't let you detonate.

272
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:44,658
What are you doing?

273
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,041
We're staging a protest

274
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,991
to save the Remington/Herzog
atmospheric destabilizing module.

275
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,074
The what?

276
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:54,741
It's a device that can manipulate
weather patterns in a confined area.

277
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,942
The DOD commissioned it
back in the 1980s...

278
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:57,976
It never worked.

279
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,907
That's exactly what
they want you to think.

280
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:01,391
The truth is they never turned it on.

281
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,641
They don't want to turn it on.

282
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:04,091
They're afraid of the possibilities.

283
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:06,357
We can't let the university's fear
dissuade progress...

284
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:07,424
Will you join us?

285
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,641
We're going to Dobler's
for a pledge mixer.

286
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:12,149
Where Rusty's gonna rub elbows
with his secret admirer.

287
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,799
Enjoy your salon of sin
while the university destroys

288
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,516
the fifth most innovative prototype
in all of atmospheric science.

289
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:19,503
Whatever happened to priorities?

290
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:23,661
You're no scientist, Rusty Cartwright.

291
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,195
Did you see that? I think she smiled
at me. Maybe that's her.

292
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:43,279
She's definitely wasting
her time on him.

293
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:45,662
- Is that the mystery guy?
- I'm not telling you.

294
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:50,029
Remember me, Jen K? Crush baskets.

295
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,661
- Where'd you come from?
- Right over there.

296
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:55,261
I've been here for a while,
but I didn't want to interrupt.

297
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,577
Then I started to feel weird
just sitting there.

298
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,061
So I decided to say something.

299
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:00,744
Then I wasn't exactly sure what to say.

300
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:01,994
I'm gonna go get a refill.

301
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,477
How'd that crush basket thing turn out?

302
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,144
You delivered the crush baskets.

303
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,563
You must know who my secret admirer is.

304
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,430
No, I was just the messenger.

305
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,630
Why would you want to know anyway?
I'd rather have the secret.

306
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:20,947
I can imagine it's anybody I wanted,
not probably that weird guy

307
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,180
in my english class who blew on
my neck that one time.

308
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,014
That's if guys gave crush baskets.

309
00:14:25,218 --> 00:14:26,218
But they don't.

310
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:28,784
I think Calvin could use a hand
over there by the bar...

311
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,885
I can help!

312
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:34,751
No, it's fine.

313
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:46,162
I need your noise permit
for the Vesuvius party.

314
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:48,862
Are you yankin' me?
Since when does that rule get enforced?

315
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,128
Since I was hired.

316
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,903
I get it.

317
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,260
You look like you'd use a little break.

318
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:01,286
You wanna come on in and
we'll set you up with a nice cold beer?

319
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,252
That's what officer Bob always did.

320
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,902
Where is good old Bob anyway?

321
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,019
Rehab.

322
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,998
Your permit deadline was today,
0900 hours.

323
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:12,648
No permit, no party.

324
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:17,514
Although you could see if
the events office'll make an exception.

325
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:19,848
All you gotta do is ask Gladys.

326
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,361
Assemble my cougar sack.

327
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,194
Don't forget to put in the aftershave.

328
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:43,425
I said bring me my cougar sack!

329
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,208
I'm going in.

330
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,434
What perfect timing. I was just

331
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:04,534
trying on the dress I got
for your dad's dinner.

332
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:05,634
What do you think?

333
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,467
I was going for an Angelina Jolie thing.

334
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,484
You know, sexy for you,
charitable for your parents.

335
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:12,251
It's great.

336
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:14,934
Listen, Case, about dinner.

337
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:16,701
Is it too sexy? Too...

338
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:18,868
Angelina home wrecker,
not enough UN Ambassador?

339
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:21,451
It's perfect. It's not that, it's...

340
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,401
My parents just invited some bigwig
to sit at their table.

341
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:31,092
Something to do with political
connections that could help my dad.

342
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,558
Some, you know,

343
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,559
asset.

344
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,013
I feel like a total jerk,

345
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:40,246
they need your ticket.

346
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,780
My... ticket?

347
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,169
They need a seat at the table
for this...

348
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,168
person.

349
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:53,902
- I thought they liked me.
- They do.

350
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:56,868
They do like you. This is nothing
personal, it's just business.

351
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,110
When someone tells you
it's nothing personal,

352
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,509
- that means it's something personal.
- No, not with my parents.

353
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:03,809
You've gotta trust me.

354
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:06,126
This has nothing to do with you.

355
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,309
This is the way things work
in Chambersland.

356
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,226
Never miss an opportunity to network.

357
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,709
You can appreciate that, right?

358
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,408
Sure, I get it.

359
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,502
I'll call you as soon as I get back?

360
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,245
We're cool, right?

361
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:29,645
- Of course.
- Okay.

362
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:46,545
None of this makes any sense.

363
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:50,223
Listen to this.

364
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,790
"Golden wheat thin",
"crunchy little bite of God",

365
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,740
"with love I eat you."

366
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:56,823
I think that's a haiku.

367
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:59,905
I know it's a haiku, but it doesn't
help me build this stupid volcano.

368
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,680
Neither does a list

369
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:06,179
of the bra sizes of the 2005
Tri Pi pledge class.

370
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:09,013
Or drawings of different types
of monkeys.

371
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:12,446
Damn it!

372
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,257
Without this volcano

373
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:21,407
there'll be no party,

374
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:23,257
there's gonna be no secret admirer,

375
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,915
and then I'll never get a girlfriend.

376
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,949
You shouldn't be concentrating
on this anyway.

377
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:32,515
The module situation has gotten dire.

378
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,149
We're gonna stage an all-campus sit-in,

379
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,799
and I really hope to see you there.

380
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,686
"Crunchy little bite of God."

381
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:56,603
I'm glad it's you.

382
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,837
- I want to apologize for any part...
- Stop talking.

383
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,703
One-word answers... Is my sister here?

384
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,420
- Did she take her car?
- I think so.

385
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:04,820
Three words. Sorry.

386
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:05,937
What's wrong?

387
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:07,035
I need a car.

388
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:08,985
It's a matter of life and death.

389
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:11,285
- Social death.
- I have a car.

390
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:12,352
I can drive you.

391
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,068
I know I talk a lot, but
because I'm nervous around new people.

392
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:18,123
It gets a lot better once I get
to know a person.

393
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:19,483
And I'm a good driver.

394
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:21,766
And you seem really desperate.

395
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:27,016
I don't care if you're raising money
for children in Darfur,

396
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,157
request to assemble denied. Next!

397
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,485
Hello there, sunshine.

398
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:38,418
Is that old spice you're wearing?

399
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:39,835
Why? Yes, it is.

400
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:41,018
Ultra.

401
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:43,654
What do you want?

402
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,387
I was told you were a discerning woman.

403
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:48,470
A woman who appreciates the classics.

404
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,987
After so many years

405
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,120
wasted on callow young women who don't,

406
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:57,220
I decided to gather up my courage
and seek out a kindred spirit.

407
00:19:57,254 --> 00:19:59,204
That is what I want, Gladys.

408
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,054
That's a very jazzy jacket.

409
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,004
No one wears madras anymore.

410
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:13,437
More's the pity.

411
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,160
And might I say the same
about your lovely sweater?

412
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:18,044
Why did they stop putting
sequins on wool?

413
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,468
Can we please hurry things up?

414
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:21,835
Hold your water, pal!

415
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:27,701
After this I'm going on a fro-yo binge.

416
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:31,468
You are bummed about Evan screwing you
out of going to his dad's dinner.

417
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,651
I can cancel on Calvin, you need me.

418
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:36,968
I'm fine, Ash. And I told you.

419
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:41,001
He didn't screw me. It was
a business decision, nothing personal.

420
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:42,935
And I'm totally okay with it.

421
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:45,935
I'm more than okay... I'm good with it.

422
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,282
It was designed for Kate Hudson
to wear to the Golden Globes,

423
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:57,499
but she didn't have the guts
to fill it out.

424
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:58,715
Lucky me.

425
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:00,045
I get to wear it to the dinner.

426
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:02,101
What dinner?

427
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:03,635
The dinner for Evan's dad.

428
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:07,185
I guess a ticket just became available,
and they invited me.

429
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:08,618
Wasn't that sweet?

430
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,509
<i>There you are.

431
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,462
We're clothed, and we're eating.

432
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,612
I was also hoping we could talk.

433
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:32,879
Sorry I'm late. Major house drama.

434
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:34,696
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

435
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,460
- You told me to meet...
- Come join us.

436
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:46,632
"Some bigwig", Evan?!

437
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,782
Some bigwig is Rebecca Logan?!

438
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,799
How could you do this to me?!

439
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:53,084
Did you think I wouldn't find out?!

440
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,926
-  I hoped you wouldn't.
- It's like you cheated on me

441
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:56,942
all over again.

442
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,132
Listen to me. It's not like that at all.

443
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:02,425
Okay, I should have told you,
you're right. It's just...

444
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:06,492
I didn't think I could convince you
that it's not a big deal.

445
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,558
It's not a big deal, but now
you're making it a big deal,

446
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,849
so I guess it is a big deal,
even though it's not a big deal.

447
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,463
Are you trying to confuse me?

448
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:16,946
Because it's not going to work.

449
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,379
I am pissed.

450
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:19,663
I know.

451
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:23,779
So if this isn't a big deal, Evan,

452
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,996
why are you going,
and why is she going?!

453
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,330
Because her father is a senator,

454
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:31,472
my parents wanna make that connection,

455
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:33,905
and there is nothing
I can do about that.

456
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,066
It'll all be over in just a few hours.

457
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,050
That may not be soon enough.

458
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,432
I had such a good time
with you guys today.

459
00:22:58,815 --> 00:22:59,998
I just had the best idea.

460
00:23:00,065 --> 00:23:02,997
I am so gonna hook you up with
some hot Zeta Betas at Vesuvius tonight.

461
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:03,998
Won't that be awesome?

462
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:05,915
So meet me by the Kegs.

463
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,653
- See you guys at the party.
- Can't wait.

464
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,203
I'll see you at the party too?

465
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:14,453
You know what, I think I'm gonna pass.

466
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:16,153
Pass? On what?

467
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,791
Pass on this. Whatever this is.

468
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:20,674
This was supposed to be a date,

469
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:22,458
and so you recruited Ashleigh to bust in

470
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:23,991
so you wouldn't have to talk to me.

471
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:25,774
Not cool.

472
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:58,456
What are you doing?
You're supposed to wait in the car.

473
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:01,590
I couldn't, it's so exciting.
What is this place?

474
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,940
It's the basement for the engineering
building. They use it for storage.

475
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,356
But you have to leave.

476
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:09,740
I'm about to commit what could be
a serious breach of Homeland Security.

477
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,607
Rusty, this is the most fun I've had
since I got to this school.

478
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:15,540
I'd tell you the reasons why
you'd let me stay and help,

479
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,506
but then I'd be talking a lot again.
Like now...

480
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:20,240
So I can't tell you.

481
00:24:25,073 --> 00:24:28,790
I'm gonna steal the Remington/Herzog
atmospheric destabilizing module

482
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,723
to power the Vesuvius volcano.

483
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,173
If it works, the module will condense

484
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,056
all moisture in a 300-foot radius,

485
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:38,223
steam it up through the volcano
like a geyser.

486
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,623
It might even make a few thunderclaps.

487
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:44,890
- You're still interested?
- Thunderclaps?

488
00:24:58,188 --> 00:24:59,188
It's right up here.

489
00:25:06,995 --> 00:25:08,845
I won't let you take it, you beast.

490
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:12,328
Rusty, you came!

491
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,793
I had an idea.

492
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:20,543
To take this protesting
to the next level.

493
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:22,643
I'm listening.

494
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,760
It's not enough...

495
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:27,233
to just keep this module
from being destroyed.

496
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:28,433
What say we save it?

497
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:30,033
They keep it locked up,

498
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:33,216
untouched, never used, not even once.

499
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:34,883
I have dreamt of...

500
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:37,935
caressing its shiny aluminum shell.

501
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:40,652
I imagine it to be very...

502
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:42,952
very smooth.

503
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:46,685
And then after we touch it,

504
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:49,987
maybe we could just, I don't know,
take it somewhere.

505
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:51,187
Somewhere safe.

506
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,787
- And then...
- We could turn it on.

507
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,870
Rusty, lead me not into temptation.

508
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:58,528
I know, dale, I know.

509
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:00,262
But ask yourself this question.

510
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:01,860
What's the bigger evil,

511
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,710
committing an act of civil disobedience,

512
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:08,777
or allowing the fifth-most innovative
atmospheric prototype of all-time

513
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,974
to die a lonely, undignified death?

514
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:16,565
I have the key.

515
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:33,260
- Stop that.
- What?

516
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,210
Do you have any idea
how delicate the module is?

517
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:38,460
You can't just grab it
like a slab of beef.

518
00:26:38,461 --> 00:26:39,457
Move.

519
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:44,149
Hello, pretty girl.

520
00:26:45,732 --> 00:26:47,582
I hate the way they got you
all cooped up

521
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,940
- in this dirty crate.
- Dale, come on.

522
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:03,262
Run!

523
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:21,672
Rusty, I can't go to jail.

524
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:23,422
I have serious food allergies.

525
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,272
We're okay, Dale, no one followed us.

526
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:29,247
You said we were going somewhere safe.

527
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,014
The Kappa Tau house is not safe.

528
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:32,331
It's a filth palace,

529
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:34,897
and I won't go in there,
and neither is the module.

530
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:36,981
Think about it this way, Dale,

531
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:39,547
this is the last place
they'd think to look for it.

532
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:42,747
What about Jesus?

533
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:45,530
What about him?

534
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,197
Didn't Jesus walk amongst the sinners?

535
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,713
Think of all the people you'll have
an opportunity to convert.

536
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:16,890
Who's ready to start drinking?

537
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,496
The plan is we hook the volcano up
to the module's cooling system

538
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:40,079
to create the condensation effect.

539
00:28:41,113 --> 00:28:42,463
It's exactly as I'd imagined.

540
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:45,279
So let's get to work.

541
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:48,046
My secret admirer awaits.

542
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,634
I just wanted to apologize
for the whole Ashleigh thing.

543
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
I wanted to...

544
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:11,491
What's up, bro?

545
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,036
I thought this was just a fling.

546
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:31,270
You know? So when you wanted more,

547
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:32,839
it sort of freaked me out.

548
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,156
I just asked for one date.

549
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:42,912
<i>A gator?

550
00:29:46,612 --> 00:29:48,512
What I'm trying to say is

551
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:52,262
that it freaked me out
when you wanted a date.

552
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:56,727
What freaked me out more was
you blowing me off.

553
00:29:58,244 --> 00:30:02,061
And I realized that I really like you.

554
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:05,275
And I don't know what that means.

555
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:09,009
I would like to find out.

556
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,542
Should we get out of here?
Maybe check out the party?

557
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,959
You really think we can duck Ashleigh
all night long?

558
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,042
On second thought,
let's grab a cup of coffee.

559
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,520
So does fuchsia make me look hippy?

560
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Kinda.

561
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:51,476
Nice coconuts!

562
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,510
So why aren't you at the posh dinner
with his pomposity, Lord Chambers?

563
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,660
He went without me.

564
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,260
Apparently I'm not posh enough
for his parents.

565
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,636
Quintessential Chambers move.

566
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,003
Use the son to expand the evil empire.

567
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:12,453
And he went right along with it.

568
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:14,720
It's not like that.

569
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:16,620
Whatever it's like,

570
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:19,458
it's got you hitting wade's hula hooch
pretty hard.

571
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,041
Cheers.

572
00:31:25,608 --> 00:31:27,941
Calvin and Heath totally dissed me.

573
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,809
I can't find them anywhere.

574
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,742
Are you still moping over dumbhead Evan?

575
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,642
Just stop... Stop thinking about it.

576
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,076
Stop thinking about Rebecca
and her designer dress,

577
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:41,209
with her boobs busting out,

578
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:43,876
throwing herself all over Evan
as they dance or whatever.

579
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,826
His parents start writing
their wedding vows.

580
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:49,709
I wasn't thinking about that.

581
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,593
Now I am.

582
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,594
I can't get it out of my head.

583
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:55,960
Picture the audience in their underwear.

584
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,060
That's for stage fright.

585
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:00,444
This problem needs
to be tackled head-on.

586
00:32:00,944 --> 00:32:01,944
Where are we going?

587
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:03,188
To make sure that

588
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:06,072
Skank doesn't put her nasty hooks
into your boyfriend.

589
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:08,088
You are such a good friend.

590
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:11,172
David gets stoned with the philistines?

591
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,524
David smote the philistine with a stone,

592
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:18,724
not smoked with the philistines
and got stoned.

593
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:20,258
It's totally different.

594
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:23,574
You go to college?

595
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,417
Volcano all set?

596
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,667
All set.

597
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,650
Don't believe everything you read.

598
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:36,525
It's you.

599
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,658
I'm looking for my secret admirer.

600
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:41,155
She told me to wear this shirt.

601
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:42,408
Pretty funny?

602
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:43,875
Must be a nightshirt.

603
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,347
That was in your basket?

604
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:48,997
Along with a note that said
to meet her here.

605
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:53,313
No offense, Jen, but if she sees me
talking to you, she might...

606
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,330
Get the wrong idea.

607
00:32:56,152 --> 00:32:57,602
Okay, Rusty, there's something...

608
00:32:58,552 --> 00:32:59,585
That's not for you!

609
00:33:01,468 --> 00:33:02,635
Where did you get that shirt?

610
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:06,268
In my crush basket.

611
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,185
That was not your crush basket.
That was his.

612
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:14,868
I'm sorry, there must've been some sort

613
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:16,385
- of mix-up.
- Ya think?

614
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:19,481
I can explain.

615
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:22,831
<i>Gather 'round, party people,
and hold onto your legs.

616
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,498
<i>We're about to blow your mind!

617
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:30,550
<i>Courtesy of our little buddy,
the volcanic mastermind,

618
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,016
<i>Spitter himself,

619
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,216
<i>Rusty Cartwright!

620
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:40,119
<i>4, 3,

621
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,919
<i>2, 1.

622
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:17,012
That's a very generous offer.

623
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:19,795
I hear your summer internship program is
supposed to be top-notch.

624
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,020
Isn't it lovely you got to meet
Admiral Lewiston?

625
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,203
He's a big supporter of your father.

626
00:34:27,937 --> 00:34:29,570
Lovely is definitely the word.

627
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,103
There's Roger and Brenda.

628
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:32,203
Let's go.

629
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:38,266
I can tie a knot in this with my tongue.

630
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:40,632
Please don't.

631
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:47,321
This place needs DJ AM asap.

632
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:50,321
What did that old man just do
with his tongue?

633
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,088
I almost feel sorry for her.

634
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:55,821
- No, I don't.
- I can't see.

635
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:57,538
Stop that, you're shaking the plant!

636
00:34:57,837 --> 00:35:00,237
This was a really bad idea.
Evan's not even talking to her.

637
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:01,287
I should have trusted him.

638
00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:02,937
Let's get out before someone sees us.

639
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,387
Oh, crap, where's my phone?

640
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,787
Where's my phone?!

641
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,553
He's coming! Let's get out of here!

642
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:21,029
What are you doing here?

643
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:25,487
Oh God, can we just talk
about this later?

644
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,054
What is going on here?

645
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:32,407
Nice outfit.

646
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,740
Evan, please take care of this.

647
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:38,140
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Chambers.
- Excuse me,

648
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:39,823
I'm talking to my son.

649
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:41,890
You're not even supposed to be here!

650
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,674
Don't talk to her like that.

651
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:48,757
I'm sorry. Ash, let's go.

652
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:55,659
It's time to introduce your father.

653
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:59,043
It's all right,
everything's under control.

654
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,061
I put your name on my crush basket,

655
00:36:21,294 --> 00:36:23,627
but I didn't know about the note
and the shirt.

656
00:36:24,827 --> 00:36:25,827
Why would you do that?

657
00:36:27,544 --> 00:36:29,044
Because I felt bad for you.

658
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:31,661
That makes me feel a lot better.

659
00:36:31,727 --> 00:36:35,694
Thanks for taking pity on the most
pathetic pledge at Cyprus-Rhodes.

660
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,961
Now you are being pathetic.

661
00:36:38,004 --> 00:36:39,404
Then you just seemed,

662
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,637
unappreciated?

663
00:36:42,004 --> 00:36:43,520
So I appreciated you

664
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,937
in a really stupid way,

665
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,687
and I'm sorry.

666
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:49,404
I feel unappreciated too.

667
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,782
I had a great time with you today.

668
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:55,499
I haven't felt that comfortable
with a guy in, like...

669
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:57,666
ever.

670
00:36:57,808 --> 00:37:00,174
I thought that you were feeling
the same way about me too,

671
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:01,716
but then we get here, and

672
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:04,466
you couldn't wait to find
your stupid secret admirer.

673
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:08,099
Did you ever think that
you might have an un-secret-admirer?

674
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:14,437
You like me?

675
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:16,687
Duh.

676
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:34,101
Where's all the beer?

677
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:05,289
- I think I just felt the earth move.
- Me too.

678
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,389
No, seriously, I think
we're having an earthquake.

679
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:20,978
It's a miracle.

680
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:30,957
It's raining beer?!

681
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:34,073
It's raining beer!

682
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,197
It's beer.

683
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,947
I'm sorry, Lord.

684
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:51,801
You have just become a legend!

685
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:59,801
It worked just like you said it would.

686
00:38:59,802 --> 00:39:01,487
It need time to soak up
all the moisture.

687
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:03,234
I think we topped egyptian Joe.

688
00:39:03,284 --> 00:39:04,284
Hell yes!

689
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:22,411
Did you seriously skip just now?

690
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,128
Did you see the volcano?

691
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:28,411
I made it rain beer.

692
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:30,411
It was awesome. This has been,

693
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,682
hands down, the best night of my life.

694
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:36,965
Even better than the time they announced
Pluto wasn't a planet.

695
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:40,282
I hated Pluto.
It was obviously just a dwarf planet.

696
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,115
You're weird.

697
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,048
I guess I'm down here
on the "worst night of your life"

698
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:49,681
end of the spectrum
to balance things out.

699
00:39:57,883 --> 00:39:59,567
What did Evan do now?

700
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,817
This isn't about Evan.

701
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:05,800
It's about his parents...

702
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:07,483
and...

703
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,150
Evan.

704
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,617
The guy's a jerk.

705
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
You're better off without him.

706
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,377
Thanks for the support understanding.

707
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:20,494
I'll be sure to do the same for you
when you're dating someone.

708
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:24,027
I'll probably be too old
by that time to care.

709
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Start caring,

710
00:40:27,446 --> 00:40:29,463
because I just walked my date home.

711
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,963
A real date?

712
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:35,430
Okay, I'm sorry.

713
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:36,913
I feel like crap.

714
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:38,796
I got drunk...

715
00:40:40,246 --> 00:40:43,996
And made an ass of myself in front
of the esteemed Chambers clan.

716
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,311
You can call them esteemed,

717
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:51,828
but I'll always believe you deserve
better than Evan Chambers

718
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:56,895
Well, we agree on one thing, Rusty.

719
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:01,200
What are you doing here?

720
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:03,683
You want me to stay?

721
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,570
But thanks.

722
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:31,612
I'm sorry for crashing the party.

723
00:41:32,545 --> 00:41:34,078
And I think I accidentally

724
00:41:34,378 --> 00:41:36,078
flashed that Admiral guy.

725
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,128
Don't apologize.

726
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:41,424
It's not your fault, it's my fault.

727
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,440
I should've never put you
in that position.

728
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:45,624
Then why did you?

729
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:51,313
Because all my life

730
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,163
I have done what it takes

731
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,547
to get ahead. That is the Chambers way.

732
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:01,713
My life has been planned out
for me since I was...

733
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:05,246
Before I was born.

734
00:42:10,642 --> 00:42:13,192
You are the first person who's ever

735
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:14,542
made me think

736
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:15,859
that if I had to,

737
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:18,459
I would take a detour.

738
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:22,447
I would go all the way
off the map for you.

739
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:28,047
I don't want you to have
to take a detour for me.

740
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,658
Come on, let's stop at "I am so sorry."

741
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Wait a minute.

742
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,594
Did you leave the dinner early?

743
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:48,031
Won't your parents be pissed?

744
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,302
Definitely.
