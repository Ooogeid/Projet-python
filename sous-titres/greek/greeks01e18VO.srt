1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:03,297
- <i>Previously on</i> Greek...
- Not exactly what I had in mind.

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,440
I'm not interested
in being anyone's warm body.

3
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:09,539
- Casey, we need to talk.
- About what?

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,199
You still want to move back
the house?

5
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:12,237
Then do it.

6
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:14,787
You're officially off probation.
We're moving forward.

7
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:18,116
Cappie didn't tell you?
He's dating Rebecca Logan.

8
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:19,249
They're dating.

9
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:26,006
- We could put a hit on her.
- She regenerates like the Terminator.

10
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:28,871
I'll go tell her I'm an idiot.
I want her back.

11
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:31,428
I finally realized
no matter what I say or do,

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,847
I can't change the past
and I'm done trying.

13
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:37,518
- Finally ready to move on.
- What if I was less of a jealous idiot?

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,687
Then I'd think maybe
we could be friends.

15
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:42,296
- Friends?
- Think about it.

16
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,115
Ready to get your ass kicked?

17
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,043
Ready to kick yours actually.

18
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:56,789
Please. You dogs are all bark.

19
00:00:56,863 --> 00:00:59,142
- What did you call us?
- You heard me.

20
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,265
Care to make things
a little more interesting?

21
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:03,816
- Like a bet?
- Are you even allowed to?

22
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:06,792
Isn't gambling a gateway
behavior back to bitchery?

23
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,443
Well, you're the expert.

24
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,616
- So what are your terms?
- Losers are on laundry duty for a week.

25
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:17,030
What an amateur.
Losers are on bathroom duty...

26
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:19,409
Fraternity bathroom duty.

27
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,713
Sounds good.

28
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:23,409
Losers clean
their winning team's bathrooms.

29
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,410
We're on.

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,679
I forgot how good you are
when you're bad.

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,238
Don't be silly.
I've sworn off bad, remember?

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,462
ZBZ fest is our annual philanthropy
event in which every fraternity

33
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:38,583
at CRU competes for the ZBZ fest cup

34
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:42,163
as well as the title
of big cat on campus,

35
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:45,793
which was named after our famous
ZBZ mascot, PussyWillow the Cat.

36
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:47,349
Aside from bragging rights,

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,852
all of the money you raise through this
week's activities will go to charity.

38
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:54,284
And as your coach, I will
be guiding you through each event,

39
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:57,749
- which will test your...
- Talent, endurance, and athleticism.

40
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,403
That one should be easy for you guys.

41
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:07,512
As for the events, we have
the scratching post pole cross contest,

42
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:11,376
the kitty kennel phone-a-thon,
the sitting kitty seesaw sit.

43
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:14,475
And the crowning event of ZBZ fest,

44
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:17,128
the Mr. Purr-fect pageant.

45
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:20,232
And you guys know what that means.

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,166
Pick the brother
who looks best in a speedo.

47
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:27,268
Kidding.

48
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,936
Well, thank God.
'Cause I'm a thong man.

49
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:34,796
Where was I?

50
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:37,367
All right, the Mr. Purr-fect event...

51
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,691
Will be worth the most points.

52
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,519
- Are you guys even listening to me?
- That's so cool.

53
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,304
My mom taught me.

54
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:48,474
Hey, Rebecca, do you have a rubber band?

55
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,725
Cappie, they're not listening to me.

56
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,905
Guys. Come on. Let's show the lady
some respect, please.

57
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,704
Is there a problem, Rusty?

58
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:06,001
Then why did you roll your eyes?

59
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:07,635
It's like, the dust.

60
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,695
If that's the case, then I suggest you

61
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,874
and the pledges need
to keep the place cleaner.

62
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,133
Now for our first practice,
I've scheduled four hours of cardio.

63
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,684
Actually, I don't think
I'm gonna have enough time to compete

64
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:21,893
in the ZBZ fest thing because
I'm a polymer science major.

65
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:23,357
That's pretty time consuming.

66
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:25,417
Participation is mandatory for pledges.

67
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:26,797
She's right, Spitz.

68
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:29,660
Besides, weren't you just bragging
to the guys that you're so far ahead

69
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:32,741
in your classes that you're reading
Stephen Hawking for fun?

70
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,299
That's right.
You said that.

71
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,780
I remember,
'cause I told Wade you were such a tool.

72
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:39,116
- I did say that.
- So what's the problem?

73
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,273
There's no problem.

74
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:42,829
No problem here.

75
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,256
There's no problem.

76
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,532
Season 1 - Episode 18
" <i>Mr. Purr-fect</i> "

77
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,472
- Synchro :
Kasius  &  <i>¤AkaZab¤</i>

78
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,270
- Transcript : <i>Swsub.com</i>

80
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:22,159
Please, can we...

81
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,351
Fine. Do them girl style.

82
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:28,040
But no more drinks-named-after-
body-parts nights during training!

83
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:30,813
But the fuzzy navels were so... fuzzy.

84
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,293
Let this sink in take a hit

85
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,092
you'll be cleaning up our...

86
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:43,221
Shape up or a total drinking ban.

87
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:45,673
I mean, no wonder no one
wanted to coach you guys.

88
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,326
And where is everyone else?

89
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:50,008
Well, we're not that good
at getting places...

90
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,013
On time.

91
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,466
Well, someone in the house
needs to make sure you are.

92
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,104
I need an assistant.
Someone responsible.

93
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:59,932
- I know who'd be perfect.
- Who?

94
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,521
Spitter, of course.
He's responsible.

95
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,577
- Rusty's a polymer science major.
- I'm a...

96
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:07,454
- It's a really time consuming major.
- Thank you.

97
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:10,810
- Just trying to help you out.
- Obviously, you don't like each other.

98
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,760
- Good. We're all on the same page.
- Not good. I'll pick someone else.

99
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:17,297
- I want you two to like each other.
- Cap, it's not going to happen.

100
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:18,632
He's Casey's brother.

101
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:21,314
And he's the creepy perv
who keeps "accidentally"

102
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:24,096
walking in on me during intimate
moments and then judging me.

103
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:27,683
She shouldn't be doing such{\ judgment } provoking
things if she doesn't want to be judged.

104
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,602
- See, the perfect impasse.
- The perfect opportunity

105
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:33,230
for two of my favorite people
to learn to get along.

106
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:35,148
You have a lot in common.

107
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:38,078
You both like green peppers and...
wait...

108
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,403
Olives on your pizza.

109
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,261
I've seen you both trip on the step
of that history building.

110
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,880
- This is a match made in heaven.
- Try hell.

111
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:47,368
Look, you both...
You both think alike already.

112
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:49,304
I love it.
Here. Embrace.

113
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,935
Get back to work!
Beaver, who told you...<i></i>

114
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:56,795
You're all wet.

115
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:00,473
Listen...

116
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,200
we need to talk, right?

117
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:05,993
I mean, about what happened.

118
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,682
- I was drunk...
- You know me better than that, Evan.

119
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:13,625
Yes, it was a drunken mistake.
And we'll never speak of it again.

120
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,060
Good.

121
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Great.

122
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,589
This may sound hard to believe
after everything that's happened,

123
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:25,705
but I'd actually like
for us to be friends.

124
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:29,931
And as your friend, I wouldn't let
one little kiss jeopardize...

125
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:32,293
anything.

126
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,570
Nice hustle.

127
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:47,471
Now I get why you accidentally forgot
the downstairs dryer shrinks everything.

128
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:54,019
I love new crushes.
New crushes are so fun.

129
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:55,444
They're also scary.

130
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:58,182
New crushes lead to new dates,
which lead to new relationships,

131
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:01,715
- which led to new breakups, which...
- Just stop overthinking it.

132
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:04,292
Just enjoy the totally hot guy

133
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:06,448
who's totally staring at you right now.

134
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,648
Maybe this is fun.

135
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:14,956
I wish you were our coach.

136
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,425
I know Frannie's supposedly nice now,

137
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:21,432
but I still catch an underlying whiff
of evil every time she walks by.

138
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,992
Well, she called you
guys first fair and square.

139
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:26,069
And I am perfectly
happy as spirit chair.

140
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,444
I am not shout-y enough for coaching.

141
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:32,325
It's Michael! My french TA.
Didn't I tell you about him?

142
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,074
He's gay.
Well, I think.

143
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:37,196
- You guys would be so cute together.
- Why?

144
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:40,247
Because we're the only
two gay guys that you know?

145
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,803
You got it all wrong.
I only think that he's gay.

146
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:44,254
I don't really know.

147
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:47,566
But would a straight
guy go to axanadusing-along?

148
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,500
I wouldn't date a guy that
went to axanadusing-along anyway.

149
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:52,727
- So I think I'll pass.
- Michael!

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,748
This is Calvin.
Remember, I was telling you about him?

151
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,994
Calvin's been to France too.
Michael just got back from France.

152
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,084
- So, how was France?
- It was nice.

153
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,454
I went to some lectures.
I saw some art.

154
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:10,332
- How was it when you went?
- I was nine.

155
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,014
I had escargot and
then threw up in the elevator

156
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:15,582
of the Eiffel Tower and started crying.

157
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:17,623
Me too.

158
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:21,731
You should get coffee,
talk more about France.

159
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,400
Well, we are both gay.

160
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,490
So you are gay.

161
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:26,942
I knew it.

162
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:28,905
So how about it?

163
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:31,505
Sure. Why not?

164
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:42,130
Can't move my arms.

165
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:44,623
I can't lift beer.

166
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:50,288
Yes, and does that include
the exfoliating... cuticle...

167
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,947
Scrub...

168
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,289
And paraffin... dip?

169
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,394
Yes, I also need...

170
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
wax.

171
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:05,483
The non-eyebrow kind.

172
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:09,982
Thank you. Bye.

173
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:12,536
Ridiculous.

174
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:16,885
How my scheduling Rebecca's grooming
appointments helps us win ZBZ fest?

175
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,497
I don't know.
Wait. What did she say?

176
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:23,018
She said she needed to focus
entirely on our training schedule.

177
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,879
That's it. I'm gonna talk to Cappie.
Straighten this out.

178
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:29,514
Don't you want me
to get her off our backs?

179
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,611
I'm gonna tell Cappie
what a pain she's being.

180
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,375
Dude, are you crazy?
You talk about breaking the guy code.

181
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,328
What's that?
Bros before hos?

182
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,374
Bros before hos is...
It's just a motto.

183
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:45,649
All right,
the guy code is practically written law.

184
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:49,534
Is it you have to protect your friends
from their evil girlfriends?

185
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,585
It's that you have to accept
your bro's girlfriend

186
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,629
even if you can't stand her
or know she's wrong for him.

187
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,495
Guys who are whipped do not
tolerate criticism of their girls.

188
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,084
Unless the girl in question
is putting your bro in mortal danger,

189
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:07,054
you smile and schedule
her waxing appointments.

190
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,444
That's it?

191
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,419
And hope they break up soon.

192
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,373
Will you pour this beer in my mouth?

193
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,536
Too bad you're not our coach.

194
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,141
You led us to a decisive victory
last year.

195
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:46,636
That's true.
How's it looking this year?

196
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,449
Well, I know about the bet.

197
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:52,805
So don't try to get any
inside information from me.

198
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,271
No, but seriously, though.

199
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,868
It would be nice to have you
hanging around again.

200
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:00,819
I figured it was time
to try something different.

201
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,498
But it is...
weird not being around.

202
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:09,411
So you said you'd like us
to try being friends.

203
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:13,735
Well, I got to thinkin',
and I don't see why not.

204
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:17,002
You know,
'cause we're over each other,

205
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:19,701
obviously we're not angry
at each other any more.

206
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:21,796
Seems like a perfect...

207
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:27,647
Fancy meeting you here, coach.

208
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,891
I'm so glad I ran into you.
I have this really great idea.

209
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,969
Hang on. I can't divulge
this in front of the enemy.

210
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:41,222
Sorry, you know I can't lose that bet.

211
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,609
I'm glad we talked.
I'll see you later.

212
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:49,350
Come on, Shane.

213
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,101
I can't want to tell you
what I came up with.

214
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,748
It's hot.

215
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,045
Do you want me to blow on it
until it cools off?

216
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,813
I'm saying that I wanted an iced latte.

217
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,238
You didn't say iced.

218
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:18,095
- I think I did.
- You didn't.

219
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:20,261
I have a photographic
and highly detailed memory.

220
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:23,023
Well, if you're so smart,
why couldn't you figure out

221
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:25,308
that it's too hot out today for a latte?

222
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:27,713
- Well, if you weren't such a...
- Yes?

223
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:32,649
Dedicated coach, you would
have time to worry about lattes.

224
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:36,174
But you don't.
So I'm gonna go get you another one.

225
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:37,835
Good.

226
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:41,294
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

227
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:44,489
<i>This is the final heat
of the ZBZ fest scratching post.</i>

228
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:47,946
<i>Once again, whoever makes it
across the pole first wins.</i>

229
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,688
<i>Your arms and legs must
be touching the pole at all times.</i>

230
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,962
<i>And as a reminder,</i>

231
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:58,668
<i>lewd pole jokes were
maybe funny the first time,</i>

232
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:02,888
<i>mildly amusing the second.
But by the sixth, it was just sad.</i>

233
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,619
<i>On your marks,</i>

234
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:07,253
<i>get set...</i>

235
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:25,402
<i>Beaver, if you win this, I'll let you
make out with me for one minute!</i>

236
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:38,856
We did it.

237
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:41,221
Don't worry.

238
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:43,694
This is just one battle.

239
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:45,368
The war is ours.

240
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:47,712
Absolutely.

241
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,765
Rebecca told me to tell you all

242
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,729
that she can't even look at you
right now.

243
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,822
She said something about Beaver too,
but I'm not gonna repeat that here.

244
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,885
She went to type up
a new training schedule.

245
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:11,393
We're all supposed
to think about our shame.

246
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,734
That was her.
I have to go.

247
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:29,031
She's taking this
a little too seriously, huh?

248
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:30,934
Went a little too far.
Guys?

249
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:36,837
- Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, it's cute when she does it.

250
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:38,880
Yeah. Like like a kitten.

251
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,330
Seriously?

252
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,738
What could be better than a hot
chick orderin'around a bunch of guys?

253
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:45,573
Even I think that's hot.

254
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:48,255
Well, I guess she is kind of like a...

255
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,929
Sexy Bobby knight.

256
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:53,289
- Exactly.
- So we're all cool then?

257
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:55,463
All right, well...

258
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:57,242
Dobler's?

259
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,226
You are the only other person
I know who doesn't like cheese.

260
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:05,134
Everyone I know thinks it's weird.

261
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:08,157
I'm not gonna judge
you on your cheese-lessness.

262
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,373
Speaking of judging,
did you watch ANTM Last night?

263
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:13,903
America's next top model?

264
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,335
As in...

265
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:19,857
I have two beautiful girls
standing before me.

266
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,902
One of them wants this
more than anything in the world,

267
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,804
but has no personality.

268
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:27,782
The other one takes beautiful pictures,

269
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:31,696
- but is plus-sized.
- Nice Tyra.

270
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:35,488
It's been a while.

271
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,875
I... haven't watched
since I started pledging.

272
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,588
Why not?
It's better than ever.

273
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:43,987
- Really?
- Owens, nice work on the pole today.

274
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:45,744
Work on the pole?

275
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:49,638
- What have I missed?
- It's just a ZBZ fest thing.

276
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:54,216
- You catch Cavaliers game last night?
- Man, how sweet was that three-pointer?

277
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:55,476
Lebron is the man.

278
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:59,314
So, I'll catch you
guys back at the house.

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,188
I'm so sorry.
I should've introduced you.

280
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:09,239
Hey, you're under no obligation.

281
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,695
So that's how you want it tonight?

282
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,873
Stay away from me.

283
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:27,634
This usually works a lot better
when we're not far from each other.

284
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:30,021
You're in training.
You need to save up some stamina.

285
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,059
So no sex.

286
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,473
I'll have you know,
I have a surplus of stamina.

287
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:37,685
Okay, I think you're taking
this training thing a bit too far.

288
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:39,659
I haven't heard any complaints.

289
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,328
They've all been really nice to me.

290
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,612
I think they know
it's in the spirit of competion.

291
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:46,736
And if they're not complaing, then as
their leader, you shouldn't be either.

292
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:50,678
- True.
- So I was thinking...

293
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:53,933
- We try some role playing.
- Now you're talkin'.

294
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,248
Let me get the costumes.
What do you think?

295
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,772
Business woman or lost german tourist?

296
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,290
The kitty kennel event is tomorrow.

297
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,141
So how about you practice
asking for donations,

298
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,589
I'll play reluctant donor
on the other end of the line.

299
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:14,806
This isn't a 900 number
by any chance, is it?

300
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:22,954
Got a delivery.

301
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:27,901
Hey, there's a sorority house next door.

302
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,571
Calvin Owens?

303
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:34,251
That's sweet...

304
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:36,432
That a dude sent you flowers.

305
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,929
That looks like,
baby's breath over there.

306
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,764
Definitely baby's breath.

307
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,145
I wonder why they call it that.

308
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,377
I haven't seen you this perky
since we tried those push-up bras.

309
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:03,303
Well, it's fun being a coach.

310
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,084
Especially coaching a bunch of guys
who are totally angst-free

311
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,065
and have no desire to discuss
the status of our relationship.

312
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,529
It's refreshing.
We should mix with those guys more.

313
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,240
Guys or guy?

314
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:17,200
'Cause I think you want
a one-on-one mixer with Shane.

315
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:20,093
I ran into Evan the other day.

316
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,313
Not Evan.
Fun, new guy. Fun, new guy!

317
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,796
And seeing Evan only made me
realize how much I need a fun, new guy.

318
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,926
But I do think Evan and I are
actually going to be able to be friends.

319
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,179
So what's Shane's major?

320
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,951
That's the best part.
Who knows and who cares?

321
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:43,708
All I know is I'm no longer
majoring in Cappie or Evan.

322
00:18:54,486 --> 00:18:56,772
Yeah. No, thank you very much, ma'am.

323
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,123
That's a very, very generous donation.

324
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:03,915
Okay, I'm done.

325
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,355
Wow. $300 in 15 minutes?

326
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,488
You work fast.

327
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:15,298
- Let me out, please.
- Someone is sensitive.

328
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,430
Care to share?

329
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:19,175
With you?

330
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,933
Let me guess.
It's a Casey issue?

331
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:25,730
Let me guess again.

332
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,356
I'm the last person
you want to talk to about Casey.

333
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,155
I get it.
It's okay.

334
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,711
Good work today.

335
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,200
Hey, Frannie, I'm sorry.

336
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:38,157
Okay, it's not you.
I'm just...

337
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:43,321
Casey wants us to be friends, right?

338
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:45,623
I said I was onboard,
but I don't think I am at all.

339
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,511
I don't know.

340
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,305
I don't know.
It feels like it might be too late now.

341
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:56,156
So guess I just gotta accept
the fact that we weren't meant to be.

342
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,616
- I don't believe in that.
- Believe in...

343
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,747
Meant to be.
Fate. Destiny.

344
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:04,131
All that powerless crap.

345
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:06,856
Evan, fate is for poor people.

346
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:09,293
Otherwise we wouldn't
have a state lottery.

347
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:12,114
You're more in control than you think.

348
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:14,660
Or at least you could be.

349
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:18,025
Give yourself a little more credit.
Start using what you've got.

350
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:19,272
Because...

351
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:22,676
You've got
a lot.

352
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,105
Hello. My name is Rusty Cartwright.

353
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:32,602
And I am a student at
Cyprus-Rhodes University.

354
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,934
Today, in association with the Zeta...

355
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,178
Hello?

356
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:39,624
They hung up again.

357
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:40,768
Yeah,

358
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:44,052
well, I'd hang up on you too
the way you drone on.

359
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:45,175
I'm not droning.

360
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,418
- You're dronin'.
- I'm reading what's on the script.

361
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,161
You need to loosen up your delivery.
Get off the page.

362
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,366
Think outside the box.
Relax.

363
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:54,912
Relax. Relax. Relax!

364
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:56,534
Give me your script.

365
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,208
Stop staring and make a call.

366
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:08,299
You've been in there for over
an hour and have only raised

367
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:09,658
$2!

368
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:11,943
Everyone else is done.

369
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,554
Hi.

370
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:18,869
Hi, little girl.

371
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:21,994
Is your mommy home?

372
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,463
No?

373
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,377
You're all by yourself?

374
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:28,039
Because I need a special favor.

375
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,907
Hang up.

376
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:30,958
Are you crying?

377
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,985
- Don't cry. No, that's. It's okay. No.
- Hang up. Hang up!

378
00:21:34,116 --> 00:21:35,071
Hang up!

379
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:38,447
God, Rusty, you're trying to get them
to donate money, not get in your van!

380
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:42,194
Did Casey ask you to throw
this so that I'd lose the bet?

381
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,200
You know what?
Forget it!

382
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,499
Okay. You're done.

383
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,733
I think I'm gonna stay
in here a few more minutes.

384
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:01,602
Why? Do I scare you?

385
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:04,839
Okay, Rebecca,
I don't think you realize

386
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:08,005
- how harshly you come across.
- Spitter, no.

387
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:11,241
And I don't think harshness
would be necessary if you could do

388
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:12,509
just one thing right.

389
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:15,273
I don't think I need lessons
in competence from someone who can't

390
00:22:15,393 --> 00:22:17,846
even get a boyfriend without
stealing one from my sister.

391
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:20,804
Please give me dating advice, Mr. Jen K.

392
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:23,720
Good luck!

393
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Rusty!

394
00:22:26,837 --> 00:22:27,604
Hey, Cap.

395
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:30,094
Hey, what's going on?
Rusty seemed upset.

396
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,136
Did

397
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:32,634
Rebecca do something?

398
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,871
No. No.
It's not Rebecca.

399
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,801
Rusty's upset because of...

400
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:39,045
Science.

401
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:41,389
- Science.
- Yeah.

402
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,441
He found out that the guy
that invented gravity just died.

403
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:47,141
Isn't that sad?

404
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:50,358
Beav, Isaac Newton

405
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:51,855
has been dead for like

406
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:53,993
300 years.

407
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:55,454
Really?

408
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:59,302
Guess Rusty's not
as smart as we thought.

409
00:23:12,177 --> 00:23:14,395
- Office hours are over, but...
- Flowers.

410
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,264
You didn't like the arrangement?

411
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,175
I didn't like you trying
to embarrass me to prove a point.

412
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:22,795
I'm sorry.
All right?

413
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:25,423
I should've introduced
you to my brothers and I didn't.

414
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:28,116
Calvin, I send flowers
to guys I like sometimes.

415
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:30,104
I'm sorry it bothered your fraternity

416
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:31,553
- brothers.
- It didn't.

417
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:34,035
They were perfectly fine
with it because they're my friends.

418
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:35,215
So what's the problem?

419
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:37,643
The problem is they're
fraternity guys, okay?

420
00:23:37,737 --> 00:23:39,916
They're not supposed to
be nice about things like that.

421
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:42,551
If I were any other guy,
they would have made fun of me.

422
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:45,082
You know, and then they would've
made me clean the toilet

423
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:48,311
with my toothbrush like any other
self-respecting fraternity guy would.

424
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:51,624
Well, my bathroom's a mess.
You're welcome to it.

425
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:54,685
Actually, my bathroom is pristine

426
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,763
and filled with high
quality beauty products

427
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,856
just like any other
self-respecting gay guy's.

428
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:00,966
Is that okay with you?

429
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:03,733
Look,
can we both agree

430
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:06,522
that before I sent you flowers,

431
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:08,735
we kind of liked each other?

432
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:11,120
Agreed.

433
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:13,130
In that case,
I'm gonna be at the gay

434
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,011
and lesbian short film festival
tomorrow with some friends.

435
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:17,962
I would love to see you there.

436
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:24,219
So, Spitter, how many Pi Sigma Thetas
does it take to screw in a light bulb?

437
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:26,577
I don't know, Cap.

438
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:27,871
How many?

439
00:24:28,237 --> 00:24:31,644
Silly Spitter, those pretty boys
could never screw in a light bulb.

440
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:34,545
Their hands are too slippery
from all the hair gel residue.

441
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,547
What's my line?
Just tell me. What is it? I'll get it.

442
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:44,821
Cap, you know you're my Mr. Perfect.

443
00:24:45,545 --> 00:24:46,481
Thanks, babe.

444
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,177
But you don't have a shot in hell
of winning the Mr. Purr-fect pageant.

445
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:50,784
Not with Rusty in your routine.

446
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:54,089
I have to take a walk
and think about a new approach.

447
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:55,899
I suggest you two practice.

448
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:57,758
No matter how futile it is.

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,254
I can't take this anymore.

450
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:04,880
I have to tell you something.

451
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:08,997
Do we need to take this upstairs?

452
00:25:09,162 --> 00:25:10,098
Right.

453
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,512
I know this is gonna be hard for
you to hear, but you have to hear it.

454
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:19,132
Is it that my girlfriend's
driving you crazy?

455
00:25:20,677 --> 00:25:22,377
And that she's taking this competition

456
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:24,522
way too seriously
and tormenting everyone?

457
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:25,361
Exactly.

458
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,673
And that she's emasculating
you beyond belief?

459
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,534
Yes.
Yes!

460
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,650
Thank God.

461
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:36,461
You guys kept saying
that you were fine with her, and I

462
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,273
thought I was going crazy. Why
didn't you come to me about this sooner?

463
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,760
Well, it was the.

464
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:42,537
- The guy code.
- The g...

465
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:44,700
Good lord.

466
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:50,370
Do you know how many lives
have been lost to the guy code?

467
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,337
How much manly dignity?

468
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:55,090
That thing needs to be
overturned before it's too late.

469
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:56,284
Yeah, well, you

470
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:58,556
- Wade and Beaver kept telling me.
- Wade and B...

471
00:25:58,706 --> 00:26:01,762
Wade spent an entire semester

472
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:03,963
with a very thin mustache
thanks to the guy code.

473
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,363
And Beaver, Beaver almost
became a Canadian citizen.

474
00:26:07,588 --> 00:26:10,726
It's a very dangerous,
antiquated statute, Spitter.

475
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:13,092
Does this mean you're
gonna dump Rebecca?

476
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:14,916
No. Of course not.

477
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:16,713
It means we're gonna help her.

478
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:17,948
She needs us.

479
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:19,622
- Us?
- Yes, us.

480
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:21,941
I can't do this alone.
Here's what I got in mind.

481
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:30,109
So how long has it been?

482
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:34,221
About...
four hours

483
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,162
and...

484
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,438
something.

485
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,257
Wow. That's $100 raised already.

486
00:26:39,508 --> 00:26:41,752
It's a good thing this is for charity.

487
00:26:41,872 --> 00:26:43,670
I'd have to charge
you for the butt chafing.

488
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,142
I don't have anything
in here to help that.

489
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:49,428
But I did bring lots of snacks.

490
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,895
And...

491
00:26:52,636 --> 00:26:55,294
Because everything's
better set to music, right?

492
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,702
And some hot cocoa
to keep you warm.

493
00:27:00,914 --> 00:27:02,490
I'm suspicious.

494
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:05,647
None of the other guys
got treats on their shifts.

495
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:08,909
Are you favoring me inappropriately?

496
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:11,272
- Of course not.
- Are you sure?

497
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:14,896
My favoring you is totally appropriate.

498
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,262
So, what's up with
you and Chambers anyway?

499
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:27,843
- You guys still broken up, or...
- Evan and I are just friends.

500
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,776
That's good to hear.

501
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:35,134
It's good to hear that
you think that's good...

502
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:37,793
To hear.

503
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:47,661
I guess we'll have to take a rain check.

504
00:27:47,947 --> 00:27:48,715
Yeah.

505
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:51,274
I guess so.

506
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,578
Which one?

507
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,477
Yeah. Cocoa.

508
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:59,106
Thanks.
Thank you for the snacks.

509
00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:01,189
Bye.

510
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:04,000
- Rain check.
- Rain check.

511
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:05,467
Bring an umbrella.

512
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:14,073
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

513
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:17,083
<i>I'm Casey Cartwright, ZBZ President.</i>

514
00:28:17,203 --> 00:28:20,273
<i>And this is the Mr. Purr-fect pageant.</i>

515
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:25,560
<i>Our top five qualifying teams
will compete in this,</i>

516
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,912
<i>the final ZBZ fest event.</i>

517
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:31,444
<i>As you can see from the scores,
tonight will decide the winner.</i>

518
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:34,422
<i>I know I'm biased,
but I have to say I'm</i>

519
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:36,539
<i>pretty confident in my team's chances.</i>

520
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:44,176
<i>Settle down.</i>

521
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:46,280
<i>Although I do appreciate
all your team spirit,</i>

522
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:48,601
<i>let's kick off the night
with the interview portion.</i>

523
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,763
<i>First up from this lovely
collection of gentlemen</i>

524
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:54,987
<i>is Seth Lubinecki, mr. Psi Phi Pi.</i>

525
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:59,706
<i>Please tell me the person who
has influenced you the most and why?</i>

526
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:07,108
<i>I admire Mr. Bill Gates</i>

527
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,021
<i>for several reasons.</i>

528
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:12,165
<i>The least of which
is his personal net worth.</i>

529
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:18,242
Hey, Ash.

530
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:21,134
What are you doing here?
I thought you had a date with Michael.

531
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:22,549
No. It wasn't a date.

532
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:24,767
No. And I decided not to go.

533
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:27,092
What? I thought you liked him.

534
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:31,260
Ash, have you ever been to a gay movie?

535
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:33,491
- Does <i>The devil wears Prada</i> count?
- No.

536
00:29:33,884 --> 00:29:37,210
No, I'm talking about an earnest
coming of age film where some young kid

537
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,288
in Idaho cuts himself while
listening to erasure

538
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:41,493
and then

539
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,488
comes out to his preacher father who
beats him and locks him in a closet.

540
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,558
- That's depressing.
- Exactly.

541
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:51,212
I mean, why does everything have
to be about being gay when you're gay?

542
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:54,981
I'd rather just go see a homoerotic
action movie with the brothers.

543
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:58,161
Calvin, you like Michael, right?

544
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,474
I think so.

545
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:04,466
<i>That Mr. Gates is a dedicated
member of the boy scouts of America.</i>

546
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:06,287
<i>As am I.</i>

547
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,462
<i>Eagle scout with the silver palm.</i>

548
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:13,589
You know what, let's go together.

549
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:15,615
It can't be more depressing than this.

550
00:30:15,853 --> 00:30:19,222
And I need to find a crowd that
appreciates my suede slouchy boots.

551
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,615
<i>That's my boy!</i>

552
00:30:52,405 --> 00:30:53,827
<i>Go, Evan!</i>

553
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,650
Knock 'em dead.
I know you will.

554
00:31:00,923 --> 00:31:01,878
Thanks.

555
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:07,946
Hey. Sounded like the crowd
really liked you out there.

556
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:09,743
Thank God.
That is a relief.

557
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:11,908
Because, you know,
if law school doesn't pan out,

558
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:14,852
I've always had this secret
desire to be a swimsuit model.

559
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,138
I knew it.

560
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:18,074
- It's so weird that I knew that.
- Really?

561
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,833
- You did know that.
- Totally did.

562
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:22,098
There he is.
Mr. Purr-fect.

563
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:23,517
Don't you think?

564
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:25,464
You know what I think?

565
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,568
I think I've got this one in the bag.

566
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,501
Come on.
Let's go make some magic.

567
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:46,554
<i>Thank you!
Thank you very much.</i>

568
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,868
<i>And a special thanks
to my lovely assistant.</i>

569
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:51,346
<i>She's a rare beauty.</i>
<i>Jeff.</i>

570
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:05,946
I can't believe you forgot
to bring timmy the snake.

571
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:09,143
Wrapping him around Rusty's
neck was the highlight of the act.

572
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:10,466
Don't worry.

573
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:12,707
I've got something special up my sleeve.

574
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:15,874
Well, you better if
you ever want me to...

575
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:19,029
Ever
again.

576
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:21,718
Don't you think that's a bit harsh?

577
00:32:21,949 --> 00:32:24,077
Don't worry.
Give me a kiss.

578
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:27,269
I'm gonna go make you proud.
Rus, come on. Rus?

579
00:32:33,204 --> 00:32:34,323
<i>And now</i>

580
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:37,521
<i>a little something from Shakespeare's
lesser known works...</i>

581
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,435
Troilus and Cressida.

582
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,573
Thought you were small.

583
00:32:56,668 --> 00:32:57,754
Okay.

584
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,508
<i>Time hath, my Lord,
a wallet at his back</i>

585
00:33:05,938 --> 00:33:07,678
<i>wherein he puts alms...</i>

586
00:33:09,543 --> 00:33:10,535
<i>To oblivion.</i>

587
00:33:11,192 --> 00:33:13,042
<i>A great-sized monster of...</i>

588
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,551
<i>Ingratitudes?</i>

589
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:21,003
<i>Those scraps are of good deeds past, </i>

590
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,908
<i>which are devoured
as fast as they are made...</i>

591
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:26,048
<i>- You suck!
- Forgotten as soon as done.</i>

592
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:27,984
<i>Perseverance, dear my Lord.</i>

593
00:33:28,104 --> 00:33:29,104
<i>Perseverance...</i>

594
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,017
<i>Dear my Lord.</i>

595
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:36,568
What the hell was that?

596
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:39,128
Shakespeare. He's one
of the greatest authors and writers.

597
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:40,800
- Could Spitter. Spitter.
- Seriously?

598
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:42,671
Can you please?
Thank you.

599
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,809
Cappie, I know you did that on purpose.

600
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,363
What are you doing?

601
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,115
I'm saving our relationship.

602
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:55,988
By making me lose a bet to your
ex and scrub hepatis-ridden toilets?

603
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,239
Yes. Exactly.

604
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:59,090
- Have you lost your mind?
- No.

605
00:33:59,525 --> 00:34:02,169
You did. I don't know if it was
competing with Casey or what,

606
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,809
but something made you
crazy this week with me,

607
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:08,095
with Rusty, with all the brothers
who are my friends.

608
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:10,424
And guy code version 2.0 requires me

609
00:34:10,477 --> 00:34:12,555
to respect my friends
when I'm in a relationship.

610
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:14,251
You lost it.

611
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:15,538
And for what?

612
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:17,611
Bragging rights over who
looks better in a swimsuit?

613
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:20,092
Since when did you care about
collegiate amateur pageantry?

614
00:34:20,203 --> 00:34:22,131
You're Rebecca freakin'Logan!

615
00:34:24,597 --> 00:34:26,413
- My God.
- Please don't hit me.

616
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:53,628
Yeah.

617
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:56,192
Look at him.
He's so cute.

618
00:34:56,337 --> 00:34:58,107
And he has amazing eyes.

619
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:04,903
I guess I just wish this particular
gay guy were a little less...

620
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:06,932
- gay.
- Why?

621
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:10,074
Because you're worried about
what other people might think?

622
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:11,380
Like your brothers?

623
00:35:11,874 --> 00:35:13,107
From what you said,

624
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,479
the only thing they're guilty of

625
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,789
is being nice when you got some flowers.

626
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:20,897
So I guess the only problem here is me.

627
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:23,298
- Breakthrough.
- And I should just...

628
00:35:23,684 --> 00:35:25,144
Just get out of my own way.

629
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:26,697
Yes.

630
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:28,064
And?

631
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:30,061
And...
and...

632
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:32,830
I should go watch
some earnest vignettes

633
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,082
with a guy with amazing eyes.

634
00:35:36,158 --> 00:35:37,337
It's a start.

635
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,719
And now

636
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:49,273
the results

637
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:53,182
verified by the accounting firm of
Zeta Beta Zeta's own accounting major,

638
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:54,441
Ivy.

639
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,605
The winner is...

640
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:05,093
Shane!

641
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,112
Which means the Lambda Sigs
are the winners of ZBZ fest.

642
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,021
Man.

643
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:25,699
I couldn't have done it without you.

644
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:28,668
Please, I think your fire
juggling sealed the deal.

645
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:30,697
And you were my muse.

646
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,530
Are you saying I'm inflammatory?

647
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:36,744
I'm saying I'd like to take
you out for a celebratory drink.

648
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:38,134
You know,

649
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,137
elsewhere.

650
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:41,856
I accept.

651
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:46,360
Let me go gloat for a minute
and I'll see you outside.

652
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:48,099
- Okay.
- Okay.

653
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:50,998
Hey, Frannie.

654
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:53,996
'Scuse me. Hey.

655
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,789
Congratulations, man.

656
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:58,213
- Best man won.
- Yeah.

657
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:00,234
Too bad there's no prize money.

658
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:02,893
See ya.

659
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:05,930
Shane.

660
00:37:06,385 --> 00:37:07,602
Hey, Shane.

661
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:08,836
Yeah.

662
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,687
Were you serious about the prize money?

663
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,741
Why?

664
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:19,136
I'll pay you $500
to stay away from Casey.

665
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:22,230
Whatever, dude.

666
00:37:22,696 --> 00:37:24,976
- I'll see you around.
- I'm serious.

667
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:27,956
You mean, like a buy-off?

668
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:30,109
You can call it what you want.

669
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,480
How about you get out of my face?

670
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,182
How about $1,000?

671
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Hey!

672
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,272
Finally.

673
00:37:52,702 --> 00:37:54,274
I was getting worried.

674
00:37:54,394 --> 00:37:55,394
Yeah.

675
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:56,765
You know what...

676
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,860
I don't think I'm up for it tonight.

677
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:03,807
All right.

678
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,792
Another rain check?

679
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:07,273
Hey, good job, Shane.

680
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:08,944
I don't think so.

681
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:11,309
See ya around, coach.

682
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:12,429
Hold up, guys.

683
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,676
So it's unanimous.

684
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:27,346
The guy code has officially
been overturned.

685
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:32,744
First order of business
in the post guy code era...

686
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:34,887
Ferret,

687
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:37,231
your girlfriend is clearly a prostitute.

688
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:41,349
Second order of business
in the post guy code era...

689
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:55,138
Hi, guys.

690
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:57,703
I'm sorry I tormented you.

691
00:38:58,092 --> 00:39:01,088
Despite the fact you lost,
I should've been nice to you.

692
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:03,276
I hope these make up for it.

693
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:24,080
I'm sorry for being mean to you.

694
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:26,108
And for making you run all my errands.

695
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,740
And for calling you the first
mentally challenged engineering major.

696
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:32,244
- Polymer science.
- Hence the apology.

697
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:34,738
Look. She...
she even got you your own...

698
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:37,027
Your own pizza with your
favorite toppings on it.

699
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,103
- Peppers and olives.
- Okay. Okay.

700
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:41,326
All right, I guess I can...

701
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:45,445
Leave the past week
of verbal abuse behind me.

702
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:47,203
And we can be...

703
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:50,360
Acquaintances who tolerate each other.

704
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:53,560
Acquaintances who tolerate each other.

705
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,435
Actually, I like green peppers.

706
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,542
Well, excuse me.

707
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:04,632
Okay, so Rebecca.
I'll call you later.

708
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:07,735
- I'm just trying to help out.
- Everybody say good-bye to Rebecca.

709
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:13,290
What are you doing here?

710
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,983
Let's just say I listened
to your advice.

711
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:19,217
Decided to take a little
control of my life.

712
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,035
Good for you.

713
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:23,281
God.

714
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:26,828
I can't believe you're actually
gonna clean the Lambda Sigs'bathroom.

715
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,155
Well, I,

716
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,004
you know, I lost fair and square.
It's time for me to pay up.

717
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,230
- Really?
- Of course not.

718
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,393
Okay.

719
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:36,853
Fraternity bathroom?
Are you freaking kidding me?

720
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:40,225
Rebecca and I hired a maid
service and had them sent right over.

721
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:43,302
This is just all so
it looks good for Casey.

722
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,950
I don't leave anything to chance either.

723
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:49,188
- Don't rat me out, okay?
- No.

724
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:51,311
I'm off to the spa to get a massage.

725
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:53,433
- Tootles.
- Bye.

726
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:57,944
Hey.

727
00:40:58,972 --> 00:40:59,725
Hey.

728
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:02,887
So
I was in the neighborhood.

729
00:41:04,024 --> 00:41:05,237
Considering I

730
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:07,244
live in the neighborhood.

731
00:41:08,538 --> 00:41:09,624
And...

732
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:12,276
I just wanted to see if
you could maybe use a study break.

733
00:41:12,756 --> 00:41:15,199
You know, totally casual.
Two friends...

734
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:17,269
Having coffee.

735
00:41:17,944 --> 00:41:21,838
That's so funny,
I was just thinking I need some coffee.

736
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:23,436
I know you well.

737
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,124
You do.

738
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:30,613
Well.
