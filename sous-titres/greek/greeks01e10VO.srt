1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:01,274
<i>Previously on</i> Greek...

2
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:04,700
I am graduating this spring,
and you could be the heir to my throne.

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,137
If you plan to graduate,

4
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:09,187
you're going to need to complete
a fifth year here at Cyprus-Rhodes.

5
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:12,256
I'm staying for a fifth year here at CRU!

6
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:14,617
- Isn't that great, Case?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,238
Frannie's already had her reign.
It's your turn now.

8
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:21,034
- This is k-study 867-5309.
- Rob Thomas guy?

9
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:23,546
You're not nearly as unpleasant
as I thought you'd be, Logan.

10
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:25,705
You smell better than I thought
you would.

11
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,723
Will you come back to my room
and have sex with me in front of Dale?

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,456
Thanks for being my handsome escort
for tonight.

13
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:35,177
I am lucky to have
such a beautiful lady on my arm.

14
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:36,588
Enjoy your win, poodle.

15
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:38,127
Doesn't last forever.

16
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:44,035
A little pick-me-up.

17
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:47,134
I thought you could use it,
given the whole, you know...

18
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,214
Sweetheart debacle.

19
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:49,947
Chocolate shavings.

20
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:51,286
Very intuitive.

21
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:53,878
Dark chocolate, no less.
Tasty and high in fiber.

22
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:56,405
- It's win-win.
- Speaking of win-win,

23
00:00:57,673 --> 00:01:00,856
remember when you were asking for
more responsibility with the sorority?

24
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,424
I think I might have something for you.

25
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,080
Campaign manager.

26
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:08,097
I'm considering a second term
as Zeta-Beta President.

27
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:09,733
I can see your campaign sLogan now:

28
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,811
"Frannie, so nice,

29
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:13,586
she deserves to lead twice."

30
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,526
- That just came to you?
- I know. It's a gift.

31
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:20,035
I'm thinking we strategize over the break
at my house in Jackson Hole.

32
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:22,348
I think that is a great idea.

33
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:25,073
You thought me being President
was a great idea too.

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,177
Remember that?

35
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,973
And I thought Orlando Bloom
was going to be the next Tom Cruise.

36
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,648
We all make mistakes, don't we?

37
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:34,046
Rebecca, walk with me.

38
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:37,111
My God, you guys.

39
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:38,734
Have you seen today's courier?

40
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:41,371
We have a school paper?

41
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:47,098
My God.

42
00:01:57,302 --> 00:01:58,433
Let's do one more.

43
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:00,894
Do my eyes look crossed to you?

44
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:03,501
Your eyes look adorable.

45
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,459
They've looked adorable
in the past 15 pictures that we've taken.

46
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,211
This picture has to be perfect.

47
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,070
It's gonna be seen
throughout the Chicagoland.

48
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,336
My parents,
friends in the Eagle Scouts,

49
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,290
my english teacher who created
a eharmony profile for me in tenth grade.

50
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:19,324
I was hoping that you wanted
this picture, so you wouldn't forget me.

51
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:22,161
Forget you?

52
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:25,696
I can barely remember anything
before you.

53
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:29,570
I don't wanna go home.

54
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:31,723
Me neither.

55
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:34,663
It's just four weeks.

56
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,747
A nanosecond when you consider
the age of the galaxy.

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Good.

58
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,184
Then let's get this picture perfect.

59
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,478
Button up your privates.
The Lord's witness coming through.

60
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:47,121
The Lord evolved our privates, Dale.
He's seen them.

61
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,956
I'm sure he doesn't want me to see them.

62
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,158
You can look, Dale.

63
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,672
And you can look at this.

64
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,292
Your people made the front page.

65
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:58,772
"The secret world
of the CRU greek system exposed."

66
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:01,697
"Sex scandals, booze,
and cheating run rampant.

67
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:03,345
Written by Anonymous."

68
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:05,528
Finally the liberal media
gets something right.

00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:36,944
<i>Bribing girls to pledge during rush?</i>

75
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,600
<i>An automated telephone service

<i>Indiscriminate sex,</i>

77
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:46,094
<i>and rampant underage alcohol abuse.</i>

78
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:50,188
<i>Clearly, you people are unable

<i>So from this day forward,</i>

80
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:54,576
<i>the university will do it for you.</i>

81
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,300
<i>As dean of students,</i>

82
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:57,949
<i>you'll answer to me now.</i>

83
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,024
Your honor, I object!

84
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:02,723
<i>To?</i>

85
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:06,829
Well...

86
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:08,616
Jean shorts.

87
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,404
Dane cook, highly objectionable.

88
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,991
Your complete and utter lack

89
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,667
of presumption that we're innocent
until proven guilty.

90
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:19,910
No more questions.

91
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,086
Your witness!

92
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:26,137
- Pre-law?
- Not yet, but I'm digging the suit.

93
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:27,657
<i>Son, stand up.</i>

94
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:35,978
<i>The only presumption I'm willing to make</i>

95
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,289
<i>is that the greek social calendar</i>

96
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:42,305
<i>will now be much less crowded.</i>

97
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,526
<i>Next semester, everything changes.</i>

98
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:47,707
<i>I'll be watching you.</i>

99
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:54,903
Did you mean for that to sound pervy?

100
00:04:57,638 --> 00:05:00,438
Dean Bowman is this close to shutting us
down, and you're mouthing off.

101
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:02,531
Would you quit your belly-aching,
Evelyn?

102
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:05,036
Your parties are so lame anyway,
what do you have to lose?

103
00:05:05,232 --> 00:05:06,344
Stop, both of you.

104
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:08,495
This is a time to put
your personal issues aside

105
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:09,828
and work together to...

106
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you.
You can step away now.

107
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:21,476
<i>Dean Bowman may think we should
all be held accountable...</i>

108
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,512
<i>But I think we know better.</i>

109
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:25,588
<i>There is a rat out there.</i>

110
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:27,642
<i>And there's a house
that has been feeding</i>

111
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:31,334
<i>that rat all of our secrets, so it could
publish its droppings on the front page.</i>

112
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:33,253
Maybe we should focus
on the university...

113
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:35,343
<i>I and the rest of the ZBZ sisters</i>

114
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:38,466
<i>will not stop until both that house</i>

115
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:40,770
<i>and that rat are brought to justice.</i>

116
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,837
<i>Who is with me?</i>

117
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,362
- Frannie, wait up.
- Walk faster.

118
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:54,707
Just hear me out.
I think

119
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:58,350
the rat is in our house,
and I think it's Rebecca Logan.

120
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,636
Hear me out. You need
to head straight to student health

121
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,149
and have your obsession checked.

122
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:03,719
You started a witch hunt,

123
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:05,240
and we might be the witches.

124
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,465
Bribes to get a pledge to join a house,

125
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,198
hazing that involved naked pictures
of faculty members.

126
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,540
These are all things
that happened at our house

127
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,984
this semester.

128
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:15,272
It's one of our pledges.

129
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,579
"Faced with her boyfriend's
very public infidelity",

130
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:20,541
"one sister had sex
with her ex-boyfriend" to even the score.

131
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:23,309
The original two remain
the 'it' couple on campus."

132
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,773
Sound familiar?

133
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:28,298
Maybe you should have them run
an MRI on that ego of yours too.

134
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:31,906
Come on, Frannie.
This isn't about you and me right now.

135
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,264
It's about Zeta Beta.

136
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:34,895
And if I'm right about Rebecca,

137
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:37,538
none of the other greeks
will have anything to do with us.

138
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,963
Give it to me.

139
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,010
I said it, I said it.

140
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:47,672
So...

141
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:50,718
how much do you think the dean
is going to investigate?

142
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,761
The article mentioned
the cheating phone number.

143
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:55,547
Don't you worry about dean Blowman
back there.

144
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:58,223
He's challenged us
to become more ingenious,

145
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,623
more innovative in our pursuit
of the Kappa Tau lifestyle.

146
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,023
Take a seat.

147
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,088
Look, next semester,

148
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:10,060
it is our mission to execute
some of the most ass-kicking,

149
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:13,606
rule-bending parties
that this campus has ever seen.

150
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,212
- So we'll go underground?
- And below the radar.

151
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,116
And behind the barn.

152
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,520
Who is with me?

153
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:20,787
Who's with me!

154
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,895
As your pledge educator,

155
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,245
I feel we've all grown very close.

156
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,372
So I want you all to feel comfortable
opening up to me.

157
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,046
The author of this article
knew several private details

158
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:38,512
that happened in this house.

159
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:40,393
She clearly has no loyalty to...

160
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,610
anything or anyone except herself.

161
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:45,811
Likes to spread misery.

162
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,680
You're not serious?

163
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,187
It reads like your résumé.

164
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:51,898
You know she's crazy, right?

165
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,772
I've never been anything
but loyal to you.

166
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,455
To me, absolutely.

167
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:02,304
But your devotion to this sisterhood
has been a bit...

168
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:04,421
suspect.

169
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,059
I have been a huge asset to this house,

170
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:12,447
and I have received nothing
but grief for it.

171
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:14,832
If you think I did it,

172
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,209
fine.

173
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:17,631
Then prove it.

174
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:34,960
Nice motel, Ash.

175
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:38,154
Either you're planning a meth bender,
or you're on the lam.

176
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:39,871
Travis called this morning.

177
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:44,234
And for our six-year anniversary,
he is making a spontaneous visit.

178
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:46,785
- Tonight.
- Aren't you just gonna see him

179
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:48,962
- when you go home in a few days?
- That was the plan.

180
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:52,195
Until he decided he'd rather spend
the break with his friends in Mexico.

181
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,523
- That sounds...
- Inconvenient?

182
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,711
I know.

183
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:58,664
The house is at DefCon 5
because of this stupid article.

184
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:00,343
He could not have chosen a worse time.

185
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,693
- Well, did you tell him?
- I did.

186
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:05,896
And he says he finds it "highly suspect
that our school paper is capable

187
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,579
of serious, investigative reporting."

188
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,466
- Of course he did.
- This was the only place

189
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:12,309
available on six hours' notice.

190
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,686
Help me make it livable.

191
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,961
The last thing I need right now
is Travis bitching about this room.

192
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,012
Just relax, okay?

193
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:23,440
The only thing this room needs
to be beautiful is you in it.

194
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,020
All right?

195
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,523
Thanks.

196
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:34,185
I'm not so sure Travis feels the same way.

197
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:38,904
All right, let's try to make this place
look a little less like that moviehostel.

198
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,666
They really think Rebecca Logan
wrote the article?

199
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,675
And they were really angry.

200
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,459
I'm really angry.

201
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:54,695
Aren't you?

202
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,895
I mean, she's made a mess of everything.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,083
And for what?

204
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:00,163
It's unforgivable.

205
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,735
Well, what if she didn't mean
to hurt anyone? What if she was just...

206
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,962
- Telling the truth?
- Defending Rebecca Logan?

207
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:10,922
No, I'm defending whoever wrote
the article, because...

208
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,283
She isn't necessarily a bad person.

209
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:16,435
She might be someone you could like.

210
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:19,398
Or love?

211
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:21,446
What are you saying?

212
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,241
I wrote the article, Rusty.

213
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:29,138
I don't understand.

214
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:35,108
I pitched the whole undercover idea
to the editor at the first of the year.

215
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:36,930
I wanted a spot on the newspaper staff.

216
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,534
It's really competitive.

217
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,265
So I went through rush,
pledging, all of it,

218
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:43,965
as an unbiased observer.

219
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,095
Only by the end, I wasn't so unbiased,

220
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:50,470
which is why I kept the article vague.
I kept everyone's names anonymous.

221
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:53,432
- I only wrote enough...
- You wrote about everything.

222
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,144
My sister's private life.

223
00:10:58,628 --> 00:10:59,778
About how I cheated.

224
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:02,446
- But no one will know that it's you.
- Is Jen K really your name?

225
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:03,750
Do you have an accent?

226
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:06,410
I always thought
you might have an accent.

227
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,701
No, everything that I told you
about me is true.

228
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,176
How do I believe that?

229
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,259
Why'd you have to tell me?

230
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,567
The AP picked up the story.

231
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:25,196
It's going out on The Wire
with my name on it.

232
00:11:27,274 --> 00:11:29,657
My first national byline.

233
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:36,332
By tomorrow, everyone will know
that I wrote the article.

234
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:38,518
You need to go tell Casey now.

235
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:39,979
What about us?

236
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:49,584
Just go.

237
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:51,958
Please.

238
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,451
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:12,332
Me too.

240
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:15,904
And this is why I freakin' hate legacies.

241
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:18,266
- But we were nice to you.
- Despite you being weird

242
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:19,676
and annoying most of the time.

243
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:22,552
I considered you a friend, and... Rusty.

244
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:27,555
I knew there was a reason I hated you
more than I normally hate most people.

245
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,912
And this article is going
to be published nationally tonight?

246
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,675
And I didn't plan for any of that.

247
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:32,895
Are you insane?!

248
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:36,194
I have to put a preemptive
call into national. You, get out!

249
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,003
Do you think she'll calm down?

250
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,737
She's the least of your problems.

251
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:43,976
We trusted you.

252
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,142
I trusted you.
Why would you do this?

253
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:48,536
I'm a journalism major.

254
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:51,779
These are the kind of flashy articles
that get you internships and jobs.

255
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,979
What about Rusty?

256
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:55,567
It was really hard.

257
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:58,539
For Rusty, considering
his first love is a liar

258
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:00,869
who used him and betrayed him.

259
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,051
You know the dean is gonna call her in

260
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:09,251
and try to get her to name
names and houses.

261
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:10,793
Do you think she'll talk?

262
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:14,228
I clearly have no idea who Jen K is,

263
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:15,655
let alone what she'll do.

264
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,258
I just know he must be devastated.

265
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:24,793
The dean?

266
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,307
I've left him a bunch of messages.

267
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,592
You know what you need?
Little bit of perspective.

268
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:35,575
Like the kind you get
on top of a ski run in Aspen,

269
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:37,518
and you got your ski gear all packed?

270
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:43,443
I may just show up with a nightie and
my toothbrush and stay in bed all week.

271
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,542
Works for me.

272
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,458
<i>Be right out.</i>

273
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:04,273
Room looks great.

274
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,031
It's...
very seductive.

275
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:14,954
What do you think?

276
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,559
My eyeballs were not prepared
for your hotness.

277
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,803
You make me feel beautiful, Calvin.

278
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:30,242
You know,
Travis won the girlfriend lottery.

279
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:33,481
Speaking of, when's the guy getting here?

280
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,284
That would be never.

281
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,237
He's not coming.

282
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,890
Did he cancel on you again?

283
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,781
No, this time, I cancelled.

284
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,329
Our relationship.

285
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,416
What happened?

286
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:50,043
You happened.

287
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:00,138
I'm gay.

288
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:06,853
What do you...

289
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:08,892
What do you mean by "gay"?

290
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:10,571
I've been meaning to tell you for weeks.

291
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,579
But wait a second,
you've known for weeks?

292
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:16,965
- I've known since elementary school.
- But we've been hanging out for months.

293
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,564
I shared my secrets,
and I just threw myself at you.

294
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,670
- Well, I was flattered, but...
- And you know about my summer

295
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:27,380
at cheerleading camp!
That secret is definitely bi-curious.

296
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:29,190
You couldn't have brought it up then?

297
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,995
Look, Ash, let me just tell...
Just wait, let me explain!

298
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,607
I hope you understand that

299
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:43,707
I never really doubted you for a second.

300
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,032
It was just all so...

301
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,447
I totally understand.

302
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,315
Can I have a word?

303
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:54,873
Our ZBZ rep is two minutes out.

304
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:57,966
I just want to be sure we're all
on the same page before she arrives.

305
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,392
Our official position is that the article
is an offensive work of fiction.

306
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:04,873
Remember, we're all shocked and outraged.

307
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,090
And if that doesn't work,
we go Regan.

308
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:08,798
Can't remember anything.

309
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:11,037
I'm not sure
that's the best way to handle this.

310
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,913
Then it's a good thing
you're not handling it.

311
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:15,606
Nobody is to be alone
with the national rep except me.

312
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:17,989
Shadow your little sisters,
travel in pairs.

313
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:19,527
If I find any one of you...

314
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:24,413
Welcome, sister.

315
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,968
I'm Frannie Morgan, chapter president,
we spoke on the phone.

316
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:29,248
And I'm Tegan Walker,
and I'm parched.

317
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:31,510
- Could I get a water?
- Of course.

318
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:36,329
First of all, I'd like to introduce
our entire sisterhood,

319
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,179
we are the finest group of women...

320
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:41,198
If that was the case, then I'm not sure
what I'd be doing here, right?

321
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:43,645
Sit.

322
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:46,989
We have a senator's daughter.

323
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:48,720
Rebecca, come, come.

324
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,031
Girls,

325
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,497
we're very unhappy.

326
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,533
This whole situation is just so...

327
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:00,482
Icky and gross
and makes you all look awful,

328
00:17:00,712 --> 00:17:03,512
which makes us look awful,
and we hate to look awful.

329
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:06,104
So we need to get to the bottom of this.

330
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:09,262
I'm so sorry you came
all this way, Tegan,

331
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,079
when the answer is simple.

332
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,289
We're guilty.

333
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,479
Guilty... Of not seeing the signs
of mental instability.

334
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:20,835
Sure, Jen K seemed a bit off
when we first met her,

335
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:21,985
but she was a legacy.

336
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:24,729
And here at CRU,
we open our arms wide

337
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:26,540
to the daughters
of our Zeta Beta ancestors,

338
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,485
no matter what shape or size they are.
I mean, just...

339
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:30,571
Just ask Tanya.

340
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,532
I'll be speaking to the girls
individually.

341
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,328
It's the quickest way to determine
what transpired.

342
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:41,604
Because if we can't get to the truth
and find a remedy, well,

343
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:44,186
I have been authorized
to pull your charter.

344
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:53,010
It must be flat, french,
and in a bottle.

345
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:06,863
- What are you doing here?
- You wouldn't return my calls.

346
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:08,463
What was I supposed to do?

347
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:15,812
Are those my glasses?

348
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,002
I haven't seen those
since the Bible Bunch show.

349
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,186
What?

350
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:24,011
Why would I have a piece
of Casey Cartwright's librarian costume?

351
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:25,361
Outrageous.

352
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,881
Look at the time...
I should probably...

353
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:29,612
take my shower.

354
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,183
Do I need to worry about him?

355
00:18:38,524 --> 00:18:40,548
- I don't think so.
- What about you?

356
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,862
How are you doing?

357
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:43,861
Your first breakup is a killer.

358
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:47,653
I remember when me and Gary Wallace
broke up in ninth grade.

359
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,410
I ate an entire sheet cake.

360
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:51,827
I haven't decided
if I'm gonna break up with Jen.

361
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,716
She betrayed you,
and your friends, and me.

362
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,363
How can you even consider
staying with her?

363
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,667
Because I love her.

364
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,517
How is what Jen did any different
than what Evan did?

365
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,845
She didn't just do it to you.

366
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:08,502
She did it to all of us.

367
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:10,812
You have to dump her.
She's a liar...

368
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:12,136
And Evan was a cheater.

369
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:15,109
But you looked past it. The world isn't
black and white, remember?

370
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:16,362
People make mistakes.

371
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,299
And it sounds like
you're about to make a big one.

372
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,810
Well, it's mine to make.

373
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:24,148
Have fun sitting at home
with mom and dad.

374
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,365
Have fun skiing with Evan!

375
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:34,917
Ivy...

376
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:38,125
How much interaction did you have
with Jennifer during rush?

377
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:43,214
They barely spoke,
because Ivy hated Jen K's crazy eyes.

378
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,080
Could you get me another?

379
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,279
That would be so awesome.
Thanks!

380
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:52,289
But don't you dare start
that chinese water torture without me!

381
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:55,332
Kidding.

382
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,122
Everyone's so serious.

383
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:03,061
That Ivy is a top-notch liar.

384
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:06,513
Makes me wonder if she really made out
with Justin Timberlake's cousin.

385
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,070
Frannie, I think we should come clean.

386
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,520
This woman knows something's up.

387
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:13,038
We need to take responsibility
and deal with it.

388
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:21,755
My plan is working like a charm, so
you can cancel this drama club meeting.

389
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,488
There are 50 girls in this house,
sorority girls.

390
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,414
We're not poster people
for keeping secrets.

391
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:28,402
You can't control everyone.

392
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,607
Remember the Casey

393
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,066
who was dependable
and willing to follow orders?

394
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:33,751
I liked that Casey.

395
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,738
This Casey is weak and kinda lame.

396
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,378
I'm just saying
you're risking everything.

397
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,580
I'm the decider.
I decide it... It's done.

398
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:41,836
If there are leaks,

399
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:43,332
then I will plug them.

400
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,534
Perhaps with the body
of a sacrificed sister.

401
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:47,506
But who, pray tell...

402
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:50,017
Maybe someone who's in charge
of the pledges.

403
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,140
Someone whose brother
dated the little spy whore.

404
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:54,287
Maybe even someone
who was featured in the article.

405
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:56,295
Let's hope it won't come to that.

406
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:04,905
She's delusional.

407
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:07,069
Like Britney Spears in a barbershop.

408
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,847
She can't see what's totally obvious.

409
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:13,577
Like when a guy smells good
and loves Beyoncé.

410
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,988
You're hugging your pillow
and not wearing earrings.

411
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,377
I broke up with Travis.

412
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,575
My God, that's fantastic...

413
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,263
Ally sad.

414
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,830
Are you okay?

415
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:30,077
It needed to happen.

416
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,529
But that's not why I'm upset.

417
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:35,542
Is it because you wasted
so many years with him?

418
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,230
No, but I'll add that to the list.

419
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,889
Which also includes recently
throwing myself

420
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:44,699
at a gay guy.

421
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,267
That's...

422
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,427
so... weird.

423
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:50,914
I didn't know he was gay.

424
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:54,091
And we spent all that time together,
and he never told me.

425
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,813
Calvin's gay.

426
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:58,254
How did you guess?

427
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:01,173
Well, he is your only friend
of the male persuasion.

428
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:02,393
Ex-friend.

429
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:04,575
I made a fool of myself!

430
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:06,929
Hold on to your pillow.

431
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,618
I'm going to say something shocking.

432
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:10,443
Maybe this isn't about you.

433
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:13,726
He lied to me, he led me on.

434
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:15,332
This is the greek system.

435
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:17,986
We're not always a beacon of tolerance.

436
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:21,239
Calvin's probably terrified
of how people will react.

437
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:22,713
I bet

438
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:24,403
his biggest fear

439
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,256
is that his best friends will turn
their backs on him.

440
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:30,543
You need your own talk show.

441
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:34,891
If only I could solve
this national problem so easily.

442
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:38,309
Frannie is dangerously close
to getting this sorority shut down.

443
00:22:39,263 --> 00:22:41,563
Well, what would you do
if you were president?

444
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,022
You know, I thought about that.

445
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:44,993
But it's kinda risky.

446
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,010
Like, deadly?

447
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:49,708
Like, I could get kicked out for it.

448
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:51,848
I'm in.

449
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:54,193
Look, we're in this together.

450
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:55,555
If you go, I go.

451
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,293
And we can rent an apartment together
off campus

452
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:00,109
and talk trash about sorority girls.

453
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:03,711
Okay,

454
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:05,020
here's what I'm thinking...

455
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:07,116
If we get taken alone...

456
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,131
We should give admissions tours.

457
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,530
"Welcome to college.

458
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:11,892
"The food sucks,

459
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,652
"the dorm rooms suck,

460
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:15,379
the relationships suck!"

461
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:17,423
The non-relationships suck.

462
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,390
You know,
I expected Ash to be more open-minded.

463
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:23,883
You know?
Especially given her fashion sense.

464
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:26,164
She might have been
had you told her sooner.

465
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:27,509
Yeah.

466
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:30,205
Well, I guess I need to rethink
my coming out strategy.

467
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,126
I just wanted people
to get to know the real me

468
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:34,934
before I told 'em I was gay, you know?

469
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:37,929
Ash did, and now she thinks
the real me was a lie.

470
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:41,233
- It's counterproductive.
- Yeah, but you weren't exactly lying.

471
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,136
You just hadn't shared
the truth with her yet.

472
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:45,038
In fact, I bet that's how jen k feels.

473
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:47,452
How do you feel?

474
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:49,454
I mean
now that you know

475
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,449
the truth, you think you can trust her?

476
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,353
I'm seduced

477
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,236
by your magnificence.

478
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,870
Tortured

479
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,473
by your indifference.

480
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:06,764
My heart

481
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,883
is a political prisoner

482
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:11,430
enslaved in my chest!

483
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:13,452
The missile looms.

484
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:15,445
It overlooks

485
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,619
and fights the enemy it impales!

486
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:20,150
Were you followed?

487
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:22,461
You're kidding me, right?

488
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,304
Why am I here?

489
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:25,911
We needed a greek-free zone.

490
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:27,115
Guantanamo!

491
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:29,205
Listen,
we don't have much time.

492
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:31,737
I need to tell you that everything
in that article was true.

493
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,798
Sorry, I'm just so moved.

494
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:38,840
Guantanamo.

495
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:41,573
These girls are

496
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:43,290
my sisters, my family.

497
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:45,541
Together,
we've built the best sorority on campus,

498
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:48,065
the crown jewel of the CRU greek system.

499
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:50,949
- I know it looks bad.
- Bad?

500
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:53,111
Your ensemble looks bad.

501
00:24:53,303 --> 00:24:54,703
This is a disaster.

502
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:56,904
But shutting us down
would be devastating...

503
00:24:56,958 --> 00:25:00,396
To me, to my sisters,
and also to nationals.

504
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:03,433
Then why have I spent the day
being lied to?

505
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:04,896
There is...

506
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,812
leadership at the house

507
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:09,029
who prefer manipulation over the truth.

508
00:25:09,387 --> 00:25:10,838
I just want to save our sorority,

509
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,497
and I have an exit strategy.

510
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,276
We'll make a sincere public apology.

511
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:17,126
And?

512
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:18,731
And

513
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:20,940
next semester,
we'll double our philanthropy hours

514
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:22,197
to set a better example.

515
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:25,310
We need more of a sacrifice.

516
00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:27,965
Maybe we'll cut our social calendar.

517
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:30,498
In half?

518
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,540
Better.

519
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,239
But this is a national scandal.

520
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:35,597
We have to show our other chapters

521
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:36,891
and our alumnI that

522
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:39,101
we have zero tolerance
for these activities.

523
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,887
Well,

524
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:42,820
she was my pledge.

525
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:44,315
So for the house,

526
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:45,707
I'm prepared to take...

527
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:46,994
The fall.

528
00:25:50,432 --> 00:25:52,332
And it is on those terms

529
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:55,024
that we are willing to give
this house a second chance.

530
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,296
After all, at Zeta Beta Zeta,

531
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:59,246
we believe in forgiveness
and redemption.

532
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:03,695
We'll make that work, won't we, girls?

533
00:26:03,858 --> 00:26:05,492
- God, I'm so...
- I'm not finished.

534
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:08,422
We cannot afford to let something like
this happen again.

535
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:12,176
That article exposed
a serious lack of judgment.

536
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,888
And someone must be held accountable.

537
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:17,816
Therefore, I have decided
that this chapter needs a regime change.

538
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,149
Frannie,

539
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:22,049
I am removing you as President,
effective immediately.

540
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,097
You... You can't be serious.

541
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:27,024
When it comes to Zeta Beta Zeta,
I'm totally serious.

542
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:30,525
Everything this sorority
has achieved is because of me.

543
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:32,947
I've made us the envy
of every girl on campus.

544
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:35,403
Right, girls?

545
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:39,103
Tell her.

546
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:41,368
Rebecca,

547
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:42,811
tell her how crucial I am.

548
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,518
Sweetie,

549
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,734
your devotion
to the sisterhood has been a bit...

550
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,172
Suspect.

551
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:54,835
I have selected
an interim president...

552
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:57,915
Someone with the integrity
to lead this house

553
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,473
through this difficult period
until spring elections.

554
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:02,110
Casey Cartwright.

555
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:04,866
Me?

556
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
Frannie, wait!

557
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:13,157
Ladies.

558
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:14,466
Frannie, wait!

559
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:16,535
Wait,
I was just trying to save Zeta Beta.

560
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:19,570
I thought she was gonna kick me out.
I asked her to.

561
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:22,968
Here's my last tidbit of wisdom for you,
mentee.

562
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:25,321
I created you.

563
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:28,572
Therefore,
I can destroy you.

564
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:45,609
Everyone hates me.

565
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:50,622
My agoraphobic roommate left our room
for the first time just to avoid me.

566
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:52,393
You should come in.

567
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:03,164
I just had to talk to someone,
even if all they said was "Go away."

568
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,724
Everyone else is acting like
I'm on an airplane with TB.

569
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:14,089
What about your newspaper friends?

570
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,134
They're all jealous,
because I got a national Byline.

571
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,366
I really thought I was doing
the right thing.

572
00:28:21,097 --> 00:28:22,364
Doing the right thing...

573
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,179
Is usually the hardest thing to do.

574
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,482
I really love you,
Rusty.

575
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,775
I loved you too.

576
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:33,953
Loved?

577
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:38,497
- Sorry.
- Give us a minute, Dale?

578
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,550
Dale, you can stay.

579
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:41,788
Jen's leaving.

580
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,377
- Over there.
- Right.

581
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:53,543
Rusty, I really think you should give
this a little more consideration.

582
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:54,806
Consideration?

583
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:57,023
- I wrote lot of really good...
- You are the last person

584
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,021
to talk about consideration, Jen,
because I really wanna believe

585
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:03,479
if you'd given us any consideration,
you never would've written the article.

586
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:06,299
- Rusty, I...
- No! No.

587
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:08,999
Good-bye.

588
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:28,835
I know you probably
don't want to hear this.

589
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:32,494
No, Dale, I don't.
I don't want to hear "I told you so."

590
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:39,356
What is that?

591
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:40,904
It's an inspirational poem.

592
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:43,369
It's about this guy
who's walking along the beach,

593
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,475
and he sees these footprints
in the sand. Dale...

594
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:47,615
See, the beach represents his life.

595
00:29:48,158 --> 00:29:50,158
And... I don't want to hurt you, Dale.

596
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,009
See,

597
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,611
Times, really the times
that he only thought there were one

598
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:56,761
set of footprints...

599
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:08,537
Excuse me.
Is Calvin Owens here?

600
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,987
Let me check.

601
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:12,124
Hey, Owens!

602
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,441
Your girlfriend's here!

603
00:30:15,308 --> 00:30:17,625
I just wanted to give this to him.

604
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:23,302
Girlfriend brought him a present.

605
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:27,911
Okay, I mean seriously,
mature yourself for a moment.

606
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:29,683
He's not my boyfriend.

607
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:30,905
We're just friends.

608
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:32,153
Hey, I see.

609
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:33,799
'Cause Calvin is gay.

610
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:39,111
My God, you guys know too?

611
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:52,909
Or not.

612
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,475
Just...

613
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,837
tell him I stopped by.

614
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:15,808
Get in.

615
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:18,690
No, Cap, I can't.
I moved my flight up.

616
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,942
There's a cab coming.
I'm done. Gimme my suitcase back.

617
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,884
I'll take you to the airport.
Put this on.

618
00:31:23,574 --> 00:31:24,574
It's a blindfold.

619
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,389
- What about the airport?
- Get in.

620
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:28,278
We should probably...
Get in, pledge!

621
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:41,474
Please tell me
you didn't take me to dobler's.

622
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:42,749
But I'd be lying.

623
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:46,757
Everyone here knows my girlfriend wrote
the article. They probably all hate me.

624
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,019
There is only one group of greeks
that matter, am I right, pledge?

625
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:51,975
- Cappie...
- And who is that group of greeks?

626
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,622
- The Kappa Taus.
- Do the Kappa Taus

627
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,724
care
what other people think about them?

628
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,213
- No.
- And are you a Kappa Tau?

629
00:31:57,228 --> 00:31:58,654
- Yes.
- So what's the problem?

630
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:02,850
Fine, I'll stay for a little bit,
but we'll go directly to the airport.

631
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:04,481
Whatever you say, Spitter.

632
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:05,839
First round's on me.

633
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:16,792
Hey, Jeannette.
Love your top.

634
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:17,981
Thank you.

635
00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:20,799
I hate your sorority
and everything you stand for.

636
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:22,966
Do you know who I am?

637
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,366
Yes!

638
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,745
Well, I have no idea who you are.

639
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:28,215
Leave.

640
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:35,846
- Thanks.
- Nobody talks

641
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:37,433
like that to one of my sisters.

642
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:39,282
Hold on.

643
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:41,599
- Hello.
- M'lady.

644
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:47,109
Casey's on her way.
She's just waiting for Evan.

645
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,450
All hail the queen.

646
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:51,143
Looks like you don't have to be
Frannie's number two after all.

647
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:52,193
Please.

648
00:32:52,352 --> 00:32:53,569
I'm nobody's number two.

649
00:32:55,938 --> 00:32:56,938
Sorry.

650
00:32:57,635 --> 00:32:59,179
- I'm so sorry...
- I'm so sorry...

651
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,304
- Wait, why are you sorry?
- No, why are you sorry?

652
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:04,117
It wasn't that
I didn't want to tell you.

653
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:06,868
- I know, I just...
- It's okay, you don't have to explain.

654
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:09,041
- Sorry I handled it the way that I did.
- Don't be.

655
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,724
I am the one who was wrong here.

656
00:33:12,342 --> 00:33:13,747
I should've just trusted you.

657
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:18,001
I take it you haven't been by the house.

658
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,229
No, why?

659
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:20,618
I...

660
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:22,630
might've possibly...

661
00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:25,274
told them you're gay.

662
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,804
- You what?
- Accidentally!

663
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,288
I didn't get to that part yet.

664
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:30,716
Wait, so after you thought
I spurned you,

665
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:32,487
you accidentally outted me

666
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,381
to my entire house?

667
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,671
First of all, no one says "Spurned."

668
00:33:36,912 --> 00:33:40,062
And second, I'm sure
if you just go and talk to them...

669
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,300
You know what?
All those "I'm sorry"s?

670
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,655
I take 'em all back.

671
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:52,076
Is that my little ski bunny?

672
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,067
Got a carrot for me?

673
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:00,222
What's up?

674
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,130
Where shall I begin?

675
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:09,074
Cute pic.

676
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:11,928
Where's Casey?

677
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:13,671
I love Casey's eyes.

678
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:16,416
They're so big and innocent.

679
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:18,524
Like bambi's.

680
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:22,803
Do you think you could look into them
and tell when she's lying?

681
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,486
All right, seriously,
what are you doing here?

682
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:28,430
Didn't you think
it was a little weird that...

683
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,554
Casey stayed with you
after the whole Rebecca Logan...

684
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:32,947
sexident?

685
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:36,385
Not that it's any of your business,
but we worked through that.

686
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:37,471
It made us stronger.

687
00:34:38,263 --> 00:34:40,413
You are adorably naive.

688
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:43,078
Listen, Casey...

689
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:45,682
has had this whole thing
scripted since day one.

690
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:49,325
She stayed with you
not because you're Evan,

691
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:51,793
but because you're Evan Chambers.

692
00:34:52,116 --> 00:34:54,916
Having you on her arm makes her
the "it" girl on campus.

693
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,303
It makes her powerful.

694
00:34:56,529 --> 00:35:00,162
It assures her the Zeta Beta presidency.

695
00:35:01,555 --> 00:35:03,505
How could you even think that?

696
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,040
Because I'm the one
who told her to do it.

697
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:10,602
To her credit,
she wanted to dump you.

698
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:14,207
But I reminded her that doing
so would have serious implications

699
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,550
on her social standing.

700
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:19,061
I dangled the carrot
of Zeta Beta president,

701
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:21,297
and your little skI bunny
ate it right up.

702
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,177
All right, you can leave now.

703
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:27,553
Just one more thing, Evan,

704
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:30,336
because I'm sensing
you're not 100% convinced.

705
00:35:33,023 --> 00:35:34,173
Deep down in the...

706
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,006
Chambers of your heart,

707
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:39,571
do you truly believe Casey's

708
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:41,321
over cappie?

709
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,199
'Cause I think she's still under him.

710
00:35:52,054 --> 00:35:53,354
Have a great break.

711
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:18,209
I was just coming downstairs
to meet you.

712
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:22,152
Nationals appointed me
President of Zeta Beta.

713
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:24,874
So they removed Frannie?

714
00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:31,674
What, did you, like, plan that?

715
00:36:32,513 --> 00:36:34,280
Frannie was trying to stonewall them.

716
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:35,744
We were gonna get shut down,

717
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,411
so I took matters into my own hands
to save the house.

718
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:42,134
I never thought it would go this far.

719
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,775
No, right, of course you didn't.

720
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:45,581
I know,

721
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:47,036
I feel super bad for her.

722
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:51,270
But I also feel like this is my chance
to show to everyone

723
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,654
what I have to offer.

724
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:55,725
Do you think it's wrong that I'm...

725
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:57,455
excited about it?

726
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,994
I mean, it's hard to tell what's right
and what's wrong anymore.

727
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:04,173
What do you mean?

728
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:06,367
After I cheated on you,

729
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,028
why'd you get back with me?

730
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:09,799
Because...

731
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,747
I love you.

732
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:17,292
Why are we talking about this?

733
00:37:17,388 --> 00:37:20,213
So it wasn't so you'd become
sorority president, right?

734
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:21,241
'Cause that's...

735
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:24,351
Did Frannie come to you?

736
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:27,089
So it is true.

737
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,770
Frannie told me staying with you
was in my best interest,

738
00:37:31,187 --> 00:37:33,621
but I didn't wanna break up,
I was just hurt.

739
00:37:33,992 --> 00:37:34,992
Really?

740
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,164
What, and Cappie helped with that?

741
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,710
I mean, it must have been nice to have
a "get in his pants free" card, huh?

742
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:43,105
Why are we talking about this now?

743
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:45,285
We're past it.

744
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:48,866
So nothing's happened between the two
of you since you "got even" with me?

745
00:37:51,714 --> 00:37:52,714
Tell the truth.

746
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:58,375
When we were working
on our paper together,

747
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:01,474
we kissed.
But it didn't go any further.

748
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,638
Evan, don't go!
Look, I'm wearing your letters.

749
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:06,426
I'm planning forever with you.
I love you!

750
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:07,743
No, you love you!

751
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:11,029
You love what I can do for you!

752
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:15,176
You know, you're ZBZ president now.

753
00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:18,240
You don't need me anymore.

754
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,658
So I guess you heard I'm gay.

755
00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:41,237
Don't worry, it's not contagious.

756
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:48,874
Does anyone wanna talk about it?

757
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:23,232
Lemme tell you something, beaver.

758
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:25,087
Women.

759
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:29,508
Women are like ions in a dense plasma.

760
00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:33,963
Bustling along,
snatching up unsuspecting electrons

761
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,196
to make themselves complete.

762
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:38,214
But your brothers,

763
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:41,658
we're electrons in a tenuous plasma.

764
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:48,343
Never tempting each other to recombine.

765
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,372
Just happily coexisting.

766
00:39:51,587 --> 00:39:52,635
I love you,

767
00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:54,379
electron.

768
00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:57,512
I think I'm... drunk.

769
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:03,296
Where's my big electron?

770
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,950
Gotta find him.

771
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:09,334
Gotta find him.

772
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,141
Gotta find him.

773
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:13,336
Electron!

774
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,763
Cappie, I just...

775
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,078
I really wanted to say that...

776
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:29,911
I really...

777
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:41,794
You're dreaming.
Go to sleep.

778
00:40:57,964 --> 00:41:00,842
- What's this?
- It's a break-up first aid kit.

779
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,152
Jagged little pill.

780
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,000
If I can't be there, Alanis can.

781
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:16,086
We'll figure it out.

782
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,767
So...

783
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,734
We took a little detour last night, huh?

784
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,350
How you feeling?

785
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,860
My eyeballs hurt.

786
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,138
I think something's
growing on my tongue.

787
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:37,798
And I'm missing one sock.

788
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:43,249
- You still need a ride to the airport?
- I'm just gonna take the bus.

789
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:45,178
See if I can get a flight on standby.

790
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:47,663
Listen, a funny little thing
happened last night, and...

791
00:41:53,176 --> 00:41:54,376
What are you doing here?

792
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:56,229
I missed my flight.

793
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,061
You?

794
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:01,835
Long story.

795
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:04,023
You want a ride home?
Ten hours.

796
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,274
I'll tell you everything.

797
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:10,174
Listen, take care, Spitter.

798
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:11,961
Remember next semester,

799
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:13,568
whole new game.

800
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:16,172
And about last night...

801
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:17,272
Next semester.

802
00:42:22,877 --> 00:42:23,910
Take care, buddy.

803
00:42:35,774 --> 00:42:37,224
You ready to get out of here?

804
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:39,837
Let's go home.

805
00:42:58,135 --> 00:42:59,202
<i>Don't touch that.</i>

806
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:03,602
<i>See y'all next semester ;)</i>
