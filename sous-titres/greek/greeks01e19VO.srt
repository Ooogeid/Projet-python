1
00:00:00,105 --> 00:00:02,429
- <i>Previously on</i> Greek
- <i>Enough!</i>

2
00:00:02,576 --> 00:00:05,738
Clearly you people are
unable to regulate yourselves,

3
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:07,754
so from this day forward,

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,845
the university will do it for you.
As dean of students,

5
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:12,340
you'll answer to me now.

6
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:15,816
University Students Against Greeks.
Now the time to politicize my position.

7
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:17,717
- I had posters made up.
- Posters?

8
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:19,618
We gotta grow this thing, Dale.

9
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:22,868
I've got a hammer and the rest
of you guys can just use your shoes.

10
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,463
Much as I disagree with U-SAG,
it's important to Dale.

11
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:29,067
I thought the goal is
to get rid of the Greek system.

12
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:31,486
It is.
Dale wants to do it his way.

13
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,112
- We should mix with those guys.
- Guys or guy?

14
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:36,508
I'll pay you $500
to stay away from Casey.

15
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:38,724
- Like a buy off?
- Call it what you want.

16
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:41,086
- You get out of my face.
- How about $1,000?

17
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,502
- I don't think I'm up for it.
- Another raincheck?

18
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:44,823
I don't think so.

19
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,132
Hold up, guys.

20
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:49,745
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:52,022
So, I was in the neighborhood.

22
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:54,951
I wanted to see if you could
use a study break, having coffee.

23
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:56,451
That's so funny.

24
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:58,851
I was just thinking
I needed some coffee.

25
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,913
- I know you well.
- You do.

26
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,465
Well.

27
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,013
Fluff up your pom-poms, ladies.

28
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,831
This weekend our very own Titans
are taking on the A&M Farmhands

29
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,604
in the Basketball
Conference Championship!

30
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:19,939
There'll be tons going on this week.

31
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:22,551
Starting tomorrow night
with the Spirit Social at Dobler's

32
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,076
and ending with the game on Saturday.

33
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,010
Everyone, bring your Titan spirit!

34
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:30,841
Actually,

35
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,147
a few slacking sisters
didn't make study hours this week

36
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:38,120
so they unfortunately can't attend
the Spirit Social tomorrow night.

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,085
The following pledges:

38
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:42,315
Mandi, Brenda and Rebecca.

39
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:45,376
Who will be missing two
of ZBZ's great traditions:

40
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:47,389
supporting our basketball team

41
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,923
and flirting with
our basketball players.

42
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:52,229
This is so not fair.

43
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,267
And it wouldn't be fair
if you enjoyed the same privileges

44
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:57,758
as girls who've pulled
twice their weight.

45
00:02:00,902 --> 00:02:02,424
Speaking of twice their weight.

46
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:06,087
Sorry, totally lost track of time.
I was at Kappa Tau.

47
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,944
Where you've been every time
there were study hours this week.

48
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,056
I have a 3.0.

49
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,982
What, I have to be
a Rhodes scholar now, too?

50
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:14,374
We'll be thinking of you when we're

51
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:16,342
brushing up against our very hot,

52
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,820
very agile basketball team.

53
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:21,259
And the rest of you,
I'll see at Dobler's.

54
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,735
Hold on, sorry. One more.

55
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,392
An active.

56
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,129
Ashleigh missed study
hours this week, too.

57
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,119
Bedposts.

58
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:40,450
Toughest roll in bowling.

59
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,939
Spitter, come here.

60
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:47,603
All right, you're gonna want
to hit the seven pin at an angle,

61
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:50,078
and launch it into the ten pin, right?

62
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,537
Can I have an ibuprofen first?

63
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:55,537
No pain, no ten bucks from Wade.
Now, strap in.

64
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,413
We are green for go.

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,334
<i>Come on! Keep going.</i>

66
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,492
Come on!

67
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:22,702
Who told you? Ten bucks.

68
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:25,480
Hold up. What was that?
Was that the phone?

69
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,019
It's the call!

70
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,884
Nope, not the call.

71
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,675
Constable.

72
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:39,804
What seems to be the trouble?

73
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:42,618
You guys are over the
designated Greek noise limit.

74
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,314
Noise limit?

75
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:46,702
Yeah. I was just walking the Row

76
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,292
when this little guy hit 82 D's
right outside your house.

77
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,915
I haven't seen readings like
that since the Hannah Montana concert.

78
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:56,885
And I don't apologize for being a fan.

79
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,268
It's... It's the middle of the day!

80
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:01,656
Yeah.

81
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:07,346
You boys stay out of treble.

82
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,699
Treble. Good one.

83
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:13,944
- Yeah, shutting the door now.
- I just said treble instead of trouble.

84
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,231
Yeah. Because there's a B in it!

85
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,433
My God, these restrictions!

86
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:21,750
What's next? We'll have to
stop throwing pledges off the roof?

87
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:26,639
Spitter, get it!

88
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:34,511
By the glory of God

89
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:37,490
and the ingenuity
of Alexander Graham Bell,

90
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:41,204
you have reached the CRU
chapter of the Kappa Tau Fraternity.

91
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,380
- This is Pledge Cartwright...
- Spitter!

92
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,473
Pledge Spitter speaking.

93
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,271
To which brother may I direct your...

94
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,918
No, just ask who it is!

95
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,203
Who's calling?

96
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:59,157
We haven't won in 25 years.

97
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:00,519
Then we're due.

98
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:05,956
Was it the ticket office?

99
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,352
Yeah. We won some kind of lottery.

100
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:12,512
Not just "some kind"

101
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:15,112
of lottery, Spitter,
but the best seats

102
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,683
to the Conference Basketball Finals,

103
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,947
where we will paint our faces,
scream like idiots,

104
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:23,904
and embarrass ourselves
and our hallowed alma mater

105
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:25,662
on national TV.

106
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:29,205
- Courtside!
<i>- Yeah!</i>

107
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,488

111
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:50,446
How could you skip Study
Hours during Spirit Week?

112
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:54,174
Spirit Week doesn't just happen, Case.
It requires planning.

113
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:57,326
Which means, as Social Chair, I have
to sit in meetings with other Social

114
00:05:57,392 --> 00:06:00,073
Chairs to discuss fresh,
fun places for Spirit Night.

115
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,013
Because I missed study hours to do it,

116
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:05,441
my reward is an evening sharing
Cheesaritos and textbooks

117
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:09,130
with a bunch of pledges
while the rest of you party all night.

118
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:10,269
Wait.

119
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:12,384
I'll be all alone.

120
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,792
What if that Lambda Sig
ass-clown Shane's

121
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,342
at the Spirit Social tomorrow night?

122
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,241
Who's going to shoot
dirty looks at him for me?

123
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:19,377
I would've.

124
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:23,274
My grades are great.
Why do I have to do stupid study hours?

125
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,881
Rules suck.

126
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:27,119
In the house, out of the house...

127
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:29,261
Remember when we didn't
have restrictions?

128
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:32,204
When we didn't have party patrol
stamping our hand that we're 21?

129
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,705
- I know I'm 21.
- Or keg limits. Or curfews.

130
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,555
I hate curfews!

131
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:40,453
I miss boys raiding
our fridge after parties.

132
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,545
You think they miss our Hot Pockets?

133
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,044
I think I'm over all rules.

134
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,198
Everywhere,
ever.

135
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:51,737
You know what?

136
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,064
Screw it.

137
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,147
You've done our house a huge service,
Ashleigh Howard,

138
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,067
so

139
00:06:57,261 --> 00:07:00,750
I'm granting you a presidential
pardon on this week's study hours.

140
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,282
Can you do that?

141
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,981
Well, I'm doing it now.

142
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:07,591
I knew our friendship would
pay off big time some day.

143
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:09,981
Yeah!

144
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,307
Hey, frat boy.

145
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:13,741
Tina.

146
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:15,961
You OK walking with the enemy?

147
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,899
Thanks to all my time around Dale,

148
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,430
I'm learning to separate
the sinner from the sin.

149
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,038
You can't be spending that much time
with him. I haven't seen you in weeks.

150
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,387
Did you miss me?

151
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,072
Maybe.

152
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,734
So, you probably hate basketball

153
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:36,183
and think it's this
gender-biased boys'club...

154
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,625
I love basketball!

155
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:40,362
I actually play a
pretty mean point guard.

156
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:41,824
Very aggressive.

157
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:44,223
I'd expect nothing less.

158
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:45,440
Hey, Rusty.

159
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,531
Hey, U-SAG flier?
Greeks are weak.

160
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:49,123
Fight the power, brother.

161
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,959
Hey,
they're gonna trash the leftover pizza

162
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:54,607
at the World Hunger Club
if anyone would like some!

163
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:55,578
Pizza.

164
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:57,214
I'm done for the day.

165
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,729
Sanjay... Carol...

166
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:00,845
You guys are faithless!

167
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:03,130
Looks like anti-Greek
sentiment has fizzled.

168
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,104
We just need a new approach.

169
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,423
- Hey, sir.
- Dale.

170
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,386
Could I interest you
in a free stress test?

171
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,216
Sure.

172
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:12,154
So, why were you asking
me about basketball?

173
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,295
The Conference Finals are Saturday.

174
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:17,296
I was thinking maybe
you'd want to go with me.

175
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:18,618
Where are you going?

176
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:20,298
- I'd love to.
- Great.

177
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,633
They're courtside seats.

178
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:23,788
We can paint our faces or something.

179
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,670
How'd you get courtside?
Tickets aren't on sale yet.

180
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:29,135
It's this lottery thing,
for all the houses.

181
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,353
You mean, only the Greeks were eligible?

182
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,638
No, I mean, we can bring guests.

183
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:38,460
So... Hey, what if we paint
a "G" on my chest and an "O" on yours?

184
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,517
Rusty, you might want to rethink that.

185
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,721
Wait, why should your frats
be rewarded for exclusivity?

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,304
OK, because Greeks have always
been the biggest supporters.

187
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:50,926
And if you think about it, without our
houses, U- SAG probably wouldn't exist.

188
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:54,315
We should thank polluters
for spawning environmental groups?

189
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:55,236
Point, Tina.

190
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,863
Which maybe I should contact since

191
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,422
you decimated half a rainforest
printing these fliers.

192
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:00,429
Nice volley Rus.

193
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,269
The frats won't print rush
propaganda next year? Interesting.

194
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,167
- This is like Wimbledon.
- Oh, my God.

195
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:14,189
He's a divine messenger.

196
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:16,799
Cool.

197
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:39,051
Titans, halt.

198
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:44,582
Hey, we're here for our
Conference Championship tickets.

199
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:46,738
You might have heard that,

200
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,145
Kappa Tau is the winning house.

201
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:50,441
Kappa Tau...

202
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:54,251
You egged the Central State
team bus last year, right?

203
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,273
If we can expedite this,
we're late for Dobler's.

204
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:58,237
Sure.

205
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:00,424
"Uh-oh!"

206
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,220
What "uh-oh?"
What's wrong?

207
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:05,799
- There's a problem with the tickets.
- No, no, there should be no...

208
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,887
Can you check again?

209
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,261
This is kind of the most important
thing that's ever happened to us.

210
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:12,028
So...

211
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,475
I'm trying.

212
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:15,396
It won't let me release them.

213
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:17,353
Well...

214
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:19,991
Give us the tickets!

215
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:22,831
Beaver.
Beaver, calm down.

216
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:26,113
Calm down I'll take care.
I'll take care of this. I am so sorry.

217
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,200
Can you please just...
Nice hat.

218
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,216
I demand satisfaction.

219
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,300
Satisfaction?

220
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:44,958
Where are you going?

221
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,653
It's Evan and Cappie.

222
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,306
You're not dating either of them.

223
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,333
Maybe one of them will throw a punch.

224
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:56,854
I want our tickets!

225
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:58,483
Hey, guys. What's up?

226
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:01,365
Some,
student group complained about Greeks

227
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:03,617
being the only students
in the ticket lottery so.

228
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:07,005
After talks with the dean and
consulting with the other houses...

229
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,927
Skip to the part where
we get our tickets.

230
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:12,575
Since we're still working to have
the administration lighten up on us,

231
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,957
we decided that making an issue
of the tickets now could result

232
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,774
in jeopardizing the bigger picture.

233
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:21,559
Which means we could
lose the battle and the war.

234
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:27,061
Yeah. Our main focus has
to be on ending the restrictions.

235
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,972
And, as administration liaison,
I have the dean's ear.

236
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:30,927
His rear?

237
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,330
And what he wants is
for us to toe the line.

238
00:11:34,356 --> 00:11:36,325
- Now it's about playing by the rules.
- We have!

239
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:39,856
There's been no brawling, no hazing,
no drunken peeing in the Olympic pool...

240
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:41,684
- I heard...
- We weren't drunk.

241
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,542
Look, Cap, we play ball now,

242
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:47,222
down the road we'll be in the position
to take back the reins. And the tickets.

243
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,916
I don't want to play ball,
I want to watch it, courtside!

244
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,199
- This weekend.
- We're not sticking our necks out,

245
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:53,862
and antagonizing the dean

246
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,482
and the Board of Administrators
just to free up your tickets.

247
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:58,251
Besides, from what I've heard,

248
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,490
the Kappa Taus have all
the tickets they can handle.

249
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,172
Evan.

250
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:04,385
Because the Kappa Taus still
remember what it's like to have fun.

251
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:05,973
You know fun, Evs?

252
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,556
F-U...

253
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:09,115
"N"?

254
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:10,733
Nope.

255
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:11,933
That's it.

256
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:21,605
I learned so much from
that center from Australia.

257
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,616
- Seven feet is so the new six-one.
- I know, right?

258
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:28,019
Who knew it could be so hot
talking straight into a guy's pecs?

259
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,527
Did I miss something?

260
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,515
Are study hours no longer required?

261
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,091
We're talking, Becks.

262
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:36,412
Who had the biggest hands?
Number 22 or 46?

263
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:39,130
No, seriously.
Why did Ashleigh get to go tonight

264
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:41,597
while the rest of us sat around
and pretended to study?

265
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:45,064
As ZBZ President, I pardoned her.

266
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:47,744
Ashleigh missed study hours
planning the social events.

267
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,032
- Not hanging out at Kappa Tau.
- With your ex-boyfriend?

268
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,555
- Which is totally irrelevant.
- Right.

269
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:55,129
What about the fact
that she's your best friend?

270
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,484
Is that irrelevant?

271
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,963
No one asked any of the pledges
if we had good excuses for not going.

272
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,765
What are the rules on a president
showing favoritism to her best friend?

273
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:07,100
- She's so awesome.
- I know. Right?

274
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:21,052
Hey,

275
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:24,370
did you have anything to do with the
dean freezing our basketball tickets?

276
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,982
No, that was more Tina's idea.
It's pretty great?

277
00:13:27,252 --> 00:13:28,674
Yeah, real great, Dale.

278
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,171
Rusty, U-SAG needed an issue
to rally people and now we have one.

279
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:33,649
We've got 90 signatures

280
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:36,644
for a resolution to abolish
the Greek ticket lottery altogether.

281
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:39,132
We'll present it at the Board
of Administrators meeting.

282
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,362
Tina's out right now
getting more signatures.

283
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:44,906
Why can't you two just stop
your assault on the Greeks?

284
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:46,123
Rusty, from

285
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:49,210
Dionysus to your present-day acolytes,
the Greeks have embraced

286
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,705
nothing but sacrilege and lust.
I can't stand by.

287
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,799
- These aren't real names.
- What do you mean?

288
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:55,209
Look.

289
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,458
Colonel Mustard?

290
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:58,873
Butts McGee?

291
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,560
All right, this one's real.
Haywood Jablome.

292
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,657
That's not how you pronounce that.

293
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:04,821
I mean.

294
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,454
Think about it.

295
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,523
All right, well,

296
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,536
well, there's some jokers on here,
but most of these are fine.

297
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,868
Can you believe it?
U- SAG's been reborn.

298
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:16,743
Resurrections rock.

299
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,526
It's Watergate all over again.

300
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:29,946
I know. I still can't believe
she pardoned her and we couldn't go.

301
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,413
It's so stupid.

302
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:32,969
Madam President.

303
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:37,135
This is ridiculous.

304
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:39,659
- I'm just going to apologize.
- Good idea.

305
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,377
I wouldn't if I were you.

306
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:42,772
OK, everybody,

307
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,848
it's time to clear the air.

308
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:47,226
I admit it,

309
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,773
I made a mistake.
So there's only one thing I can do.

310
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:51,788
Resign?

311
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:54,242
Apologize.

312
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:57,612
In my mind I was making a small
exception for Ashleigh

313
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:59,773
because of the work
she was doing for the house,

314
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,300
and I realize now

315
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,857
it might seem unfair to not give
the same treatment to everyone else.

316
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:07,072
So
for this week,

317
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:09,802
I'm fully pardoning the rest
of the pledges.

318
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:13,452
I stepped over the line,
and abused my position as president

319
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:14,908
and I was wrong.

320
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:17,441
I screwed up.

321
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:19,137
And I'm sorry.

322
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:23,687
Accepted, Case.
No biggie.

323
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,401
Works for me.

324
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:29,936
Thanks, everyone.

325
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,119
Why would you discuss
the exclusively-Greek ticket lottery

326
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:37,062
with the head of a group
that hates Greeks?

327
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:40,404
I was actually talking about it
to a girl. I was trying to impress her.

328
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:42,400
She's part of U-SAG, too.

329
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:45,145
She's infuriating,
but she's really kinda cute.

330
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,648
Just like you, Spitter.

331
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:49,920
Has it occurred to you that
all the girls you like hate the Greeks?

332
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:52,997
You should really talk to someone
about that. But not your roommate.

333
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:58,442
Listen, Spitter, don't sweat it, OK?

334
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,927
We'll just make a virtue
of this self-destructive vice

335
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:02,420
of yours. Follow your heart.

336
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:03,957
Stay close to Ms. U-SAG.

337
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,168
- See what their next move is.
- Be a spy.

338
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,762
Like Jason Bourne.

339
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:11,499
Or like the monkey
in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

340
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:13,193
What're you gonna do?

341
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,173
I'm gonna handle the
other part of the equation.

342
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:17,524
All right, now run along, little monkey.
Dean Bowman.

343
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:23,442
Nice goat.

344
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,910
Very distinguished.

345
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:26,734
It's a Van Dyke.

346
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:28,977
How racy of you to say so, sir.

347
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:31,802
- Make it quick, Mr. Cappie, I'm busy.
- OK, all right.

348
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:35,573
OK, hypothetically, let's say a bully
comes along and steals a boy's lunch,

349
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:38,078
- and now that boy is real hungry.
- Tragic.

350
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:39,969
The bully shouldn't be stealing lunches.

351
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:42,639
You agree that the lunch
be returned to the rightful owner.

352
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:46,034
Absolutely. Unless the
rightful owner only had the lunch

353
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:49,414
in the first place because he had
exclusive rights to the sandwich shop.

354
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:53,232
No said anything about a sandwich shop.
Maybe he made the sandwich at home.

355
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:55,483
Maybe.
But that wouldn't fit the metaphor.

356
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,658
Are we speaking metaphorically?

357
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:00,697
OK, OK.

358
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,245
We'd like our tickets back.

359
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,900
And now I'm kind of hungry.
I wouldn't mind some lunch.

360
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:07,985
The fate of the tickets is in the
hands of the Board of Administrators.

361
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:11,386
Personally, I believe the lottery
should be rescinded permanently.

362
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:14,127
The Greek system doesn't
deserve special treatment,

363
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:16,341
especially after last
semester's incidents.

364
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:19,046
- This is all part of the new rules.
- Which are overkill!

365
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,007
Overkill or not, they're the rules.

366
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,129
And we all have to live by them.

367
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:25,677
Otherwise, there'd be chaos.

368
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,239
Chaos?

369
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,529
No winning tickets
with a Greek-only lottery.

370
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:46,610
Thank you.

371
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:52,393
Hey, Tina. What a coincidence.
What are you doing here?

372
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:55,164
I had no idea you'd be out here.
What are you up to?

373
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:58,586
Getting signatures to bolster
our position at the Board meeting.

374
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:00,383
What are you up to?

375
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,097
What makes you think I'm up to anything?

376
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:05,604
Because you're acting all nicey-nice.

377
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:08,497
You still want to go to
the basketball game together?

378
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:12,763
Well, that's kind of tricky,
since I no longer have any tickets.

379
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,185
And you know that,

380
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:18,177
because you're the reason
that I and...

381
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,120
... and my brothers, we don't have any.

382
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:25,344
Well, you can still get some.
Just wait in line like everybody else.

383
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,429
I don't care that much
about going to the game.

384
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,742
Then why did you ask me to go with you?

385
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,355
You're really not
making much sense, Rusty.

386
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:34,052
Oh, my God!

387
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:45,673
Excited about the game, Mandi?
You going?

388
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,750
I don't know.

389
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,727
Well, you're totally free
and clear to go and have fun.

390
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,615
Thanks, Big Sis.
How presidential of you.

391
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:56,980
Can I skip study hours next week, Casey?

392
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,875
I need to help plan
our philanthropy project.

393
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:01,744
That sounds like a good excuse to me.

394
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:06,114
I screwed up. I said so.
There will be no more exceptions.

395
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:07,914
Two wrongs don't make a right.

396
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:09,207
But wait.

397
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:11,423
My boyfriend is gonna
be in town for a few days.

398
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,693
I want to spend as much
time with him as possible.

399
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:16,045
Is boyfriend time a pardonable offense?

400
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:17,137
He's pre-med.

401
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:20,833
We could practice CPR during study hours
then I could teach it to the house.

402
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:22,247
Excellent!

403
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,889
OK, you guys, can't we just let this go?

404
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:26,890
Yeah, sure.

405
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:29,318
I mean, it's not like
my love life is more important

406
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:33,896
than giving your BFF the opportunity
to ogle hot jocks at Dobler's.

407
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:37,823
Thanks a lot.

408
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,740
Pardon me?
You were saying?

409
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:48,383
Thanks.
Good night.

410
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,933
Thank you.
Have a good evening.

411
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:03,305
Jeez.

412
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:06,481
You are way above the Greek noise limit!

413
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:09,209
Hysterical.

414
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:11,397
- Now get out of here.
- Before we do sir,

415
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:14,957
if you wouldn't mind blowing into this
before you drive your lovely date home.

416
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,328
I will not.

417
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,313
What is this?

418
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:21,378
That? That's a 500-dollar ticket.

419
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,950
In crayon?

420
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,001
I noticed you had a keg in there.

421
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:27,412
According to campus regulations
you were supposed to check Ids

422
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,190
and pass out wristbands.

423
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,813
Everyone was over 50.

424
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:33,056
How'd you know if you didn't card 'em?

425
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,773
We all need to live by the rules.

426
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:40,778
Your exact words, if I'm not mistaken.

427
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,366
Exact words.

428
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,764
Excuse me, Sloan.

429
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,236
And your solution to rules
you don't like would be...?

430
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,713
Change them?

431
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:55,100
You really willing to do what
it takes to change the rules?

432
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:59,023
OK, but no kissing.
It's too personal.

433
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,611
If you want your tickets back,

434
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,822
come to the Board of Administrators
meeting tomorrow afternoon.

435
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:10,615
- Present your case.
- Great, we'll talk some b-ball.

436
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,248
Get our tickets back before the game.

437
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,661
We're not just talking
about the ticket lottery.

438
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:16,840
- We're not?
- No.

439
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:20,152
I plan to recommend that all
the restrictions be made permanent.

440
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:22,790
You argue the Greek position.

441
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:26,537
If you can convince the board,
you win, the tickets are yours

442
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,201
and the Greeks will get
all their privileges back.

443
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,014
And,

444
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,364
- if I don't convince them?
- You lose it all. For good.

445
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:40,819
Good night.

446
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,046
Good night.

447
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:47,269
'Night.

448
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,284
Drive safely.

449
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:51,592
Thanks.

450
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,129
Well, nice work, man.

451
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:04,601
You made this a huge deal
when it didn't need to be.

452
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:07,121
Must use last bomb wisely.

453
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:08,300
Are you listening?

454
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:10,684
Now the fate of the entire
Greek system is in the hands

455
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,692
of a flaky, alcoholic degenerate.

456
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,436
I am not an alcoholic.

457
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:17,558
I'm Skulltar, intergalactic hero.

458
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:20,657
Look, I typed these up for you, Cappie.

459
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,936
They're talking points for today.

460
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,365
Consider them damage control and a gift.

461
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,485
Do not need them.

462
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:30,512
I've got a gravity blaster with an
entropy shield. I should be fine.

463
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:33,831
Point n°1: "Greeks provide housing
that the school will have to make up

464
00:22:33,871 --> 00:22:35,861
for should restrictions
drive students from rush."

465
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:39,203
Point two: "The Chrilon Nebula
is the source of all planetary grief."

466
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:40,815
Hey!

467
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,207
All right.

468
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,059
***

469
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:56,176
I think I'll be just fine
without your talking points.

470
00:22:56,302 --> 00:22:58,579
Go paddle up your back channel,
Evan-escence.

471
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,432
Leave the up-front stuff to me.

472
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:04,235
You're playing Fight Night, Skulltar.

473
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:08,669
I am?

474
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:19,311
I don't even get a "hello" anymore?

475
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:23,080
I'm gonna really have to rethink
this whole friendship thing, Case.

476
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,906
I didn't even see you there.

477
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,324
I guess I'm a little distracted.

478
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,209
Go ahead, sit down.
I could use a break.

479
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,600
Sorry, I...

480
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:46,219
- Force of habit.
- It's OK. It's not mine.

481
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:53,136
So, what are you doing?

482
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:56,905
Background check on the professors
on the Board of Administrators.

483
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:59,325
Seeing if there's
any strings I can pull.

484
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,360
I might have to do
some influence peddling.

485
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,916
You really think Cappie's
going to tank this thing?

486
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:09,244
Well, the Zbzs will be in
the front row to show our support.

487
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:11,873
Yeah, no offense,

488
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:15,743
but I think the Zbzs
should probably lay low on this one.

489
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:17,688
Just 'cause we don't
want to remind the board

490
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,547
where all the restrictions started.

491
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,492
Right.

492
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,123
- Rules suck.
- Yeah.

493
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,984
I think we should make
a rule against rules.

494
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:26,771
- You would have my vote.
- I could use it.

495
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:30,274
I sort made this presidential decision
that the girls aren't too keen on.

496
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:34,262
Rebecca called me out and
the reaction has been crazy.

497
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,464
I apologized, but no one's buying it.

498
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,479
What'd Frannie say?

499
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,027
You're not serious.

500
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:43,242
I know Frannie's made
some pretty big mistakes,

501
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:45,441
but she and I talked a bit

502
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:49,514
during the ZBZ days. She actually
gave me some really good advice.

503
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,246
People can surprise you.

504
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:01,439
Hey.

505
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,177
Hey, yourself.

506
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,424
Behold, Rusty.

507
00:25:04,714 --> 00:25:06,201
The U-SAG heart beats strong.

508
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:09,069
Hey, Sanjay, give me my phone sheet.
I'm gonna roll some calls.

509
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,524
U- SAG, Greeks are weak.

510
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,428
- I'll get the phone sheet.
- Yeah, thank you.

511
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:18,586
Dale, this is our room, not yours.

512
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,596
I'm trying to calculate how
much funds we have for a media buy.

513
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:25,352
Sorry.

514
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:31,752
- Dale, why are you doing this to me?
- More boldface.

515
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:33,355
Go crazy with the boldface.

516
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:35,835
To you? Rusty, this is for you, OK?

517
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:38,899
The way I see it, I'm saving
your peeps from eternal damnation.

518
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:41,202
I'm your own personal
"Get Out of Hell Free" card.

519
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,720
- Why are you wearing a suit?
- It's for my speech.

520
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:44,921
Your speech?

521
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,073
We got 300 signatures.

522
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:49,803
I am the vessel through
which those voices must be heard.

523
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:09,467
Frannie,

524
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,361
can I talk to you?

525
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:14,050
Of course. What's up?

526
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:17,777
I was hoping I could get
some advice about the house.

527
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,684
Absolutely.

528
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:24,699
Anything I can do.

529
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:28,777
It's about the whole
study hours debacle.

530
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:32,191
Some of the girls are
starting to dismiss you?

531
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,500
Disregard you?

532
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:36,016
Yep.

533
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,972
Case,

534
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:40,546
there's a reason
why bees have a queen.

535
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:42,819
Otherwise,
it's just a big hive mentality.

536
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,732
The girls are starting
to question your authority

537
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:46,494
and

538
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:48,937
you need to stop the swarm
before they revolt.

539
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:50,581
You're saying I've lost control?

540
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:53,575
You will if you keep trying
to win them over with honey.

541
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:55,358
You're the president, poodle.

542
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,809
- You're not one of them anymore.
- But how do I turn this back around?

543
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:00,682
I said I was sorry publicly.

544
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,382
Did President Ford

545
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:04,764
apologize for pardoning Nixon?

546
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:07,464
No.

547
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:11,165
Do you think you were
wrong to pardon Ashleigh?

548
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:14,043
Not completely.

549
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,444
Then stop apologizing.

550
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:18,300
They want their pound of flesh.

551
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,360
Hell, they'll take every pound
you give them. But they don't need it.

552
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:23,416
One pound is all they get.

553
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:26,123
Set up a forum,
let them vent,

554
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:29,422
and then shut them down.

555
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:31,053
Vent,

556
00:27:31,874 --> 00:27:32,831
shut down.

557
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,210
You can't show people
where they need to go

558
00:27:36,758 --> 00:27:38,387
if you don't step out in front.

559
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:47,804
Admit it. A little humble pie now and
then is good for Princess Cartwright.

560
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,832
You know my stance
on Ex and Becks fighting.

561
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:53,329
I know, you're Switzerland.

562
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,889
That's a big no on the headdress,
Pocahontas.

563
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:58,845
Come on. I'll score points
with the anthropology professor.

564
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:01,833
Spitter, what do you think?

565
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:04,912
Native American headdress
or Scottish kilt?

566
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:06,259
Maybe both.

567
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,710
Forget the costumes, Cappie.
You need to focus on your speech.

568
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,029
Because U-SAG is gaining
some serious traction

569
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:14,949
and Dale's gonna be speaking for
them against you at the meeting today.

570
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:16,878
Well, I'll just have to go naked, then.

571
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:19,957
- Welcome to 40 minutes ago.
- This isn't a joke, Cap.

572
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:21,917
Dale's got a secret weapon.

573
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:23,876
You've never seen me naked.

574
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:26,851
It's this girl, Tina.

575
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:29,120
She is relentless, man.

576
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,483
She's constantly disagreeing,
taking the opposite position,

577
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:35,161
saying these really
annoying things in this

578
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:37,533
gratingly reasonable tone

579
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:39,736
with this chestnut brown hair

580
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:42,251
and this all-innocent smile

581
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:45,797
and these amazingly intense
eyes that just lock onto you like

582
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:47,406
she's trying to bend a spoon,

583
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:50,649
and she wears this hypnotic perfume...

584
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,697
Oh, my God,
just have sex with her already.

585
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:55,434
I'm about to puke.

586
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,195
Sex with her?

587
00:28:58,466 --> 00:28:59,676
I'm gonna kill her!

588
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,058
It's perfectly reasonable to
be attracted to someone you can't stand.

589
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,462
- Rugh?
- Not you, sweetie.

590
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:08,062
What my little siren is saying, Rus,

591
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:11,275
is the only way you're gonna
get Tina off your mind, is if you...

592
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:13,421
... do something about it.

593
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:16,719
Like what?

594
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:18,787
Well,

595
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:22,103
a date is a good place to start.
Why don't you go buy her a malt?

596
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,533
He's really hopeless.

597
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:29,272
Just like his sister.
I'm Switzerland.

598
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:32,485
What do you think of this?

599
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,936
That's not mine.
I know, it's mine.

600
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,011
I gathered everyone who
may still have issues about the...

601
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,661
... study hours

602
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:48,056
situation,

603
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,771
so that each of you
may have a chance to

604
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:53,798
- air your grievances.
- And the cat is here why?

605
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,573
Let's call this "a kitty passing."

606
00:29:57,512 --> 00:30:00,224
This is your chance
to speak with impunity.

607
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:05,350
Like the conch in Lord of the Flies.

608
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,593
Whoever holds Pussywillow the Cat

609
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,045
speaks. Everyone else listens.

610
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:14,677
Say your piece,
then pass her to the next girl.

611
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:16,526
Laura, we'll start with you.

612
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:18,046
Thanks.

613
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:22,545
I think that what you did,
Casey, was awful.

614
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,071
You undermined my office
of Scholarship Chair,

615
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:26,899
and you infected this house

616
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,554
with a cancer
from which it may never be cured.

617
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:32,172
Proud to be a Zeta Beta.

618
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:37,989
Well, I think Laura here
should get a boyfriend

619
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:41,939
or a hobby. Unless looking
for a boyfriend is her hobby.

620
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:45,299
- Bite me!
- I've got the conch!

621
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:53,498
- Everyone, sit down now!
- Because you trashed Casey.

622
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,790
- Because Casey messed up.
- Wait your turn.

623
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,701
- I spoke with impunity.
- I spoke with impunity, too!

624
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,579
- It's OK.
- Shut up!

625
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:03,422
- Sorry, Casey.
- This is so lame.

626
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:06,276
Yeah, I guess only actives get to shout.

627
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:07,833
What's that smell?

628
00:31:09,842 --> 00:31:11,013
Pussywillow!

629
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,921
You had Pussywillow last. Your fault.
My fault?

630
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,157
Yeah!
That should be minus hours.

631
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:28,643
Girls!

632
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:32,297
Everyone has had their say.

633
00:31:33,756 --> 00:31:34,751
Well, I didn't.

634
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,144
That wasn't a question.

635
00:31:36,212 --> 00:31:39,456
We're moving on. You can
start by putting these chairs away.

636
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,215
Study hours are still mandatory.
For everyone.

637
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:45,397
Check the letters on the front of
the house. This is Zeta Beta Zeta,

638
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:47,276
the best house on campus.

639
00:31:47,494 --> 00:31:50,362
Don't act like anything less
ever again.

640
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:17,542
Rusty, hi.

641
00:32:18,346 --> 00:32:19,790
What are you doing here?

642
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:21,939
I brought you a malt.

643
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:25,979
Look, Rusty, if you're here
to get a preview of Dale's speech...

644
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:26,799
I'm not.

645
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:29,648
Then why are you here?

646
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:32,126
To bring you a malt.

647
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:34,390
I don't think so.

648
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,490
Why do you think I'm here?

649
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:40,642
You tell me.

650
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:45,477
No, because whatever I say,
you'll disagree with it.

651
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,579
Is that a problem?

652
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,220
Should it be?

653
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,691
Are you as turned on right now as I am?

654
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,861
You smell good.

655
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:09,275
Are you sure?

656
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,610
- Shut up.
- I'm OK...

657
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:22,272
<i>This is why we must picket.</i>

658
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:24,209
<i>Lose the Greeks and their tickets!</i>

659
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,135
<i>Greeks deserve to have some fun.</i>

660
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:28,083
<i>Babes and courtside, number one!</i>

661
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:29,911
<i>Greeks deserve to have some fun.</i>

662
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,781
<i>Babes and courtside, number one!</i>

663
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:33,689
<i>This is why we must picket.</i>

664
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:35,433
<i>Lose the Greeks and their tickets!</i>

665
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:37,402
<i>Donna Martin graduates!</i>

666
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,724
<i>Donna Martin graduates!</i>

667
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:42,202
<i>Donna Martin graduates!</i>

668
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:52,394
So, what do you do when a system,
a society, doesn't work?

669
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,490
Do you just allow it to consume itself,

670
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:56,520
to take down those around it?

671
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:58,959
No. You fix it,
but

672
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,410
not by turning the job over
to the very same men and women

673
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:04,380
who destroy it in the first place.

674
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:14,561
Thank you, Mr. Kettlewell.
Your remarks were insightful and...

675
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:18,428
It makes me wonder what God would've
done in a similar situation. Like,

676
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,996
I don't know, Sodom and Gomorrah?

677
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:24,173
Our next speaker is Mr. Cappie.

678
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:26,319
Then the Lord rained
down fire and brimstone,

679
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:29,547
turning their cities to ashes
and condemning them to destruction."

680
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,490
- I'm just paraphrasing Genesis.
- Mr. Cappie, are you ready?

681
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:36,409
That's right, the big G flew in,
cleaned house and took names.

682
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:39,362
You know what, if he can smite
a sodomite every now and then,

683
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,769
why can't we do the same?

684
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,932
Why can't we make our world
a better place by getting rid of them?

685
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:47,501
Sodom and Gomorrah, fraternities
and sorities, Greeks and goblins,

686
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:50,840
Cheech & Chong, these are the same
hippie lettuce smoking enemies

687
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,684
of righteousness that we should
ship right back to old Scratch himself!

688
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,323
Return to sender!

689
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:58,173
Yeah!

690
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,085
Hey, I was great.
I was great.

691
00:35:15,162 --> 00:35:16,082
Mr. Cappie?

692
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:19,052
Two minutes.

693
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:25,452
Strangely,
I agree with the crazy person here.

694
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:29,010
We Greeks can often be irresponsible

695
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:30,342
and reckless.

696
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:32,976
But I don't regret anything I've done

697
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:35,083
and neither should anybody here,

698
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,229
because screwing up is
what college is all about.

699
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:41,174
Learning from your
mistakes and all that.

700
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,358
Yet, if you deny us
our chances to fail now,

701
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:48,337
it's gonna be a lot harder
for us to play catch-up in the future.

702
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:50,134
Honestly, what's worse,

703
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,579
hooking up with Dean Bowman's
secretary now

704
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:55,458
or fooling around with your boss'wife
later on?

705
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,211
Let's take you, for example.

706
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:01,608
You look like you might have
been interesting a long time ago.

707
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:03,811
You'd know,
if you hadn't dropped my class.

708
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:07,651
But even if I stuck around, wouldn't you
agree, no matter how great your class,

709
00:36:08,193 --> 00:36:11,972
it would still be a very, very small
part of the college experience?

710
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,305
- Yes, maybe, but...
- Time!

711
00:36:14,787 --> 00:36:16,867
We will consider your presentation,
Mr. Cappie.

712
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:19,458
Dean Bowman, I'm not
finished yet. Sorry.

713
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:20,668
The rules.

714
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,455
Dean Bowman,

715
00:36:24,296 --> 00:36:27,730
as Greek liaison I'd like to be allowed
two minutes to speak?

716
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:30,038
Fine, Mr. Chambers.

717
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:35,902
I was gonna talk about housing,
philanthropies, student funds, but,

718
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,452
I'm realizing that had Cappie
been allowed to extend

719
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:41,418
his rare moment of lucidity,

720
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:43,794
you would have realized
that he was right.

721
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,926
Professor Hebert, in school

722
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:50,698
you founded Student
Anarchists Disunited.

723
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:53,445
If the government was looking
over your shoulder, you'd be the first

724
00:36:53,524 --> 00:36:55,261
to chain yourself to a building.

725
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,156
Because S.A.D.
stood for something!

726
00:36:57,273 --> 00:36:58,550
- Like loyalty.
- Yeah!

727
00:36:58,648 --> 00:36:59,624
Friendship,

728
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:00,855
brotherhood.

729
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:04,342
Professor Adams, you went Psi Phi at CRU

730
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:08,305
and became a campus legend when
you put A&M's cow in the bell tower.

731
00:37:08,868 --> 00:37:12,898
That's an interesting way to start
a career as a world-renowned zoologist.

732
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,285
And let's not forget another
significant figure

733
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:17,089
in this room, who back in the day...

734
00:37:17,244 --> 00:37:21,185
Well, let's just say he majored in
psychoactive horticulture?

735
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:23,627
He was evicted from
three dorms in a semester.

736
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:26,684
If anyone need 24/7 restrictions,
it would be this guy.

737
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:29,101
What if he wasn't allowed
to make those mistakes,

738
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,048
and there was quite a few.

739
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,221
Would he have spent his entire life
overseeing the well-being young people?

740
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:37,762
I mean, would you...

741
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:41,538
... Dean Bowman?

742
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,812
I think we've heard enough.

743
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:52,371
Meeting adjourned.

744
00:38:05,946 --> 00:38:08,619
<i>... heading to the North,
where we're two hours away from</i>

745
00:38:08,649 --> 00:38:12,596
<i>the A&M Farmhands meeting
up with the CRU Titans.</i>

746
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:15,642
<i>This game has huge playoff implications.</i>

747
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:18,464
Everybody, listen up.

748
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,243
The restrictions have been lifted!

749
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,053
Congratulations.

750
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,311
Somebody's riding high.

751
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,282
Not high enough, though.

752
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:37,959
I may have saved the Greek system,
but unfortunately that includes the Kts.

753
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:41,285
It's a small price to pay.
I mean, you're a hero.

754
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,001
And a great advisor.

755
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,469
Thanks to your recommendation,
I consulted Frannie,

756
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:49,069
and she was instrumental
in helping me regain trust,

757
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:51,759
- authority, and control at the house.
- Great.

758
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,614
You suggested I talk to Casey?

759
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:55,897
Yes, I did.

760
00:38:57,745 --> 00:38:59,775
Well, thank you.

761
00:39:00,878 --> 00:39:03,852
Here's to everything
working out for the best.

762
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:08,168
A toast for getting those
restrictions off our backs.

763
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:09,751
To Evan Chambers!

764
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:13,687
To Cappie!

765
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:17,471
No restrictions and
awesome basketball tickets!

766
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,171
Courtside seats, baby.

767
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:23,390
Spitter,

768
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:25,567
you had sex!

769
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,347
How do you do that?

770
00:39:28,378 --> 00:39:29,118
Well,

771
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:31,187
it's a gift and a curse.

772
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:34,771
It's weird to like and not
like someone at the same time.

773
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,964
Yeah, tell me about it.

774
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:49,833
It's gonna be long time
I still don't like her.

775
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:51,834
Thank you.

776
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,242
Hey.

777
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,319
How you doing, Dale?

778
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:19,778
In the wake of today's
landmark decision?

779
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:21,733
I've disbanded U-SAG.

780
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:25,636
I'm sorry and I'm not sorry,
if you know what I mean.

781
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:27,869
Yeah,

782
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,367
it's all right. I mean, but it wasn't
really working, anyway.

783
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:36,617
Hey, you hear that?

784
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,036
It's your speech.

785
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:42,473
Yeah.

786
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:44,803
Somebody must've put it on the Internet.

787
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:48,593
<i>... both the enemies of
righteousness It sounds like</i>

788
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:53,066
They're really responding to it

789
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,487
next door.

790
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:58,149
Sure, Dale.

791
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,754
So, you must be thrilled.

792
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:07,391
A big victory for the Greeks, you
don't have to deal with Tina anymore.

793
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:16,308
Kettlewell.
Hey, Tina.

794
00:41:16,912 --> 00:41:18,649
You missing the cause already or...

795
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:20,050
What?

796
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,970
Yeah, hold on.

797
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,531
She wants to talk to you.

798
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:27,457
- Are you guys friends or something now?
- Not exactly.

799
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:38,626
What a game.

800
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:41,834
Hey, Beaver, rember when
you dropped your pants at halftime?

801
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,220
That was you.

802
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:47,681
Hey, what's harder to believe?

803
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:49,740
That we lost?

804
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,334
Or that Bowman used
to smoke the hippie lettuce?

805
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:56,730
Although,
I thought his eyes seemed red once.

806
00:41:56,857 --> 00:42:00,330
That's only one more reason
he deserves our respect.

807
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:02,293
He was a formidable opponent.

808
00:42:02,593 --> 00:42:05,322
Everyone,
can I have your attention, please?

809
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:07,116
This

810
00:42:07,946 --> 00:42:09,273
to Dean Bowman,

811
00:42:10,434 --> 00:42:11,976
this one is for you.

812
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:29,825
I got it.

813
00:42:30,496 --> 00:42:31,238
<i>Wait...</i>

814
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,240
<i>- Beaver... Beaver, don't...!
- Something's on fire.</i>
