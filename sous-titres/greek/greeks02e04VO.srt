00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,268
<i>Previously on</i> Greek...

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,965
With everything happening right now,
my parents' divorce,

3
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:05,709
my father's trial, Zeta Beta,

4
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,631
I need something more
than just fun.

5
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:09,638
I can step up and be that guy.

6
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:11,872
I know you can, Cap.
But just not for me.

7
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,850
- So, are we...?
- Broken up?

8
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,462
Yeah. I guess so.

9
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:17,687
I don't have a lot in common
with {/a bunch of}fraternity guys.

10
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,940
- I'm a fraternity guy.
- {/A fraternity guy}Interested in me.

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,264
It's different.

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,318
It's my credit card bill!

13
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:25,111
- Thirteen hundred?
- Dollars?

14
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:26,946
I have to get a job, Case.

15
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:29,616
Max, this is my sister, Casey.

16
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:31,660
We should get you out more.

17
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,329
Maybe. I don't know.
I... I gotta go, though.

18
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:36,498
Goodbye, Casey.

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,590
So, if the light we're seeing
is millions of years old,

20
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:48,130
then the stars might
already be dead.

21
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,217
But it's not just the stars

22
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:52,013
that are in the past.
It's everything.

23
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,184
Even you looking at me now.

24
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,631
So, you're not you?

25
00:00:58,346 --> 00:00:59,646
No, I'm me.

26
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:02,501
But you're seeing me
one billionth of a second ago.

27
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:05,615
So...

28
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:09,063
everything is history

29
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:11,199
and relationships
are just memories.

30
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:12,850
Except for the light.

31
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,515
Which is in its own present,

32
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:18,623
our past and someone else's future.

33
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,846
The Hawking of Hearts.

34
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:29,058
You know what that means?

35
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,686
What?
Why are you staring at me?

36
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:45,489
You were making out
with your pillow.

37
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:46,719
No, I wasn't!

38
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:49,126
Must have been
an awesome dream.

39
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:50,989
You were drooling.

40
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,836
I don't drool!

41
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,079
Much.

42
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:59,622
All right.
Lightning round.

43

44

is a Pisces,

45
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,044
and can't live without
cuts two, three and eight

46
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:06,605
from <i>The Best of Sting</i>.

47
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,383
- Ferret.
- He is such a romantic.

48
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:11,926
Afraid of apricots?

49
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,997
- Wingnut!
- That's Heath.

50
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:15,764
Heath is correct. Wingnut?

51
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:18,641
This active recognition test is
gonna be tough. I mean, likes,

52
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:21,504
dislikes, embarrassing secrets...

53
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:24,439
I know more about the actives
now than I ever wanted to know.

54
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,626
Except for this guy.
Joshua Whopper.

55
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,048
Isn't that the guy who's always
carrying a knife?

56
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:30,815
Whoever it is,
we better figure it out

57
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:33,073
or we're scrubbing toilets
until initiation.

58
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,708
Empty your wallets.

59
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,083
- Why?
- Lunch buffet.

60
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:42,081
You're shaking us down
for a strip club?

61
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,788
It's not just any strip club.
It's Gentlemen's Choice.

62
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,167
We need to make a Cappie trip.

63
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,340
Last time Cappie
went to the strip club

64
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,938
was when he was...
Oh, no.

65
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:53,993
No one mentions Rebecca.

66
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:58,760
Hey, Cap, so you broke up
with Reb...

67
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,458
You weren't supposed to...

68
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,580
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

69
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:05,697
- Why?
- Beaver.

70
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,115
- I'm fine.

71
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:09,984
So, I can get
my money back then?

72
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:13,238
Any last minute questions
on the active recognition test?

73
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:15,490
- ART's in two days.
- I have one.

74
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,209
I took the liberty of downloading
National's list of current actives.

75
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:20,613
Suck up.

76
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,248
There's an active on
the list no one has ever seen.

77
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:24,587
Or ever met.

78
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,417
Who's Joshua Whopper?

79
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:33,320
Extra points for being
industrious, Spitter,

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,426
but don't worry about him.
He's not on the test.

81
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:38,464
OK, yeah, but according
to the rules of the Arts,

82
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,848
each pledge must
know every active.

83
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:42,762
But not Joshua.

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,681
Trust me.

85
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,187
Leave the Whopper alone.

89
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:10,433
Rebecca's been eating her feelings
since 7:00 this morning.

90
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:12,328
It's her second box of cereal.

91
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,647
I wonder if
she'll give away her clothes.

92
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:17,019
I wouldn't mind that
Marc Jacobs cocktail dress.

93
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,803
It was already
pretty tight on her.

94
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:20,174
She and Cappie broke up.

95
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:21,594
What?

96
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:22,728
Really?

97
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:28,535
Looking for a job is way harder
than I thought.

98
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:30,607
What about babysitting?

99
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:34,277
And what about your irrational
fear of little people?

100
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,281
Good point.

101
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,947
You know, I'm actually thinking
of hiring an astronomy tutor.

102
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:42,410
I could help.

103
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,662
- I love looking at the stars.
- That's what I thought

104
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:46,953
the class was going to be about
when I signed up for it.

105
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,868
But all we're learning about is

106
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,846
black holes, dark matter,

107
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,337
alternative universes.

108
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:54,767
- Why don't you drop it?
- I still need one science course

109
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:56,079
for general ed.

110
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,676
So, who do you think I can get
to help me?

111
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:02,722
Ivy took it last semester.

112
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,280
Ivy?

113
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:07,560
I think we're in a fight
or something.

114
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,604
What about Rusty?
He's science-y.

115
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,623
And that worked out
so well the last time.

116
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,691
Oh, wait. What about Max?

117
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:16,234
Max?

118
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,568
Rusty's friend Max.

119
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:22,533
He must know all about astronomy.
He worked for NASA or something I think.

120
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,663
- He's probably pretty busy.
- Yeah, you're right.

121
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,700
Still, it couldn't hurt to ask.

122
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:31,417
Thanks.

123
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,600
Joshua Whopper looks exactly
like Abraham Lincoln.

124
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,149
- You see the problem?

125
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:58,117
The 16th president of the United States
was a Kappa Tau?

126
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,540
Guys, get the fact that Abe
is about 200 years old

127
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,157
and was not a Kappa Tau.

128
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:04,618
This is a trap.

129
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,798
We have no idea
who Joshua Whopper is.

130
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,658
Which means,
when Cappie said, "Trust me,"

131
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,521
he probably meant,
"Don't trust me."

132
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,927
Which means Josh Whopper

133
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:14,056
is going to be on
the active recognition test.

134
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:15,814
And after every one of us fails

135
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:19,258
we're going to be breaking out
the gas masks, Hazmat suits,

136
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,524
and we're gonna go
on porcelain patrol until initiation.

137
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:24,929
We gotta find the Whopper.

138
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,266
How do we do that?

139
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,725
We look for a guy
with a beard and a funny hat.

140
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,585
It's you.

141
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,571
Yes. And you're you?

142
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,158
You're probably wondering

143
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:47,660
what I'm doing here.

144
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,134
Would...
Actually, I was thinking about...

145
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:56,520
That's not really relevant now.
So...

146
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:02,216
I really need a tutor
for Intro to Astronomy.

147
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,593
And I know it's not
your major specifically,

148
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:07,337
but Rusty mentioned
you had some connection to NASA.

149
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:09,131
Which got me thinking...

150
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,486
I really need help
with the class.

151
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:14,153
Max... NASA...

152
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,683
So I'm here.

153
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:22,111
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

154
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:25,907
It didn't go too well
with blackjack and Casino Night.

155
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:29,616
Well, I'm big on second chances.

156
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,705
Actually, I'm big
on third and fourth chances, too.

157
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:34,182
Could you do tonight?

158
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,825
8:00 here?

159
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,656
Sounds... intimate.

160
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:42,715
Well, it's just... where I live.

161
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,379
Excuse me, Miss Brown?

162
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:07,966
Sorry. I'm the new guy.

163
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:10,127
And I don't want
to be a nark or anything,

164
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:12,230
but I just saw a woman
from admissions

165
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,289
throw away her recycle bin
'cause she said she hated the earth.

166
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:17,750
Was it Constance?
Big redhead?

167
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,739
Show me, please. Thank you.

168
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:22,019
I can't stand her.

169
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,474
I mean, who does that?

170
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,613
I've talked to her before
about this.

171
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:37,571
Password protected.

172
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,238
How long is this gonna
take you to hack in?

173
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,416
Well, with the 256 bit encryption
and double coded keys,

174
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:45,620
between two hours and never.

175
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:47,707
I need her password.

176
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:49,824
Uh... Jordan.

177
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:53,828
Sarah...

178
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:56,998
Arlo...

179
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:00,339
Hey, you know what I always do?

180
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,405
I always tape my password
to my top drawer.

181
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,065
No one does that anymore.

182
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:09,685
Password.

183
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:12,930
All right, we're in.

184
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,350
Joshua Whopper.

185
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:19,501
Physics 405,

186
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:22,625
English Lit 320, Chemistry 401.

187
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:24,221
Straight A's?

188
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:25,735
Wait a second.

189
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:28,385
There's a Kappa Tau
that's smarter than you?

190
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:30,364
Yeah, it appears so.

191
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:36,370
And he has a class tomorrow
at Lasker Parks Hall.

192
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:37,788
Let's go.

193
00:09:41,993 --> 00:09:44,434
<i>40 Year Old Virgin</i>
is a masterpiece.

194
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:46,631
Although <i>Knocked Up</i>
runs a close second.

195
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:50,493
But don't you think
Judd Apatow's movies can be...

196
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:53,179
a little misogynistic,
kind of homophobic?

197
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,954
Was it the chest waxing thing?

198
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,975
No, it was the "you know
how I know you're gay" thing.

199
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,241
It objectifies gay life.

200
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,292
So now you're gonna
teach me about being gay?

201
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,309
If I recall, last night
I taught you a few things.

202
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:07,610
A point taken.

203
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:10,784
But how many other gay people
do you hang out with?

204
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,350
I mean, besides me?

205
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:14,557
Is that a trick question?

206
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:17,584
Fine. None.

207
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,736
Then you have to admit

208
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:22,487
that your world view
is slightly limited.

209
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:26,535
Which is...

210
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:31,342
why I was thinking we could go
to Gentlemen's Choice.

211
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:35,012
You want to go to a strip club?

212
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,660
No, the other
Gentlemen's Choice.

213
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,427
The hottest... Well...

214
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,375
only gay bar in Cyprus.

215
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:44,706
We'll meet up with some of
my friends, we'll hang out.

216
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:46,220
Trash Judd Apatow...

217
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:50,027
You've never been to a gay bar,
have you?

218
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:54,741
I just don't really like tight
shirts and guys in Daisy Dukes.

219
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:57,183
Don't mock what you don't know.

220
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,161
Besides,
that's not Gentlemen's Choice.

221
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:01,863
Come on. It wouldn't hurt you
to actually hang out

222
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:04,180
with other gay people
every now and then.

223
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,086
Who knows. Maybe you'll
even meet a friend or two.

224
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:10,279
It's time to broaden
your horizons.

225
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,181
Spread my big gay wings?

226
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:21,600
So you break through the line and no one
touches you, you keep on rolling.

227
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:23,102
That's inertia.

228
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,229
That's Newton's first law of motion.

229
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:28,190
Then you power right through
an undersize fullback.

230
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:30,280
That's Newton's second law, force.

231
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,277
Hell, yeah.

232
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,779
OK. Then the third law.

233
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,196
You hit the quarterback,
knock him out cold.

234
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,035
For every action there is
an equal and opposite reaction.

235
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,789
Hell, yeah.

236
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:55,468
Max, I was hoping
to understand gamma ray bursts.

237
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:57,595
OK, yeah. That's a rocket

238
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,848
of electromagnetic energy
created by a collapsing star.

239
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:04,075
Kind of a good and bad thing
if one heads our way.

240
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:06,520
- Bad first.
- Well, the world would plunge

241
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,275
into darkness,
polar ice caps would melt

242
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,611
and deep sea creatures
would rule the earth.

243
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,152
And the good?

244
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:15,249
Well, no more student loans.

245
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:17,005
Got it.

246
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,515
But that would never happen, right?

247
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:25,433
No matter how invested you are
in your view of the universe,

248
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:28,141
you have to be prepared
for things to change.

249
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:32,982
Are we talking about gamma rays

250
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:34,799
or something else?

251
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,010
I don't know...

252
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:41,679
Maybe neither.

253
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:57,228
That's not something you see every day.

254
00:12:57,348 --> 00:12:59,780
- What?
- Cappie on campus.

255
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:15,711
Dr. Shapiro?

256
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:17,927
If you have any questions
about today's lecture,

257
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,489
my office hours are this
afternoon from 3:00-5:00.

258
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,579
No, I'm fine with today's lecture.

259
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,246
Actually, I'm not even in your class.

260
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:28,144
I just had a question
about one of your students.

261
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:30,199
I'm looking for Joshua Whopper.

262
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,583
It's a lecture class.

263
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:33,607
I don't know everyone individually.

264
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:36,929
Are you sure?

265
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:44,660
Well, anyone with an A

266
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,191
in my class
doesn't come to office hours.

267
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,153
Sorry, gentlemen.

268
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:55,921
Well, we're dead.

269
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,475
Cappie's gonna ask us
who Joshua Whopper is,

270
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:59,806
and we got zip.

271
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:01,859
Wait.

272
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:05,306
It's crazy.

273
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:07,343
What if Josh... No.

274
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:09,685
Cappie on campus...

275
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,730
Why are you talking to yourself?
I'm standing right here.

276
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:14,967
OK, Joshua's smart.

277
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:16,281
He's secretive.

278
00:14:17,118 --> 00:14:18,500
He has dozens of majors.

279
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,946
He hangs out
at Lasker Parks Hall.

280
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,199
What if Joshua Whopper
is Cappie?

281
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,049
Wow. That sounds great.

282
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:37,338
- I'm gonna be a naturalist intern.
- You'll have to wear hiking boots.

283
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,797
So, how was your tutoring session?

284
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:44,102
I'm less confused
about astronomy

285
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:46,138
and more confused about Max.

286
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:49,504
OK, here it goes.

287
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,727
I kind of like him.

288
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:52,937
Oh, he's cute.

289
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:56,232
Weird, but cute.

290
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,650
So, how was it?

291
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,857
Was it all gushy and romantic?

292
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,249
Or did he get all science-y
and weird?

293
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,370
Neither.

294
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,905
Both. I don't know.

295
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:07,076
Honestly, I'm not sure
what happened.

296
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:11,580
Wait. He's not just an Evan/Cappie
in a dork suit, is he?

297
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,477
No, that's the strange thing.
He's totally unlike Evan

298
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,745
or even Cappie.

299
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:18,108
Max is so far outside
my normal dating pool,

300
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,798
I can't read him at all.
It's like all the usual

301
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,964
fraternity/sonority dating rituals
have been tossed out the window.

302
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:25,876
We're{/, like,} from different planets.

303
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:27,134
You need a translator.

304
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:30,307
Someone who can speak
both Greek and geek.

305
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,220
French maid, hers.

306
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:41,151
Amazon princess, hers.

307
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,820
What happened with you and Rebecca?

308
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:47,851
We figured we were headed
in different directions,

309
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,976
so better to cut it off now
before anyone got hurt.

310
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,641
Devil temptress, hers.

311
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,816
Super chick. That's mine.

312
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:58,224
- Where are the bracelets?
- And you're OK?

313
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:01,589
You mean do I need to go and get
hammered at Gentlemen's Choice,

314
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:05,092
{/and} pay a bunch of naked girls to pretend
they love me? No. That sounds like fun.

315
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:06,552
You're not joshing me?

316
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,179
Nope. I'm not joshing you.

317
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:10,942
Oh, let's see.

318
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:13,875
Margaret Thatcher. Mine.

319
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:16,979
Margaret Thatcher was
one whopper of a prime minister?

320
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,690
Maybe she was listening
to Josh Groban,

321
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:22,164
watching Judge Wapner.

322
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:25,195
I'll bite.

323
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:32,703
I know who Joshua Whopper is.

324
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,873
- No. You don't.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

325
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:39,084
Dozens of majors,
secretive about his name,

326
00:16:39,244 --> 00:16:40,539
smarter than he lets on

327
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:43,130
and he was walking out of
Lasker Parks Hall. I saw him.

328
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,687
He's you. You're him.

329
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:47,176
- Rusty, you don't want to go there.
- Why not?

330
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:49,126
I figured it out, didn't I?

331
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,742
{/Come on,}I know your real name.

332
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:56,921
You don't. Because if you dug
a little deeper, Nancy Drew,

333
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,688
you would have discovered
that Joshua Whopper

334
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:02,483
has been a student at CRU since 1984,

335
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:05,277
which just so happens was
a dark time for the Kappa Taus.

336
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:08,687
Thanks to the invention
of the microchip,

337
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:12,179
CRU was finally able
to track grades by computer.

338
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,663
And the administration began to enforce
Greek minimum grade point averages.

339
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:17,996
It didn't appear
that the Kts would survive.

340
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:20,674
The only person in the house
making grades was a pledge.

341
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:23,482
Lasker Parks,
a computer science geek.

342
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:25,194
Lasker Parks?
He invented the...

343
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,446
Uh, Spitter, don't interrupt.

344
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,023
So, Lasker enlisted
his pledge class for help.

345
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:33,502
They stole the password
to the university mainframe

346
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:37,006
and for their pledge project
they created Joshua Whopper,

347
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,588
a computer program.

348
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:42,692
A safeguard to ensure that
the Kts will never again

349
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,710
fall prey to grade standards.

350
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,867
Every semester the program
chooses random large classes

351
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:50,739
and enrolls Joshua Whopper
and awards him an A.

352
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:55,994
The less attention
Joshua Whopper gets, the better.

353
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:57,836
And don't tell the pledges about him.

354
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,122
This is something you're supposed
to learn as an active.

355
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,509
Well, why do we even
need him? It's...

356
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,503
Have you seen our grades?

357
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:06,964
Without Josh they would have
shut us down years ago.

358
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,581
So, you understand why
this has to remain a secret?

359
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:10,509
Totally.

360
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:15,828
Oh. Hey, you forgot this.

361
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:17,291
Nope. That's mine.

362
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:22,592
So, it turns out a food service
coordinator is actually...

363
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,857
- The guy who makes the French fries.
- Exactly.

364
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,675
Which is why I told him I'd
go broke keeping my pores clean.

365
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,023
- I'm sure they understood.
- I know, right?

366
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:33,558
Plus, if I took the job I'd have
even less time to see you.

367
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,513
Yeah, I know. It has gotten pretty
intense with Michael and me.

368
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:38,541
I knew you guys would hit it off.

369
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,127
Hey, why don't we all
go to Dobler's tonight?

370
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,709
You treat this time and then
I'll pay when I get a...

371
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:46,779
Maybe...

372
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,576
Maybe I could be a bouncer.

373
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:51,552
I'm actually hanging out
with Michael tonight.

374
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:54,738
That's... good.

375
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:56,890
But you should come.

376
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:59,595
- Really?
- Yeah. I wouldn't mind the company.

377
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,594
We're going to Gentlemen's Choice.

378
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:05,384
- The strip club?
- No, the other one.

379
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:10,840
... is afraid of the color green,

380
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:12,732
has never eaten chicken,

381
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:14,823
and likes to chase geese?

382
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,617
- Jeremy.
- Dude,

383
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,149
do you honestly want
these guys to be your brothers?

384
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,711
I don't even know how most
of these kids got into CRU.

385
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:24,249
And what kind of parents
name their kid Ferret?

386
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:25,980
You promised not to disparage.

387
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,344
I'm sorry.
I'm just not impressed, that's all.

388
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,756
Here's a winner.
"Barks at parked cars."

389
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,510
- That's Pillbox.
- Sadly correct.

390
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,552
This guy has some promise.

391
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:38,199
Smart, stable,

392
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:40,557
good family life.
Real name?

393
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,935
I don't know. I give up.

394
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:44,451
Joshua Whopper.

395
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,838
- I think we're done.
- Who is this guy?

396
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,386
Is he smarter than me?

397
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,312
Hey, Casey. Just...

398
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:59,159
helping out your little brother here.
You know, 'cause I care.

399
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:03,455
Rusty, can I talk to you
for a sec?

400
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,143
- In private?
- Sure.

401
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:07,000
No, no.
You guys don't have to leave.

402
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,081
I'll just, uh,
listen to my music.

403
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:10,440
You know, meditate.

404
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:12,065
Expand my mind.

405
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,048
What's up?

406
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:26,024
There's someone on
the honors engineering floor

407
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:27,399
who I kind of like.

408
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,045
Here?

409
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,649
I kind of like...

410
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:38,640
Max.

411
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,001
I should warn him.

412
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,345
What do you mean?

413
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:45,531
'Cause you date
like Sherman marched, Casey.

414
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:48,333
With scorched earth
and broken

415
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:49,911
spirits left in your wake.

416
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,546
OK, A: ouch, and B:

417
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:55,140
all I need you to do
is find out if he likes me.

418
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,717
- That's it.
- That's just way

419
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:59,138
too junior high dating strategy.

420
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:01,013
How would you know?

421
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:03,679
OK, A: ouch.

422
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,851
And B: because I read your diary.

423
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,065
Fine.

424
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,682
Please, Rusty.
Please, Rusty, please!

425
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,743
OK. Stop, stop.

426
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:20,300
All right, I'll do it.

427
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,577
I knew I could count on you,
little brother.

428
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:28,582
- I'm the best.
- Yes, you are.

429
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,142
Max? Really?

430
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:37,424
The guy's a freakin' loser.

431
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:45,140
Hi. I'm looking
for Joshua Whopper.

432
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,893
Why would you...
Why would you need to do that?

433
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,062
I'm Claire Golan,
Dr. Shapiro's TA,

434
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,490
and after some students came
to Dr. Shapiro looking for him

435
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,145
she checked her midterms.
His test is missing,

436
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:57,319
which means
Dr. Shapiro's gonna kill me.

437
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:00,162
Well, Claire, I'm sorry to hear that,
but it was nice knowing you.

438
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:02,449
Then she'll take it to the
Gender Studies Review Board,

439
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:04,364
then the Academic Review Board.

440
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:07,829
All those people will have to
meet Joshua Whopper?

441
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,499
Yes, they would. Unless
I can get this all cleared up.

442
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:16,434
Today's your lucky day, because...

443
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,341
- I'm Joshua Whopper.
- You are?

444
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:21,521
Great.

445
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,595
Then would tonight be OK, 9:00?

446
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,807
- Sure. For what?
- For the make up midterm.

447
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:28,873
While the material's still fresh?

448
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:32,521
Tonight, tonight?

449
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:35,250
That's so cool of you.
You're a total lifesaver.

450
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,453
Hey, Claire, I'm taking
two gender studies classes

451
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:40,404
with Dr. Shapiro.
Which one is this again?

452
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:42,023
The Phallus.

453
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,148
So, you're tutoring my sister now?

454
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,613
Yeah, we only did it once.

455
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:53,039
No, I mean tutoring.
I'm not... I didn't...

456
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,290
- I wasn't saying that...
- OK, thank you.

457
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,670
Good to know.

458
00:22:57,332 --> 00:23:00,643
{/You know, }I've won a lot of awards
too, Max. A lot bigger than the...

459
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:02,800
National Science Foundation
gold medal.

460
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:04,553
Oh, that one. I assisted

461
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:07,389
Professor Lowy with his work
on fuel cell technology.

462
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:11,258
Dale, maybe you can answer this.
Why do they always

463
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:13,585
put the environmental awards
on the wooden plaques?

464
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:15,489
Nobody likes a show-off, Max.

465
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,234
But with all that studying and tutoring,
I bet you don't have much time to date.

466
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,264
No. Not really.

467
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,782
European Science Foundation
Legion of Honor?

468
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,244
Ah, the Neues Schloss Hotel
in Zurich is pretty cool.

469
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,684
It's hard to tell if they like you
as much as you like them.

470
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:32,743
So you test the waters...

471
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:34,302
Agreed.

472
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:38,420
Maybe... Maybe it'd be smart to...

473
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:40,249
ask a family member.

474
00:23:41,197 --> 00:23:43,175
See if the other person's interested...

475
00:23:46,254 --> 00:23:49,014
For heaven's sake, will somebody
just say what they really mean?

476
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:50,891
Max, I demand to know
your intentions.

477
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:54,061
- Is he all right?
- Apparently not.

478
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:57,637
Who's that?

479
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,192
She's pretty. Is that your sister?

480
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:04,780
Girlfriend.

481
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:08,987
Thank you.

482
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,790
I don't get it.

483
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,085
I asked him to tutor me. Why didn't
he just say he had a girlfriend?

484
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:19,377
Why would he do that?

485
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:20,872
You're kidding, right?

486
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,699
Asking him to tutor me meant
I was interested in going out.

487
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:25,765
If he has a girlfriend
he should have said no.

488
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:28,711
What would you say if you just wanted
him to help you with your class?

489
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,777
That I wanted him to tutor me.

490
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:33,422
You really didn't pay very
close attention to my diary.

491
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,730
You know what? I'm bowing out
before this gets super complicated.

492
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:42,192
This is what you get
when you try to date amateurs.

493
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,574
Will you make sure Max gets it?

494
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,543
I owe him for an hour
of tutoring.

495
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:57,305
What's, uh...

496
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,827
OK, I'll be right there.

497
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,884
Looks like we have a 1066 here.

498
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,427
Serial killer?

499
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:10,863
Major crime alert.

500
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:13,951
I'm thinking of becoming
a student security officer.

501
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:16,226
Their uniforms are hideous.

502
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,718
OK, you know what you need?

503
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,765
A bigger spoon?

504
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:26,778
An evening out with me and Calvin
at Gentlemen's Choice.

505
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:29,156
- The strip club?
- No. The other one.

506
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:31,310
I'll take a pass.

507
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:34,454
I'm not in the mood to hang out
in a bar packed with guys.

508
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,992
But these guys are exactly
what you need.

509
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:39,808
Gay bars are tailor made
for depressed straight girls.

510
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:42,715
There's lots of great music,
hot guys that don't hit on you,

511
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,380
and all night they tell you
you're fabulous.

512
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:49,801
All right, lightning round.

513
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:53,401
Who said a male's masculinity
is defined by his relationship

514
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:55,765
with not only his but
a woman's phallatical display?

515
00:25:57,415 --> 00:25:59,895
I have no idea,
but it sounds kind of he-she.

516
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:01,706
No offense, but we're screwed.

517
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:03,603
This books are scary thick

518
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:07,038
and I can't even wrap my head around
the class description in the syllabus.

519
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:09,616
"The thrust of the phallus

520
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,036
"is how perceptions of masculinity

521
00:26:12,177 --> 00:26:15,160
"affect psycho, social and
interpersonal relationships."

522
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,032
Rusty, don't go soft on me.

523
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:18,298
Cap, I'm beat.

524
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:20,525
This class is really hard.

525
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:23,460
I just can't cram it in
fast enough.

526
00:26:23,858 --> 00:26:25,616
All right.
We need a helping hand.

527
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:27,741
- Reach under those books.
- What are you thinking?

528
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:30,733
We get everybody in here,
we bang our heads together,

529
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,219
everyone pitches in.

530
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:35,555
If Joshua Whopper's going down
he's not taking the rest of us with him.

531
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,047
Clearly we've all taken
gender roles for granted.

532
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:43,555
I've never had
such clarity before.

533
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,431
Maybe we'd be better brothers

534
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,213
if we treated each other as sisters.

535
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:56,179
An open exchange of feelings.

536
00:26:57,754 --> 00:26:58,759
Sadly,

537
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:01,526
it appears our phalluses
have led us astray.

538
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:06,799
I'm gonna miss you.

539
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:11,299
I'm gonna miss you, too.

540
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:16,664
Now I know I have a heart...

541
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,861
... because it's breaking.

542
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:25,175
And, uh...

543
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,695
... I think I'm gonna miss you
most of all, Scarecrow.

544
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,357
I'm going with you.

545
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,367
Right. Sorry.

546
00:27:37,585 --> 00:27:38,993
Hey, Beav, are you...

547
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,880
Are you crying?

548
00:27:42,566 --> 00:27:45,026
Yes, and I don't care.

549
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,672
- But I didn't get you anything.
- Later. Just take a sip.

550
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,617
We were thinking about
going to the backyard,

551
00:28:00,737 --> 00:28:02,248
just blowing some stuff up.

552
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,749
Yes!

553
00:28:11,444 --> 00:28:12,589
Hey, Casey?

554
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:13,959
Sorry to bother you.

555
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,193
I came to return your check.

556
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:17,420
I can't cash it.

557
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:20,177
I had a feeling you weren't
going to make this easy.

558
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:22,678
- No, it's not...
- Look. I gave you a check.

559
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:26,121
It's yours. Do what you want.
Consider it a lovely parting gift.

560
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:28,440
Clearly, you have some issues.

561
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:31,710
You need to work them out
and I wish you luck with those.

562
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:33,290
No, Casey,

563
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:36,022
you didn't sign the bottom of it.

564
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:38,340
Right.

565
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:40,341
Great.

566
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:43,407
So I'll just get a pen, then.

567
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:44,774
Casey, wait.

568
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,815
And then he just left.
No, fled.

569
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:12,298
Fled is more the word.
He does that a lot.

570
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:15,297
He's so weird.
I don't even know why I care.

571
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:17,867
- Well, how was it?
- What?

572
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,091
The kiss?

573
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,302
It was...

574
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:23,975
great.

575
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,707
Really great.

576
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:27,788
Which pisses me off even more.

577
00:29:28,204 --> 00:29:29,043
Why?

578
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:31,088
Because even with all those brains

579
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,279
he's just Evan in a dork suit.

580
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:35,054
He has a girlfriend, rember?

581
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:40,370
Well, maybe he's looking to turn
his twosome into a threesome.

582
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,460
Max? Please.

583
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,321
He's the sweetest...

584
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,145
... least corruptible guy in the world.

585
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:49,235
It's always the quiet ones.

586
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:52,032
Well, then I'm just
gonna yell at him, Ash.

587
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,131
Perfect.
Where are you going?

588
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:01,485
Calvin is meeting Rebecca and I at
Gentlemen's Choice. Do you want to come?

589
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:04,008
You're going with
Calvin to a strip club?

590
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:05,732
No, the other one.

591
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,747
What do you think?

592
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:17,777
It's not so scary.

593
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:19,428
Kind of nice.

594
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:22,316
And maybe you'll find another
gay guy on the planet to talk to.

595
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:25,122
Yeah. Chances of that are
highly unlikely.

596
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:26,591
I got it.

597
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:29,016
Heath.

598
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:36,934
Heath, this is my boyfriend, Michael.

599
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:39,404
Hi, Michael.

600
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:41,848
You guys know each other?

601
00:30:42,316 --> 00:30:44,081
Yeah. I'm a Kappa Tau.

602
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,095
He's an Omega Chi.
We're like, locked in mortal combat.

603
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:49,225
Mortal enemies. I got it.

604
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:54,708
You want to go this way?

605
00:30:57,144 --> 00:31:01,046
The plan was for you to hang
out with gay guys, not straight girls.

606
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:04,373
I know, but Ashleigh called
me and said Rebecca needed a pick-me-up.

607
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:05,990
Bad breakup.

608
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:09,317
Say no more.
Me and my buddies will handle it.

609
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:13,618
So,

610
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,351
where's Greg?

611
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,829
I don't know.
We broke up about a month ago.

612
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:24,034
- You broke up with Greg.
- Yeah.

613
00:31:25,623 --> 00:31:28,306
- Can't we take the night off?
- Duty calls.

614
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:30,823
If straight guys weren't so insensitive

615
00:31:30,943 --> 00:31:33,051
then we wouldn't be left
to pick up the pieces.

616
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,307
But they are so this is part of the job.

617
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:41,287
OK, go.

618
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:47,464
Oh, my god.

619
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:49,936
You two look so fabulous.

620
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:51,344
And crazy hot.

621
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:53,832
Are you gonna dance with me or

622
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:56,547
am I gonna have to call my friends
over for some help?

623
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,787
We'll dance.

624
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,270
See?

625
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,429
- First time here?
- Yeah, first time.

626
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:16,716
- What do you think?
- It's OK.

627
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:19,206
Michael wanted me
to make some new friends.

628
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,779
Preferably ones that
weren't into Judd Apatow.

629
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:26,544
- Know how I know you're gay?
<i>- You're in Gentlemen's Choice.</i>

630
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:36,059
Then Lacan stated
that man finds satisfaction

631
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,068
for his demand for love
in the relation with the woman.

632
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,753
And as much as the signifier

633
00:32:40,873 --> 00:32:44,314
of the phallus constitutes her as giving
in love, which she does not have.

634
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,990
Yes. What about Furhagen?

635
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:48,566
The relationship between man and woman

636
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:51,572
beyond the phallus is the very same
as the relationship

637
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,153
between the subject
and the real of its body.

638
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:55,842
Yes, yes. What about...?

639
00:32:55,962 --> 00:32:58,620
You know, Spitter, the answer
to every question is the same.

640
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:03,135
The phallus half of the relationship
has a tendency to screw things up.

641
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,051
Cap?

642
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,953
I couldn't step up for Rebecca.

643
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:20,957
I couldn't change.

644
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:25,759
She need more.
She need real support and I couldn't

645
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,504
give it to her.
So...

646
00:33:33,932 --> 00:33:34,941
I miss her.

647
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:47,358
There you are.

648
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,866
Hey, tutor.

649
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:51,087
I just have one last question.

650
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:55,452
Did you think that kissing me
would make me somehow want you more?

651
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:57,075
Who do you think you are?

652
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,495
That's two questions.

653
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,290
Regardless of what you might have heard,

654
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,188
I'm no longer about crazy,
dysfunctional triangles.

655
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:06,212
I'm not going to be a one man
girl to a guy who's a two girl man.

656
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:09,962
I mean, why can't anyone
just have a normal relationship?

657
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:11,488
Is that so difficult?

658
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:15,844
What would your girlfriend say
if she knew what you were up to?

659
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,638
She's not exactly my girlfriend anymore.

660
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:23,256
If she's not exactly your
girlfriend anymore, then

661
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,842
why would you call her
your girlfriend to Rusty? And

662
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,807
why do you keep a picture of her?

663
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:31,600
Did she break your heart or something?

664
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:37,165
I get it.
It's tough.

665
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,481
Trust me.
I am the queen of not letting go.

666
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:43,374
But you've got to move on.

667
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,302
My girlfriend's dead.

668
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,647
Good progress.

669
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,793
I know it seems harsh,
but admitting that she's dead to you is

670
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:54,832
the first step to moving on.

671
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:58,263
You know, I had to do the same
thing with my last boyfriend.

672
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,316
It's not like we don't
all have old ghosts.

673
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,274
My girlfriend,

674
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,078
she really is dead.

675
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:19,391
We met freshman year in the dorms.

676
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:22,714
And then just before junior
year she discovered this

677
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,775
tiny lump on her neck.

678
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,863
That's when it started.

679
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:30,039
I'm sorry, Max.

680
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:33,887
When did she die?

681
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:37,795
About six months ago.

682
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:48,139
You know, when I was 17,
Rusty had this

683
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:51,052
cat that nobody liked.
Nobody except for him.

684
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:52,927
Except for him.

685
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:56,159
She was kind of a cross between
a Bengal and an

686
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:58,225
actual Bengal tiger.

687
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:02,893
The day I was nominated for prom queen

688
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:04,556
I wanted to celebrate,

689
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,180
so I borrowed my

690
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:07,496
mom's car.

691
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,124
And I hadn't driven much,

692
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,958
so I was nervous.

693
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,890
Then when I pulled out of the garage...

694
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:17,538
You drove over the cat.

695
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:26,681
And I just compared a dead cat
to your girlfriend who died of cancer.

696
00:36:28,615 --> 00:36:30,085
It's just I've never...

697
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:32,579
... known anyone who died.

698
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:35,113
Except for Rusty's cat.

699
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:36,401
It's OK.

700
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:39,341
You're not the first
person who's done it.

701
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:41,495
Do people talk about cats?

702
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:45,552
I get a lot of different reactions
when I talk about her.

703
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:46,676
Which is

704
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:50,587
usually why I try
to just avoid the subject all together.

705
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:53,866
It's...

706
00:36:57,722 --> 00:36:58,897
It's still tough.

707
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:01,369
You know?

708
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:05,905
And I guess that's why I haven't really

709
00:37:06,832 --> 00:37:08,079
gone out with anyone

710
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:09,468
since she died.

711
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,193
Got you.

712
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:25,974
I don't think now

713
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:27,977
is a good time.

714
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:30,940
And it's not you feeling weird.

715
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,041
It's me too.
I thought I would be over her,

716
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,110
ready to move on.

717
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:38,336
But the more I'm...

718
00:37:39,316 --> 00:37:41,731
... more I'm around you,
the more I think of her.

719
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:43,842
And I just...

720
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:49,745
I like thinking about her.

721
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:54,593
Well,

722
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,932
maybe we should both
just say good night.

723
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:11,303
Good night, Max.

724
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,377
What is Beaver's favorite color?

725
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:23,958
Chartreuse.

726
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:27,366
Reminds me of beer.

727
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,969
Why do we call Brother Doug
"Corn Nuts?"

728
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:33,582
Myrtle Beach.

729
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:35,905
He went out for a salty ocean swim,

730
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:38,268
laid out naked and roasted his...

731
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:40,070
... corn nuts.

732
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,598
OK, last question,
Pledge Spitter.

733
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:45,796
Cappie is your big brother.

734
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:48,772
Tell us something about him
that only you would know

735
00:38:48,892 --> 00:38:50,783
that you've learned
in the last 24 hours.

736
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:58,565
Cappie's not Joshua Whopper.

737
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:02,892
They gout.
My clean a bruder.

738
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,329
Turn around!

739
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,466
What do you want to do tonight?

740
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,552
I suppose watching Superbad
would be out of the question?

741
00:39:11,672 --> 00:39:14,586
If you agree to go to a seminar
on queer musicology.

742
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:18,350
Yeah, I guess the Apatow
Dvds will stay in the closet.

743
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,262
Then how about Gentlemen's Choice?

744
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:24,217
- You know, I liked that.
- Yeah? I noticed.

745
00:39:24,591 --> 00:39:26,520
You never mentioned
that you knew a Kappa Tau.

746
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,072
Heath? We...

747
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:33,088
... met during rush, you know.

748
00:39:33,316 --> 00:39:34,428
It's no big deal.

749
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:36,867
Oh, my god. I got the job.

750
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:40,302
And you can start your first
exciting campus tour next week.

751
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,410
Oh, my god! I have a job!

752
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:50,892
I'm sorry for messing
things up with Joshua Whopper.

753
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:52,047
It's OK.

754
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:54,072
We can always depend on you.

755
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:58,044
You're the one who got the A
in Shapiro's make up exam.

756
00:39:58,226 --> 00:40:01,461
I got lucky. It actually turned out
to be one of the best classes

757
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:03,530
- I've never taken.
- You know,

758
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:07,606
sometimes people can change.
It just takes the right person.

759
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,746
Even phalluses...

760
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,647
... can grow.

761
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,820
You should be ashamed of yourself,
Spittles.

762
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:19,050
To Joshua Whopper.

763
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:22,001
Too bad Joshua couldn't
make his own party.

764
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:23,612
After his

765
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:26,433
stellar showing of the phallus,

766
00:40:27,046 --> 00:40:29,347
he's back to work
doing what he does best.

767
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,725
Making our house a little bit better.

768
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,800
Because Joshua Whopper embodies
the very best of Kappa Tau.

769
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:38,606
He's unselfish,
dedicated

770
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:41,494
and he's always willing
to put his brothers first.

771
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:45,895
To Joshua Whopper.

772
00:40:51,106 --> 00:40:51,979
Andromeda,

773
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:54,135
Pleiades...

774
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,442
... Orion's belt,

775
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:00,832
Big Dipper,

776
00:41:01,557 --> 00:41:02,451
and...

777
00:41:04,282 --> 00:41:05,074
Lyra.

778
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:08,237
Ashleigh said you might be here.

779
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,734
This is the only part
of the class I enjoy.

780
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,516
But after a while it
all starts looking the same.

781
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,358
The trick to the constellations
is to know the stories behind them.

782
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:23,820
Lyra's my favorite.

783
00:41:24,054 --> 00:41:25,958
It was the musical instrument
of Orpheus,

784
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,869
the greatest musician that ever lived.

785
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:29,293
I have all his Cds.

786
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,584
- Kidding.
- Do you know the story?

787
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:36,721
So, Orpheus loved one thing

788
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,785
more than music and that was Eurydice,

789
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,347
the most beautiful girl that ever lived.

790
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:44,130
But she died. She was poisoned.

791
00:41:44,927 --> 00:41:47,611
And Orpheus could not live without her.

792
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:50,556
So he went down to
Hades to bring her back.

793
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,949
The ruler of Hades agreed,
but there was a catch.

794
00:41:56,779 --> 00:42:00,104
If he turned back to look
at her face she'd be gone forever.

795
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:05,829
Just before he got to the surface
he heard this rock crash behind him,

796
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:08,003
so he turned back to
see if she was all right.

797
00:42:10,418 --> 00:42:11,589
And that was it.

798
00:42:11,908 --> 00:42:14,236
The gates to the underworld slammed shut

799
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:16,330
she was gone forever.

800
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:19,955
That's terrible.
What happened to him?

801
00:42:20,698 --> 00:42:21,517
He...

802
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,444
He spent the rest of his life

803
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,651
wandering the earth alone.

804
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,152
Do you want to take a look?

805
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:38,406
No.

806
00:42:43,753 --> 00:42:45,082
I'm not turning back.
