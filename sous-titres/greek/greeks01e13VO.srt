00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:01,238
<i>Previously on</i> Greek...

2
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:03,367
- Are we in the wrong house?
- I'm lizzi.

3
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:06,206
I'm gonna be here until ZBZ nationals
determines that you girls are back

4
00:00:06,249 --> 00:00:07,537
on the straight and narrow.

5
00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:10,880
I'm sure we'd be doing a lot better
if lizzi hadn't made us dress like this.

6
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,570
We're intentionally being shunned.

7
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,333
Get outta my squad car!

8
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,264
100 hours of community service.

9
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,938
Decide this is going to be a great
new semester, and it will be.

10
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:21,528
You think I can do that?

11
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:23,402
We discussed it at
the last chapter meeting.

12
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,221
That's right.
You weren't there.

13
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:27,394
- Where's the snow machine?
- I'm so sorry.

14
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:30,562
It's bros and cheesaritos
before hos.

15
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:31,669
I'm gay.

16
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:33,506
- You know, I can work with that.
- You can?

17
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,752
Vitamin and prayer regiment
can cure that.

18
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:38,002
Things have changed, Casey.

19
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:40,279
You have to accept that.

20
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:43,968
So you believe we have
a future together.

21
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,564
In a world where there's
no Casey Cartwright.

22
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,930
Check out the yummy boy buffet.

23
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:57,571
I don't have much of an appetite.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,563
Casey, we are two
newly-single college girls

25
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:03,153
in a room full of boys
and two-for-one drinks.

26
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:05,199
It will never get better than this.

27
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,966
Please, god, don't let that be true.

28
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:10,186
Come on, a little flirtation
might do you some good.

29
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:13,548
I'm just not ready to dive
back into the cru dating pool.

30
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:17,022
Not to mention the water's
pretty icy for ZBZS.

31
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:18,266
Okay.

32
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,399
But I can be a great wing woman.

33
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,093
The goose to your Maverick.

34
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:29,410
Well, lock and load.
We got two bogeys at 12:00.

35
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:32,670
What are you doing?

36
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,394
I am waving at cute boys.

37
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:37,732
There are two guys over there.
One of them will have to talk to me.

38
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:40,739
Okay, Goose,
I'm about to eject you from the cockpit.

39
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,089
And I just got this top,
so I'm gonna take it for a spin.

40
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,836
Hey, ladies,
these are from the guys at the bar.

41
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:49,035
Well, thank you very much, forever 21.

42
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,674
We can't accept these.

43
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,146
Wing woman. Right.

44
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,317
Sorry. My mistake.

45
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:58,064
These aren't for you.

46
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,272
Looks like they've got the top guns.

47
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:09,934
Roll call!

48
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:12,184
All those present,
say aye.

49
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,535
- <i>Aye.</i>
- Great. Okay.

50
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:16,370
First order of business.

51
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:19,377
There appears to have been
an unfortunate incident

52
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,890
in the upstairs bathroom
that involved corn.

53
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,924
We're gonna need a
pledge to clean that up.

54
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,179
Spitter, hey, thanks for volunteering.

55
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,574
I didn't volunteer.
I'm just the only one here.

56
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,219
Wherefore art thou pledges?

57
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,976
- Tell me you've come bearing gifts.
- Sorry, cap.

58
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,167
No gifts. However,
we did bring flowers.

59
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:43,930
From the omega chi front yard!

60
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:51,001
Well, impressive feat, pledges.

61
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,779
- Wade, I think they're ready.
- Time to take it to the next level.

62
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,819
Initiation?

63
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:57,669
Hey, slow down there, spitter.
You're talkin'at the speed of crazy.

64
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,621
We meant your pledge project.

65
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:02,433
The hot tub,
the back porch, even vesuvius.

66
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:05,367
These were all built
by prior pledge classes.

67
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:09,705
This is your chance to write your own
chapter in the Kappa Tau history book.

68
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,190
Preferably one with lots of pictures
for those of us who don't

69
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:13,743
care to read too much text.

70
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,022
Can you handle this?

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,088
- <i>Yeah...</i>
- I said...

72
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,884
- Can youhandle this?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

73
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,018
There ya go!
Hands in!

74
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,131
<i>Kappa...
Tau!</i>

75
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:26,067
Yes!

76
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,936
Season 1 - Episode 13
" <i>Highway to the Discomfort Zone</i> "

77
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:39,280
- Synchro : 
<i>¤AkaZab¤ & Kasius</i>

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,053
- Transcript : <i>Swsub-sub</i>

79
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:44,751
So please remember that
showers longer than three minutes

80
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:48,937
are strictly prohibited, as Lizzie
has so thoughtfully reminded us.

81
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,371
Water's the earth's most precious gift.

82
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:54,103
And finally,
Lizzie also reminded me that

83
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:55,855
this week is national

84
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:58,333
ZBZ big sister,
little sister week.

85
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:01,340
Apparently, someone forgot
to put it on the calendar.

86
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:03,346
This week is gonna be so...

87
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,553
- Tense.
- Girls,

88
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:09,749
few relationships are more precious
than the one between a big

89
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,061
and her little.

90
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:13,987
It's like a delicate, fragrant orchid.

91
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:17,010
And this week, ZBZS across
our great Nation

92
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,810
will be pruning their orchids

93
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,501
so they'll blossom forever.

94
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:21,945
So

95
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:25,826
tomorrow, we'll be volunteering
in pairs at the animal shelter.

96
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:28,176
Thursday is our
double date dash at dobler's,

97
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,161
and friday will end the week
with a celebratory tea.

98
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:32,798
Meeting adjourned.

99
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:42,585
We're not actually going to
be participating in this crap, are we?

100
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:44,725
I keep my orchid pruned.

101
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:46,563
The events are mandatory.

102
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:48,843
Rebecca, listen,

103
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,081
I know

104
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,808
we started our relationship

105
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:54,792
off on the wrong foot. Mostly because
you started out in the wrong bed.

106
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,571
- You really need to get over that.
- May I finish?

107
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,300
But you did help out with
the prohibition party last week.

108
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,642
Plus, with Evan and Frannie

109
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:05,090
out of the picture,
hating you seems less necessary.

110
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:07,070
And since we have to spend
this week together,

111
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:09,101
I was thinking we might try and be.

112
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:09,974
Friends?

113
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,749
I was going for non-enemies.

114
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,480
See you at the shelter tomorrow.

115
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:22,821
Hey, Fellas.

116
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,422
- You need help?
- No.

117
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:28,725
Go show your pledge brothers
how to hack.

118
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:31,920
I don't know how to hack.

119
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,271
Nice.

120
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:48,556
Dude...

121
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,714
<i>All right.</i>

122
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:55,583
<i>Gather around the porch.</i>

123
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,599
<i>All right, before you embark
on your pledge project voyage,</i>

124
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:01,548
<i>me and the wadester got a little,
special treat.</i>

125
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:02,890
<i>A gift, if you will,</i>

126
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,706
<i>that we think will get you pumped
about your journey.</i>

127
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,678
<i>Wade?</i>

128
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,562
<i>In the pantheon of kt greats,</i>

129
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:20,078
<i>one man but stands alone.</i>

130
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:22,870
<i>I'm proud to call him my big brother.</i>

131
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:24,670
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>You guessed it.</i>

132
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:27,838
<i>Here he is.</i>
<i>Egyptian joe!</i>

133
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:35,171
Touching stuff, cap.

134
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:38,885
<i>Wade, if you could
turn down the music a hair.</i>

135
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,467
<i>I still wanna hear it, though.</i>

136
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:42,318
This song slays.

137
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:43,665
<i>So...</i>

138
00:06:44,883 --> 00:06:46,214
<i>In'99,</i>

139
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:49,661
<i>40 years of pledge project sweat</i>

140
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:52,402
<i>culminated in
vesuvius.</i>

141
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:55,733
<i>A pyrotechnic marvel so sublime
that it birthed</i>

142
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:57,868
<i>this school's sweetest rager.</i>

143
00:06:58,695 --> 00:06:59,707
<i>You know...</i>

144
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,562
<i>The volcano wasn't
the only thing blown that night.</i>

145
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:05,997
We blew minds.

146
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,512
<i>Melted hearts.</i>

147
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:11,291
<i>And in the hot, hot heat of legendary
accomplishment I became.</i>

148
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:14,789
<i>Right.</i>

149
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,500
<i>So...</i>

150
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:19,104
<i>After we made vesuvius,</i>

151
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:22,614
<i>my pledge bros and I forged
the ultimate bond.</i>

152
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:24,465
<i>Maybe</i>

153
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,906
<i>you can enjoy a bond like that too.</i>

154
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:29,808
<i>But nobody expects
you to equal vesuvius.</i>

155
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,116
<i>I mean, I don't.</i>

156
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:33,319
<i>We expect you to top it!</i>

157
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,066
Yeah!

158
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:44,089
My answer is yes.

159
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,553
Was the question...

160
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,534
Wanna get naked?

161
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:50,704
You asked if I'd go on a date with you.

162
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,871
I've given it some thought, and

163
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:55,213
I'm ready.
Let's take this public.

164
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,395
Way public.

165
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:58,892
Like, let's go outside
and make out on the ZBZ lawn.

166
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,796
Oddly arousing, but

167
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:04,624
methinks there are

168
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:06,677
ulterior motives afoot.

169
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:15,289
I want you to know that the way I feel
about you has nothing to do with Casey.

170
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,225
Who, by the way,
did something really scary today.

171
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,809
- What?
- She was...

172
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:22,308
nice.

173
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:24,470
To me.

174
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:29,596
- Un-freaking-believable.
- Will you be serious?

175
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:30,957
What's the big deal?

176
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:32,912
If you and Casey sign a peace treaty,

177
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:35,612
it will be so much easier for us

178
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:37,537
to have diplomatic relations.

179
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,263
Maybe you're right.
I'm being stupid.

180
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:44,567
I know. Why don't you make nice
with evan chambers?

181
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:45,958
Point taken.

182
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:49,364
I just didn't want people to think
that I was dating you to get to her.

183
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:52,337
Now she's all nice and smiley.
Once she finds out about us,

184
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:55,057
she's gonna hate me again, restoring
peace and harmony to the universe.

185
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:57,307
You are such a romantic.

186
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,006
Trust me.

187
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,875
I'm so ready to walk out that door
instead of climbing out the window.

188
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:11,324
Bu-bu-bu... well, okay, before we.

189
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:15,224
Before we face the parazzi,
I need to tell Casey.

190
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:16,759
I owe her that.

191
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,700
I know you wanna make her hate you, but

192
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,159
I don't.

193
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,690
You're the one who suggested
we stop hiding.

194
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,409
Casey and I have a past.

195
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,959
But we...

196
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:31,098
We have a future.

197
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:32,757
Fine.

198
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:36,995
But this is the last time
I'm doing this, Rapunzel.

199
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,067
- Calvin?
- Hey.

200
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:52,275
Two questions.

201
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,125
One, is Rusty here, and two...

202
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:56,946
You knit?

203
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:59,140
Two answers.
No and yes.

204
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:02,827
Knitting increases hand-eye
coordination and requires complex math.

205
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:05,721
Okay. Just tell him I stopped by,
all right?

206
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:08,142
Hey, have you given any more
thought to my offer?

207
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,084
Your offer?

208
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:11,877
To guide you back to the
warm embrace of heterosexuality.

209
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:15,169
- Yeah... no.
- I got a lot of free time on my hands.

210
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:18,026
I could read up on the latest
methods of conversion therapy.

211
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,672
Just, just let me help
you choose a better path.

212
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,351
- And I'm not judging you.
- So I chose to be gay.

213
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,451
I know that sin can be very seductive.

214
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,672
Thus my three pop-up blockers.

215
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,905
So you think because
I'm gay I wanna be straight?

216
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:35,262
See, with that sense of humor, you're
gonna be very popular with the ladies.

217
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,439
Just let me fix you.

218
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:40,040
Okay, Dale.

219
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,033
If you think you can fix me,
I'll let you.

220
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:45,279
All right. My room, 6:00 tomorrow.
Your journey begins.

221
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:47,412
Our journey begins, my friend.

222
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:49,140
Our journey.

223
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,035
Don't worry.
I can cure you of that.

224
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:59,393
What about warren?

225
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:01,419
He eats like a caveman.
Zach?

226
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,532
Republican.

227
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:05,190
My phone's spent.
Isn't there anyone you're into?

228
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,076
There is this hot foreign exchang

229
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,288
student that winked
at me today in class.

230
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,774
Hopefully,
that's not an insult in his culture.

231
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,836
Where's he from?

232
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:17,082
Hotmanistan.

233
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,976
You're way zen about the date dash.
Because I'm going solo.

234
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,169
I've got way too much
on my plate running Zeta Beta.

235
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:25,344
The last thing I need to worry
about is finding a date.

236
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:26,610
Evening, ladies.

237
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:27,783
Cappie!

238
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:29,577
What timing.

239
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,053
Okay, I'll see you back at the house.

240
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,032
- Nice vest.
- Yeah, makes me feel official.

241
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:39,458
Actually, I was...

242
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:43,016
I just finished up with my community
service, and I was hoping we could chat

243
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,518
about dating.

244
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,228
I think I know where this is going.

245
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:50,809
Listen, Cap, I totally owe you
for the party last week.

246
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,657
You were a really good...
friend.

247
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:54,932
Thanks.

248
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:56,796
And as friends,

249
00:11:57,504 --> 00:11:59,300
I just wanna let you know that...

250
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:00,767
I'm dating someone.

251
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,235
You are?

252
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:06,950
S, so, who's the Lucky lady?

253
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,222
Rebecca.

254
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:10,969
Rebecca who?

255
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:12,463
Rebecca Logan.

256
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:17,676
My little sis...

257
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:20,269
That's.

258
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,508
Fantastic.

259
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:25,056
- Are you cool with this?
- The coolest.

260
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,454
I. I'm like a...

261
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:27,747
Polar ice Cap.

262
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:31,140
I mean, Rebecca,
she's just so warm and Fuzzy.

263
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:33,100
Like global warming.

264
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:35,002
You know, look at the time.

265
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,271
I. I gotta run.

266
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:38,294
Can't... can't miss to catch a predator.

267
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:40,767
It's really good to stay informed.

268
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,959
- Casey, are you sure you're.
- So excited... for you.

269
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:46,841
So excited.

270
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:53,246
Okay, guys, pledge class project.

271
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,461
Any ideas?

272
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,447
- Got one.
- Pickle.

273
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:00,322
All right. We could wire
the tri-pi showers with web cams?

274
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,868
And end up defending ourselves
to Nancy Grace? Don't think so.

275
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:05,829
I got an idea.

276
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:08,665
We could make

277
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:10,986
a Kappa Tau video game.

278
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,541
We can design different characters
for each brother

279
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:17,061
- and maybe put in a few easter eggs.
- Dude,

280
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,537
none of us know anything about computer
programming or video game design.

281
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:21,385
But...

282
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:23,213
But... brad, I could teach you.

283
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:27,343
Gonzo's got a good point, spitter.
The project sounds a little ambitious.

284
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:29,551
Gonzo? When did you get that nickname?

285
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:32,428
When we watched muppets
take Manhattan in the hotel.

286
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,257
On our pledge trip
to the mall of America.

287
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:37,644
You went on a pledge trip.

288
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:40,648
Without me?

289
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:41,817
Yeah...

290
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,611
We tried calling you,
but you dealing with some Jen K.

291
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:48,190
Cris by dropping singles
at a strip club with the brothers.

292
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,741
Now, what I was thinking was

293
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,244
what can we do,

294
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:56,136
minimum amount of effort,

295
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,838
that will produce maximum fun?

296
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:01,558
Two words.

297
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,604
Tire swing.

298
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,727
<i>Yeah, man.</i>

299
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:09,635
I, that's. I don't.

300
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,703
I don't think that's
what Cappie was talking about.

301
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,499
Never mind.
Never mind.

302
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,642
Hey, Casey.

303
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:28,525
I'm having a bad day.
Could we just skip to the tender moment?

304
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:31,557
- Forget it.
- Fine, fine.

305
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:34,724
We'll do the whole thing.
What's wrong?

306
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:37,943
My entire pledge class hates me.

307
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,274
Okay, you know what?

308
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,191
Have a seat on your throne,
drama queen.

309
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,018
I'm serious.

310
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,964
It wasn't until we started
working on this pledge project

311
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,908
that I realized they have
this whole life going on without me.

312
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,052
They pull pranks on omega chis.

313
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,154
- They went to the mall of America.
- Okay,

314
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:59,486
so you're not mr. Popularity.
You never were in high school.

315
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:03,092
This should feel comfortable,
like putting on an old, musty sweater.

316
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:06,839
Casey, these are my pledge brothers.
Right now it's like we're a boy band...

317
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,063
And I'm the fat one.

318
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,137
It's pronounced"fa-tone".

319
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:16,365
If I were one of your pledges,
what would you tell me to do?

320
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:17,847
Well,

321
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,097
I would encourage you to

322
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,800
try and make a good impression...
Perhaps by

323
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:24,278
giving a handmade gift.

324
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,589
People are always impressed
when you take the time to personalize.

325
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,224
Casey, i'm in a fraternity.

326
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:34,404
You wouldn't be if you were one
of my pledges. Now, I'm crazy late.

327
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:35,889
Listen, just

328
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:38,522
make a sincere effort, and I'm sure

329
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:40,369
they'll give you a second chance.

330
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:54,285
Calvin, welcome to a very
special purity pledge meeting.

331
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:05,027
You'll have to excuse sanjay.
He's never seen a...

332
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,652
Gay in the wild before.

333
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:08,177
I have.

334
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,138
My mom's in real estate.

335
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,547
So what are you guys doing here?

336
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:18,380
Well, communication is
key to the conversion process.

337
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:19,598
This is a safe room

338
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:22,992
where everyone's comfortable talking
about their deepest, darkest yearnings.

339
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:24,591
So let me get this straight.

340
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,724
You mean let us get you straight.

341
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,947
Funny.

342
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:32,765
You guys
get together every week.

343
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,528
You talk about your feelings.

344
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:36,652
And you don't have sex with women.

345
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,092
Sign me up.

346
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:50,950
Hey, little sis.
Ready to bond?

347
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,459
Wait a sec.

348
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,680
- Have you talked to Cappie?
- You mean your new squeeze?

349
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:58,329
I did.
Though he's not quite new.

350
00:16:58,467 --> 00:16:59,761
More used.

351
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:02,092
Are you guys
the Zeta Beta Zeta sorority?

352
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:09,920
That's us!

353
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:15,585
There's so many of you.

354
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:17,725
I'm Jonah, your canine care specialist.

355
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:20,160
I'm Casey Cartwright,
Zeta Beta President.

356
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,073
So what do you need us to do?

357
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:23,967
Feed them, play fetch?

358
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,384
Rub their Teeny, Tiny Tummies?

359
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,474
These kids are getting dewormed.

360
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,931
Not by you though.

361
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:34,972
I got something even
better for you guys.

362
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:37,495
Meet Philip.

363
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,336
Just rescued yesterday.

364
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:42,878
He's a total softie,
but he looks like he eats babies.

365
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:45,579
People don't adopt dogs that eat babies.

366
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:50,027
I bet if you could get his hair
to look half as good as yours,

367
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,374
he'd be adopted by today.

368
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,453
Whew.

369
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,150
Look at us...
Washing dogs.

370
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:05,875
Hey!

371
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:08,134
Sorry.

372
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:09,606
Just admit it.

373
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:12,584
The fact that I'm dating
Cappie's eating you up inside.

374
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:14,945
I wish you both nothing but happiness.

375
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:19,124
Thank goodness, because i'm bringing
Cappie with me to the double date dash.

376
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,160
- I didn't want it to be awkward.
- No!

377
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,198
No, I, it won't be.

378
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:24,750
Awkward.

379
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,166
Cap, Joe.

380
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,676
Spitter, i'm so excited,
I cannot wait for the big reveal.

381
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:36,714
It's likeextreme makeover,
fraternity edition.

382
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:38,840
Let's do this.

383
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:41,044
Bhrosers,

384
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:45,304
our pledge class has toiled nonstop
to bring you the best

385
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:48,809
in backyard fun.
We're proud to present to you...

386
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,198
The swing-a-ling.

387
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,505
- Sweet!
- Me first.

388
00:18:58,883 --> 00:18:59,871
Yeah.

389
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:11,479
I'll be in my volcano.

390
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:22,458
The swing-a-ling?

391
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:24,986
Yeah, catchy name for a Crappy product.

392
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:26,730
What is this, an infomercial?

393
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:29,010
Start over.
Do better.

394
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:35,405
Okay, okay.

395
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:41,552
Well, that's the most
action I've gotten in months.

396
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:43,484
Remind me again why
I can't just hit her.

397
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,674
Because you're over Cappie, remember?

398
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,881
Have to float above it,
and you can't let it get to you.

399
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,692
I need a date, ASAP.

400
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:51,736
She's bringing Cappie
to the double date dash.

401
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,162
- I thought weren't ready for dating.
- It's not a date.

402
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,000
It's... a defensive maneuver.

403
00:19:56,793 --> 00:20:00,426
Okay. Well, there's the
delta rho with the eight-pack.

404
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:02,236
Or the tri-nu.

405
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:05,833
Since the article, those houses treat us
like we're radioactive.

406
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:08,002
Does Hhotmanistan have a roommate?

407
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:09,295
I could ask.

408
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,091
We communicate through hand gestures.
So it might take a while.

409
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,949
I need someone fresh and exciting,

410
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:21,098
a man so juicy that people'll forget
Cappie and Rebecca are at the party.

411
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:44,797
- This sucks, man.
- Come on, guys. We can do this.

412
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:49,132
I think I have a solution,
but it all relies on Spitter.

413
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:51,398
Great.

414
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:55,011
I know this video game could rock.

415
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:58,475
Not the video game.
You have to get us out of this.

416
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:02,238
- Me?
- Cappie thinks you poop pearls.

417
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:05,401
You have to talk him
into letting us off the hook.

418
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:08,730
I think Cappie wants us to work together
to come up with something great.

419
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,022
Yeah, and we did.

420
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:14,277
The swing-a-ling. We need you
to convince him it was good enough.

421
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,321
We're counting on you.

422
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:29,000
How you feeling?
Any less gay today?

423
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,651
Still pretty gay.
In fact, you know, last night,

424
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,026
I had the most vivid dream
of Anderson Cooper...

425
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:38,342
Let's just try a new technique,
shall we?

426
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:41,837
Macho wear?

427
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:45,358
- Where'd you get this?
- Somehow I got on their mailing list.

428
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,907
But their boxer briefs
are actually quite comfortable.

429
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:49,186
They do look snug.

430
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:51,579
So what I need you to do

431
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:53,305
is flip through the catalog

432
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:55,610
and stop whenever you see a man
you find attractive.

433
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,567
Sounds fun.

434
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:02,026
My, my.
He's nice.

435
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,845
What the...

436
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,268
Just take a deep breath.
It's aversion therapy.

437
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:12,960
We have to link the stink of this rotten
bana peel to your attraction to men.

438
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:16,505
This is ridiculous. Why does
it bother you so much that I'm gay?

439
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:19,057
Because you deserve to be happy.
How can you be

440
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:21,135
knowing you're not going to heaven?

441
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:24,555
So you know for a fact
gay people aren't on the invite list.

442
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:28,179
They teach you that
the first year of bible school.

443
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,354
It says in Leviticus "You shall not lie
with a male as one lies with a female".

444
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,898
- I've read Leviticus.
- You have?

445
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:35,775
- Have you?
- Of course.

446
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:39,236
Then you know that it prohibits people
from getting tattoos, right?

447
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:42,239
And from eating shellfish,
from wearing clothes with mixed fabrics.

448
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:45,493
Call me crazy, but that shirt looks
like a poly/cotton blend.

449
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:49,330
I don't have time
to debate the scriptures with you.

450
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:52,350
But I'm gonna leave this here
for you to practice.

451
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:03,711
So how did you two meet?

452
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,670
I strooped him.

453
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,513
The stroop task. It was a psych test.
She was my proctor.

454
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:12,761
I see.

455
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:15,606
- First we played proctor, then...
- Could you...

456
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:18,689
excuse me for a moment?

457
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:27,090
Save me from Frankencouple.

458
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,658
How's your date?

459
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:32,164
- He's <i>très romantique</i>.
- So he's French?

460
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:36,270
- He definitely kisses that way.
- Maybe he's carrying his passport

461
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,670
in that fanny pack.

462
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:41,228
I think it's cute.
Plus, it keeps his hands free.

463
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,408
I'm such a horndog.

464
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,224
I am so, so sorry I'm late.

465
00:23:58,074 --> 00:24:00,224
It was really busy at the shelter.

466
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,946
We rescued this litter of kittens,

467
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:06,490
and I had to bottle-feed them dinner.

468
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,885
Saving kittens.
Isn't Jonah amazing?

469
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:12,498
Amazing.

470
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,821
Speaking of kittens, I saw this video
on <i>Youtube</i> where this...

471
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:23,633
this cat just would not stop
sucking on this guy's nipple.

472
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,502
Internet's insane.
Thank God.

473
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:38,107
Greetings from
your friendly neighborhood party patrol.

474
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,649
I'm gonna need to see some ids
before I let you have those beers.

475
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:45,154
It's for your own protection.

476
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:52,093
Name?

477
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,648
- Jonah Perkins.
- Eye color hazel.

478
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,396
And beautiful.

479
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:04,321
- And an organ donor.
- Of course.

480
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:08,887
Enjoy.

481
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:17,245
Refreshing.

482
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:30,498
You down here?

483
00:25:35,614 --> 00:25:37,164
You gotta knock, man.

484
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:40,543
Well, come on in.
Hang out for a bit.

485
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:46,390
Grab a bag.

486
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,627
"Fro-Below.
Shampoo for your privates."

487
00:25:53,148 --> 00:25:54,398
I'm an inventor.

488
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,850
How's that workin' out?

489
00:25:58,255 --> 00:25:59,605
It's a good life.

490
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,632
All purple mountain majesty.

491
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:05,401
A lotta guys my age are anchored to,
like, family or rent payments.

492
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:06,892
I go wherever.

493
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:08,843
Tropics...

494
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:11,236
Deserts.
Back to Kappa Tau.

495
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:13,560
Have fun, share my wisdom.

496
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:16,646
Check in on my Vesuvius.
Speaking of...

497
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,948
Who installed
the atmospheric destabilizer?

498
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:24,936
Me.

499
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:26,688
Nice.

500
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,092
Can I make you a sandwich?

501
00:26:31,185 --> 00:26:33,235
That's okay.
I'm not really...

502
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:37,545
What are you doing down here?

503
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:39,767
I'm looking for Cappie.

504
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:43,838
My pledge brothers wanted me
to talk to him about the swing-a-ling...

505
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,277
Maybe sell it more.

506
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:48,294
Me and my pledge bros
had a crap first effort too.

507
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:50,061
So I made Vesuvius.

508
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:53,824
You gotta step up.
That's what's wrong with the world.

509
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:56,805
But weren't your pledge brothers mad
that you did it without them?

510
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,492
Hell, no. They loved me.
I made us legends.

511
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,882
A man with a big-ass brain like yours
needs to take the wheel

512
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:05,794
and drive 'em to the Promised Land.

513
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:09,410
- I don't know.
- Innovators walk alone.

514
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:12,879
Do your own thing.
Slap their names on it,

515
00:27:13,052 --> 00:27:14,428
and reap in the benefits.

516
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,847
And by benefits...
I mean women.

517
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,705
What about your speech?

518
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,540
The forged bonds.

519
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:26,581
Cappie asked me to throw in
some stuff about...

520
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,566
bonding or blah, blah, blah.

521
00:27:29,277 --> 00:27:31,496
I love Cappie, but he's an idealist.

522
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,666
You gotta be a realist.

523
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:36,466
The pledges'll thank you in the end.

524
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:40,642
Now eat your salmon.

525
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:46,347
I hope to one day become a veterinarian.

526
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,632
People are so concerned
about human health care.

527
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:56,940
Did you know that dogs and humans

528
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,766
are the only two mammals
with a prostate?

529
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,728
Kiss me.

530
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,160
How 'bout another drink?

531
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,643
I gotta drive home.

532
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:19,692
How 'bout just one for me?

533
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:51,525
Somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the Lord today.

534
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,491
- I haven't gone to sleep yet.
- Is something due?

535
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:57,160
Relax.
I'm working on my pledge project.

536
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,658
You pulled an all-nighter
for fraternity homework?

537
00:29:00,646 --> 00:29:01,912
I've designed...

538
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,912
a homemade video game.

539
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:05,974
It's called Kappa Tau-tris.

540
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,626
It's like Tetris, but the shapes
are all things from the house. Try it.

541
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:16,342
See, you just drop the keg
next to the beer bong.

542
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:18,074
All right, I'm done.

543
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,139
- Dale, I need to beta test it.
- Rusty, I'm not satan's joystick.

544
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,894
Good morning, sunshine.

545
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,040
Mom!
We talked about knocking.

546
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:51,543
I know. I was worried
you were gonna be late for school.

547
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:54,088
I didn't know you had company,
or I would have...

548
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:55,923
brought more lucky charms.

549
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:59,764
Hi. We haven't been introduced.
I'm Marie.

550
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,365
Pretty name.

551
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:06,265
Please, don't feel awkward. I've told
Jonah if he's going to have sex,

552
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:09,368
- I want him to have it under my roof.
- Mother!

553
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:12,606
Mother... That means
it's time for me to make my exit.

554
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:15,372
We're leaving for school in 20 minutes.

555
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:17,221
20 minutes.

556
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,167
You live with your mother?

557
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,244
Yeah, just until I go to college.

558
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,413
Wait... you're not in college?

559
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:30,048
But I'm taking ap calculus.

560
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:32,563
How old are you?

561
00:30:33,187 --> 00:30:34,938
I'll be 17 in two weeks.

562
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:38,509
Which reminds me... My mom's letting me
have a party in the backyard.

563
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,676
You should totally come.
But I gotta warn you,

564
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:42,678
she's insisting I have a piñata.

565
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:44,655
Listen...

566
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,042
I have to go...

567
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:51,250
My mom could drop you off
on the way to school.

568
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,489
Really, I need to walk.

569
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,817
- I crave my morning exercise.
- Can I call you?

570
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:58,764
Yes. In five years.

571
00:31:09,154 --> 00:31:11,138
- Are we off the hook?
- We're still hooked.

572
00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:13,083
This sucks.
What do we do now?

573
00:31:13,356 --> 00:31:14,778
Now we kick ass.

574
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:17,696
Wait until they play Kappa Tau-tris.

575
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:20,352
You made the video game.

576
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:23,574
- Pay up.
- It still has a few bugs.

577
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:26,889
Go ahead and turn it in, Spitter,
and you can be the hero.

578
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,415
And we... can go get fro-yo.

579
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:34,229
I don't want to turn this in alone.
This is our pledge class project.

580
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:37,070
This is your pledge project.

581
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,658
Just like you won beer pong
and you rebuilt Vesuvius.

582
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,912
And we are kinda over it.

583
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:46,292
I don't wanna be the hero.
I wanna be part of this pledge class.

584
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:49,244
But I haven't had much experience
being a team player.

585
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:51,857
I was hoping maybe my brothers...

586
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:53,957
could tell me how to do that.

587
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,109
- Don't be so critical.
- Don't showboat.

588
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,622
- Don't call me Brad.
- And help us

589
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:05,104
brainstorm another project
that we can all be a part of.

590
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:06,419
Done.

591
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,849
So what are some things
every brother in the house enjoys?

592
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,170
- Beer!
- Reruns of cops.

593
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:15,985
Chicks.

594
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:17,898
We can build chicks!

595
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:20,317
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

596
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,808
Casey, over here!

597
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:27,025
I was hoping my big sis could make it.

598
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:31,787
Aren't those the same clothes
you were wearing last night?

599
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:35,610
I'm concerned.

600
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,641
Me too.
About the environment.

601
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:41,529
Which is why I like to wear
all of my outfits

602
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:43,399
twice before washing them.

603
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,634
Water is the Earth's most precious gift.

604
00:32:46,852 --> 00:32:48,396
Excuse us a moment.

605
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:55,686
At least one of us
got our passport stamped last night.

606
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,981
Jonah is 16.

607
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:04,278
Isn't that illegal?
You might be on to catch a predator.

608
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:07,932
I saw Cappie and Rebecca making out
and I lost it.

609
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:11,368
I got drunk,
and I hooked up with some random guy.

610
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,897
Correction.
Random boy.

611
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:17,050
The point is...

612
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:21,399
I let it get to me, and that's exactly
what I didn't want to happen.

613
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:31,013
You're looking very straight today.
You ready for the next lesson?

614
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:34,251
You can't make me straight, all right?
These lessons are useless.

615
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:36,020
Listen, you can't lose faith, okay?

616
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,604
Today's is the best of the bunch.
All about attraction.

617
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:42,123
Now just look at this parade
of female flesh walking by us.

618
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:44,568
- This is absurd.
- Listen, you gotta learn

619
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,998
to appreciate the female form,
the... slope of the neck,

620
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:49,971
curve of the back.

621
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:52,041
The heft of the bosom.

622
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:54,696
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

623
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,870
Now, who do you find attractive?

624
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:03,603
She's cute.

625
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:08,099
See? She is attractive.
I knew you'd have an instinct for this.

626
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:12,429
What is she doing with him?
She must like guys with personality.

627
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:16,016
He doesn't look that hideous to me.

628
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:19,895
- You find him attractive.
- Well, he's got good bone structure.

629
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:21,296
Wait.

630
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,980
- It all makes sense.
- What?

631
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:27,857
Have you ever thought that the reason
you're trying to turn me straight

632
00:34:27,977 --> 00:34:30,665
is because deep down inside...
You might be gay?

633
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:33,441
- Ridiculous.
- Let's just look at the evidence.

634
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:36,229
You don't have sex with women.
You like to knit. You...

635
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:38,099
Appreciate the male form.

636
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:41,222
And I've seen you run.
It's a little bit swishy.

637
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,710
I don't like what you're implying.

638
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:46,129
If you ever need to talk,
I'm here for you.

639
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,185
Until then, you might wanna use this.

640
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:58,491
The world is full
of hot senator's daughters, right?

641
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:01,299
That's the attitude.
Dime a dozen, right?

642
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:03,128
Come on.

643
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:04,989
Come here.

644
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,998
All right, I'll see you later, buddy.

645
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,395
You're a good friend to Beav, Cap.

646
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,502
I'm sorry I haven't been
a very good friend to you.

647
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,115
More friendly fire.

648
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,049
Friends are supposed to warn each other
when they're making mistakes.

649
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:37,996
Look, I understand
why you dislike Rebecca.

650
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,977
- But I've seen a different side of her.
- Rebecca only has one side,

651
00:35:42,097 --> 00:35:45,647
and it's covered in scales. She's just
toying with you to drive me insane.

652
00:35:46,151 --> 00:35:48,483
So seeing me with someone else
is driving you insane?

653
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:50,261
Seeing you with her is.

654
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,237
You and I are done.

655
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:55,490
You made that very clear last semester.
So why do you care?

656
00:35:55,764 --> 00:35:57,742
If you say
it's because we're friends, I swear,

657
00:35:57,862 --> 00:36:00,537
I will vomit
into your ridiculously small purse.

658
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,148
I still care about you, Cap.

659
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:14,422
I care about her.

660
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:16,470
Really.

661
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,883
Is it her winning smile

662
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:22,226
or the fact that she's the one person
on campus you knew would drive me crazy?

663
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,186
What is it, exactly, you see in her?

664
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:27,646
She likes me for me.

665
00:36:42,351 --> 00:36:45,373
First, we gave you the swing-a-ling,
which ended with a broken Beaver.

666
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:49,633
So today, we're going to heal him
and this house

667
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:52,339
- by giving you the thing he likes best.
- You made chicks?

668
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:54,949
Better.

669
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,163
We made...

670
00:36:58,493 --> 00:37:01,302
beer with our brand-new brewery.

671
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:10,497
I have not been this impressed

672
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,943
since Jennifer Hudson in <i>Dreamgirls</i>.

673
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:15,682
You totally came through!

674
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:19,539
Let's have our president
taste the first batch of beer.

675
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,843
- We're calling it Cappie-weizen.
- Nice touch.

676
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,579
Let's let the love flow.

677
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,266
- Is it clear beer?
- Just wait.

678
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,238
Silly me!
This is not about how the beer tastes.

679
00:37:58,538 --> 00:38:00,862
This is about you guys working together!

680
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,326
Brothers, let's hear it for our pledges!

681
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:09,711
I'll drink that.

682
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:14,705
- We're still working on the formula.
- Way to go, Spitter.

683
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,946
I just worked on the fermentation.

684
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,916
Pickle's uncle imports hops,

685
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,845
and Jake made these coasters.
He's now known as...

686
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:24,488
- Woodchuck.
- It's good.

687
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:27,905
I mean, it's no Vesuvius,
but... still.

688
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:34,139
He really loves that volcano.
He's just a little...

689
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:36,030
Endearing.

690
00:38:36,688 --> 00:38:39,358
- Sure.
- Look, I know Joe seems a bit crazy,

691
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,990
but we've been though a lot.
If it weren't for this house,

692
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:45,374
we probably never would
have even talked to each other.

693
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:48,131
But that's the beautiful thing
about brotherhood.

694
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:50,766
It makes you bond with different people

695
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:52,751
outside of your comfort zone.

696
00:38:52,993 --> 00:38:55,545
Speaking of bonding
with different people...

697
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:58,681
- We're making a pancake run to Ihop.
- I'll be there in a second.

698
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:02,026
- I'm just gonna finish...
- Go celebrate. You've earned it.

699
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,692
Spring cleaning?

700
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:20,278
I'm removing every speck of gay
from my life.

701
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:23,472
- Tim McGraw.
- His jeans are too tight.

702
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,342
It draws the eye downward.

703
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:28,124
You realize I was just joking, right?

704
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:30,705
- You're not gay.
- I know, but that's what you gays do.

705
00:39:30,957 --> 00:39:32,958
You indoctrinate.
If I don't stay vigilant,

706
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,919
sooner or later I could end up
with my own bravo tv show.

707
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:38,546
That's ridiculous.
No one can make you gay.

708
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:41,508
Just like no one can make me straight.
It's not a choice.

709
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,009
I can't accept that.

710
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,189
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's not what I believe.

711
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,892
Well, isn't that what college is for...
Challenging our beliefs?

712
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:54,058
Pretty sure it says that
in the brochure.

713
00:39:55,491 --> 00:39:56,815
What do you want from me?

714
00:39:57,057 --> 00:40:00,762
I want you to accept that I'm gay
and happy about it.

715
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,614
All right.
Accepted.

716
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:12,441
Thank you.

717
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:19,637
Next time, we're gonna talk
about that flag, okay?

718
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:25,567
Okay, Tim.
You can stay.

719
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:38,764
Nice tail lights!

720
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:45,171
That's my sister.

721
00:40:46,283 --> 00:40:47,833
We'll save you seats.

722
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:59,632
Let's pretend that never happened
and deal with it later in therapy.

723
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:03,791
So where are you running to?

724
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:06,291
Correct question
is what am I running from?

725
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:09,117
- What do you mean?
- Cappie didn't tell you?

726
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:11,908
- He's dating Rebecca logan.
- They're dating!

727
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,715
Maybe we could put a hit on her.

728
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:20,440
I think she regenerates
like the Terminator.

729
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,188
You okay?

730
00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:27,735
I know I don't have any claim on him.
It's just...

731
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:31,863
Cappie's always been there for me.
Deep down, I felt better knowing that.

732
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,913
It's like a safety net.

733
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,626
I guess so.

734
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:39,167
And now he's gone, and...

735
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,450
- It's scary.
- Can I give you a piece of advice?

736
00:41:45,957 --> 00:41:48,369
The reason people get scared

737
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:52,914
when their safety net is gone
is that they begin to doubt themselves.

738
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:56,392
They think they can't do what they did
before because that net's not there.

739
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:59,181
I'm just saying
that I wish I was as good as you are

740
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:01,231
walking the tightrope that is college.

741
00:42:02,214 --> 00:42:04,464
You're really into this net analogy.

742
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:07,956
- If you fall...
- If you say I will catch you...

743
00:42:08,252 --> 00:42:09,614
This conversation is over.

744
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,969
That's fine.
I'm late for pancakes.

745
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:14,767
Thanks.

746
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:19,031
Wait up.

747
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:26,998
Running.

748
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:29,551
Good idea.
You were looking a little puffy.

749
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,296
Listen, Rebecca,

750
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:37,399
even though I question your motives,

751
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,020
I'm staying out of your relationship
with Cappie. I want no part of it.

752
00:42:41,283 --> 00:42:43,780
Sounds like you're moving on.
Good for you.

753
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,151
I mean, really...
It's been two years.

754
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:51,959
Just... one more...

755
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:53,168
thing.

756
00:42:54,023 --> 00:42:55,566
If you hurt him,

757
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,439
I will hurt you.

758
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:02,818
This is what big sis, little sis week
is all about.
