00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:01,845
Previously on "<i>Greek</i>."

2
00:00:01,986 --> 00:00:04,865
Bro, what you're gonna do si
tell this chick you're not interested.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,623
- Send her a text.
- Really?

4
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:09,744
You're officially free.
That was fast.

5
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:12,844
Rusty, thanks for letting me know.

6
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:14,746
By the way, I have crabs.

7
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:17,139
Come on.
This is your junior year.

8
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:19,484
You need to start making
some tough decisions.

9
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:21,784
What I want is to be
at the center of things.

10
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:23,667
To be challenged and inspired.

11
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:26,035
And I'm still very much
considering law school.

12
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:28,535
I woke up this morning,
and I finally realized

13
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,067
no matter what I say or do,
I can't change the past

14
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,137
- or how you feel about it.
- What if I was less of a jealous idiot?

15
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,468
Then I'd think, maybe,
we could be friends.

16
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:37,907
Remember Shane?

17
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:41,842
You know why he stood Casey up
after the Mr. Purr-fect contest?

18
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:43,890
I paid him to leave her alone.

19
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,094
Pretty smart?

20
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:48,439
Instead of trying to keep
all the guys away from one girl,

21
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,319
you should find a girl who thinks
you're the only guy in the room.

22
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:57,470
Can't believe you signed up for
an extra class you don't get credit for.

23
00:00:57,618 --> 00:00:58,670
It's a prep class.

24
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,837
And, according to Evan,
it's the best way to ace the LSAT.

25
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:05,967
And it gets my mom off my back,
which is even better than course credit.

26
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:09,212
Thank God I gave up my
advanced degree aspirations.

27
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:11,603
Standardized tests are so not my thing.

28
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,345
Good luck, Case.

29
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,676
I'm off to my seminar
on the movies of John Hughes.

30
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,865
Enjoy!

31
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:22,931
So...

32
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:26,103
Is Evan taking this LSAT class, too?

33
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,616
Evan? No,

34
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:30,525
Mr. Born-Lawyer already took the class,
of course.

35
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,871
On his way to becoming the Supreme
Court's youngest clerk ever.

36
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:37,296
"Welcome to your first step
towards an exciting

37
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:40,642
- "future career in the law."
- Casey Cartwright, Esquire.

38
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:42,229
Bad-ass prosecutor by day,

39
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:44,401
and Armani-wearing temptress by night.

40
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,846
- It's like you're a superhero.
- A superhero with an expense account.

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,358
- Don't remind me.
- About expense accounts?

42
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,071
About money. I'm broke.

43
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:55,659
What am I gonna do about
spring break? It's next week.

44
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:58,162
There's no way you can
your parents go give you more?

45
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:01,123
I can't tell them I've already spent my
allowance for this month.

46
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:03,341
Can I borrow against
your future account?

47
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:05,082
You'll have to make an appointment

48
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:09,020
with my cute administrative man-sistant
to discuss that.

49
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:10,758
Stop, you're intimidating me.

50
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,744
Wait until you see me in the courtroom.

51
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:15,202
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

52
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,438
Case closed.
And so it is resolved.

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,722
It takes 427 licks to get
to the chocolate-y center.

54
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:22,940
Good going, Spitter.

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,294
I've never seen anyone
lick something that fast.

56
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:26,928
It was mildly disturbing.

57
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:30,095
Now, that that's out of the way,
you're all ready to become

58
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:32,338
new men.
Are we getting initiated?

59
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,371
This is an initiation of sorts.

60
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,005
Wait, Beaver.

61
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:46,708
This box contains
the lost souls of dozens

62
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,199
of departed Kappa Taus.

63
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,344
You think there are body parts in there?

64
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:51,540
This box

65
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,219
holds your futures.

66
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:56,016
You
are no longer Pickle.

67
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:58,409
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.

68
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:00,390
You are now...

69
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,798
... Peter Carey, age 24.

70
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,048
Kappa Tau class of 2006.

71
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,712
Gentlemen,
it's time to get your fake Ids.

72
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:13,111
Because while the Kappa Tau
basement does not card,

73
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:14,775
the bouncers at spring break do.

74
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:15,851
Buzzkill.

75
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,625
Doormen you encounter
next week are fierce, pledges.

76
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,940
You must become one
with your new identies.

77
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,707
Let no Myrtle Beach
bouncer tear you asunder.

78
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:26,351
Ben Bennett, you are now...

79
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,265
Of course.

80
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,699
- Frank Franklin.
- Sweet!

81
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,983
Wait, that doesn't look anything
like him. We're gonna get in trouble?

82
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:37,739
Everything worth while
comes with at a risk, Spitter.

83
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,496
Or should I say...

84
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:44,424
... Chad Stewart?

85
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:52,461

So what'd you get?

90
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,583
A new notebook?

91
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,482
Your score.

92
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,917
I got a 160 last practice test.
I got a 160

93
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:29,405
on my last practice test, which would
be OK, except I want to go to Yale

94
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,511
and they would laugh at me
with that score.

95
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,705
And if I don't get
into the international

96
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:35,670
trade law program at Yale, I'm done.

97
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,954
I have a 3.9, which is OK,
but I really need to

98
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:42,509
beef up my internships this summer
if I don't want to be a total joke.

99
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,513
Yeah.

100
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,129
Have you started interviewing yet?

101
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:48,860
Interviewing...
No, not yet.

102
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,060
I thought this class was my first step

103
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,898
towards an exciting
future career in the law.

104
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:03,800
What'd you get on
your last practice test?

105
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:05,289
One-seventy.

106
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:15,037
OK, looks like some people
are overdoing it a little bit, right?

107
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,708
What do you mean?

108
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:23,403
OK, everybody.
Let's get down to business.

109
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,151
I'm sure you've been practicing,

110
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:27,492
so let's go ahead and start
off with a mock-LSAT.

111
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:28,830
Pass those back.

112
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,704
You've got two hours.

113
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,162
When I say go, go.

114
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:52,144
Welcome to Bionic Beats.
Can I see some ID?

115
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:53,383
No problem.

116
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:04,678
He's on the guest list.

117
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,405
- Chad Stewart?

118
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:11,152
That's right.
Chad Stewart.

119
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:14,363
2343 Homer Terrace,

120
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:15,944
Sunshine, Florida.

121
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,594
What's your sign, buddy?

122
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:27,711
You get out of here. You and
your fake ID! You get out of my club!

123
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:29,483
Nobody messes with Tad,

124
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:32,592
the best bouncer in Myrtle Beach!
Get outta my sight!

125
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:34,721
Come on!

126
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:37,427
- You didn't have to give a noogie.
- Lucky that's all you got.

127
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,483
If we were in Myrtle,
you'd get a class-one

128
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:42,808
misdemeanor punishable by a fine
of not more than $200

129
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,333
or imprisonment for not more
than 30 days plus court costs.

130
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,770
Let's let Rusty's abject failure
be a lesson to us all.

131
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:52,387
Well, what kind of question is,
"What's your sign?"

132
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,083
A question the real Chad Stewart
would have answered easily.

133
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,195
There's an in-bar field test
coming up tonight.

134
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,621
I want you to study up and be
prepared, or it's Noogieville for you.

135
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,610
Or jail in some states.

136
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,431
Man, it is wild in there!

137
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:10,458
You don't even wanna know.

138
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:17,583
Back of the line.

139
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,381
Next.

140
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:24,818
I can't believe this.

141
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,758
How commercialized
spring break has become?

142
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,252
That's all good. It's that
I won't be able to participate

143
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:33,063
in any of the pre-packaged
commercialism this year

144
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:34,735
unless I win the lottery.

145
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:41,496
Hello, Powerball.

146
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,671
Don't you have a credit card?

147
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,369
But the bill goes to my parents.

148
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:51,450
And ever since they figured out that
my charges to MAC were for lip gloss

149
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:54,918
and not computer tech-support,
they've been strict with it.

150
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,914
Well, you won't have that problem here.

151
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:59,402
Your Credit Plus bill goes right to you.

152
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:01,237
Not only that,

153
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:04,427
it will allow you to establish
a credit history in your name.

154
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:07,165
- That sounds like a smart thing to do.
- It is.

155
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,241
And for every purchase you make,

156
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,621
you'll earn points.

157
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,629
And I can offer you

158
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,554
a thousand dollar limit.

159
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,017
- Sign us up!
- I don't know.

160
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:19,860
I can throw in a free MP3 player,

161
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:22,595
but the offer is good for today only.

162
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:25,479
But since you guys
are such good customers,

163
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,408
I can have those cards
overnighted to you,

164
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:29,332
and you'll be ready to charge tomorrow.

165
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:34,488
It's just a credit card.
It's not the Army.

166
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,124
Sure, why not?

167
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,262
Spring break, here we come.

168
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:50,962
What are you studying?

169
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,289
I am studying Chad Stewart.

170
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,626
I haven't come across any Chad Stewart.

171
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,815
Is that in the string theory section?

172
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:02,073
Chad Stewart is the guy
whose fake ID I inherited.

173
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,005
But all I can find is his CRU web page

174
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,532
from three years ago.

175
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,808
Apparently, he's a songwriter.

176
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:21,827
Not bad?

177
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,530
Pretty rudimentary chord changes
if you ask me.

178
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:30,824
How old do I look in this?

179
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:32,317
Eighteen.

180
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,543
You know, lying about who
you are is never good, Rusty.

181
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,426
It signals a lack of self-esteem.

182
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,868
Why would I want to be anyone
but Dale Kettlewell?

183
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:43,397
- You wouldn't, Dale.
- Obviously.

184
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:49,245
- What about this?
- You look like my cousin Barry.

185
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,489
He always wore a hat like that.
He's in prison now.

186
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:54,646
I don't care about your cousin.
I need to look like a 24-year-old singer

187
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,348
and snowboarder who backpacks
through South-east Asia.

188
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:59,948
To my knowledge, people who
travel through South-east Asia

189
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,610
generally look like pedophiles.

190
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:05,098
Which is kind of fitting, because
that's what Barry got pinched for.

191
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:07,240
All right. Come on, man, help me out.

192
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:09,288
I will. By referring you
to the Book of Matthew,

193
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,446
which tells us that
one sign of the end times

194
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,607
is Satan impersonating
an angel of light.

195
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:15,196
So it's up to you, Rust.

196
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,547
What do you want to be?
Satan, or an angel of light?

197
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,738
Whichever gets me served
in Myrtle Beach, Dale.

198
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,436
That'd be Satan.
Satan lives in Myrtle Beach.

199
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,694
Hey! What are you doing here?

200
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:37,106
Your Guide to Acing the LASAT.

201
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,376
I'm taking that prep class
you took last semester.

202
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,390
Why didn't you tell me
the goobers in that class

203
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:46,349
passed the bar? I am way behind.
I got a 140 on my first practice test,

204
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,903
thanks to those stupid logic problems.

205
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:51,139
So I thought...

206
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:54,406
I could help you?

207
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,238
Yeah,
but not if it's too weird.

208
00:10:57,654 --> 00:11:00,897
I don't want to ask too much
of our brand-new friendship.

209
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,164
You know, of course it's not too weird.

210
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,313
You need help, I'm here for you.

211
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,475
And I've got a bunch of my
old practice tests upstairs.

212
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:17,762
You're right, those logic problems
can be a bitch.

213
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:29,251
Pickle,

214
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,329
you're up first. Then Ben Bennett.

215
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:33,533
Rusty might need
a little extra prep time.

216
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:35,079
Hey, I've been studying.

217
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:36,740
I'm sure you have, Spitter.

218
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:39,345
She just got a big tip.

219
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,687
Her mood is good.
Pickle, you're up.

220
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,265
Gentlemen.

221
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:46,333
What can I get you?

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,127
I'll have a vodka
and orange juice, please.

223
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,968
No problem.
Can I just see some ID first?

224
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:54,215
Sure.

225
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,676
So, Peter, I see you're from Omaha?

226
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:02,353
I'm a Libra.

227
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:04,774
How about just the orange juice?

228
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,942
What about you? You over 21?

229
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,504
Well, I'm flattered you'd ask,
little lady.

230
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,905
I haven't been Ided in years.

231
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,045
Six-foot-three, huh?

232
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,099
I'm gotta go to the bathroom.

233
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:25,766
Me, too.

234
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,244
What about you two?
Got some ID for me?

235
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,972
Are you really Chad Stewart?

236
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:48,983
- In the flesh.
- Yeah. Who else would I be?

237
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,524
This is so weird.

238
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:54,934
I always had this fantasy of
you walking into my bar one day.

239
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,738
I never thought it would happen.

240
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,216
I mean, you haven't been
seen in Cyprus in three years,

241
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:02,224
since you walked out of that
gig at the Coffee Grounds Cafe.

242
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:05,757
By the way, I agree with you.
Commercialism has ruined music.

243
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:09,510
Hunter's Heartis my favorite
song off your underground CD.

244
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:12,697
I'm Trish,
by the way.

245
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:16,347
Well, you know my name.

246
00:13:19,138 --> 00:13:19,949
So

247
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:21,591
what can I get you?

248
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,229
Singapore Sling.

249
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:24,948
Singapore Sling.

250
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,029
You are so cool.

251
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,378
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

252
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,398
Singapore Sling?

253
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:36,796
Well, Chad Stewart spent
a summer in Singapore.

254
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,157
Far be it for me
to question Chad Stewart.

255
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:45,244
"A seafood restaurant
serves five different entrees

256
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:46,864
"on five different nights.

257
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,147
"If halibut is served only
on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

258
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:53,298
"then when does the restaurant
serve Lobster"?

259
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:59,279
First of all, I'm never eating
seafood again. Secondly,

260
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,216
am I crazy or are these questions
totally pointless?

261
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:05,678
Is anyone thinking of fish when they're
defending someone on death row?

262
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,870
If they're hungry, maybe.

263
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:12,474
No, seriously, the point is
testing your reasoning skills.

264
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:15,159
They're what you use to craft
your entire argument.

265
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,560
You know, and winning arguments
is what the law is all about.

266
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,102
If you find the right argument,

267
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,053
you can win any case. It doesn't
matter what the facts are.

268
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:25,658
The truth is beside the point.

269
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,996
But, in the meantime,
I'm still dealing with fish.

270
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:32,843
That's true. OK.
But

271
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,019
I also know that you
happen to be a whiz at Sudoku.

272
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:40,137
Remember? I had fight you
for it every Sunday morning.

273
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,131
Yeah?

274
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:44,324
What are you trying to do? Torture
me with the various leisure activities

275
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:46,423
I no longer have time to enjoy?

276
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:49,638
No, no. I'm trying to point out to you

277
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,327
that these logic problems
are actually a lot like Sudoku.

278
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:57,023
You line things up
and cancel them out until they fit.

279
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,538
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

280
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:04,986
So let's try this again,
Sunday morning Sudoku-style.

281
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:06,190
Right on.

282
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:09,397
Isn't this strange?

283
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:13,671
I mean, us getting studying for the LSAT
together like we always planned?

284
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:16,424
No. It doesn't feel strange to me.

285
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,031
It feels...

286
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:22,748
... great that we can be mature
enough to sit here together,

287
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,904
studying, as friends.

288
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:26,719
I love this.

289
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:29,743
Me, too.

290
00:15:35,653 --> 00:15:38,390
So there I was,
all alone,

291
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:41,502
hiking through the
Kanchanaburi province,

292
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:44,282
when I came upon the most
pristine rainbow

293
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:45,964
I've ever seen.

294
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,367
Wait, is that how you got
inspired to write Wet Tuesday?

295
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,921
That's my second favorite song of yours.

296
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,463
No. Actually the,

297
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:57,874
the wetness
in the song

298
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:00,271
refers to the tears that I shed

299
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,052
after a bad breakup.

300
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:07,280
Must've been the worst breakup ever,
given the violent imagery in that song.

301
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:10,566
"Singed flesh" and
"shattered bones." Yikes!

302
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:12,405
Yeah. Exactly.

303
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:16,563
Gee, you sure know a lot about my music.

304
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,938
I'm sorry. Am I
making you uncomfortable?

305
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:20,840
I know how private you are. I'm just

306
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:23,637
still so amazed you came out of hiding.

307
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:26,887
I'll be right back.

308
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,731
- Did you see that?
- She's way into me.

309
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:33,950
Easy, Spitter.

310
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,710
Chick bartenders tend to make all male
drinkers feel like that. They're like

311
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:40,132
clothed strippers that way.

312
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:42,698
Hey,

313
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:45,832
would you, maybe,
be interested in going to this

314
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:47,828
party thing with me this weekend?

315
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,275
Yeah.

316
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:50,439
Great!

317
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,485
Meet me here.

318
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:57,167
Friday night,
7:00.

319
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,058
Excuse me, miss.

320
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,497
- Bye.
- All right.

321
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,325
Looks like you had it all wrong.

322
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:20,775
- Cough syrup and suntan lotion.
- Exactly.

323
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:44,727
Sunday morning Sudoku.

324
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:05,376
<i>I was naive</i>

325
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,422
<i>Not to let you go
When the time was right</i>

326
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:11,050
<i>When the time was right</i>

327
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,181
<i>I was a fool.</i>

328
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:21,987
Casey's a genius, yay!

329
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:25,758
OK. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
It's just a practice test.

330
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:27,650
But you got a 155.

331
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:30,138
- And that deserves another round.
- Exactly.

332
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:31,618
I'll get this one.

333
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:36,339
A pitcher, please,
and you can keep the tab open.

334
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:37,202
Got it.

335
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:39,140
I've always wanted to say that.

336
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:42,511
Take it easy there, Spendy González.
I don't want my first court Case

337
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,588
- bailing you out of debtor's prison.
- I have it under control.

338
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:48,260
Besides, every time I make a purchase,
I earn points.

339
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,630
Points for what?

340
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,811
I don't know.
But everyone loves points.

341
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,262
I'll be right back. I'm

342
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,069
I'm gonna give my
study-buddy the good news.

343
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,718
I say they're back together
by spring break.

344
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,936
What do you think?

345
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,164
I don't think she'd
take him back, do you?

346
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:13,082
Never thought she'd take him back after
he slept with Rebecca.

347
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,797
And I never thought she'd
hook up with Cappie again. So

348
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:17,391
who knows?

349
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:20,672
But, think about it, this is how
they started out freshman year.

350
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,017
They were just friends.

351
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:24,640
Before you know it,
a friendly hug becomes

352
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:27,798
a friendly kiss becomes
here we go again. So...

353
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:31,961
it's not what I'd choose for her,
but if it makes her happy...

354
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,265
I guess I thought.

355
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:37,719
She was so done with him,
nothing he did would make a difference.

356
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:41,524
No, I outscored most of those
bleeding ulcers because of you.

357
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:44,588
- Thank you so much.
- You're the one that took the test.

358
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:48,112
You're gonna make a great lawyer.
I, for one, can personally attest

359
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:50,885
to your skills in the
argumentative arts.

360
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:53,945
Seriously, I owe you one.

361
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:55,571
Let's grab dinner, celebrate.

362
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:00,404
- Yeah, sure, why not?
- All right.

363
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,125
But only if you let me treat.

364
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:27,342
She's going for it. I tell
her I snowboard in the Swiss Alps.

365
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,768
So then she invites me to
this wild party this weekend.

366
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:32,918
- Are you gonna go?
- Of course I'm gonna go.

367
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:35,938
- I can't disappoint my biggest fan.
- That is awesome.

368
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:38,865
I can't believe she bought you
as a 24-year-old musician.

369
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:41,591
We have got to work
on our fake ID technique, OK?

370
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:44,931
Aren't you supposed to be organizing
Beaver's adult video collection?

371
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:48,098
Sorry, Cap. Rusty was just telling
us about the sweet party

372
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,713
- he's going to this weekend.
- Is that so?

373
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,344
Spitty, you're not actually thinking
about going to that party?

374
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:05,302
Trish invited me.
I can't stand her up.

375
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:07,550
No, Trish invited Chad Stewart.

376
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:08,963
Not Rusty Cartwright.

377
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,640
Playing Chad Stewart
over a round of Singapore Slings

378
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:15,275
is one thing, but do you really think
you can pull it off for an entire night?

379
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:17,749
Me thinks you're
in over your head, wee one.

380
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,492
You think I can't handle it?

381
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:22,224
- Well... No, I...
- Hey. Come on.

382
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,918
'Cause I think I can
handle myself just fine.

383
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,336
In fact,

384
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,650
while you've been tied down
with one girl all semester,

385
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,717
I've been handling myself
with various ladies.

386
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:37,515
Handling yourself is perfectly normal
and we all do it, but it's not

387
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:39,550
necessarily something
you wanna brag about.

388
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,247
Very funny.
What about Tina?

389
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,112
I forgot about Tina.

390
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,667
Too bad she turned out to be so...

391
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,235
- crabby.
- Hey, I took care of it.

392
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:55,772
I'm not trying to sound like a jerk. I
just don't want you to get carried away.

393
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:58,110
Because when a man gets
too big for his britches,

394
00:21:58,282 --> 00:21:59,843
you know how he ends up, Rusty?

395
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,315
Naked.

396
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,046
Think about that.

397
00:22:10,072 --> 00:22:11,429
I really wanted that wrap.

398
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:13,882
It would've gone perfectly with
all of my new bathing suits.

399
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:16,665
What kind of thrift store
doesn't take credit cards that way?

400
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,558
A thrift store that only takes cash.

401
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,195
And didn't you already
buy some sort of wrap?

402
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:25,517
I can return that.
And this is vintage.

403
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:29,314
Do I need to do a credit-card
intervention on you?

404
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,038
I need all this stuff for spring break.

405
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,034
When I get back, I'll get more allowance

406
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:37,126
and I'll be able to pay it all off,
without a cent of interest.

407
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:39,493
Do you see how carefully
I've thought this out?

408
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:42,694
Yeah, but your careful thinking
seems to have found its limit.

409
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:45,680
Unless...

410
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:49,264
... I give up "careful" thinking
and go for more...

411
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:51,910
- ..."outside the box" thinking.

412
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,222
You said you needed a new flash drive.

413
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:57,059
They sell those at the campus store,

414
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,660
which takes credit cards.
See where I'm going with this?

415
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:02,758
Yeah, I give you the cash,
and you charge the flash.

416
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:04,175
And we have a plan.

417
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,946
Just this once.

418
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:12,833
- Please, please, please.
- All right, all right.

419
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:17,744
Why do I feel like Michael Jackson's
plastic surgeon?

420
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,606
What are those?

421
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,394
Books. You, of all people,
should recognize them.

422
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,029
So you were serious
about that law school thing?

423
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:35,669
I thought you were trying
to get Mom off your back.

424
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,064
No, that was just a happy
byproduct. Rusty, hello.

425
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,284
Law school has been my plan
since freshman year.

426
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:42,968
Really? What kind of law?

427
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:47,079
I'll worry about that after
I get through my LSAT class.

428
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:49,820
Which, by the way, I am kicking ass in.

429
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,226
I have to go meet Evan for dinner.

430
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:54,169
You're meeting Evan for dinner?

431
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:58,646
He's been helping me with
my LSAT class,

432
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:01,910
that's all.
And we're going out to celebrate.

433
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,076
And...

434
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:05,696
- And...
- Here we go again.

435
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:08,856
Did anyone ever tell you you're
the world's biggest flip-flopper?

436
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:11,181
I'm not flip-flopping.
Evan and I are friends.

437
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,659
No, Evan isn't capable
of being a decent friend.

438
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:16,386
There's always a catch with him.

439
00:24:17,195 --> 00:24:19,435
He's sneaky and manipulative,

440
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,201
and you cannot trust him.

441
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:25,442
Case, he's gonna take you to
some swanky, romantic restaurant

442
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:26,988
and try and lure you back.

443
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,530
It's like he's the Kanchanaburi pit vipe
of Thailand,

444
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:33,807
and you're his juicy little field mouse.

445
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:38,426
You haven't let Cappie
make you brownies, have you?

446
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:41,649
And there's no way that's
what Evan's thinking.

447
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:45,837
What's with the jacket?
You look like you're 12.

448
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:50,421
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

449
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,022
See ya later, Rust.

450
00:24:53,706 --> 00:24:55,773
Don't be his field mouse, Casey.

451
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,883
This is the kind of
place I was in the mood for.

452
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:03,638
- I'm glad you suggested it.
- Me, too. Hey.

453
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:07,765
I hope you're in the mood for this, too.

454
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:14,303
You're not gonna give me a
mock-LSAT over dinner, are you?

455
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:17,682
What's this for?

456
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:19,040
Well,

457
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,311
it just so happens
that my dad's old buddy

458
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,566
is the dean of admissions at Harvard.

459
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:28,386
And it just so happens
that this old buddy

460
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,609
is in Cyprus for some conference.

461
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,866
That's a lot of just-so-happening.

462
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:35,958
But the biggest happening of all,

463
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,304
I got you a sit-down with him.
Sunday afternoon.

464
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,384
- Harvard Law School?
- Kind of a big one.

465
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:43,923
Where you're going.

466
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:49,466
Wait a minute, Case.

467
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,203
Come on. You're not

468
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,306
reading too much into this, are you?

469
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,801
- It just seems...
- Listen.

470
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,478
Two of my Omega Chi brothers
are already meeting with him.

471
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,548
I thought...
I thought it'd be great if you did, too.

472
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:04,069
You know? This isn't some

473
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,866
elaborate ploy to get you back.

474
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:09,571
- I know.
- 'Cause we're just friends.

475
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:12,474
Amigos, right? That's it.

476
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:15,955
But, listen, if that's
too weird for you, then...

477
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:19,707
- No! It's not too weird for me.
- And it's not too weird for me.

478
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:22,668
OK, so...

479
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,362
I feel like a total Jackass.

480
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,299
Can we just order
and forget I said anything?

481
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,951
- And thank you.
- And you're welcome.

482
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:46,499
I love my new lip gloss.

483
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:47,971
What do you think?

484
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:49,427
I think...

485
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:52,077
... that corporate litigation
sounds really boring.

486
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,339
Well, so do I.

487
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,705
So stop reading that
and come to Dobler's with me.

488
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:57,691
- I'm gonna open another tab.
- I can't.

489
00:26:57,853 --> 00:27:00,791
I'm meeting this Harvard guy tomorrow.
I need to find something

490
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:04,561
to talk to him about, like
what kind of law I want to practice.

491
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:06,648
There's...

492
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,998
Quantitative corporate finance.

493
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:11,360
That sounds worse than
corporate litigation.

494
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,975
No, no, no. This actually
sounds kind of cool:

495
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,648
"Students learn to assess risk...

496
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:21,334
"by using multi-factor
models and analyzing

497
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:24,577
- "corporate structure."
- Whatever you say.

498
00:27:27,925 --> 00:27:29,445
What's up with your knee?

499
00:27:30,728 --> 00:27:31,559
What?

500
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,987
You looked like you were
having a convulsion.

501
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,173
No, it didn't.

502
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:40,073
Well, I'm off.

503
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:42,380
When fun Casey returns,

504
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:44,164
she knows where to find me.

505
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:48,872
"Contracts..."

506
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,469
Hey, I don't look 12 in this, do I?

507
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:53,632
No.

508
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,914
All right. Good.

509
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,782
But it is kind of a feminine cut.

510
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:05,505
Where are you going? Another one
of your debauched frat fetes?

511
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:08,371
Actually, no.
This is a party for grown-ups.

512
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:09,690
I'm listening.

513
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,598
It's just this girl I met.

514
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,745
It's this party in town.
No one from school.

515
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:15,892
Townie party?

516
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:18,710
- I'm totally down.
- I didn't invite you, Dale.

517
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:21,021
And why would you want to go anyway?

518
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:25,318
I'm so weary of the juvenile drivel

519
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,526
that passes for conversation
on this campus.

520
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:30,268
A little adult interaction
is exactly what I need right now.

521
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,405
You know a lot about music, right?

522
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:35,695
Are Norma Kettlewell's fresh-baked
blueberry muffins

523
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,457
the best smell in the world?

524
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:39,678
The answer is yes.

525
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:42,199
OK. Great.
Then you can come.

526
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,967
- 'Cause I might need your help.
- As always.

527
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:46,629
All right.

528
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,031
There's a five-dollar minimum
for charges.

529
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:00,866
Well, I'll just have
to get five dollars worth of gum.

530
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:14,003
Sorry. Card's been declined.

531
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:16,862
Come on. For five dollars?

532
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,467
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

533
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,157
But I have a thousand dollar limit.
There's no way

534
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:23,240
I could possibly have spent...

535
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,347
you don't happen to take points, do you?

536
00:29:36,535 --> 00:29:38,437
Look at all these nice cars.

537
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:41,193
- I hope we're not underdressed.
- You might be.

538
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:46,622
- And you have to call me Chad.

539
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:50,619
What? No, Rusty. I did not sign on
for anything like that.

540
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:51,905
Hi.

541
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:53,023
Hey, Trish.

542
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:54,724
I told you you were underdressed.

543
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:56,519
You look wonderful.

544
00:29:58,352 --> 00:29:59,832
This is my buddy, Dale.

545
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:01,679
Yeah, hey. I...

546
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,780
I just decided to accompany
my good buddy Rock and Roll Chad

547
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,070
to your little shindig tonight.

548
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,933
Chad, I'm so glad you came.

549
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:14,868
But, listen,
please

550
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,828
don't hate me. I wasn't

551
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,320
totally honest with
you when I invited you here.

552
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:23,336
Hey, I've always
said honesty is overrated.

553
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:26,611
So, whatever it is, it's no big deal.

554
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,582
Two people joining under God.
Sweet.

555
00:30:45,773 --> 00:30:47,806
My sister Jill is getting married today,

556
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:51,373
and she's an even bigger fan
of yours than I am, believe it or not.

557
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:53,920
I'm sorry to ambush you like this. But

558
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,512
I knew you'd say no
if I asked in advance.

559
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,259
But, well,
our dad died last year,

560
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:04,352
and it was your music that got
Jill through that terrible time.

561
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:08,243
And I promised her you'd do it.
I know that was stupid. I just thought.

562
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:09,729
Well,

563
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:13,184
since my dad couldn't be here
to walk Jill down the aisle,

564
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:15,526
maybe Hunter's Heartcan.

565
00:31:19,396 --> 00:31:20,790
You want me to sing?

566
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:23,687
Yeah. Go get 'em, Chad-o.

567
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:25,820
Let's hear you rock that mic.

568
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,876
Oh my god!
My sister's gonna be so excited!

569
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:56,609
Sorry.

570
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:12,436
<i>Hunter's heart.</i>

571
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,270
<i>You hide...
And I try to...</i>

572
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:20,517
<i>Something... song.</i>

573
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:35,592
What's wrong? Is it stage fright?
I know it's been a long time.

574
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:38,197
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm not Chad Stewart.

575
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:42,381
Just give us a second.
Everything's fine.

576
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:45,886
- What are you talking about?
- My name is Rusty Cartwright.

577
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:49,845
I'm 18 years old, I'm tone-deaf,
I don't snowboard,

578
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:52,973
I used Chad Stewart's ID to buy alcohol.

579
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,041
- That was a fake ID?
- I'm really sorry.

580
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:57,976
I probably could've gotten you fired.

581
00:32:58,096 --> 00:33:00,225
Yeah, that's the least
of my problems right now.

582
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:01,982
What's happening? What's going on?

583
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:04,812
Maybe she came to her senses
and decided to call it off.

584
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:08,525
She didn't want to marry him!
She shouldn't.

585
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:11,656
Are you kidding me, Jill?

586
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:12,913
You're flaking?

587
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,368
That is it!

588
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:18,048
I am SO sick of you
and your drama-queen games!

589
00:33:18,168 --> 00:33:19,911
You're calling me a drama queen?

590
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:22,826
I have just one word for you, Pete:
Phoenix.

591
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,047
You would bring that up!

592
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:26,367
Let's go.

593
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:29,718
I hope you've learned a
lesson about the wages of sin...

594
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,401
Shut up, Dale!

595
00:33:36,402 --> 00:33:39,427
Thanks for making it quick.
My friend's having a crisis.

596
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:41,681
Here you go.

597
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:46,307
I'm so pathetic. I can't
even pay for my own beer.

598
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:49,302
So you overdid on
the whole consumerism thing.

599
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:52,664
It happens.
This is America. Don't fret.

600
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:54,679
I can't believe I bought all that stuff.

601
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:57,325
I kept getting this crazed
feeling like if I didn't

602
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:00,450
grab what I wanted right away,
that someone else would.

603
00:34:00,744 --> 00:34:02,142
I know what you mean.

604
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:07,404
Hey, isn't that that Lambda Sig
who stood up Casey?

605
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:09,586
What's his name, Shane?

606
00:34:10,763 --> 00:34:12,881
What a dirtbag.
Look at him over there,

607
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:14,907
laughing all slimily.

608
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,912
That whole thing was so weird.

609
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:20,750
- Wasn't it? He seemed so into her.
- I know!

610
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:22,195
I mean, if I were Casey,

611
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:24,929
I'd be dying to know what made
him do that, wouldn't you?

612
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:27,480
He shouldn't be allowed to get
away with dissing her like that.

613
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,348
- You're right.
- I'm sick of guys treating girls

614
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,602
like crap and never
get called out on it.

615
00:34:32,723 --> 00:34:33,872
Me too.

616
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,495
I wish I could just go over there and

617
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,551
tell him off right here and now.

618
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:40,635
You should.

619
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:43,071
- Really?
- Yeah. Do it!

620
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:54,834
Hey,
you!

621
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,591
Yes? Can I help you?

622
00:34:58,016 --> 00:34:59,212
You sure can.

623
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,759
You can start by explaing to me
who you think you are,

624
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:03,563
blowing off Casey Cartwright?

625
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:08,195
You seem a little drunk, so...

626
00:35:08,337 --> 00:35:10,729
Well, you seem
a little bit like a loser.

627
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:14,048
Like one of those guys
who has to treat girls badly

628
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:15,405
to feel like a real man.

629
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:17,946
If you want to lecture someone
about treating girls badly,

630
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:20,699
- talk to Evan, not my bro here.
- Steve!

631
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,545
Stop trying to change the subject.

632
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:25,087
Evan is a really good
friend of Casey's now.

633
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:28,671
Look...

634
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,755
Evan is no friend of Casey's.

635
00:35:33,856 --> 00:35:35,032
What do you mean?

636
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:44,411
Hold on.

637
00:35:47,544 --> 00:35:48,983
Hold on five seconds.

638
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:52,487
Casey. What's wrong?

639
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:55,762
Did you pay Shane Mullen
to stay away from me?

640
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:58,450
What are you talking about?

641
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,326
I'm talking about you paying
someone a thousand dollars

642
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:03,288
to stand me up and humiliate me.

643
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,205
That is crazy. Who told you that?

644
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:06,967
Shane told Ashleigh at Dobler's.

645
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:08,752
And you believe him over me?

646
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,537
- Why would he make that up?
- 'Cause he's a jerk.

647
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:13,178
To excuse bad behavior.

648
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,939
So you didn't pay him off?

649
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,410
Look,

650
00:36:16,703 --> 00:36:19,439
you need to forget about him.
You've got an interview to prepare for.

651
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:21,446
You're not denying it.

652
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:25,369
Just give me a straight answer, Evan.

653
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:27,736
Yes.

654
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,895
Who does that?

655
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:32,195
You dumped me.

656
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,029
You don't want to be with me, but
you don't want anyone else to either?

657
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,731
- How could you be so spiteful?
- I didn't do it to be spiteful.

658
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:39,863
- Then why?
- Because I love you.

659
00:36:50,202 --> 00:36:52,177
After everything we've been through?

660
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:54,792
Did you really think this
is how you could win me back?

661
00:36:55,686 --> 00:36:57,207
Because that's not love.

662
00:36:57,753 --> 00:36:58,769
I was desperate.

663
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:01,638
People who love each other
shouldn't manipulate each other.

664
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,758
This needs to stop. The things

665
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,921
we keep doing to each other
need to stop.

666
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:12,372
- I just don't want you to hate me.
- I don't hate you.

667
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:16,149
I feel...

668
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:18,631
sad for you.

669
00:37:20,173 --> 00:37:21,734
And for me, because

670
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:25,626
I really thought we were friends.

671
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,058
And now...

672
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,472
I think,
you should,

673
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,929
I don't know, take some time,

674
00:37:42,624 --> 00:37:45,299
- get your head together.
- My head is perfectly together.

675
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:48,215
- I didn't mean...
- No, no, no. I got it.

676
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:50,542
- You think I'm pathetic.
- Evan.

677
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,480
I think we're done here.

678
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:10,277
I hope I can work this out. I really
need to buy Casey a pick-me-up present.

679
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:15,467
My God! I've been on hold for so long

680
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:18,021
this techno version of to Joy
is starting to sound catchy.

681
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,116
You could always
just return everything instead.

682
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:24,276
I mean, Ashleigh. Do you
really need this tankini?

683
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,051
First,

684
00:38:26,852 --> 00:38:30,440
I love that you know the term tankini.
And second, yes.

685
00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:31,414
Ashleigh.

686
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:34,414
What? I'm gonna work out a payment plan,
and everything will be fine.

687
00:38:34,951 --> 00:38:36,586
Hello!
Yes!

688
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,648
So

689
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:40,172
I spent a little more than I planned,

690
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:42,981
and my card was declined, so I just...

691
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,265
Really? You can?

692
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:48,724
That's great!

693
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:51,176
Thank you!

694
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:54,163
That was quick.

695
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:55,927
Did they you on a payment plan?

696
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:58,217
Nope, they upped my credit limit.

697
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:10,831
Hey, what are you doing?

698
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:14,369
Learning how to take a pair of leather
jodhpurs from runway to reality.

699
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:19,418
Don't you have that
Harvard meeting at noon?

700
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:21,437
The meeting Evan set up?

701
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,815
No thanks.

702
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:25,873
I'd rather wear leather jodhpurs.

703
00:39:25,993 --> 00:39:28,952
Seriously, sweetie, you
cannot blow off that meeting.

704
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:31,332
Sure, I can.
It's Evan-tainted now.

705
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:33,447
Who cares about Evan's taint?

706
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:36,997
Yes, he did something creepy,
and I totally support you

707
00:39:37,117 --> 00:39:39,816
wanting to stay miles away from him. But

708
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,467
this Harvard meeting
is about your life, not his.

709
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,307
You seem to have a good
head on your shoulders.

710
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,382
I'd say if your scores keep improving,
and you

711
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:52,087
fill your resume out a bit,

712
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,873
you've got a good shot.

713
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:57,048
So do you have any more
questions for me?

714
00:39:57,749 --> 00:39:59,147
No, I think that's it.

715
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:00,775
You've been very helpful.

716
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,884
I'm so glad we did this.

717
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:05,336
All right.
Then I have a question for you.

718
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:10,524
Let's assume you get in...
to Harvard, or someplace else.

719
00:40:11,313 --> 00:40:12,791
That's just the beginning.

720
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:17,331
I want to know what it is about
the law that's exciting to you.

721
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,645
Why do you, Casey Cartwright,

722
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:21,611
want to be a lawyer?

723
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:36,828
Geez, Dale. It really weirds me out
when you do that.

724
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,983
Sorry.

725
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,064
Come in!

726
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:43,735
- Hi, Dale.
- Hi, Chelsea.

727
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,445
Sorry, it's Casey, right?
Chelsea was my ex-girlfriend.

728
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:52,318
- That I had.
- Actually, I wanted a word with Rusty.

729
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:55,275
Yeah. Sure.
You guys go ahead. I...

730
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:58,019
I was actually gonna head out,
go to the gym for a little bit.

731
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,397
Been working out,

732
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,610
you know,
just for me.

733
00:41:02,352 --> 00:41:03,265
You know,

734
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:05,453
for summer.

735
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,024
Those space pajamas
don't look sweat-proof.

736
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:14,075
So why are you here?

737
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:21,189
No one else will understand this.

738
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:24,053
You're the only person I could think of

739
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:26,604
who's known what they want to do
with the rest of your life

740
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:28,325
since they were in diapers.

741
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:30,046
It was actually pre-school.

742
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:33,637
We made these pinhole cameras,
checking out a solar eclipse,

743
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:37,061
and I had this kind of "a-ha" moment.

744
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:41,134
Which you probably had about
law school sometime, too, right?

745
00:41:41,276 --> 00:41:44,608
Except that it wasn't
my "a-ha" moment.

746
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:46,589
It was Evan's.

747
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:49,025
I don't get it.

748
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:53,759
Being Miss "A-ha-Less,"

749
00:41:54,906 --> 00:41:57,055
it was easier to follow Evan's path.

750
00:41:57,197 --> 00:42:00,414
So easy that, after a while,
I forgot I was following anyone at all.

751
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:02,460
Unfortunately, I didn't figure that out

752
00:42:02,581 --> 00:42:04,690
until the Harvard dean of admissions
asked me

753
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:06,321
why I want to be a lawyer,

754
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,054
and I had to say,

755
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,241
"Because of my ex-boyfriend."

756
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:17,738
Well, if there's

757
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,476
one thing that I've learned,

758
00:42:20,962 --> 00:42:22,158
it's that

759
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:25,274
living someone else's life
is never a good idea.

760
00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:32,516
Everyone in that LSAT class knew exactly

761
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:34,100
what they wanted,

762
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,880
from where they would go
to law school

763
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:39,042
to what kind of lawyer they would be.

764
00:42:39,563 --> 00:42:42,421
And it turns out, I know
exactly what I want, too.

765
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:45,925
I know what kind of law
I want to practice.

766
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:47,845
None.

767
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:50,613
So what now?

768
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:57,227
Now... we

769
00:42:57,551 --> 00:42:58,787
do not mope.

770
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:01,426
We go back to ZBZ,

771
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:05,325
make slice-and-bake cookies
and eat the whole pan.

772
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:07,758
- Are you in?
- I'm in.

773
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:12,406
Not that jacket.
