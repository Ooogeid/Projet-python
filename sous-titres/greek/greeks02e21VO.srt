1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,208
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:04,420
Ever since I took my trust,
I've become this person.

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,099
- I buy my way out of everything.
- You'll get used to it.

4
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:10,301
- Look at Dad.
- I don't want to be like Dad.

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,637
Vesuvius is a homecoming legend.

6
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,338
It's the party against
which all other parties are judged.

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,225
- They killed her, Cap. Vesuvius.
- No.

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,477
I'm with Max.

9
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,729
Why can't you find
someone else perfect for you?

10
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,939
No other girl in the world
compares to you.

11
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,984
- It's old habits, Cap.
- Old habits? Like having a great time?

12
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,445
- What does that tell you?
- That we can't be friends.

13
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:31,163
I'll see you around.

14
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:45,450
I love blue. I love alumni.

15
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,196
Hi alumna? Alumnus?

16
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:49,815
Whatever.

17
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,221
Most of all, I love my first homecoming
with my boyfriend.

18
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,361
Yay, homecoming.

19
00:00:57,554 --> 00:01:00,460
But most of all I love having
a best friend who won't hate me

20
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:03,942
for forgetting that her boyfriend
is far away doing sciencey stuff.

21
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:06,972
I don't need you to be sad for me, Ash.
I'm happy for you, but...

22
00:01:07,097 --> 00:01:10,404
All this focus on homecoming
definitely makes me miss Max.

23
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:14,365
Well, you two will have
your own homecoming in less than a week.

24
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,929
<i>Trident fishermen stay up late.</i>

25
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:20,060
<i>Ties the flies and masters the bait.</i>

26
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,742
<i>Stay up late.</i>

27
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,505
I do not love blue that much.

28
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,813
- Nice suit. Who died?
- A dear friend.

29
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:41,560
- Really?
- No.

30
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,020
Now. Get out of here,
Evan Rachel Wooden.

31
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,065
Just keeping up appearances.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,450
- What the hell?
- It's okay, Ash.

33
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,199
No, not Cappie, Frannie.

34
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,477
OK, if everybody could please
take their seats.

35
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:04,533
We'll get started.

36
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,338
I'll hand things over
to our float contest chair,

37
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:15,155
Gamma Psi President Natalie Martin,
and her co-chair,

38
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,803
Frannie Morgan,
president of the Iota Kappas,

39
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,726
the newest member to Panhellenic.

40
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:23,101
I've got it, Nat.

41
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:28,481
First, let me say how awesome it is
to be back with you guys.

42
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,088
Officially.

43
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,276
I was supposed to say this part.

44
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,043
And I'm thrilled to announce
our theme

45
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,728
for this year's all-Greek
float building contest

46
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,926
"Love through the ages."

47
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,560
Love through the cages?
Which reminds me, Evan,

48
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:46,332
the petting zoo called.
You're still banned. Sorry.

49
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,781
This year's winning team
will split a $2000 prize

50
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:54,173
which was donated
by one of our most illustrious alumni:

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,966
Jonathan Chambers.

52
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,932
Maybe we should have taken back
those Icky defectors after all.

53
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,646
- I still feel a little sorry for her.
- I've...

54
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:10,393
We've randomly paired the houses
by drawing names out of a hat.

55
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,034
Your partners' names are
in your envelopes.

56
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,530
The Ikapps are with the Omega Chis.

57
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,002
Okay, I officially don't feel sorry
for her anymore.

58
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:24,662
Feel sorry for us, instead.

59
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,789
Kappa Tau?

60
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,252
Okay. Good luck everyone.

61
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,380
So everyone should pair up

62
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,633
with your partners homecoming
float chairs if you brought them.

63
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,991
And start building your floats.

64
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,391
He lived and died for parties.

65
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,546
Like Clarence Thomas once said:

66
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:50,326
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

67
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:51,774
Rage,

68
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:55,617
rage against the dying
of the light."

69
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,794
All things must come
to an end, Pickle.

70
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:01,949
The important now is to find a way
to move on with our lives.

71
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,249
And the only way to do that
is to let go of the past.

72
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,012
Goodbye Vesuvius.

73
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:27,600
Never have the words "ashes to ashes"
been more appropriate.

74
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,611
Why don't we just rebuild Vesuvius?
All we need is some money,

75
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:33,552
a Remington Herzog Atmospheric
Destabilizer, Scotch tape...

76
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:34,972
We've gone through this.

77
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:37,857
It takes serious bank to rebuild
the 8th wonder of the world

78
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:39,095
and we don't have it.

79
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,739
But we would
if we won the float contest.

80
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:44,992
KTs do not do floats.

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,535
I say we put it up to a vote.

82
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:47,734
Fine.

83
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,307
All in favor of spending
countless hours

84
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:54,084
building a ridiculous
homecoming float with the ZBZs...

85
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,711
So we can resurrect Vesuvius.

86
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,463
- ... say "Aye."
- Aye.

87
00:04:58,169 --> 00:04:59,288
Sorry Cap,

88
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,281
it's for Vesuvius.

89
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:04,396
Great.
Then I guess we're building a float.

90
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:08,515
So now,
before our new float chair, Rusty

91
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,388
leads us to a likely defeat,

92
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:13,656
Pickle has organized a wake
with plenty of beer,

93
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,396
extra crispy chicken
and a screening of Joe vs. The Volcano.

94
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:21,395
- That's my favorite movie.
- I know, Pickle. We all know. Come on.

95
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,402
- I can't...
- Come on.

96
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,965
Yeah, I'll just go ahead.
I'll get started then.

97
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:32,917
Can I help, Spitter?

98
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:35,997
Yeah, sure.

99
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,884
-=Greek 221=-
"Tailgate Expectations"

100
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,796
<i>Timing: Kappa Team</i>

101
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:52,257
I don't know what to do with...

102
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,320
I know that the KTs aren't bad guys.

103
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:57,272
It's just hard to do a project
with people who can't focus.

104
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:00,067
And still need afternoon naps.

105
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:02,539
Ash, I think maybe
I should sit this one out.

106
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,697
What're you talking about? No.

107
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,324
Your float design looks great.

108
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:09,889
Well, except,

109
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:12,939
are you sure there was a giant broccoli
in the Garden of Eden?

110
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,581
It's a tree, not a broccoli.

111
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,750
I shouldn't be in charge
of getting it built.

112
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,003
Maybe Betsy could do it.
She's social chair.

113
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,297
The only float she's ever built
involved ice cream and vodka.

114
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:25,663
Look, I know things between you
and Cappie are a little weird.

115
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:27,136
They aren't weird.

116
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,824
They just... aren't.

117
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:31,273
We're not really talking
to each other.

118
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,708
It's just too awkward
to be around him.

119
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,752
We can't let Frannie and the Ickies
win their first contest

120
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:39,565
out of the Panhellenic box.
It would set a very bad precedent.

121
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:42,067
Ash. "Precedent."

122
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:45,279
- You sound so presidential.
- I know, right?

123
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:49,074
I wanna be a great president
and not lose.

124
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,307
So, you need to do this
not just for me

125
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,287
and for ZBZ, but for yourself.

126
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,041
If you really want Cappie to move on,
you're going to have to be OK with this.

127
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,354
A new kind of Cappie and Casey.

128
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,036
Or maybe
we could just go 90210 Classic

129
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:04,673
and burn down
Frannie's float Emily Valentine style.

130
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,168
- Seriously?
- No.

131
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,300
Let's build a float.

132
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,589
I'll take care
of running the truck and

133
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:15,187
I figured you'd love to be
in charge of the float.

134
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:17,843
- Don't gay guys love floats?
- That's show tunes, jackass,

135
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:20,835
you're mixing your stereotypes.
But even if I did love floats,

136
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,580
I do not love Frannie.

137
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:24,353
Mom.

138
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:26,570
- Sweetheart.
- It's so good to see you.

139
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,112
- Hi, son.
- Hi, Dad.

140
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:30,824
- You remember Calvin.
- Of course.

141
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,039
I hope our little president's
handling the house well.

142
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:39,124
So much so, he just delegated
the float to me. Awesome.

143
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,878
So we could win
and keep the prize money in the family.

144
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,801
Spoken like a true Chambers.

145
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:49,705
OK, well, since I don't speak Chambers,
I'll let you get on with it.

146
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:52,567
Frannie
and the homecoming float awaits.

147
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,969
Doesn't get much better than that.

148
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,608
I don't suppose there's any chance
you and Frannie...

149
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,146
Mim, leave your son alone.

150
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:05,565
- You two are in a good mood.
- We're just glad to see you, son.

151
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:08,319
And we are so proud of you.
Your grades are good.

152
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,307
You're president of Omega Chi.
And I'm assuming that

153
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:14,373
that truly impressive vehicle
parked in the driveway is yours.

154
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,829
Do they let guys my age
drive things like that?

155
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,208
I know things were a bumpy
when we first handed over the trust.

156
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,174
We're just happy
to see you doing so well.

157
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,964
And I'm starving. Ready for lunch?

158
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,850
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

159
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,529
You sure you're not dying
or something, Dad?

160
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:34,748
Trust me, Evan, when I'm dying,
I will not be in a good mood.

161
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,992
We could build a huge castle
over a running stream.

162
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:40,724
It could be like Romeo and Juliet.

163
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,063
That is the best example
of "Love Through the Ages."

164
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,773
What about Jennifer Love Hewitt?

165
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,551
We could start at Party of Five,
move on toTime of Your Life,

166
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:51,405
which wasn't very good.
Can't Hardly Wait, Ghost Whisperer...

167
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:54,190
- Ghosts are pretty cool.
- You can't see ghosts.

168
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,700
Yeah, but she can.

169
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:58,583
We don't even have to make them.
We could just be like:

170
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,373
"There's a ghost."
And people will be like: "Where?"

171
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,696
We'll be like, "J.L.H. can see them."
And they'll be like.

172
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:07,254
Or...

173
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:10,090
Star Wars? Princess Leia
and Han Solo.

174
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,091
Hey guys.

175
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,844
Casey, hey.
We were just discussing our float theme.

176
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,882
I have it right here.

177
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:22,186
We were thinking something
more along the lines of

178
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,729
Death Stars and moats.

179
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:25,480
And Jennifer Love Hewitt.

180
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,774
Neither of you have ever built
a float before?

181
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,611
No, but I did make
a volcano rain beer.

182
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,697
- Is that a giant broccoli?
- That is a tree.

183
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:36,200
Casey's trees
always look like broccoli.

184
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,701
This is the Garden of Eden.

185
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,163
Beautiful, romantic and achievable
with paper-mache and chicken wire.

186
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,352
Hey, Cap.
Come here and check this out.

187
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,131
We were discussing our theme.
Do you want in? I'm thinking Star Wars.

188
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,260
Casey wants the Garden of Eden.

189
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,961
Bert & Ernie?

190
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,997
No? That's all I got.
Guess I'll just head down to Dobler's.

191
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:03,528
OK for the Garden of Eden,
but only if we can put in

192
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,187
a running stream and thunder clouds.

193
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:07,481
And Eve as a ghost.

194
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:17,254
Every flower has to be perfect
if we're gonna beat Frannie.

195
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:20,774
I don't think anyone's going to notice
incorrectly wrinkled tissue paper.

196
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,081
Tailgate supplies complete.

197
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,738
My work here's done.

198
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:29,836
And your fun begins.

199
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,411
So how are you showing
your school spirit this weekend?

200
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:36,914
You know, I guess I'm more
of an internal spirit kind of guy.

201
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,055
You haven't found the right thing.
You just have to keep an open mind

202
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,348
and jump in.

203
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,600
Maybe you could be
in the card section, or...

204
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,936
- Pick fights with the other team.
- Or...

205
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,939
Maybe one of those crazy blue guys
who runs around campus?

206
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,900
No. They're just embarrassing.

207
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,534
And they almost ruined
my new white jacket last night.

208
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:57,967
Between work and school I don't have
much time for that stuff anyway.

209
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,742
How about I catch up with you after
the game? We'll do something then, OK?

210
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,732
Cute, apathetic,

211
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:07,854
and a good shopper.

212
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:09,251
My kind of guy.

213
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:12,129
- If he wasn't already yours.
- Which he is.

214
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,298
And I saw you put
that snotty tissue in there.

215
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:24,298
I called ahead
and rented the biggest truck they have.

216
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:26,126
I appreciate your help.

217
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,799
I gotta say,
I was kinda surprised when you offered.

218
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:31,585
Well, Vesuvius was a big deal
for you, right?

219
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,900
Vesuvius was gonna be my legacy.

220
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,694
How I would be rembered

221
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,250
long after I'm gone.

222
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:42,034
I was thinking the new Vesuvius
could be my legacy also.

223
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,328
Three years in this house
and I'm only known for

224
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,580
is liking foosball and guys.

225
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,671
No... not really.

226
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,752
You ever notice that I'm the only guy
without a nickname?

227
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,129
- What about Wade?
- Freshman year, couldn't swim?

228
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,141
Then let's leave our mark.

229
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:00,135
Great.

230
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,426
So what's Wade's real name?

231
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:04,198
Wade.

232
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,540
- Pleasure doing business with you.
- Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

233
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:14,184
- You sure you don't mind?
- Yeah, don't worry about it. It's fine.

234
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,227
No way.
The KTs are going through with this?

235
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,551
The way Cappie left that meeting,
I thought for sure you guys would...

236
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,241
- ... back out.
- We're backing in.

237
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,329
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

238
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,883
Give Casey my condolences.

239
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:36,284
That's what he said, Frannie.

240
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,378
Good one, Spitter.

241
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,051
We're here
for the twenty foot stakebed.

242
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,032
- Homecoming, right?
- Yeah.

243
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:44,262
I love you guys.

244
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,431
The float thing
has been great for business.

245
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,603
I'd love to help you,
but I just rented it out.

246
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,105
What do you mean "just"?

247
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,607
Guy before you
paid me double the rental rate.

248
00:12:56,998 --> 00:12:58,527
Evan stole our truck.

249
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,445
Come on, guys.
Let's get started on the float.

250
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,214
- I'm gonna...
- Yeah, me too.

251
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:26,000
No, even if you throw in a bike rack,
a Winnebago doesn't work.

252
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,618
I need a twenty-foot flat bed.

253
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,769
Thank you.

254
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:36,523
- You still don't have a truck?
- Not exactly.

255
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:38,927
Rus, we need something
with wheels, now.

256
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,987
At this point, I'd settle
for a trailer or a donkey cart.

257
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,073
In order to do the stream,
we need a truck.

258
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,658
And we have to do the stream

259
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,730
because we have to guarantee
that we win this thing.

260
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:54,040
- Eden must be biblical.
- Eden must travel to the stadium.

261
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:55,076
Fine.

262
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,461
I'll go get a truck. A huge truck.

263
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,738
You just start building the float
on those pallets

264
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:01,427
and leave room for a stream.

265
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:13,594
Hello?

266
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:22,828
Hey Ashleigh.

267
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:24,652
Oh, my God.

268
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:26,948
What are you doing in there?

269
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,278
Let me in.

270
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:30,773
Why not?

271
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,497
Ashleigh, look, no offense.
Just go away. Please.

272
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,541
What are you doing?
You're starting to scare me.

273
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,090
I can explain. I didn't think anyone
was going to be here.

274
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,259
Oh my God.

275
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,244
The reason I didn't tell you
about this, is because

276
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,388
I saw how you and Casey reacted
to the Cru on the quad...

277
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:52,140
You almost ruined
my new white jacket.

278
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,729
Yeah, and then

279
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:57,270
- how you said the Cru was embarrassing.
- Yeah, but I...

280
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,542
But, Ash look...

281
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:01,879
I have wanted to be a Trident Cru
ever since I was a kid.

282
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,084
I always thought it was so cool.
You know?

283
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,879
Total anarchy, dressing crazy,
yelling whatever you want.

284
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:11,069
Ash, it's like all the things
I'm not in real life...

285
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:12,841
... and...

286
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,455
... it feels great.

287
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,539
Look, Adam's light saber.

288
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:27,147
I don't think Adam
had a light saber.

289
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:32,305
Look I'm Eve. Who wants
to help me find a snake?

290
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:36,793
OK, Case.

291
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,777
- The KTs have gone native.
- And some girls have gone with them.

292
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:43,021
- Where's Rusty? He could help.
- He's still getting the stupid truck.

293
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,646
We need to think like Kappa Taus. What
could we say to get their attention?

294
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:48,485
- What about Cappie?
- No.

295
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,908
This is the new kind of Cappie and Casey
where we do things, without him.

296
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,743
What "new kind of Cappie and Casey"?

297
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,829
Never mind. You're a genius, Ash.

298
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:56,875
Come on.

299
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:01,251
Who wants to see Rebecca's boobs?

300
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:03,878
That's your plan?

301
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:06,423
- Seen those.
- I'll pass.

302
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,261
My boobs are awesome.

303
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:14,431
I'm dating your brother.
That'd be really creepy.

304
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,535
Who wants to see Ashleigh's boobs?

305
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,633
All right.
Now that I have your attention.

306
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,653
Who gives the most
kick ass parties at Cru?

307
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:29,738
We do.

308
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,782
And what is the most kick ass party
the KTs have ever given?

309
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,453
- Vesuvius.
- What do we need to get Vesuvius back?

310
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,191
- Money.
- And where are we gonna get that money?

311
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,127
Charge people to look
at Ashleigh's boobs?

312
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,508
No. Build the float.

313
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:53,561
Build the float.

314
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:54,836
Build the float.

315
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,831
You are gonna be fine
without Cappie.

316
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:15,231
Barkeep.

317
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,744
Two of whatever you got on tap.

318
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,531
- Sound good?
- Yeah, it's fine.

319
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,689
This may sound corny,

320
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:26,269
but I can't tell you
how much I've looked forward to this.

321
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:28,712
Having a beer with my son.

322
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:32,274
Who is truly following
in my footsteps.

323
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,649
- I'm really proud of you.
- Dad, come on.

324
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,254
Let me enjoy this. You should, too.

325
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:39,766
- Here's to you.
- All right.

326
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:53,379
Is it ever weird for you though?

327
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:55,121
What?

328
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:57,060
The money?

329
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,564
I mean
it does change things, doesn't it?

330
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:04,215
You know, do you ever worry
that people only like you because of it?

331
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:06,221
But then you felt weird

332
00:18:06,657 --> 00:18:08,772
if you don't pick up the tab
or share it

333
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:10,949
because you've got
so much more than they do?

334
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:12,841
You talking about anyone
in particular?

335
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:17,762
And yes.

336
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,426
Frannie, a little.

337
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,262
Some of the guys from the house.

338
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:23,138
And Patrick.

339
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,393
Your brother?

340
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:29,285
Yeah, I gave him a small loan

341
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:31,484
maybe a month or so ago.

342
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:34,229
It's really hard
to say no sometimes.

343
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,642
It's a skill that comes
with maturity.

344
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:40,859
You'll get there.

345
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,569
- Where have you guys been?
- Getting a truck.

346
00:18:57,814 --> 00:18:58,964
From where? Wyoming?

347
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,909
The rental company
didn't have anything left,

348
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:03,803
so we had to go to five places
just to get something that moved.

349
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:04,945
It's in the front.

350
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,937
- We had to come in and open the gate.
- So, what do you think?

351
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:10,064
Cute?

352
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,820
No. Don't even think about it.

353
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:17,898
- What?
- I know that look.

354
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,192
It's great. It's finished.
This float will win.

355
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,640
Do not change anything. Promise me.

356
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:27,123
All right. I promise.

357
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,257
Thank you.

358
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:31,462
No one gets everything exactly
the way they want it, Rus.

359
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,048
- You really think this can win?
- Nope.

360
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,471
But we did promise
not to change anything.

361
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,638
That is true.

362
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,530
But we did not say anything
about improving it.

363
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:54,075
A cheerleader. That's funny.
I never would have guessed that.

364
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:57,554
Why don't you show me
some of your cheers?

365
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:17,129
- What... What happened to our float?
- Rusty. What have you done?

366
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,658
Wait for it.

367
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:32,397
I'll be Eve.

368
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:34,821
I'm Adam. Tempted?

369
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,239
What a beautiful baby.

370
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,492
Vesuvius.

371
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:51,082
One, I'm really pissed at you
for not listening to me.

372
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,960
And two, this is amazing.
I can't believe you pulled it off.

373
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:03,678
It's out?

374
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:07,974
We used the truck alternator
as generator.

375
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:11,477
Without a regulator switch,
it's problematic.

376
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:12,937
You think?

377
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,523
Which is why Heath and I
are going to pick one up now.

378
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,735
Meet us at the stadium parking lot
for judging. The keys are in the truck.

379
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:20,787
Tailgate.

380
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,095
Hey, I thought we were meeting
at the stadium.

381
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,508
No, we wanted to talk to you.

382
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:57,565
What's going on?

383
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:02,788
Your father told me
about your discussion at the bar.

384
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:04,561
And we're concerned.

385
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:06,449
- This is about Patrick?
- No.

386
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,688
It's about you.

387
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,713
I thought a lot about what you said
about your feelings,

388
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:14,636
about having more money
than your friends,

389
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,543
your sense of obligation
to share it.

390
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:21,968
And that's a bad thing?
We were just talking.

391
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,968
It made us realize

392
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,783
that we might have overestimated
your ability to handle this.

393
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:32,311
- It's a lot of money.
- Yeah, but it's my money.

394
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,477
I've been keeping my end
of the arrangement.

395
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:38,163
I've applied for law school.
I haven't gotten married.

396
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:40,221
Been keeping my grades up.

397
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,814
I can't believe this.

398
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:44,820
We just want to help.

399
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:53,529
Hey Rebecca? Would you mind helping me
get the food in Casey's car?

400
00:22:53,654 --> 00:22:55,623
I keep telling you,
you're asking me all wrong.

401
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:57,297
Yes, I mind.

402
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:01,547
Thank you.

403
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,260
You're not cheating on Fisher
with one of the blue freaks, are you?

404
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,869
Because if you are, I'll take him.

405
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,668
Fisher is one of the blue freaks.

406
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,496
Never mind, all yours.

407
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:22,196
What can I do?
I finally find the right guy

408
00:23:22,321 --> 00:23:24,126
and he turns out to be
the wrong color.

409
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:27,822
- Does that make me prejudiced?
- No, it just makes you sane.

410
00:23:28,718 --> 00:23:31,701
And now he wants me to share it
with him. He wants me to dress up,

411
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,208
and paint my face, and be a Crupie.

412
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:36,581
Cheerleader for a cheerleader?

413
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,833
How redundant.

414
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:52,551
<i>Welcome CRU students,
faculty and alumni</i>

415
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:54,390
<i>to our homecoming football game</i>

416
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,725
<i>against the A&M Farm Hands.</i>

417
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,586
<i>Cyprus-Rhodes University thanks
all of you for attending.</i>

418
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:03,995
<i>So let's show our spirit
and help send our seniors off</i>

419
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,442
<i>with a victory
in their final home game.</i>

420
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:12,718
Nice barbecue, Pickle.

421
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:16,383
If you stare at the fire long enough,
it starts to look like magma.

422
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,836
So where are you?

423
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,766
I'm on my way, Rus.
I had to get gas.

424
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:28,982
Someone forgot to check the level of the
tank when they picked up the truck.

425
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,886
- What?
- Hello? Hey...

426
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,620
- Is there a problem?
- Casey's on her way.

427
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:47,693
Come on.
It's only a couple miles to the...

428
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:02,333
No, you're fine.

429
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,351
Hey, Jordan, come here.

430
00:25:25,717 --> 00:25:28,818
This fig leaf is really working
its mojo with the ladies.

431
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,322
Why are you hugging me?

432
00:25:38,564 --> 00:25:40,839
I lost my fig leaf.
The front one.

433
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,269
I got it. Spitter, I got it.

434
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,995
I got it, Spitter.

435
00:25:47,743 --> 00:25:49,337
Excuse me. Excuse me.

436
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,133
Heath, it's to your right.

437
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:10,443
<i>The Omega Chi IKAP float
is now on display.</i>

438
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,655
<i>Featuring Antony and Cleopatra.</i>

439
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:18,039
- Checking out the winning float?
- Yeah,

440
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:21,746
if there was a "Most Likely
to be Yawned At" category.

441
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:26,667
So where's the KT/ZBZ entry?

442
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,295
You did know it had to be here
to be in the contest?

443
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:32,456
It's coming. It just took
a little longer than expected

444
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,017
because Rusty added a few extras.

445
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,392
You mean, like this?

446
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,069
Look. Antony and Cleopatra
are kissing.

447
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,685
Pretty cool, Rus?

448
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:57,485
- You did not build this.
- Actually, we did.

449
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,201
But the hydraulics it would take
to power this...

450
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,846
Were designed by Dr. Robert Dimano.

451
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,344
So you hired a mechanical
engineering professor?

452
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:07,805
- That's against the rules.
- I thought some girl in your house

453
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,666
- designed this?
- I never said that.

454
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,798
As long as the float is built
by the students,

455
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,727
and isn't lewd or offensive,

456
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:17,874
it's totally legal.

457
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,802
I so want to hit her.

458
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,545
- Me too.
- Yeah, me three.

459
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,804
Look, Rus, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

460
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,145
Where's my phone?

461
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,825
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

462
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:39,793
<i>Hey, this is Rusty. Leave a message.</i>

463
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:44,416
<i>I'm sorry. The voice mailbox of
the subscriber you are calling is full.</i>

464
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,039
<i>Please try your call another time.
Thank you.</i>

465
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:02,747
It's me.

466
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,194
<i>Come on out and see
who's going to win the $2000 prize.</i>

467
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,291
<i>For best float.</i>

468
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,346
Rusty, the Omega Chi float
is pretty good.

469
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:16,213
- You think we can beat it?
- As long as Casey gets here.

470
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:18,172
- Where the hell is she?
- Hey Spitter,

471
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:19,532
almost forgot.

472
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:21,204
I found your cell.

473
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:23,868
Yeah, you left it on the table.

474
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,987
I used it for a cover
when you looked for my fig leaf.

475
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,925
Good thing for me,
it was a flip phone.

476
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:35,884
It's Casey.

477
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,722
The truck broke down.
She's not going to make it.

478
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,306
We're going to lose.
The Omega Chis are going to win.

479
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,593
It's over.

480
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:53,197
Vesuvius doesn't have to be our legacy,
we'll think of something better.

481
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:54,720
I know you will.

482
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:56,817
It's too late for me.

483
00:28:57,378 --> 00:28:58,871
What are you talking about?

484
00:28:59,591 --> 00:29:00,446
I just...

485
00:29:00,754 --> 00:29:03,240
I wanted to do something awesome
before I graduated.

486
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,951
Heath, you're a junior, right?
You have a lot of time.

487
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:08,107
No, I don't.

488
00:29:08,232 --> 00:29:10,397
I'm graduating at the end
of the semester.

489
00:29:11,312 --> 00:29:12,875
Wait. You're graduating early?

490
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,211
I took a lot of AP classes
in high school.

491
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,422
I started CRU as a sophomore.
I start medical school in the fall.

492
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,965
You're kidding, right?

493
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,677
I saw the Iki float, and it's
really good. Where's Casey?

494
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,222
The truck broke down.
She's not going to make it.

495
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,308
But we can't let the Ikis win.

496
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,438
Ash, they're not going to win.

497
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:37,608
You're going to have your legacy
before you graduate.

498
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,391
All right. Come on.

499
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:42,923
What?

500
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,973
I know I technically violated
our agreement to... You know,

501
00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:50,458
keep each others lives separate.

502
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:51,388
But...

503
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:53,299
Is that the carburetor?

504
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:55,678
Yes, that's the carburetor.

505
00:29:56,418 --> 00:29:58,054
I don't think it's the carburetor.

506
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:00,424
Right. Sorry.

507
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:02,808
I want you to know,
it was a true emergency.

508
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:05,469
You were the only person I could get
who wasn't too drunk to drive.

509
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:07,672
What did the Auto Club say?

510
00:30:09,332 --> 00:30:10,091
I...

511
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:13,385
... forgot to call the Auto Club.

512
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:17,126
Your car breaks down,
you have an Auto Club membership,

513
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:19,204
and instead of calling them,
you call me,

514
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:21,652
who you know knows next
to nothing about cars.

515
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,948
Give me the card. I'll call them.

516
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:50,115
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

517
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:52,696
Heath? The beer? Genius.

518
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:54,957
It just seemed right.
And it was my idea.

519
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:58,272
The floats are that way.
It's a good thing your pretty.

520
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,319
So they're going to freeze
my trust for six months,

521
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,613
and they want me to see a therapist.

522
00:31:06,103 --> 00:31:07,052
"Hey, Doc,

523
00:31:07,227 --> 00:31:09,360
"I'm having trouble
being a greedy bastard.

524
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:12,119
"Can you help me out?
And do I have to pay you?"

525
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:14,137
My dad sent me to a therapist

526
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:16,248
because he was convinced
I was a shopaholic.

527
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:17,975
- Really?
- It was great.

528
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:21,015
The therapist helped me see
that I was buying expensive crap,

529
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,214
which i was,
to get back at my father

530
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,133
for treating me like some kind
of prop in his political career.

531
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,135
- Did you stop?
- No.

532
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,137
But now when I do it, I know why.

533
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,905
It makes it a lot more gratifying.

534
00:31:34,954 --> 00:31:38,562
Not as gratifying as if he treated me
like I was someone special in his life.

535
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,691
Think you'll ever stop
waiting for that moment?

536
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,652
God, I hope so.

537
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:48,288
And in the meantime,
I guess you take what you can get.

538
00:31:48,664 --> 00:31:50,855
Unless they change,
what other choice is there?

539
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,048
Do you want some gum?

540
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:11,178
Why are you so pissed at me?
It was an honest mistake.

541
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,564
It's like there's
this tractor beam that

542
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:15,766
seems to pull me toward you
no matter what I do,

543
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,228
and I am trying to shut it down.
I'm trying to make it go away.

544
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,231
- It's nearly...
- You think I planned this?

545
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,817
You think I rigged the contest?
So the KTs and ZBZs worked together,

546
00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:27,916
sabotaged the truck, then told Rusty
not to answer his phone,

547
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,906
got the girls drunk at the tailgate
so they couldn't get me

548
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,994
and forgot to call the Auto Club,
so you could rescue me.

549
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,351
I don't want to wonder anymore
about what you're thinking,

550
00:32:37,476 --> 00:32:39,331
what you're doing
or who you're doing it with.

551
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:43,168
You were right. I need to move on,
but I don't know if I can if...

552
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:45,170
Unless you stop.

553
00:32:45,544 --> 00:32:47,980
- Stop what?
- I'm sorry I called.

554
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:50,092
I'm sorry I keep talking to you.

555
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,511
I'm trying to do better.
What else can I do?

556
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,264
I don't know.
Just, stop making me so crazy.

557
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,889
- Stop being so paranoid.
- Stop telling me what to do.

558
00:32:58,014 --> 00:32:59,956
Stop wasting your life
on stupid things.

559
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:01,645
Stop making me want your approval.

560
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,814
Stop always being there
when I need you.

561
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,180
Stop yelling at each other and tell me
what's wrong with the damn truck.

562
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:09,903
- It's the alternator.
- It's the carburetor.

563
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:14,806
Right. How about I just tow it?

564
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:51,394
But, you're not...

565
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:54,871
- You're not blue.
- I know. I just...

566
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,336
I can't do it.
It's not me.

567
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:01,802
- Wha... What do you mean?
- I mean, that I thought about it and

568
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:05,110
I know you love doing this,

569
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:09,286
but, I just, I don't think
I can go that far...

570
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:11,199
... be that crazy and...

571
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:15,023
... wear what you're not wearing.

572
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,106
Of all people, I thought
that you would understand.

573
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:21,445
This is my way
of showing my spirit, OK?

574
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,903
- I just wanted to share that with you.
- I know, Fisher.

575
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,947
But there's a fine line
between spirit

576
00:34:27,405 --> 00:34:28,960
and spectacle.

577
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:31,589
You wear giant flowers and

578
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,196
pom-poms and leg warmers
on your arms.

579
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,781
These are not leg warmers.

580
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,284
And what? You think my clothes
are as extreme as this?

581
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,705
No. But I think your clothes say
you're open and adventurous.

582
00:34:44,612 --> 00:34:46,750
Which are two things
that make me so crazy about you.

583
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:50,170
I want to say "aw"

584
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,149
but it's hard to take you seriously
when your face is blue.

585
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,804
You said that I should keep
an open mind, right?

586
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,930
Well, that's all I'm asking of you.

587
00:35:05,261 --> 00:35:06,868
<i>May I have your attention, please? </i>

588
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:09,908
<i>Float judging is about to begin
outside Tunnel 2.</i>

589
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,818
We chose Antony and Cleopatra,

590
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:17,072
because what she did for Antony
has inspired women through the ages.

591
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:20,243
Their legendary romance
has captured the imagination...

592
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:22,870
Poor Calvin.
Caught in the cross-fire.

593
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:25,205
What ever happened
between you two anyway?

594
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:27,481
You know how in baseball

595
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:29,877
there's a pitcher and a catcher?

596
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:31,795
Yeah.

597
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:34,175
Well, I didn't.

598
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,457
I'm not too big of a sports fan.
Calvin is, so...

599
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:39,970
It didn't work out.

600
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,777
Frannie, I think we might want
to stop the float.

601
00:35:57,951 --> 00:36:00,240
- What?
- This isn't good.

602
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,668
You're not dressed?
We're already late

603
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:07,182
- for the Dean's reception.
- I'm not going.

604
00:37:07,945 --> 00:37:09,125
- Excuse me?
- Dad?

605
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,484
It's alright.

606
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:13,518
We'll talk tomorrow
when you've had some time to

607
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:16,798
think about our discussion,
and cool down.

608
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,028
Like I did after you laid out
the strings attached to my trust fund?

609
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:25,075
It's not going to happen, Mom.
I've decided I don't want my trust fund.

610
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:27,579
- For Pete's sake.
- I'm serious.

611
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:30,831
It's no good to me if it can't buy
what I want. Which is actual parents,

612
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:34,418
not two business associates
who happen to share my last name.

613
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:38,672
Do you think I could buy that,
with all the millions in my trust fund?

614
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,897
See? I didn't think so, either.
So, it's not really much good to me.

615
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:47,202
It hasn't really brought me much
but suspicion and grief.

616
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,944
And a very nice car.
I would like to keep the car.

617
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,135
Don't play this game with us.
You'll lose.

618
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:56,137
I've already lost, Dad.

619
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,637
- I'm looking for a new game.
- Evan, please.

620
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:01,855
No. If that's the way he wants it.

621
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:03,697
- Let's go home.
- That's the way it is.

622
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,803
- When you change your mind...
- Dad. Goodbye.

623
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,388
You guys have a safe trip home.

624
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:20,354
Baby, Vesuvius!

625
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:23,851
Your daddy would be so proud.

626
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:26,817
That float prank.

627
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,269
- I love happy endings.
- Too tight!

628
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,309
- It's too tight, Beav!
- OK. I'm sorry.

629
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:39,399
The CRU football team actually won.

630
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,018
Andy had two interceptions,

631
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:44,951
but all anyone is talking about
is yours and Heath's float prank.

632
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,199
There was no big volcano,

633
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,062
but that pyramid definitely blew
a boatload of beer.

634
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,537
Look like you got
your legacy after all.

635
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,206
Wasn't the legacy I was expecting.

636
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:57,713
It still bums me out that Natalie
and the Gamma Psis won.

637
00:38:58,047 --> 00:38:59,586
Heidi and Spencer's Fake Wedding?

638
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:02,881
- How lame is that?
- Totally. But look on the bright side.

639
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,673
Maybe next year
you can blow up their float too.

640
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:10,255
Trident Slow-Mo Machine!

641
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:22,002
You

642
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,095
are

643
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,065
so

644
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,072
weird.

645
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,910
Is

646
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,449
that

647
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:30,169
OK?

648
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:38,694
From skeptic to Blue Man groupie
in two short days.

649
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:41,286
Ash sure is unpredictable.

650
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,809
She's also very lucky.

651
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,681
You know, I'm going to go home.

652
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:51,760
You think they're blue all over?

653
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,785
Good night Becks.

654
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,019
Night.

655
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:01,897
You don't seem too shook up
about the volcano.

656
00:40:03,305 --> 00:40:06,939
My legacy is going to be about something
different than volcanoes and floats.

657
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:10,032
Whatever it is,
try not to waste so much beer.

658
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,295
- Have you considered whipped cream?
- No, I'm talking about brotherhood.

659
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,787
I helped Heath make his mark
at Kappa Tau.

660
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:21,293
Yep. He's going to medical school.

661
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,419
I hear he wants to be
a heart surgeon.

662
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:26,655
I was thinking, we could give him
a nickname. Something like Doc.

663
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,007
Or...

664
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,192
Dopey.

665
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:35,766
Something fitting.

666
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:57,628
I hope you're not stressing
about the float contest.

667
00:40:57,753 --> 00:41:01,374
So we didn't whip Frannie's Icky ass
like we wanted to.

668
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,544
But at least she didn't win.
We'll get them next time.

669
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:07,127
I'm actually not thinking
about Frannie

670
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:09,757
or her Icky ass.

671
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:12,968
I'm thinking
about the Garden of Eden.

672
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:15,078
The strip club on Highway 90?

673
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:18,600
Adam and Eve.

674
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:21,631
You know, I never would've expected
my "Adam" would

675
00:41:22,428 --> 00:41:24,731
turn out to be a blue guy
in a fork hat.

676
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:27,984
I never expected
to miss him so much.

677
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:31,738
Max'll be back in less than a week.
You're almost there.

678
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:35,367
I'm not talking about Max.
