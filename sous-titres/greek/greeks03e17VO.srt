1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,417
Previously on Greek :

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:02,960
I realize this is awkward.

3
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,493
You said you liked me,
and I didn't remember you.

4
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,383
I asked you out,
and you blew me off.

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,550
Now I see why it's awkward, for you.

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,902
I convinced Rebecca to come
to our Valentine's party.

7
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:15,473
I want to show the girl who doesn't
believe in love how much she means to me.

8
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,350
- Is that from Evan ?
- I like it.

9
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,925
He thinks you have a future.

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,937
You're giving Evan the wrong
idea when you don't feel the same way ?

11
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,482
I don't want to get serious.
How about we go upstairs ?

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,941
My God !

13
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:29,028
- What about law school ?
- I thought about it but for a boyfriend.

14
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,365
- You should consider it for yourself.
- If I get into CRU Law

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,950
and you find a major that you love
then maybe

16
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,133
we could end up graduate
at the same time.

17
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:39,799
I'm not sure I'm ready
to graduate and leave here.

18
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:42,699
- What about you and Casey ?
- I don't really know.

19
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,718
- Morning.
- Good morning !

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,492
Looks like you have a new Jeremy
on your hands.

21
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:59,350
Right on time, Dumper.

22
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,524
Mardi Gras breakfast beer ?

23
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:05,379
It has absolutely zero essential
vitamins and minerals.

24
00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:06,669
Right. Mardi Gras.

25
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:08,976
I'd love to, but I'm taking
the LSAT today.

26
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,305
Are you sure you need that
to get into law school ?

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,116
The Law School Admission Test ?
Yes, I'm sure.

28
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,280
- That will be all, Dumptruck.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:20,166
I remember when you were a pledge
you used to say : "One day,

30
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,666
- someone will wake me up with beer."
- It's as special as I'd hoped.

31
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:25,626
We've come a long way.

32
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,616
I'm taking the LSAT,

33
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,816
you're getting beer brought
to you and declaring a major.

34
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:32,383
We're practically grown up.

35
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,980
- Yep.
- So...

36
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:37,596
Did you ?
Fill out your major declaration form ?

37
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,348
- Yes.
- Really ?

38
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:42,852
With three majors. I got
so excited I couldn't stop writing.

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,683
At least you're narrowing down
the choices. What are they ?

40
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,357
If I tell you,
then they won't come true.

41
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:51,527
- Are you not taking this seriously ?
- I swear I am.

42
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,364
But today is about you and your test.
How are you feeling about it ?

43
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,973
I'm taking your advice.

44
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:59,595
I'm trying to clear my mind
and not think about it too much.

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,246
Always worked for me.
Then you can come by the Mardi Gras

46
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,887
Spectacular and forget all about it.
Speaking of Mardi Gras,

47
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:08,836
- there's this tradition where...
- No way.

48
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,704
It's time for the first
parade of the day !

49
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,217
Go play with your friends.

50
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,682
Good luck on your test !
Remember...

51
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,142
don't be nervous.

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,351
I won't be.

53
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,153
Rusty, we're working in
the lab later ?

54
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,792
Yeah, but I have to leave
a little early to help Kappa Tau

55
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:38,580
set up for our Mardi Gras party.

56
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,584
Right, your frat world. Here's hoping
you have both eyebrows in the morning.

57
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,089
I will because I have
a date for the party.

58
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:46,415
I'm actually on my way to meet her.

59
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:49,435
- What's her name ?
- Her name...

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,204
Wait a minute. Is this weird
for us to talk about this ?

61
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,083
Why ?

62
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,910
Because of the whole nerd
auction thing when you liked me

63
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:58,107
and hated me all in
one conversation.

64
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:00,982
We're past the "will they,
won't they" hump.

65
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:04,142
Now we know we won't,
it clears a path for us to be friends.

66
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,977
I guess. I've just never
had a girl friend before.

67
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,543
- That doesn't surprise me.
- I mean a girl, pause, friend.

68
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,389
That doesn't surprise me, either.

69
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,944
- But you should give it a try.
- Sure.

70
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,757
Why not ?
Okay, girl-pause-friend,

71
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,074
I'm gonna introduce you to my date.
You can tell me what you think.

72
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,271
Let me guess.
Vapid sorority girl ?

73
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:24,809
Not exactly.

74
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,516
Hello, Katherine.

75
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:27,834
Rusty, hi.

76
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:36,210
- Whatcha reading ?
- The latest Franka comic strip.

77
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:39,034
She's a Dutch sleuth who takes
on the likes of shady businessmen

78
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,781
and pirates and smugglers.

79
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,597
I would share
but the humor doesn't translate.

80
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,601
Katherine, this is Dana.

81
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:50,624
She is my lab assistant
on my project.

82
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:51,730
And my friend.

83
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,275
She's also a Space
Plasma Physics major.

84
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,570
Good for you. I'm fascinated
with the Kinetic Molecular Theory.

85
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,822
So, I picked up
some Mardi Gras masks.

86
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,288
I wanted you to try them on to make sure
they don't overpower your small head.

87
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:04,413
Thanks.

88
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,372
- What do you think ?
- Well, she's not vapid.

89
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:10,083
She's great !

90
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:11,329
Great.

91
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,528
-= 317 =-
"The Big Easy Does It"

92
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:16,297
Kappa Team

93
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,034
There you are !

94
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,397
Are you coming to Dobler's
for Mardi Gras tonight ?

95
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:28,057
Evan is going with Rebecca
and Pete is meeting me after

96
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,241
he gets back from his lacrosse
game in Chicago.

97
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,771
Don't you just love Mardi Gras ?
It's the perfect holiday.

98
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,409
Because it doesn't have the added
romantic pressure of Valentine's Day

99
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:38,992
or the unflattering color palette
of St. Patty's Day.

100
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,780
But sometimes
you have to take the LSAT.

101
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,159
My God !

102
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,366
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,116
I'm blabbing on about parties
and boys when you've got the most

104
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:50,414
- important test of your life.
- Well, not of my life.

105
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,991
No, you're right.

106
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:54,500
So just relax.
It's like any other test,

107
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,500
only four hours longer.

108
00:04:56,913 --> 00:05:00,323
Why the hell have I been designated
sober sister on Mardi Gras ?

109
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:03,452
Because you were the only person not
at the meeting when we did the vote.

110
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:05,256
If your meetings weren't so stupid,

111
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,631
I might attend.

112
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,293
You take such wonderful
care of us here at ZBZ.

113
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,897
We would like to show
our thanks by making

114
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,621
you our honorary ZBZ
sober sister tonight.

115
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,945
No can do. I'm going to
the KT Mardi Gras party tonight.

116
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,353
But you don't drink.
Or have fun. What's the point ?

117
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,785
It's an opportunity to show people
you can have fun without drinking.

118
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,410
You saying that
makes me want to drink.

119
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,167
I don't know why I thought
I could study here.

120
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:39,921
No, but I made you a study snack.

121
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:42,383
A fish medley, with blueberries.
It's brain food.

122
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:47,221
Thanks, but brain is already full...

123
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:48,430
of...

124
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:49,835
knowledge.

125
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,267
- Want me to put it in a to-go box ?
- No.

126
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:56,689
I'll eat it.

127
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:06,355
We want to make this Mardi Gras
tradition called a king cake.

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,925
You bake a plastic baby into a cake,

129
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,200
and whoever gets the slice
with it has a lucky year.

130
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:15,888
Do it.

131
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,586
This is gonna be
a great Mardi Gras party.

132
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:22,047
I know.
First beads and now cake.

133
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,341
And I'm bringing
Katherine as my date.

134
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,802
What ?

135
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:29,880
I like her.
I know, she's a little strange,

136
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:32,597
but she's really pretty under
those head bands and pearls.

137
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:34,184
Have a seat.

138
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,372
Come here.

139
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,615
Spitter, do you know
what Mardi Gras is ?

140
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,087
It's French for Fat Tuesday

141
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:44,054
which is a culmination of a carnival
beginning with the Twelfth Night.

142
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:47,656
Wrong. It's a time when we try to get
girls to show us their boobs for beads !

143
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,908
- I don't think she's that type of girl.
- Exactly.

144
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:52,327
Mardi Gras is about debauchery
and sex.

145
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,758
You only bring a girl if you know
there's going to be both.

146
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,990
- That's why I'm bringing your sister.
- I got it.

147
00:06:57,115 --> 00:07:00,002
If you bring a date, you can't
throw beads at any other girls.

148
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,338
You don't want the first time
you see her snack trays

149
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,506
to be the first time
everyone else sees them, too.

150
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,384
I think Katherine will
really love this party.

151
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,094
She really likes jazz.

152
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,137
Jazz ?

153
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:13,932
You don't deserve these.

154
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:25,327
That necklace looks great on you.
Are you trying to get me back upstairs ?

155
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,452
Yes.

156
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,165
See you tonight.

157
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:32,565
Cal !

158
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,630
Look, I know you're pissed at me.
I don't blame you.

159
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,616
But it's not gonna happen again.

160
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,792
I pawned my laptop
to pay back the house.

161
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,089
- What are you gonna pawn next ?
- I'll just take on some more work.

162
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,541
That sucks.
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,677
Thanks.
It's not that bad.

164
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,516
I made 50 bucks last night catering.
I'm practically rolling in it.

165
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:59,436
Regardless men,
I just wanted to apologize.

166
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,030
Cool ?

167
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,407
Yeah, cool.

168
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:15,119
Oh gosh !
Oh, goodness.

169
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,343
Need these ?

170
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,908
Joel ! Hi.
What are you doing here ?

171
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,577
Standing around with napkins
waiting for a spill

172
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:28,132
and getting coffee.

173
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,425
Well, you've come
to the right place for both.

174
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,137
- Thanks.
- Oh, God, this book.

175
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:36,140
For a while, this was the bane
of my existence.

176
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,893
- How are your nerves ?
- You know... my mind is clear.

177
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:42,563
Feeling calm, trying not
to think about it too much.

178
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,201
That's impressive.
I was such a mess

179
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:48,110
the week before the LSAT,
I couldn't sleep or eat for a week.

180
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:49,584
Me either.

181
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:52,377
People keep telling me
not to be nervous and I'm trying

182
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:54,575
- to take their advice.
- That'd be nice

183
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,983
but I don't see how you could.
You're about to take a test

184
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:59,354
that's the most important factor
in getting into law school.

185
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,326
Exactly !

186
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:02,187
- It's a really big deal !
- The biggest.

187
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:05,444
So freak out now instead
of freaking out in the test.

188
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,580
Because I've put all
of my eggs into one basket,

189
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:11,038
and if I don't get into
law school then I have nothing.

190
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:14,331
So, I am...
I am currently freaking out !

191
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,954
Good for you.

192
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,127
My God.

193
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:23,187
I was trying so hard not to be nervous,
it was making me nervous.

194
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:28,025
- Thank you for the help.
- You're welcome. I gotta go.

195
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:33,324
Another trick that helped
was having a lucky talisman.

196
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,866
I had this sweatshirt I wore
the whole time I was studying.

197
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:39,411
It got pretty gross at the end,
but it worked.

198
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:40,787
Can I borrow it ?

199
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,498
You don't want to go
to law school that badly.

200
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,345
- What are you doing ?
- I'm seeing if you need any help.

201
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm actually the assistant

202
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,280
and you're the roommate.
What are you doing here ?

203
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:05,376
Rusty said I could play
with his lab equipment. 

204
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:07,326
We're leaving for the KT party soon.

205
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,158
You can have the
whole place to yourself.

206
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:10,700
Right, your big date night.

207
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:12,811
Date ?
Cappie didn't say anything about a date.

208
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:16,114
I don't have one since Retainer Girl left
me emotionally and physically scarred.

209
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,784
Relax, you do not
need to bring a date.

210
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,288
Apparently.

211
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,412
OK. That's a relief.

212
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,205
- You can take me.
- You want to go to a fraternity party ?

213
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,334
Why not ?
As long you don't mind.

214
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,413
- Why would I mind ?
- Great.

215
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:32,130
Wait, hold on.
I haven't agreed to any of this.

216
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,713
Don't I get a say ?

217
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:36,760
- Let me see your teeth.
- What ?

218
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,805
I want to make sure you don't have
any dangerous orthodontia.

219
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,616
Let's see those chompers.
Come on.

220
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:44,741
No.

221
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,147
All right, fine.
I'll take you.

222
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,002
- What are you doing here ?
- I have a few last minute details

223
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,227
I wanted to discuss with you
before this evening.

224
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,552
- May we have the room ?
- What ?

225
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,240
You're serious.

226
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:07,338
Totally.

227
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:10,513
Yeah, I have some stuff outside
I need to work on.

228
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:17,895
- What's up ?
- Well, I've spent a considerable amount

229
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,178
of the last four years
focused on my future.

230
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,098
Yeah ?

231
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:24,054
And now that I've been accepted
into law school and I do not start

232
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,602
my summer internship for two months,
I have a lot of time on my hands.

233
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,766
I think you are a great person

234
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:32,482
and we've had one relatively
successful date.

235
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,460
I do not want to go to Yale a virgin
I've decided to lose my virginity to you.

236
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:37,362
Tonight.

237
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:42,200
- If you're amenable.
- I'm flattered.

238
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:46,286
But we haven't even kissed yet.
Or learned how to greet each other.

239
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:50,125
Clearly, we are two very smart people.
I'm confident that we can figure it out.

240
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:52,799
Now, I don't have
any experience in the area,

241
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:56,467
so I will defer the choice
of prophylactic over to you.

242
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,556


243
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,935
OK, let's get this keg in the truck.
Remember, lift with your back

244
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,812
on the count of three.
One...

245
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:13,064
- two...
- three !

246
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:15,859
You got it ?
You got it ?

247
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,592
So, did you figure out
that Mardi Gras date problem ?

248
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:24,493
Sort of.

249
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:28,538
Talk to you for a second ?

250
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:31,013
- Just a little thing.
- Yeah. Sure.

251
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,543
Katherine wants to have sex.

252
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:35,921
That's great !

253
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,382
Wait, with you, right ?

254
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,509
- Yeah, with me.
- That's great !

255
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:43,664
You found the exception
to the "No Date On Mardi Gras" rule :

256
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:47,140
- the "Sure Thing On Mardi Gras."
- Sure thing. It's just that...

257
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,569
- she's a virgin.
- Really ?

258
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:52,687
- Yeah.
- You know what, I actually get that.

259
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,981
It's only our 2nd date
she already wants to have sex.

260
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,853
If she's a virgin, is she gonna want
to get married by the 3rd one ?

261
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,549
What is it with you Cartwrights
and your obsession with the future ?

262
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:03,210
Look at it this way :
Being here at school is like Mardi Gras,

263
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:05,315
and the rest of your life
is like Lent.

264
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,541
You gotta get it all out
before you give it all up.

265
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,023
I've never been
anybody's first before.

266
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:11,748
What if I "give it all up"

267
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,626
and I don't meet her expectations ?

268
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,183
Are you kidding me ?
She's never done it before,

269
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,608
so she has nothing to compare it to.

270
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,299
I've never thought
about it that way.

271
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,387
I have a chance to be her first
and I'm guaranteed to be her best.

272
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,707
You'd have to screw it up
pretty badly not to.

273
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:30,410
- Real bad.
- Trust me, this is a good thing, OK ?

274
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,971
In fact, I have a little
something for you

275
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,564
in honor of this occasion.

276
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,970
You know, not too long ago,
you came into Kappa Tau

277
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:41,194
yourself a virgin, looking for
that first sexual experience.

278
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,947
And here you are, passing that wisdom
on to some other fortunate soul.

279
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,499
It's the circle of life.

280
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,829
The circle of sex life.

281
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:58,656
Come on.

282
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:05,969
Guess what I've got.

283
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:08,513
- The new Mariah album ?
- Better !

284
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:12,225
Tickets to Mardi Gras, tonight,
Gentleman's Choice !

285
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:14,895
So no Dobler's
with the rest of the house ?

286
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,339
No way.
This is my first gay holiday.

287
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,151
Easy Captain Fabulous. Straight people
celebrate Mardi Gras, too.

288
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,278
- Not like we do.
- Good point.

289
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,947
While I was there,
I got a proposition.

290
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:27,486
To bartend.

291
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:30,577
Apparently, they're expecting
such a huge crowd, they need extra help.

292
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,330
I could make 500 dollars prancing
around without my shirt on.

293
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,790
- Wait, did you say 500 dollars ?
- Yeah.

294
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,705
But instead I'm choosing
to prance around you

295
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,338
- with my shirt off for nothing.
- That's sweet.

296
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,925
But just so you know,
I'm gonna keep my shirt on.

297
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,243
But no pants.

298
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,307
I thought you were
off taking your test.

299
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,652
I need a lucky charm for the LSAT.

300
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,202
I was going to bring Pussy-Willow the
Seventh, but that seemed unprofessional,

301
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:04,070
so I'm going with the purple
hair tie I use to study.

302
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,444
- As soon as I find it.
- Purple. On it.

303
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:11,117
While we're looking,
mind if I ask you a question ?

304
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,100
What's up ?

305
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:15,202
I was supposed to go to Dobler's
with Pete but the lacrosse team decided

306
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:18,779
to stay in Chicago for Mardi Gras, so
I'm sad that we're not gonna be together

307
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:21,119
but I don't want him
to think I'm some needy girl.

308
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:25,121
I'm super bummed that we're not
gonna be together, but I get it, so...

309
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:27,050
Casey, how do I feel ?

310
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,464
You've only been dating
for a short time,

311
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,222
and up until now he's given you
no reason to doubt his character.

312
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,600
How you react to this
will set a precedent.

313
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,184
A measured response is best.

314
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,239
Text, but don't call.
Be cool, but not cold.

315
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,844
Tell him your preference
is that you wish he were here,

316
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:45,111
but you understand his situation
and hope he has a fun time with the team

317
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,885
while also thinking about the great
time he could be having with you.

318
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,324
If he doesn't find a way to get back to
Cyprus tonight, then res ipsa loquitur !

319
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,126
- Is that Harry Potter talk ?
- It's lawyer talk

320
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:57,163
- for "the thing speaks for itself."
- Fancy.

321
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:59,708
That was the most
perfect answer ever !

322
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:03,253
I know ! I am going to ace this test and
go on to kick some Washingtonian ass !

323
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,215
- As soon as I find my lucky hair tie.
- Yes !

324
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,241
You got a sec ?

325
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,599
Ramen noodles ?

326
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,345
I used to judge people
for eating this stuff.

327
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,798
But it's delicious
and in my price range.

328
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,475
OK, what would you say if I told you
I knew of a way for you to make

329
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,444
a whole lot of money
for one night's work.

330
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:29,571
I'd say you want
to harvest my organs.

331
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,574
No. Gentleman's Choice needs
a little extra help tonight.

332
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,367
You want to harvest that organ.

333
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,402
I understand if
you're not interested.

334
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:39,899
No, it's that I told Rebecca
that we'd hang out tonight.

335
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,644
I'd feel bad if I just bailed
on her, last minute like that.

336
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,794
You could make enough
to buy back your laptop.

337
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,112
- In one night ?
- Gays spend money on Mardi Gras

338
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:49,087
like grandmas at Christmas.

339
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:51,968
All right, yeah, I'm in.

340
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:55,013
Just do me a favor,
let's keep this between us.

341
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,817
Rebecca does find it charming
that I don't have any money,

342
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:01,144
but her opinion'd probably change if she
found out that I stole from the house.

343
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:04,064
That'll be between you, me
and all the gay men of Cyprus.

344
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:15,399
Coming through !

345
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,832
Got your message
about your hair thing.

346
00:17:18,957 --> 00:17:20,882
I told the guys to pretend
like you're not here

347
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,939
so you can go about your business
in peace and get out of here sober.

348
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:25,877
Thanks, Cap. I'm actually feeling

349
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,505
pretty good, even though it's one
of the biggest days of my life.

350
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,632
It's big day for both Cartwrights.

351
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:33,444
- Why ? What's Rusty doing ?
- Nobody.

352
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,095
Rusty ?

353
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:41,059
- Did you tell her about Katherine ?
- No. But you just did.

354
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,435
- What's going on with Katherine ?
- Nothing.

355
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,891
Did you do something
lame to piss her off ?

356
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,608
- Even if I did, it's not your business.
- Russell Alan !

357
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:52,696
Fine. If you must know,
Katherine and I

358
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,147
are gonna have sex tonight.
Happy ?

359
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:58,201
No ! I am not happy. And frankly,
I'm feeling a little sick.

360
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,848
You two are allowed to date,
be cute, maybe hold hands,

361
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,916
- but no sex.
- First of all, that's not up to you.

362
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,094
Second, it wasn't even my idea.
She came to me.

363
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,457
Apparently she's a virgin
and wants me to be the one who,

364
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:13,675
you know, changes that.

365
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,017
That is not a good idea.
If it goes badly,

366
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:18,847
she's gonna want to talk to me
and I'll have to cut off my ears.

367
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,468
It's not gonna go badly because she
doesn't have anybody to compare me to,

368
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:24,519
so there will be no expectations.

369
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,907
- I taught him that.
- No expectations ? Are you two crazy ?

370
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,644
She's had 21 years to
build up her expectations.

371
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,212
She's not some normal girl
who only learns about sex

372
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:36,602
from teen vampire movies. We're talking
about Katherine. She reads.

373
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:39,852
You're competing with Robert
Pattinson and Lady Chatterley's Lover.

374
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:41,411
I read that book.

375
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:44,547
All right, I saw it on Skinemax.

376
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,314
You know, I don't have time for this.
I'm about to step into my future.

377
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,087
If I were you,
I'd seriously rethink this.

378
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,492


379
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:48,812
This will commence the Logical
Reasoning portion of the test.

380
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:50,647
You have 35 minutes.

381
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:53,005
Starting now. Good luck.

382
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,014
It's OK to be nervous.

383
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,374
"The government chose not to
require warnings on products

384
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,952
containing caffeine because if the
findings were refuted,

385
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,963
the government would
lose credibility.

386
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,466
Which of the following
is suggested by the above ?

387
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:11,903
A) A warning that applies to a
small population is inappropriate ?

388
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:14,420
B) Few people drink more than
six cups of coffee a day ?

389
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,888
Or C) Cappie won't declare a major".

390
00:20:22,576 --> 00:20:23,699
Focus, Casey !

391
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:30,505
Why hasn't Cappie declared a major ?
I mean, I knew what I was getting into,

392
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,556
but is he ever going to leave CRU ?

393
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:35,908
Why would he lie to me ? And... my God,
why is that guy tapping his foot ?

394
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:57,880
The next parade theme is...

395
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,299
people with cups !

396
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:02,275
Follow me !

397
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:07,592
You may not be aware of this,

398
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:10,728
but Mardi Gras originated in
Mobile, Alabama, not New Orleans.

399
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,353
In 1830 by the Cowbellion
de Rankin Society.

400
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:16,398
Nobody likes a know-it-all, Dana.

401
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:20,737
Looks like somebody's shirking
their sober sister duties.

402
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,432
Excuse me for a minute.

403
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:28,535
What's that ?

404
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:32,817
No, it's silly.
I just find I'm at my best

405
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:35,219
when I have a schedule made
for the day's activities.

406
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:38,463
- Is "have sex" on there ?
- There's a window.

407
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:41,299
You know, I read somewhere

408
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,134
that a woman's first time
is never really the best.

409
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:46,164
In CosmoGirl ? Yes.

410
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:49,140
I have been doing this research, too.
Albeit in magazines geared

411
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,789
toward a younger demographic.

412
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:53,186
Apparently most people
my age are no longer virgins.

413
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:58,274
I just wanted to make sure that we
have the same expectations

414
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,399
about that.

415
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:01,570
In terms of positions ?

416
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,114
No, I mean...

417
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,227
who did you imagine when
you pictured your first time ?

418
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:09,374
Well, I always thought
Al Gore was...

419
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
very hunky.

420
00:22:12,842 --> 00:22:14,581
Al Gore ? Really ?

421
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,295
I know he's not really
an option. He's married, and...

422
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,344
he has a very busy
speaking schedule.

423
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:25,926
What ?
So I like smart bad boys.

424
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,804
At least it wasn't Robert Pattinson.

425
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,097
Who ?

426
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:36,853
I can't believe we're here.

427
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,887
We'll just stay long enough to
congratulate Casey on her test.

428
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:41,598
Mardi Gras !

429
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,010
Yes, thank you.

430
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,992
I was supposed to be
at Dobler's with Pete.

431
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,928
And I was supposed to be with Evan.

432
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,246
Look at you, all lovey-dovey.

433
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:56,724
It's ridiculous that
he has to work an emergency medical

434
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,674
- conference on Mardi Gras.
- What do you say, ladies ?

435
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:01,653
Go ask a Tri Pi !

436
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:09,302
Rebecca, you look
really great tonight.

437
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,006
- Was that too far ?
- No. It was really nice of you.

438
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:17,722
I was gonna suggest
we go up to my room,

439
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:20,881
but I didn't because
that would be going too far.

440
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:24,197
And you expecting me
to have sex with you

441
00:23:24,322 --> 00:23:26,570
as a reward for not going too far

442
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:27,947
is going too far.

443
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,993
- So we're not having sex ?
- Bye, Beav.

444
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,974
Yes, these lovely and elegant
beads can be yours...

445
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,977
- We're outta here.
- We can congratulate Casey later.

446
00:23:40,324 --> 00:23:41,767
OK, well, we'll talk.

447
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:43,564
All right ? Yes !

448
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,640
I thought you said
I'd make a lot of money.

449
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:59,395
Maybe the guys are getting
a straight vibe from you.

450
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:01,256
What ?

451
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:03,524
I'm just admiring
how great you look.

452
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:05,461
You could just...

453
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:08,488
You could just use one minor
adjustment here.

454
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,009
- Really ?
- Yeah.

455
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:12,276
It's Mardi Gras.
Just go for it.

456
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:15,542
All right.
Gay men of Cyprus, look out !

457
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:21,655
I think I know what my problem is.

458
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:27,214
- What are you doing ?
- I'm advertising.

459
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,127
Can I have a beer ?

460
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,433
This is so much better.
No one will objectify us here.

461
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,408
And look at all the cute,
shirtless gay boys !

462
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:40,509
OK, dancing.

463
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:53,003
Twice in one day ?

464
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,551
- What brings you here ?
- I wanted to see how you did.

465
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:58,859
That's nice but you didn't have
to come all this way.

466
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:01,334
I know I didn't have to.
I wanted to.

467
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:04,538
- So ?
- I did OK, I guess.

468
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,797
It was hard to concentrate
for so long.

469
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,521
Some life stuff tried to seep

470
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:10,675
into my head.
But your advice definitely helped.

471
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:12,510
- So, thank you.
- Good.

472
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,596
These should help, too.
It's what I wanted

473
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,516
when I was done. Thought you
might be feeling the same way.

474
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,212
The cookies are because you probably
haven't eaten in a week

475
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:23,938
and the Scotch is because
that's what lawyers drink.

476
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:27,051
- Right.
- And, well, because it's Scotch.

477
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,268
So, you got plans ?

478
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:34,322
I'm supposed to go to this party.

479
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,369
You know what ?

480
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,079
The party's not going anywhere.

481
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:43,331
Good.
I was hoping you would say that.

482
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,633
Hey, Spitter. It's like being
on Bourbon Street, isn't it ?

483
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,620
We may need more Bourbon.

484
00:25:57,396 --> 00:25:59,650
So, how's it going with Katherine ?

485
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,987
Really good. We're in the "free
party time" of tonight's schedule.

486
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:05,771
She's in the parade
for people from Wisconsin.

487
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,657
- Have you seen your sister ?
- No,she was supposed to be here

488
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,299
- after her test.
- So did I !

489
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:12,236
- I need to talk to her.
- Don't worry.

490
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,780
I'm sure she'll show up.
It's Mardi Gras !

491
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:17,359
Yeah, it's Mardi Gras.

492
00:26:17,484 --> 00:26:19,746
- I need to get another beer.
- Yeah !

493
00:26:23,318 --> 00:26:24,815
How's it going with you guys ?

494
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,374
- Great.
- She's a delight.

495
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:29,771
Go for Dale.

496
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,383
No, you're looking for Laura.

497
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,340
She's the sober sister tonight.
I'm Dale.

498
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:36,487
- What's your name ?
- Dale !

499
00:26:36,612 --> 00:26:38,221
Laura gave me your number !

500
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,675
What do you mean
she gave you my number ?

501
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,933
All right,
who still hasn't seen them ?

502
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,730
- Not on my watch.
- Ready ?

503
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,149
All right, all right.
Show's over.

504
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:58,199
- So how's it going with Dale ?
- Dale ? Dale's great.

505
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,576
So what's up with you
and Katherine ?

506
00:27:01,014 --> 00:27:03,454
- Things are going pretty well.
- How well ?

507
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,623
You're my girl-pause-friend, right ?

508
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,146
Definitely.

509
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:09,001
Okay, then I'll tell you.

510
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:11,448
Katherine and I are gonna
have sex tonight.

511
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:13,315
Sex !

512
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,772
I didn't know you guys
were that serious.

513
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:19,095
We're not.
This is only our second date.

514
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:22,265
- So you're that guy.
- What guy ?

515
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:26,310
No, she came to me.
This wasn't even my idea.

516
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,099
She's the one who wants
to lose her virginity.

517
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:31,144
And you're taking
her virginity no less.

518
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:35,027
Is sex just some sort of insignificant
transaction to you ?

519
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:38,176
Wait a minute, she's not making
a big deal out of this.

520
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:40,390
- Why should I ?
- That just proves it right there.

521
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:42,910
You not thinking that it's
a big deal makes you a dog.

522
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,621
I am not a dog. She's the one
with the schedule !

523
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:49,041
Then hi-five on that, bro !
That's... great.

524
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:56,152


525
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:59,727
- I didn't think I liked Scotch.
- What do you think now ?

526
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:02,741
I think I like Scotch.

527
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,763
This is exactly what I needed.

528
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:09,632
I know.
I remember.

529
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:11,594
Walking out of that test,
I was mush.

530
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:14,066
I didn't even have the brain capacity
to count to ten.

531
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,110
Now, you don't need to.

532
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,578
I can't believe I was able
to steer clear

533
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:23,259
of all the Mardi Gras madness.

534
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:25,036
It's Mardi Gras already ?

535
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,315
Right.

536
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,254
You're probably above all
the crazy partying stuff.

537
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:31,979
Me ?
Are you kidding ?

538
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,376
Back in the day
I would've passed out,

539
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:36,464
sobered up,
then passed out again by now.

540
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:37,720
You ?

541
00:28:37,845 --> 00:28:39,895
Does Congressman Paymer
know about this ?

542
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,366
No and she also doesn't
know that, as an undergrad,

543
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,868
I streaked the Michigan/Ohio
State football game.

544
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:47,350
In November.

545
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,629
No way !

546
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:51,550
Stadium cops threw me
in the football jail.

547
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:54,107
I swore that if I ever
got out of there,

548
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,711
I was gonna earn a law degree

549
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,693
and fight for streaker
rights everywhere.

550
00:28:57,972 --> 00:29:00,738
Well, it is important
to have dreams.

551
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:05,011
So, no more wild days like that ?

552
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:08,836
I guess at some point you realize
you've been there, done that.

553
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:12,333
And you start to find
other things interesting.

554
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:25,508
- King cake ?
- No, thank you.

555
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,833
I don't eat at fraternity parties.

556
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:31,148
But it's got a baby in it !

557
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,986
This is gonna be my third trip
to the ZBZ house

558
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:39,485
- since Laura's gone wild.
- Let me ask you something.

559
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,208
Do you resent Sheila
for taking your virginity ?

560
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,428
I don't think so.
I know it ended badly,

561
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:47,910
but I think, on some level,
I wanted it to happen.

562
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,371
- But you gave up God.
- True but in the end I came back

563
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,539
to him.

564
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,216
Here come the weeble-wobbles.
Let's get you girls home.

565
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,754
What are you still doing here ?
Thought you were on a sex schedule ?

566
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:02,382
Or, should I say, a sexedule ?

567
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,712
- I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
- You're preparing to have sex.

568
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,840
- Do I need to walk you through this ?
- Does taking Katherine's virginity

569
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:09,974
make me a dog ?

570
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,643
On the contrary.
It makes you a college student.

571
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,478
A very lucky college student.

572
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,377
This evening, tonight,
is what college is all about.

573
00:30:18,502 --> 00:30:20,443
Look around you.
This is a magical place.

574
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,403
It's not gonna get
any better than this.

575
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,088
Look...

576
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:29,702
all you have to think about is whether
or not it feels right to you.

577
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,490
Don't let other people
get in your head about it.

578
00:30:32,615 --> 00:30:34,248
Be your own moral compass.

579
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,567
- Beads !
- Wait a second.

580
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:41,130
There's no way Anthony Hopkins
should have more beads than me !

581
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:55,563
- You don't think I'll do it ?
- I will do it !

582
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:06,486
Too far ! Too far.

583
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:08,481
But thank you.

584
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:17,049
Dude !
You look just like my friend...

585
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:18,167
Ashleigh !

586
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,053
You thought I was a drag queen ?

587
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,178
No.

588
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:23,214
What are you doing here ?

589
00:31:24,073 --> 00:31:28,073
We were at the KT house, but got tired
of getting ogled by frat guys.

590
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,866
- Nice.
- Yeah, I'm getting my gay on.

591
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:33,194
- It's about time !
- Wait a minute, you said "we."

592
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:36,060
- Who are you here with ?
- Rebecca. She's over at the bar.

593
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,140
Dance with Ashleigh for a second.

594
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,533
Excuse me.

595
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:51,954
I'm not just saying this
because it's Mardi Gras,

596
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,255
but you are hot.

597
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:58,707
- You know I'm a girl, right ?
- And I'm straight.

598
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:02,568
Hey, man !
Look at this !

599
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:04,931
All it took was a little blatant nudity.
Who knew ?

600
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:08,008
Yeah, you might want to cover up
because Rebecca's here.

601
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,304
I guess the jig is up.

602
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,939
What are you gonna do ?

603
00:32:15,355 --> 00:32:16,892
Have a little fun on Mardi Gras.

604
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,020
What's your name ?

605
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:23,687
Stranger in a bar.

606
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,620
No complications ?

607
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:30,354
Why not ?
It is Mardi Gras.

608
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:34,785
- What can I get you guys ?
- Two cosmos.

609
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,253
What you doing ?

610
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:00,530
Thanks for the party, dude.
See you in the lab.

611
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,856
I don't know what your problem is
but I am not a dog.

612
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:07,651
I've been navigating
by my own moral compass.

613
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:09,737
- If you say so.
- I do.

614
00:33:10,546 --> 00:33:12,031
Why do you even care, anyway ?

615
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:14,202
Because I like you.

616
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:16,445
Again ?

617
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:18,949
But you told me
at the nerd auction you don't.

618
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:21,206
I tried to ask you out
and you turned me down.

619
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,542
You know, for a smart guy
you sure are dumb.

620
00:33:24,397 --> 00:33:26,378
Look at all the signs
I've been giving you.

621
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,253
Like insulting my character ?

622
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:30,132
- Calling me a dog ?
- No, like

623
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,663
getting dressed up,
putting make-up on.

624
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,335
Do you know that I even wore
these stupid heels

625
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,491
because I calculated
our height difference

626
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:40,142
and knew these would
facilite eye-to-eye contact.

627
00:33:42,214 --> 00:33:43,729
Your math was perfect.

628
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:47,605
After all the time we've spent
together in the lab,

629
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:49,351
how can you not see it ?

630
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:52,093
We have a great time,
we have so much in common.

631
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:54,808
We just make sense.

632
00:33:57,749 --> 00:34:00,371
So you don't want to be
my girl-pause-friend ?

633
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:02,706
Never mind.

634
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:08,865
It's time.

635
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:16,927
I used to be able to put away
a whole bag of these.

636
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:19,390
- Right.
- No, seriously, I was a

637
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:20,748
fat little kid.

638
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,143
You certainly grew
out of that stage.

639
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:27,187
So the test.

640
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:30,058
There were a lot of
really tough questions.

641
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:32,015
It's over now.
Next stop, law school.

642
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,363
And you didn't even have
to streak a football game.

643
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:37,199
I know.
I almost forgot.

644
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,816
My lucky talisman. I was going to
go with Pussy-Willow the Seventh

645
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,913
but they won't even
let you bring a phone,

646
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,000
so...

647
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,406
I hope it worked.

648
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:56,009
I can't.

649
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:00,032
No, it's just...

650
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:04,226
You've got a boyfriend, don't you ?

651
00:35:07,426 --> 00:35:10,441
I'm sorry, Casey.
I wouldn't have done that if I'd known.

652
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,026
No, it's my fault.
I should've been more up-front.

653
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,027
It's OK.

654
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,687
I should get going.

655
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,285
I do have one last logical
reasoning question for you.

656
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,656
Why would a girl spend
an evening with a guy

657
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:26,790
and not tell him
she has a boyfriend ?

658
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:30,961
Good thing that wasn't on the test.

659
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:34,956
Good night, Casey.

660
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,905


661
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:48,225
That was weird.

662
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,330
Not what I imagined
your medical conference to look like.

663
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:54,902
No, I meant you kissing
a guy right in front of me.

664
00:35:55,397 --> 00:35:57,752
Come on.
He was a gay guy in a gay bar.

665
00:35:57,877 --> 00:36:00,115
- It's not a big deal.
- It's a big deal to me.

666
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,702
I want to be exclusive with you.

667
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:05,329
Why ?

668
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,842
That's not exactly the response
I was expecting.

669
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,876
Because I care about you,
that's why.

670
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:15,214
I care about you, too. But that doesn't
mean we need to be exclusive.

671
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,590
What does that mean ?

672
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:22,721
Wait a minute. You mean
you haven't been exclusive ?

673
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,451
When ?

674
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:30,299
With who ?

675
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:31,814
Was it Cappie ?

676
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,816
- No.
- Then who was it ?

677
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,609
It doesn't matter.
Look, Evan...

678
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,222
I can't believe this !

679
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:39,321
Do you have any idea
why I'm working here ?

680
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:44,258
To pay back money that I stole from
my own house to buy you that necklace.

681
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:47,871
I never asked you to do any of that.

682
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,748
I've always been honest with you.

683
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,294
I'm not a girl who's gonna have
an ordinary relationship.

684
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,503
That's something
you've talked yourself into.

685
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,156
Love doesn't work.

686
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,966
And you trying to force this on me
is what's screwing this up !

687
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,578
No, you screwing this up
is what's screwing this up !

688
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:04,179
You can hide behind
that crap all you want to,

689
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:07,297
but we both know
that it's just a lame excuse !

690
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,160
You're afraid !

691
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,397
This is why we should've
just been a one-night stand.

692
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,652
Want to know
why you don't believe in love ?

693
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,570
Because you're heartless.

694
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:25,277
What's going on ?
Is everything okay ?

695
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,816
Yeah, take her home.

696
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
Hello.

697
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,545
I watched 9 1/2 weeks.

698
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,479
Apparently men find it erotic
when women wear dress shirts.

699
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:22,319
I am prepared to dance for you.

700
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:28,805
You know what ?
Maybe we should just get comfortable.

701
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,818
I can't believe I'm finally
getting this over with.

702
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:48,538
- Did it already happen ?
- "Get this over with" ?

703
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:52,147
That sounds like some
sort of transaction.

704
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,668
Well, I suppose, in a way...

705
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:56,458
- it is.
- I'm not

706
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,570
so sure I want to be someone
you just get this over with...

707
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:03,048
with.

708
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,700
Are we not doing this ?

709
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,769
I wish I was a bad boy.

710
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:09,429
I wish I was Al Gore.

711
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:10,764
But I'm not.

712
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:12,307
I'm sorry.

713
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,203
Thank you, Dale.

714
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,623
You are the best...

715
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,165
- sober sister ever !
- I know. Remember to

716
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,383
vote for my raise at the next
chapter meeting.

717
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:40,995
What are you doing ?

718
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:43,996
I want you to have something.

719
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,387
Show your butt.
Nice.

720
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,641
Those are my favorites.

721
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:57,008
Let's go.

722
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:00,228
Dale...

723
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,310
and Laura ?

724
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,240
You're just in time for
the final parade of the evening.

725
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:33,972
Parade, Pledge !
Parade !

726
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,860
Get that girl some beads !

727
00:40:38,118 --> 00:40:39,768
There were better ones.

728
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:41,704
So, how'd the test go ?

729
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,818
There was one logic question
that tripped me up.

730
00:40:47,188 --> 00:40:48,313
What was it ?

731
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:51,782
I saw the form.

732
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:55,043
Why did you lie to me ?
Why didn't you tell me

733
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:57,204
that you're nowhere close
to picking a major ?

734
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,764
I just didn't want to distract you
before your test.

735
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:01,333
That didn't really work out.

736
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,795
I'm sorry, I screwed up.

737
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,547
But the truth is,
I didn't fill it out because...

738
00:41:08,386 --> 00:41:09,758
I'm not ready to graduate.

739
00:41:10,624 --> 00:41:13,460
I didn't tell you because you've been
putting so much pressure on me.

740
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:15,180
I don't want to pressure you

741
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:18,767
but this changes things.
I thought we were past this, and I

742
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:22,392
could finally see some sort of future
together, but instead you lied to me ?

743
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:26,217
Even though we said we could talk
to each other about anything.

744
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:29,486
I almost kissed another guy tonight.

745
00:41:30,595 --> 00:41:31,595
What ?

746
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:35,462
Joel came to see how I did

747
00:41:35,587 --> 00:41:39,287
and he brought Scotch because that's
what lawyers drink, and...

748
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:40,872
But nothing happened.

749
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,609
I don't know what your plan is,

750
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,960
I don't know what my plan is
and it drives me crazy.

751
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:48,630
I don't want a plan.
I just know I'm not ready to graduate.

752
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,483
- Ever ?
- Maybe.

753
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:02,269
I'm gonna stay at the ZBZ house.

754
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:06,431
Happy Mardi Gras.
