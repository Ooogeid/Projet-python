2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,481
You gotta be pretty smart to get in
the engineering program.

3
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:05,922
- How'd you know?
- This is the honors engineering floor.

4
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,950
I found out you had sex
with Evan Chambers.

5
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:10,283
I did, rush night, and it was amazing!

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,984
Evan Chambers is my boyfriend.

7
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:12,990
How awkward for you.

8
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:14,005
So what do I do?

9
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:17,337
You do what you need to do
to make it right in your mind.

10
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:22,612
You guys play football?

11
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:23,862
I played for a year...

12
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:25,799
in little league.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,450
We could kick your ass at anything...

14
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:28,600
- Really?
- Yeah, we could.

15
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:29,717
I'm not gay.

16
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:31,217
We were just drunk.

17
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:32,905
- Who sent it?
- I bet it's from Rebecca.

18
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:35,158
She didn't do this. Someone else is
holding the camera.

19
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,592
- I'll delete it.
- No, wait.

20
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:37,601
Where'd you get that?

21
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:40,415
I'm willing to bet you didn't get
attention from your dad growing up.

22
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:42,494
Wanna get his attention now?

23
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,926
Howe comes up from the outside,

24
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,410
setting up his shot.

25
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:47,877
Shoots!

26
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:52,810
You might want to aim away
from the goal next time.

27
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:53,894
I'm improving though.

28
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,427
That's all that matters.

29
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,425
Did you know during
his 20-year career in the NHL,

30
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,028
Wayne Gretzky scored 894 goals,

31
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:03,996
had 1,963 assists?

32
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,814
That's 2,857 points.

33
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:07,815
No.

34
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:10,240
- I didn't know you were so into hockey.
- I'm not.

35
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:11,940
I've never even watched a game before.

36
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,323
But I've never played
beer pong before either.

37
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:15,640
Yeah, don't remind me.

38
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:18,488
The Kappa Tau's first floor hockey game
of the season is today,

39
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:19,516
I just want to be ready.

40
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:20,649
It's just intramural sports.

41
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:23,349
I know. But I never really got to
play sports in high school.

42
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,799
This is something I feel like
I can really do...

43
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:27,565
Playing sports with the guys.

44
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:29,382
Doing guy stuff.

45
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:32,123
Yeah, enjoy your guy thing, Gretzky.

46
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:33,348
I gotta get back to the house.

47
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:35,262
Aren't you gonna play for
the Omega Chis?

48
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:36,942
Nah, sounds like work.

49
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:38,861
Open net,

50
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,069
Rusty Cartwright all by himself,
setting up his shot.

51
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:43,188
He shoots!

52
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:47,780
How 'bout giving me
a two-minute head start?

53
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:49,413
Sorry.

54
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,696
I asked for a sumatra
with a splash of soy,

55
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,747
not a latte with whole.

56
00:01:57,102 --> 00:01:58,747
You don't want me to get fat, do you?

57
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Get?

58
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,856
What?

59
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:04,522
Question.

60
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:07,306
If I wanted to leak a sex video
onto the internet,

61
00:02:07,322 --> 00:02:08,956
could I do that straight from my phone?

62
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:17,112
Nothing starts the day off right
like that first cup of joe.

63
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,016
After all, your first is always
the best, don't you agree?

64
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,632
The one that's the most special?

65
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:24,316
The one you can never avoid?

66
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,436
The one you can never forget.

67
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:28,820
You guys are way into your coffee.

68
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,570
Pardon... I spy a tasty morning muffin.

69
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:36,769
Top o' the mornin', muffin.

70
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:39,469
Ready to get slaughtered by
the Lambda sigs?

71
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,184
You're forgetting the fact that
we have the Beaver,

72
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:44,568
the number-one recruit for CRU Football.

73
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:47,235
And the Lambda sigs have numbers 2
through 30.

74
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,718
Never discount the underdog.

75
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:50,881
Here you go.

76
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:52,231
Try this.

77
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,467
I think I want an iced coffee.

78
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:06,451
Might I recommend a Cappie-cino?

79
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:08,417
Go play your sports.

Is that you?

85
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,250
Do you think I can get a chance to play?

86
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:05,317
I'm ready.

87
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:06,430
I've been practicing.

88
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:09,280
Can you see those huge guys out there
with the sticks?

89
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,397
Good, because I can't.

90
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:14,904
Which might be a sign of a concussion.

91
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:16,697
Wait, there they are.

92
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:17,914
Be right back...

93
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:29,150
I can't get past their new goalie.

94
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:31,183
- That guy's a friggin' machine.
- Come on, Beav,

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,100
the Kappa Taus never say die.

96
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:34,930
The Kappa Taus are dead.

97
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,897
It looks like we're going to be going up
against the lambda sigs next round.

98
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:41,964
O'toole, will you do me a favor
and do some recon work on that goalie?

99
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:46,397
As athletic support liaison
for Omega Chi, it's my job

100
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:49,097
to solicit ideas on
how I can effectively support you.

101
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,780
Bake cookies, paint signs.

102
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:53,484
How 'bout a pep rally?

103
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,434
How about just this?

104
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,850
Good, 'cause I hate baking cookies.

105
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:23,813
I mean, how hard is it to embroider

106
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,831
ZBZ hearts Omega Chi on a polo?

107
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:27,967
I could make some calls for you.

108
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:31,647
Casey will figure it out. She's always
my point for special projects.

109
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,997
Do you think I could put my name
into the mix for an assignment?

110
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:36,964
Sweetie, pledges don't get assignments.

111
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:40,005
I was just thinking that
you might make an exception,

112
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,214
considering my political experience
and my dad's house in Jackson Hole.

113
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:45,398
Could be fun for a committee retreat.

114
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,481
I do look really good après ski.

115
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Let me ponder.

116
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:55,314
What's the story with
the scruffy Kappa Tau

117
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:56,498
who looks like Rob Thomas?

118
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,730
- He was talking to casey this morning.
- Oh, God!

119
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,864
He just can't get over it.

120
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:03,873
Casey made the mistake of dating Cappie
freshman year.

121
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,880
He's ridiculous,
has no discernable goals.

122
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,346
We considered with holding
her activation

123
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:10,980
because of that unholy alliance.

124
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:14,091
Luckily she came to her senses
and dumped him.

125
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:17,187
I love learning about my big sis.

126
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:28,464
You!

127
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,764
Time-out!

128
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
All right...

129
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,412
We're down three goals,

130
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,830
there's a minute left in the game.
There's only one thing we can do.

131
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,547
Start drinking now.

132
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:43,805
This game's over.

133
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:44,905
Pledge.

134
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,238
Yes, sir.

135
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,088
All fours, please. Thank you.

136
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:52,072
Hey, Rudy...

137
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:54,696
Hop in, don't die.

138
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,588
Okay, you got it.

139
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:58,305
<i>You the man, Spitter!

140
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,572
They're putting Rusty in?

141
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,491
- This should be good.
- It's gonna be bad.

142
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,056
Very, very bad.

143
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:10,789
I think we met on rush night.

144
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,708
Great. You ready for pain?

145
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,572
Is that a trick question?

146
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,633
- Is that over?
- Yeah!

147
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:51,521
Nice going, Spitter.

148
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,209
You just scored against your own team.

149
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,551
<i>You're an idiot!

150
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,141
They really should mark those?

151
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:00,543
I said take off the mask!

152
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:08,065
The Lambda sigs are disqualified

153
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,273
for the improper use of
a professional athlete...

154
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:13,357
Marty McSorely.

155
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:17,600
The Kappa Taus will play the Omega Chis.

156
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,182
On your feet, pledge Owens!

157
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,064
Dad?

158
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:42,519
Unbelievable.

159
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,517
22 years, this place hasn't changed.

160
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,398
Of course, we did a better job at
keeping it clean.

161
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,280
But you goats will learn.

162
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:51,963
What are you doing here?

163
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:54,348
I believe that's my line.

164
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:56,458
I've been in college four weeks.

165
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,217
Are you suffering from invasion
of privacy withdrawal?

166
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,892
It's the first weekend
of the IM Sports season.

167
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,989
I thought I'd come watch you play.

168
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,560
Imagine my surprise
when I went to the gym,

169
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:08,256
and you were nowhere to be found.

170
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:09,654
I guess I forgot.

171
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:12,057
You loved hockey in high school.

172
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,658
Look, our agreement required me
to pledge your fraternity.

173
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:15,714
All right? That's all.

174
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:22,247
Do they know?

175
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:23,775
No.

176
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,477
And I'm not planning on telling them.

177
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,563
This couldn't be the same chair.

178
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:37,656
I was dating this ZBZ...

179
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:39,196
Hilary...

180
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:40,932
- What's her face...
- Dad...

181
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:42,292
I won't get into details,

182
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:45,057
- but let's just...
- Let's just stop right there.

183
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,352
A singing beaver,
now I've seen everything.

184
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:57,734
Muffin!

185
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,020
I missed you.

186
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:00,773
Tell me about you...

187
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:03,279
The Kappa Taus... Cappie.

188
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:05,534
Kappa Taus win...

189
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:07,695
On a technicality... shocker.

190
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,416
Don't worry, we'll beat you gals
fair and square.

191
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,328
Like you've ever beaten us at anything.

192
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:13,365
One word...

193
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Beer pong.

194
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,446
You are a joke, do you know that?

195
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:17,558
Your a jerk off.

196
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:18,812
No, it's all right, beaver.

197
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:21,544
I mean if Spitter can take him down
with a paddle,

198
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:22,979
I think I can take care of myself.

199
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:25,718
It's just too bad
you couldn't take care of Casey.

200
00:10:25,997 --> 00:10:27,795
Now why'd you have to go
and bring that up?

201
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:29,957
He took care of her all night long
during rush.

202
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:31,026
Down, beav!

203
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:39,432
I'll see you on the court.

204
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,675
I bought a ton of stuff to rally
the Omega Chis.

205
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:56,418
Pledge Rebecca,
would you unload my car, please?

206
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:59,605
I'll let you two talk first.

207
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,504
Come sit, let's chat.

208
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,330
Lemonade?

209
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:09,914
Sure.

210
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,190
Now that the game is going to be

211
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,782
between the Omega Chis
and the Kappa Taus,

212
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:20,881
I have some concerns about
our athletic support program.

213
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:25,177
That's some lemonade.

214
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,749
I feel like this is my fault,
even though it isn't.

215
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:31,218
When I told you to even the score
with Evan,

216
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:34,846
I meant go find some cute barrista
without a last name...

217
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:36,828
Not your skeezy ex.

218
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:38,647
What are you talking about?

219
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,890
Rebecca heard it from something called
"the Beaver."

220
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:42,846
Apparently he announced it
after the game,

221
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:44,580
in front of everyone.

222
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,406
Including Evan.

223
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:48,095
Oh, God.

224
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:52,054
She felt awful telling me,
but she did it to protect you.

225
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,619
And us.

226
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,874
There's a potential conflict
of interest here.

227
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,731
Wait, are you questioning my loyalty?

228
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,210
I'm not, sweetie, but

229
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,991
it's about outside perception.

230
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:09,558
I have decided to have Rebecca
replace you as athletic support liaison

231
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:11,416
until this whole thing blows over.

232
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:12,434
She's a pledge.

233
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:14,982
She has a lot of ideas
about how to take it to the next level.

234
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,122
But she's a pledge.

235
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:18,191
You're replacing me with a pledge?

236
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,116
Casey, let me impart for a second.

237
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:26,037
An important aspect of being a leader is
the ability to manage your mistakes.

238
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,869
Remember when Cheney shot
that man in the face?

239
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:31,012
He went underground for a couple days
in a bunker,

240
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:36,050
laid low, and before you know it,
the guy he shot was apologizing to him.

241
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,342
Genius, right?

242
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:40,783
Yes, but...

243
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,435
I'm just trying to help you.

244
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:43,516
Please,

245
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:44,832
for your own good,

246
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:47,087
go underground.

247
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:03,333
I was thinking maybe
I can be more useful on defense.

248
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:04,544
It's a big game, Spitter.

249
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:05,718
It's bigger than all of us.

250
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,457
The classic battle between good
and Evan.

251
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:12,099
Beer pong started a winning streak
against the Omega Chis

252
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,777
that I'm ready to defend to the death.

253
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,498
I did win at beer pong.

254
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:18,538
Absolutely.

255
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,311
You're the MVP of beer pong.

256
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:24,771
We gotta put our good guys in this time
around to destroy Evan Chambers.

257
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:27,809
I know Evan's a jerk,
but what'd he do to you?

258
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:30,289
We go way back.

259
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:32,266
I've hated Evan

260
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:33,963
for almost two years now,

261
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,871
since we roomed together freshman year.

262
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,921
What happened freshman year?

263
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:39,915
Long story.

264
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:41,460
But you understand as much as anyone

265
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:44,182
that kicking Evan's ass can
only mean good things.

266
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,533
So that's what we have to do.

267
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:46,608
I want to help.

268
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:47,682
Spitter,

269
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,086
do you know the most important part
of any athletic organization?

270
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,791
Morale?

271
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:54,977
Hydration.

272
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,347
You want me to be the water boy?

273
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,501
Team hydration facilitator.

274
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:02,450
Remember, it's not
what your fraternity can do for you,

275
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:04,543
but what you can't do
for your fraternity.

276
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,278
And you just cannot play floor hockey.

277
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,528
It's what you can do
for your fraternity.

278
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:13,535
It's affirmative.

279
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:15,062
That's the spirit!

280
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:24,030
the Kappa Taus

281
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,081
aren't as much of a threat
as the lambda sigs, but

282
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,202
that doesn't mean we shouldn't
bring our best game.

283
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,209
That is why

284
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:32,929
I've asked our distinguished alum coach

285
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:34,755
Roger Owens to help us train.

286
00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:37,024
<i>Good luck, coach.

287
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:47,060
Whether it's the rose bowl
or intramurals, the story's the same.

288
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:50,779
A team wins because everyone's
on the same page.

289
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,624
A team is only as strong
as each individual player.

290
00:14:57,253 --> 00:15:00,998
Which is why I'd like to tell you
a little bit about my son, pledge Owens.

291
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,082
Father Owens,
can I talk to you for a second?

292
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,479
Trust me,

293
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:09,536
you don't need to hide who you are.

294
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:10,782
Gentlemen,

295
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,869
my son has a secret

296
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:15,068
- he needs to share.
- No, I don't.

297
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:18,377
It's okay, Calvin,
these walls are sacred.

298
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,855
Calvin's not just an ordinary pledge.

299
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,681
He's... different.

300
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:24,808
Calvin is...

301
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:28,497
An all-state hockey player.

302
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:31,476
You gotta put him on the team!

303
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,060
Does it need some glitter?

304
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:44,190
I was kind of going
with a pink and green theme.

305
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:45,397
Something more like...

306
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,199
this.

307
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,942
Wait, that's not right.

308
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:54,483
Hey, little sis, can I have a word?

309
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:00,520
What's up, big sis?

310
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,700
If you think you can come
between Frannie and me...

311
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:04,767
I feel for you and your sad situation,

312
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:07,210
but Frannie appointed me
because she couldn't trust you.

313
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:09,902
I'm just doing what Frannie feels is
the best thing for Zeta Beta.

314
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,503
You didn't even want to come
to Zeta Beta in the first place.

315
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,627
But I'm here now, because of you.

316
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:15,795
Ironic, isn't it?

317
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,734
I've spent the past 18 years of my life

318
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:21,138
as the beautiful daughter
of my father's political machine.

319
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:23,163
And I think it's time I start machine
of my own.

320
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,304
And who knows,

321
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:27,537
maybe I'll be the youngest president
this sorority's ever seen.

322
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:30,214
Beware of the limelight, little sis.

323
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:32,569
You've got a couple skeletons
in your closet.

324
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm not leaving, big sis.

325
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,395
And I'm not afraid to play dirty.

326
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:52,565
Man, it must have been tough
having your dad as a coach.

327
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:54,615
It's pretty hardcore.

328
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:55,652
Definitely.

329
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:58,938
I used to hate when my dad
even came to my soccer games.

330
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,221
No matter how well I played,
it was never enough.

331
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:04,215
So I took up cross-country.

332
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,507
Meets were so boring, he lost interest.

333
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,185
And I haven't touched
a soccer ball since.

334
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,724
So you'll understand
if I decide not to play.

335
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,433
No, man. What, are you crazy?

336
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,116
I am putting you
on every sports team we have.

337
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:18,911
Until you finish grad school
or your knees blow out.

338
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:22,453
Anything for the brothers.

339
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:24,614
I like your attitude, pledge.

340
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,924
So you're practically
a professional hockey player.

341
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,277
Why didn't you ever mention it?

342
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,458
You didn't ask.

343
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:39,359
And, you know,
it's not that big of a deal.

344
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:40,701
Yeah, but you were a jock.

345
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,322
People cheered for you.

346
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:46,846
No one cheers for you when you solve
a Volger-Fulcher-Tamman equation.

347
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:49,896
Except my mom.

348
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:57,852
Last chance to join me for the most
fantastic left-behind party ever.

349
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,100
No, thanks.

350
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:00,945
Just sit around and read the books?

351
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:04,438
We also, you know,
interpret science from current events,

352
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,736
try to predict the end of days.

353
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:07,394
And I'll order a delicious pizza.

354
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:09,929
I'll catch the next one.

355
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:13,469
The next one may be in heaven, so...

356
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,015
Make sure you're on that list.

357
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:19,554
I've got to live at the Kappa Tau house
next semester.

358
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:27,266
You know, then you can fetch your bros.
Water 24/7.

359
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:29,633
It's only 'cause
we're playing against Evan.

360
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:32,183
Otherwise, they would definitely give me
a second chance.

361
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,239
You really think so?

362
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:35,905
This whole brotherhood thing...

363
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:37,191
I'm not so sure I buy it.

364
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:46,202
Don't I get major girlfriend points
for going to see a movie called Hot Rod?

365
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:50,190
Yeah, 'cause I am definitely
in the mood for a comedy.

366
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:54,857
What?

367
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:57,522
Can we please talk about this?

368
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,479
It's not like you didn't know
it was Cappie.

369
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:01,119
I mean, you knew, right?

370
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:02,703
Yeah, I knew it was him.

371
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,163
But I didn't know that everyone else
on campus knew.

372
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,747
It's not everyone on campus.

373
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:12,983
I guess one or two Kappa Taus saw me
leave the next morning.

374
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,641
You couldn't be a little more discreet?

375
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:17,260
You hooking up with Rebecca
in the middle of a rush party didn't

376
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:18,453
exactly go unnoticed.

377
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,441
I'm sorry, Case.

378
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,975
But when I think about you and Cappie,
I kind of lose my mind.

379
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:31,912
I thought all this was behind us.

380
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:32,968
It was.

381
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,421
Until Frannie started doubting
my loyalty to Omega Chi,

382
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:37,950
took me off athletic support, and...

383
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,465
brought this whole thing up again.

384
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:45,091
Are you doubting me too?

385
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:50,103
I'm gonna get some popcorn.

386
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:51,916
I'll meet you inside.

387
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,820
I thought you wanted to meet for brunch?

388
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:08,783
What? Coffee, doughnut... brunch.

389
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:10,923
Doesn't matter.

390
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:12,718
I'm not very hungry anyway.

391
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:14,659
So what's up with you?

392
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:16,376
I don't wanna talk about it.

393
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:20,648
Evan and I had the worst date ever
last night.

394
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:22,302
Hot Rod... hilarious.

395
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:24,582
The date with Evan... not so funny.

396
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,224
Why, what's going on with you two?

397
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,253
Never mind. It's too complicated.

398
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,791
I mean, you make one mistake,
and suddenly like,

399
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:32,760
everybody doubts you
and forgets everything

400
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:34,318
good and loyal you've ever done.

401
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:37,728
Should I know what that means?

402
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:39,386
Like I said, it's complicated.

403
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:40,476
Fine.

404
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:42,181
My turn.

405
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:43,566
I've been benched.

406
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,504
Cappie's not letting me
play floor hockey.

407
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:48,046
Which is kind of like a flashback
to being ten years old,

408
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,296
the worst guy in Little League.

409
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,970
It's not like they're all so perfect.

410
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:53,243
They're definitely better than I am.

411
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,739
And they have no right to sideline
a person based on assumptions.

412
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:58,435
It's not entirely assumptions.

413
00:20:58,472 --> 00:20:59,795
I did score for the other team.

414
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,453
So why let them set the terms?

415
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:02,509
Yeah, you're right.

416
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:05,103
I didn't join a fraternity
to be a water-boy.

417
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:07,814
- I joined to be a part of it.
- They need proof, give them proof.

418
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:09,016
Get back in the driver's seat.

419
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,536
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

420
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,847
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

421
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:12,871
The doughnuts are on me.

422
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:18,134
I just wanted to do a little something

423
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,222
to thank you for all your team spirit
this week.

424
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:22,290
Tiffany Mesh Bangles.

425
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:26,576
Very impressive, rebecca.

426
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,307
Wait until you see the t-shirts we made.

427
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:29,313
So cute.

428
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,288
Homemade t-shirts.

429
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:32,891
That is impressive.

430
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:35,090
- Thanks, big sis.
- For pledge.

431
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:38,444
But if you really want to win,
you have to be serious.

432
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:40,492
You have to be willing to play dirty.

433
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,610
Right, Becks?

434
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:43,718
Posters and t-shirts?

435
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,548
That's great if this were 1985
and we all had feathered hair.

436
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:51,406
But I straighten my hair, Rebecca,
because I'm serious.

437
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:53,735
So let's stop playing around.

438
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,969
- What are you doing out of your bunker?
- I've got a plan

439
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:00,484
that guarantees the Omega Chis
win the game.

440
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,432
But it's not going to be easy.

441
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:05,766
It's going to require
that you wear the sexiest,

442
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:08,675
sluttiest, sweetest outfits you own.

443
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,482
Oh, my god, I'm totally in!

444
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:32,908
Did we have physics homework?

445
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:34,447
No, I'm learning to play hockey.

446
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:40,782
That won't work.

447
00:22:40,913 --> 00:22:43,154
It has to work.
Physics explains everything.

448
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,360
If I don't have the specific skills
to play the sport,

449
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:47,230
then my brain can definitely
make up for it.

450
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,276
It's an interesting choice of using
Drew's co-efficient theory of friction.

451
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:52,505
Re-normalized
with euclidean quantum field theory.

452
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:53,903
- Don't forget to...
- I'm on it.

453
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:57,293
You know, this just might work.

454
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,144
Rusty, me, you, we could...

455
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:02,957
We change the very nature of sports.

456
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,248
We could take back
the playgrounds, the fields,

457
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,498
the courts, the rinks
from the physically gifted.

458
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:09,697
The future could be ours.

459
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:11,374
I just want to play intramurals.

460
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,435
Today intramurals, but tomorrow...

461
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,130
The world!

462
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:26,412
If I line up here, taking into account
the slant of the incline,

463
00:23:26,524 --> 00:23:29,487
the height of the goal,
and the rate of my metabolism...

464
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,976
I told you, it's 73 degrees!

465
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,628
This is hopeless! I can't do this!

466
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,454
We should work with the motion capture.

467
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,703
Dale, this is stupid.

468
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:46,026
There's a reason nobody has taken back
the playgrounds.

469
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,309
It's physically impossible.

470
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:51,555
What if we re-calculated the diameter
of the ball in relation to the stick.

471
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,048
No... I'm done.

472
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,296
We can't turn ourselves into athletes.

473
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,811
Einstein probably sucked
at floor hockey too.

474
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:10,882
Wanna party?

475
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:15,966
Slow down, eager beaver.

476
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:18,519
Beware of hot greeks bearing gifts.

477
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:24,985
Me thinks we find ourselves confronted
by a very attractive trojan horse.

478
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,311
We invite you in, you get us drunk...

479
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:29,287
We lose the game tomorrow.

480
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:34,057
But the Kappa Taus will not succumb
to such obvious trickery!

481
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:35,622
So much for straight hair.

482
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,738
Are you seriously...

483
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:39,658
turning this...

484
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,719
down? Think about it.

485
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,564
I'm doing better than that.

486
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:45,725
I'm imposing a two-drink limit!

487
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,688
Don't use the upstairs bathroom, please.

488
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:55,732
Thank you.

489
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,646
How did you know
they couldn't count past two?

490
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:12,317
We threw booze and girls
into the equation.

491
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:15,713
I just hope I haven't exposed myself
to herpes for nothing.

492
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:16,881
Trust me.

493
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:26,164
I knew you'd come back to me.

494
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,879
We do need to get you some deodorant.

495
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,071
Good work, pledge.

496
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:33,390
He's a great player, so it's your job
to make sure he gets extra attention.

497
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Hands.

498
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:40,761
No one's allowed back in the house
until they've been disinfected.

499
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:48,770
This is so much fun!

500
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,401
We have to do this with every house.

501
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,910
We'd wear different themed outfits...

502
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:54,454
How are we doing in here?

503
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:56,466
They're on their sixth round
of cement mixers.

504
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,697
Just to be clear,
we're trying to slow them down,

505
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,244
not kill them... Ok?

506
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:02,362
Fine.

507
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:14,088
You've been avoiding me.

508
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:15,820
Where's Rusty tonight?

509
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:17,739
Not here. We're all alone.

510
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,230
Are you gonna let him play?

511
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,411
Let's not talk about family.

512
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:23,161
How about boyfriends?

513
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,484
Because I have a boyfriend.

514
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:26,876
Whose ass is gonna be grass tomorrow.

515
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:29,484
What do you see in that tool anyway?

516
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:32,572
I happen to like nice guys.

517
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,224
I'm nice guys.

518
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:40,212
No, you're not.

519
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:44,366
You're...

520
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:48,465
Drunk.

521
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,397
- First line, your best...
- Sure.

522
00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:57,236
What happened to you?

523
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,919
I pulled a hammy in practice yesterday.

524
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:01,174
I think I'm gonna have
to sit this one out.

525
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:03,860
- Did you go to student health?
- There was nothing they could do.

526
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,795
Good luck today.

527
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:07,193
Go omega Chi.

528
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:09,745
Go ahead. I'll meet you at the gym.

529
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:14,619
What the hell are you doing?

530
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:17,209
What I wanted to do in the first place.

531
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:19,944
Are you really gonna let
your brothers down like this?

532
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,318
You said all I had to do was
join your fraternity,

533
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,684
and you'd pay for college. Right?

534
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,063
I'm doing your guy thing.

535
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:27,609
Everything else, in my opinion,
is non-negotiable.

536
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:31,040
Did you think I wanted you to pledge
because it would make you more of a man?

537
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Didn't you?

538
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,868
I wanted you to pledge this house

539
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,867
because some of the great friendships
of my life started here.

540
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:41,055
My brothers got me
through some tough times.

541
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:43,033
And they helped me get started
with my career.

542
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:44,533
They stood up with me at my wedding.

543
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:46,715
Gays can't get married, remember?

544
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:50,703
Well, what about one
of those commitment ceremonies?

545
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:52,293
Or, what are we calling it now,

546
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:54,977
- Civil Union Partnerships?
- Dad...

547
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:57,101
That's not the point all right?

548
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:58,213
Have you...

549
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,847
- told anyone here?
- No.

550
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,345
Son, you have nothing to be ashamed of.

551
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:07,227
I'm not ashamed!

552
00:28:07,842 --> 00:28:09,612
I'm great with being gay.

553
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,167
It's just how everyone else reacts
that sucks.

554
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,268
When I came out in high school,

555
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:18,616
I went from being Calvin Owens

556
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:21,431
to "that gay hockey player-guy."

557
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:23,648
And I'm more than that.

558
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:27,108
And this is my chance to start fresh,

559
00:28:27,518 --> 00:28:28,915
on my own terms.

560
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,989
So I'll tell who I want,

561
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,499
when I want. But,

562
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,939
to be honest, dad, it's not the most
interesting thing about me.

563
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,672
Play... Don't play.

564
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:46,659
That's up to you.

565
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:50,686
I just don't want you to miss out on
what I got from this experience.

566
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:52,723
Some pretty amazing friends.

567
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:12,160
Water boy reporting for duty.

568
00:29:18,795 --> 00:29:21,907
You guys, the game starts in 20 minutes!

569
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:27,618
Hey, you ok?

570
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,215
Muffin.

571
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,503
Devil.

572
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:32,175
So where do you want me, Coach?

573
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:37,982
Get out there and show 'em what you got,
pledge  Owens.

574
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:45,993
<i>About time, guys.

575
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:52,489
Dale, what are you doing here?

576
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:55,617
I'm risking my immortal soul to tell you
we forgot to factor in the torque

577
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:58,386
due to residual perspiration,
the weight differential of water loss.

578
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:59,875
Which changes, like, everything!

579
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:00,975
I don't have time for this.

580
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:02,744
- I'm not even playing.
- Listen to me!

581
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:04,105
This is bigger than you.

582
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,823
Okay, we started something,
and I expect you to finish it.

583
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:09,175
It wasn't 73 degrees, Rusty, it was 78.

584
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,094
Do you hear what I'm saying? It's 78!

585
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:12,230
We had it all wrong!

586
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:15,230
Take back the gym, Rusty.

587
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,180
For all of us.

588
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,170
Hey, youngblood.

589
00:31:25,238 --> 00:31:26,934
Don't you want your good luck kiss?

590
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:58,560
You must be getting real tired
of coming in second to me.

591
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:00,255
You know what makes it easier?

592
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:02,790
Knowing I'll always be her first.

593
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,452
That was awesome!

594
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:21,334
Who knew sports could be so fun?

595
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:22,401
Definitely.

596
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,850
Congratulations, Casey.

597
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:27,502
Your plan was creative, effective,
and very dirty.

598
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:29,638
Cheney would be proud.

599
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,532
Thanks.

600
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:18,993
Calvin is amazing.

601
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,969
And he's kind of hot. Is it just me?

602
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:39,111
- You can get off me now.
- Right, that's right.

603
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,409
Call me later?

604
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:46,154
Maybe we should call him, Cap.

605
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:47,477
I'm over here, dude.

606
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,131
Maybe we should turn up the toll.

607
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,125
No, you can't give up.

608
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,491
Isn't this game bigger than both of us?

609
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:00,292
Isn't this about kickin' ass?

610
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:02,976
Isn't this about good VS Evan?

611
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:08,472
He's right.

612
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,194
You may not be feeling well.

613
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:14,486
Some of you are even still drunk.

614
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,105
I see before me a team of Kappa Taus,

615
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:20,358
playing in defiance of tyranny.

616
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:22,722
You've come to fight as free men,

617
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,213
and free men you are.

618
00:34:24,548 --> 00:34:25,548
Will you fight?

619
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:30,016
Aye, fight and you may die,
run and you may live.

620
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:31,017
At least a while.

621
00:34:31,098 --> 00:34:32,421
It hurts real bad, Cap.

622
00:34:34,444 --> 00:34:36,158
Drunk people don't feel pain!

623
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:37,858
And neither do scotsmen.

624
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:39,763
We may be puking,

625
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:42,829
the Omega Chis are not used
to running on puke like we are!

626
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,763
And Rusty here...

627
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:47,221
Look at him.

628
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,072
Just a nice kid from Cleveland.

629
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,389
Chicago.

630
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:52,368
And I know that
when he's dying in his bed

631
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:53,954
many years from now,

632
00:34:54,122 --> 00:34:58,411
he'll be willing to trade all his days,
from this day, for one chance!

633
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,449
I'm actually fine...

634
00:34:59,454 --> 00:35:01,540
Just one chance to come back here

635
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,448
and tell our enemies
that they may take our lives,

636
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:07,601
but they'll never be able
to take our freedom!

637
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,571
If he's dead, do we win automatically?

638
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,750
Dude Owens, nice play out there, man.

639
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:52,048
I can't believe
you almost weren't gonna play with us.

640
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,166
I'm kinda regretting missing
the first game.

641
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,696
Look at that guy. Can't take a hit.

642
00:35:58,715 --> 00:35:59,870
What a freakin' queer.

643
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:10,432
Come on, Beav.

644
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:12,513
Is he dead?

645
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,656
He's still breathing.

646
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,948
I gotta find some adrenaline
or something.

647
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:17,737
So... Are you playing someone else?

648
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,422
I need a decision. Let's go.

649
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:21,267
We'll play a man down.

650
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,149
What about your water boy?

651
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,519
I bet he wants to play.

652
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:26,811
You know what?

653
00:36:26,997 --> 00:36:28,078
That's a great idea.

654
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:30,277
Suit up, Spitter.

655
00:36:30,444 --> 00:36:31,444
You're going in.

656
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,940
I can't do this, I'm telling you,
I practiced, I studied.

657
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:38,983
None of it mattered.

658
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:40,790
I suck! I'm not kidding.

659
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,073
Do you know what separates
a sucky athlete from a great one?

660
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,472
This.

661
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:50,135
Upper body strength?

662
00:36:51,178 --> 00:36:52,178
Your heart.

663
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:54,956
Now grab your stick and be a Kappa Tau.

664
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,351
And Rusty...

665
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,437
If you get the ball...

666
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,965
Go that way.

667
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:03,754
Please don't hit it to me.

668
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:07,753
Please don't hit it to him.

669
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,517
Spitter, run!

670
00:38:38,892 --> 00:38:39,991
Let the dork go!

671
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:50,135
Equipment penalty for not wearing a cup,

672
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,794
which makes us lose the game!

673
00:38:52,092 --> 00:38:53,303
That's just ridiculous.

674
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:54,839
That's, like, the worst ref ever.

675
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:57,842
Just because you forgot to protect 'em,
doesn't mean you don't got 'em.

676
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:07,886
I'm sorry I let you down.

677
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:11,911
I'm sorry I was so blinded
by my desire to win,

678
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:14,885
I completely forgot what
being a Kappa Tau is all about.

679
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:16,669
Brotherhood?

680
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:19,097
Drinking and hot chicks.

681
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,203
That was one hell of a shot though.

682
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:23,852
Maybe it was luck.

683
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,001
Or chance.

684
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:26,796
Or science. I don't know.

685
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:30,560
I just know I'm not good at athletics,
and I don't have to be.

686
00:39:30,597 --> 00:39:31,603
No, you do not.

687
00:39:32,573 --> 00:39:33,573
Now come on, Spitter.

688
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,927
Let's get you a drink you can swallow.

689
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:37,925
Barkeep.

690
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:41,939
Where's Beaver?

691
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:43,957
- Where's Cappie?
- Where's my drink?

692
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:47,995
Finally.

693
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:50,895
Pledge Rebecca, can you get the glass?

694
00:39:50,994 --> 00:39:51,994
Thanks.

695
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:58,023
Ladies,

696
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,973
just wanted to say thank you
for the party favors last night.

697
00:40:01,113 --> 00:40:02,389
Most enjoyable.

698
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:03,470
Thank us?

699
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:05,054
But we sabotaged you.

700
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:07,868
I can't believe I just said "sabotage."

701
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:09,706
Maybe I am learning french.

702
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,452
Well, we would have won,
if not for the tragic technicality.

703
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:15,035
And the cement mixers.

704
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:16,824
It was a pretty dirty trick.

705
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:18,234
I'm a big boy.

706
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:19,483
I can handle it, Case.

707
00:40:19,675 --> 00:40:22,348
Sorry, Cappie,
we're Omega Chi girls, remember?

708
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:23,422
Bye!

709
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,762
You know, it's kind of nice
when the good guys win, don't you think?

710
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:32,784
Not quite the same when you win
'cause I wasn't wearing a cup.

711
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:35,112
I'm just saying.

712
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:43,586
Thanks for the athletic support.

713
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,617
Can you believe Frannie ever doubted me?

714
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,934
She would have to be crazy,
and you know what?

715
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:51,132
I bet she feels like a jackass for it.

716
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,867
All's forgiven.

717
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:06,899
There's always rugby in the spring.

718
00:41:07,738 --> 00:41:10,469
I think I'm going into early retirement.

719
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:14,973
There are certain things you just have
to accept about yourself.

720
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,364
I'm good at table sports,
and I just suck at hockey.

721
00:41:21,737 --> 00:41:22,742
And I'm gay.

722
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:23,967
Right.

723
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,443
I knew this gay guy once.

724
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:41,635
Well, it wasn't that he was once gay.

725
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:43,797
I knew him. Once.

726
00:41:43,983 --> 00:41:44,994
And he was gay.

727
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:46,799
- He is gay.
- Are you okay?

728
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:48,681
You're having a little mouth spasm.

729
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,871
I just know that this is a big moment.

730
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,863
And I have no clue what to say.

731
00:42:00,428 --> 00:42:01,528
What are you thinking?

732
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:03,838
I think I should let you know
that I'm okay with it.

733
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:05,870
Which I am.

734
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:10,331
But then, in my head, I'm just like
"way to be presumptuous, Rusty."

735
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,288
I mean, we're friends.

736
00:42:13,386 --> 00:42:15,865
It's not like you need to get
my permission to be gay.

737
00:42:17,188 --> 00:42:18,597
We are who we are.

738
00:42:20,535 --> 00:42:22,118
- Right?
- Right.

739
00:42:24,988 --> 00:42:27,317
So does everyone else know but me?

740
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,726
Actually, no one here at school knows
but you.

741
00:42:37,078 --> 00:42:39,282
Are you gonna tell
your Omega Chi brothers?

742
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,223
One thing at a time.

743
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:46,071
I just, I just want to get
through pledging first.

744
00:42:50,412 --> 00:42:51,597
It's good to know that I have

745
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,759
at least one brother for sure.
