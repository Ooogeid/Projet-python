1
00:00:01,025 --> 00:00:04,042
- What are the guns for, then?
- For gotcha, the Omega Chis'

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,409
campus assassin game.

3
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:08,301
The object of the game is to
eliminate your assigned target.

4
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,328
Didn't break your purity pledge?

5
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,844
- Nope. Aren't you proud?
- I had sex with Sheila.

6
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,860
I saw Rebecca having
a lot of fun last night.

7
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:16,928
With who?

8
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:19,757
It was hard to tell,
given his face was in her mouth.

9
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,556
- Who's the mystery man?
- You're a good kisser.

10
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,043
What are we doing?

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,944
Without extra credit, D on my midterm,
which is 20 percent of our grade...

12
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,948
... my average is still a low C.
Max told me everything.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,201
You admitted you weren't over Casey.

14
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:40,268
Stop. Cappie and I aren't
getting together. Are we?

15
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:55,633
It's so quiet in here.

16
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:01,059
<i>Quiet please Spitter's study zone</i>

17
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,095
Sorry.

18
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:10,379
They're making sure
I get my studying done.

19
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,920
Totally silent charades.

20
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:13,454
They've been playing for hours.

21
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,826
Must be nice to have that kind
of leisure time, am I right?

22
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:19,677
Between my guitar hero tournaments,
tennis lessons,

23
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:22,326
drinking, gardening,
I am booked solid, spitter.

24
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,257
- Is that tea?
- Boo Berry bana blast punch.

25
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:27,828
- I warmed it up.
- And you're reading jodi picoult?

26
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,163
It's for booktacular:
the book club dale and I started.

27
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:34,384
We're meeting tomorrow
and I'm halfway through.

28
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:36,955
The one daughter needs
the other daughter's kidney.

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,864
- It's a big dilemma. Lot of angst.
- Sounds like you and my sister.

30
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:42,575
Far as I know, Casey
and I both have two working Kidneys.

31
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:43,977
No, I mean the angst.

32
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:46,184
No angst on my end.
Why would there be?

33
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:48,557
Yeah, I guess you turned her down.

34
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:50,558
How's she doing?

35
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:53,232
Busy getting ready for ZBZ
father/daughter weekend.

36
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,708
"Get your grill on."

37
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:00,703
Jordan invited me.

38
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,666
She wants me to meet her dad.

39
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:04,689
Already.
I mean,

40
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,760
we haven't even, you know...

41
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:16,918
- The dad? Sorry about that.
- <i>Doin it!</i>

42
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:20,076
Why? She said he's really nice.
Just a regular guy.

43
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:22,143
I'm supposed to call him Jack.

44
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:25,059
- It's gonna be great.
- It's gonna be awkward at best.

45
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,653
At worst, there's gonna be a heated
argument, culminating in a standoff,

46
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:31,214
gunfire and one or more people
are gonna lose a Kidney.

47
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,635
Or I've just been reading
too much Jodi Picoult.

48
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:36,571
Never mind. It'll be fine, OK?

49
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:39,407
What father wouldn't be thrilled
to have you date his daughter?

50
00:02:44,353 --> 00:02:46,073
<i>He's screwed.</i>

51
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:47,373
I know!

52
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,514
- Gotcha!
- I hate this game!

53
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,179
Sorry, Laura.

54
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:08,008
How do we explain that she's
not in the sority anymore?

55
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,684
It's beth. I couldn't explain
daylight savings time to her.

56
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:12,313
It's easier to let her stay.

57
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:14,695
What if her dad shows up
for father/daughter weekend?

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,790
Last thing we need is another dad.
Every year,

59
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:19,571
all the dads care about
is the flag football game.

60
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:23,159
You think they were at NFL fantasy camp
instead of playing against frat guys.

61
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:25,829
Not just any frat guys.
The best athletes on the row.

62
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,874
Calvin's playing this year, so I made
banners for both him and my dad.

63
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:33,379
- You're weird, Ash.
- Why? 'cause I like my dad?

64
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,705
Because you text your dad every day.

65
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,903
You asked him to be
your Facebook friend. That's weird.

66
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:42,721
My dad hasn't talked to me about anything
except the weather since I got boobs.

67
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,723
With my dad, infidelity with hookers
is always a conversational option.

68
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,943
- Can't wait!
- That sucks.

69
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:51,896
He did just finish a two-week
intensive therapy retreat.

70
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,629
With colonic cleanse.

71
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:55,425
He claims he's a changed man.

72
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:58,486
This is all so sad!
I tell my dad everything.

73
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,073
He knew about me and fisher
hooking up before you guys did.

74
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,533
And I told him about you and Evan.

75
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:04,966
Yeah, Evan.

76
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,416
You know,
there are other guys on this campus.

77
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,250
Relax. It's not like you kissed
someone else's boyfriend this time.

78
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,992
But I have to ask,
how the hell did that Even happen?

79
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:18,715
The usual way. Tequila shots.
You know how it is.

80
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,372
What do you mean?
Evan hasn't

81
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:23,292
touched tequila since the human PI?
That mixer sophomore year.

82
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:26,733
I mean, I did too many
shots and kissed him.

83
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,512
I thought you said he kissed you.

84
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:30,271
That's what I meant.

85
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,315
So why are you so nervous, Rebecca?

86
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,858
Not nervous. In a hurry.
Study session later.

87
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,057
Hey, Fisher, looks like Rebecca
wants seconds of that sausage.

88
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:44,574
She can't seem to cram it
in her mouth fast enough.

89
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,212
Sorry about that.

90
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,013
Oh, my god!

91
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:07,419
Yum, Spicy sausage!

92
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,938
- = 302 =-
"Our Fathers"

93
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,661
VO By: ¤Aka¤, flolo, Jujuleder

94
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:32,502
Fisher, can I talk to you for a sec?

95
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,791
Yeah, sure.
I'm kind of busy right now, but...

96
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,678
- It's just...
- Hi, guys! What's going on?

97
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,308
I just had a question for Fisher.

98
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,031
Really?
What's the question?

99
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:46,550
- Why do you care?
- I'm a curious person, Casey.

100
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:49,121
So am i.
I'm curious

101
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:52,350
if the two of you have something to
hide about the end of the world party.

102
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,969
Something disgusting you
should be totally ashamed of?

103
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,350
- Of course not.
- We just kissed, OK?

104
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:03,138
{\pos(192,210)}I can't believe this. I can't believe
you would do this to Ashleigh.

105
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,130
- It was a total accident.
- It'll never happen again.

106
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:09,826
We were drunk, Rebecca kissed me,
and as soon as I realized, I stopped.

107
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:11,718
Way to take responsibility.

108
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:14,330
And you. After everything
that she's done for you?

109
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:20,152
- I know.
- My god, I'm such a dumbass.

110
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,266
Of course she'll never
forgive me for this.

111
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,946
No, she won't.

112
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,297
{\pos(192,210)}But I'm not going to tell her.

113
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:29,898
You're not?

114
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,889
I'm just picturing her face.

115
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,183
{\pos(192,190)}She doesn't deserve
to feel that way.

116
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:37,818
{\pos(192,210)}You guys are the ones
who deserve to live with this.

117
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:41,399
{\pos(192,210)}All right. I'm gonna take you
at your word, just this once,

118
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,020
{\pos(192,210)}that you love Ash
and this was a huge mistake.

119
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,134
{\pos(192,210)}And I am going to assume
that you were drunk

120
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,120
{\pos(192,210)}and didn't know what you were doing,
and you're not the horrible,

121
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,861
{\pos(192,210)}backstabbing, conniving whorebag
this behavior would imply.

122
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,664
You really expect me to believe
you're not gonna tell her?

123
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,456
{\pos(192,210)}I guess you'll just
have to trust me.

124
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:11,555
What's up with the jazzy ensemble?

125
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,543
I could ask you the same thing.

126
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,626
I got an important
meeting with my pastor.

127
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:19,185
I have an important meeting with
one Mr. Jack reed, jordan's dad.

128
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,294
I dressed up a little bit
so I don't get judged

129
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,365
as some dumb frat guy.

130
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,443
Sometimes it's good to be
judged as harshly as possible.

131
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,336
Want to talk to me about something?

132
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:30,913
No judgments.

133
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,487
You know, don't you?

134
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:33,982
What gave it away?

135
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,111
Her slatternly perfume?

136
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:38,331
I can't get it off my clothes.
Like she's marked me.

137
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,310
No, you smell...

138
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:44,288
The way you always smell.
Calvin told me.

139
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,993
He's worried about you.

140
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:48,481
- That losing your virginity...
- Don't say it!

141
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,017
I'm sure I'm gonna
feel normal and pure again

142
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:54,977
as soon as I talk it out
with pastor dan, so...

143
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:57,231
Good luck with your judgment day.

144
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,578
Hi! Dad!

145
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,508
How was your flight?

146
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,429
- It's good to see you.
- You too. You look great.

147
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,826
I bet you know what
i'm gonna say now, right?

148
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:25,481
- What's that?
- Tire pressure, case.

149
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,597
Your right rear looks low.
Might want to take care of it.

150
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:30,754
I'm just looking out for you.

151
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,821
Yeah. So how's mom?

152
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,662
Good. How's your brother?

153
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:36,918
Good.

154
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:44,981
I thought I'd drop you
back at your hotel.

155
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,216
I have to finish
setting up for the barbecue.

156
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:48,610
Sounds good.

157
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,359
Good.

158
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,991
When's the last time
you changed the oil?

159
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:04,694
I just did.

160
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,439
You can't forget.

161
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,087
Do you know how important
adequate lubrication is?

162
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:15,183
What I mean is, for instance,
in your mother's vul...

163
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:16,438
Volvo...

164
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,743
What if you broke down
in an unsavory neighborhood?

165
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:24,884
- A pretty girl like you.
- I said I just got the oil changed.

166
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,213
And I'm an adult,

167
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:28,483
- I can take care of...
- Stop sign. Stop sign!

168
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:38,109
Almost out of gas.

169
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:44,357
Jammin'

170
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:48,486
we jammin' with jesus, too
he jammin' with us

171
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,128
we jammin' with him

172
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:52,892
jammin'

173
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:54,154
brother kettlewell!

174
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,928
Are you here to jam for the lord?

175
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,813
No, I didn't bring my guitar.

176
00:09:58,095 --> 00:09:59,974
I actually just, need

177
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,933
to talk to you about... Sin.

178
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,106
Jesus's specialty.
That's what he died for.

179
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,621
No, I understand that.

180
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:09,419
So if I sin
and ask for forgiveness...

181
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:10,755
Then you're forgiven.

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,903
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- But I had sex!

183
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,739
With my landlady.
This is a woman I didn't love.

184
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,496
- I didn't even really like her.
- Brother Kettlewell,

185
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:21,637
the gospel according to John says
if we confess our sins,

186
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:25,402
then he is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins,

187
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,929
and to cleanse us
of all unrighteousness.

188
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:29,729
Then how come
I still feel like hell?

189
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:32,369
Brother Kettlewell,
jesus has done his part.

190
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:37,768
So don't blame him
if you still feel bad

191
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:39,660
come on, sing with me.

192
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:41,426
We're jammin'

193
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:44,016
we're jammin' with Jesus, too

194
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,767
we'd like a taxi, please.

195
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,143
Traveling in style, right?

196
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:52,766
Or casey didn't want to pick us up.

197
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:56,703
Dad, do you mind if I try out
a few conversation topics on you?

198
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:58,707
I want to be prepared
for Jordan's dad.

199
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:00,450
You're gonna be fine, Rus.

200
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,082
Remember in high school,
your mother always used to say,

201
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:06,231
"it's too bad Rusty doesn't
have a girlfriend or date..."

202
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,918
'cause"any parent would be thrilled
to have him dating their daughter."

203
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,400
Remember those friday
nights we all used to hang out?

204
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:14,697
How we used to say,
"it's too bad Joan of Arcadia

205
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:17,625
isn't a real girl,
'cause Joe Mantegna

206
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,397
and Mary Steenburgen
would've really liked you."

207
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:22,388
That makes me feel so much better.

208
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,921
Cab for Jack Reed!

209
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:25,513
Yeah. Jack reed here.

210
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:27,849
Mr. Reed.

211
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:31,440
- Yeah.
- I'm, Jordan's boyfriend, Rusty.

212
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,607
Is that right?
How the heck are ya?

213
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,787
- Call me Jack.
- This is my dad, Russell.

214
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:41,707
Russell. Russell, Rusty.
Sensing a theme here.

215
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,107
That's right!

216
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,413
We try to make it easy.

217
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,731
Why don't we share a cab over?

218
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,082
- Great.
- Yeah.

219
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,251
A little scrawny
for a cornerback, huh?

220
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:52,115
Must make up for it in speed.

221
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:54,123
Come on!

222
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:55,654
Wait a minute.

223
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,763
You have a girlfriend
and you're playing football?

224
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:00,333
- That's my Rus.
- No. He thinks i'm her ex-boyfriend.

225
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,078
Let's move it.

226
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,829
I killed again last night.

227
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:07,495
I hope you mean in the game.

228
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,391
I feel bad because he thought
we were going on a date.

229
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,396
But then I got him!

230
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:14,710
Guess he shouldn't have trusted you.

231
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,581
He didn't mind though.

232
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:20,363
I let him touch my right boobie.

233
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:26,900
Ash, I have to tell you something.

234
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,541
You're probably gonna hate me,
and I wish I never did it,

235
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,965
but I didn't kiss Evan
at the end of the world party.

236
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:33,926
I kissed Fisher.

237
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:35,051
What?

238
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,797
That's not funny.
Is that a joke?

239
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,145
I wish it were.

240
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:42,142
- You kissed Fisher?
- I'm sorry, Ash.

241
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,345
It was just a kiss.

242
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,188
Oh, yeah, and one more thing:
Casey found out, but didn't tell.

243
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:48,225
- She wanted to keep it a secret.
- What?

244
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,499
- What?
- What?

245
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,702
Where should I put these buns?

246
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,203
Ashleigh! There's my girl!

247
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:00,926
Dad.

248
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,816
Ash, I can explain
this whole situation.

249
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,170
Did you kiss her?

250
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,152
Rebecca kissed me,
and I stopped her.

251
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,697
- It will never happen again.
- Welcome to ZBZ.

252
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,367
Never speak to me again.

253
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:39,708
Ash, can I...? Will you
listen to me for one minute?

254
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,194
Here they are, the bffs!

255
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,305
Casey and Ashleigh!

256
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,273
Senior year! What are you guys
gonna do without each other?

257
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:52,067
Think you're gonna be roomies
out there in the big bad world?

258
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:53,761
Oh, I'm not worried, dad.

259
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,500
I can't wait for graduation.

260
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,672
Omg, it's the bbf... Fs.

261
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,174
It's like they've all
been readingtiger beat.

262
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,558
Hey, dad.

263
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,167
Hi, Mr. Cartwright.

264
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:06,638
Hey, kid.

265
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,338
Is that who I think it is?

266
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,757
If you mean Fisher, nope.

267
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,397
Come on, dad.
Let's go get some food.

268
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:23,418
Sure is, clear out today.

269
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,466
I have so much inside of me
that needs to come out.

270
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,969
Wasn't that part of your
problem before, dad?

271
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:36,698
I acknowledge that.
But the key is constant communication.

272
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:38,635
That's what I learned on my retreat.

273
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,664
Confessions of past wrongs
is the way to make current rights.

274
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:46,312
Ash, can I talk to you for one...

275
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,511
Get your hands off me.
Welcome, Mr. Logan.

276
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,830
Are you having a fight
with your friend, becky?

277
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,478
It's nothing I can't handle.

278
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:00,689
As my art therapist said,

279
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,484
"friends are the glue that
hold our hearts together."

280
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,028
I had a best friend once.

281
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:09,414
Then I lured him into a ponzi scheme

282
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:13,662
that bankrupted him, and
then I slept with his wife.

283
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:16,705
I was a bad man, becky.

284
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,486
Your newfound self-awareness
is really annoying.

285
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,233
I acknowledge that.

286
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:29,712
This guy's a cavs fan.

287
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:32,546
Great.

288
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:34,298
First your dad thinks I'm andy,

289
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:37,517
and now he'd clearly rather you
date my gay best friend than me.

290
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:39,439
Oh, come on.
You know how dads are.

291
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,164
He barely hears a word I say.

292
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,089
Of course I told him about you.

293
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:45,655
The only thing that registered
in the past two months

294
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,912
were "football player"
and "boyfriend."

295
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:50,110
Why didn't you tell me
he's such a sports nut?

296
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:53,034
I could've studied.
You said he was just a regular guy.

297
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,325
Aren't most regular
guys sports nuts?

298
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,432
- So I'm an irregular guy?
- No!

299
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,632
He is gonna love you,
all right? Come on.

300
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:08,132
So cal here once won
the halftime free-throw contest.

301
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,136
- Isn't that amazing?
- And rusty's his best friend!

302
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:14,556
That's right, sir!

303
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:18,130
Let me get that.

304
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:20,031
Don't worry about that.

305
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:21,876
Oh! That's all right.

306
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,479
That's good.

307
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:27,273
You know, the first time
I drank tequila,

308
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:29,573
I spit it out. All over a girl.

309
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:31,403
Good story.

310
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,120
But, sir, don't think I'm
some reckless underage drinker.

311
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,847
The reason I spit it out
was because that was he first time

312
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:40,893
I ever drank. I'm in the honors
engineering program.

313
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,688
We don't have time to drink.

314
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,484
Leave that to communications majors.

315
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:47,237
Communication majors.
Yes! Like my dad!

316
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:50,925
Dad, we talk about the importance
of communication all the time.

317
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,722
Yeah. So you spit your
tequila out all over a girl?

318
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,497
Yes. Like I said,
it was the first time I drank.

319
00:16:56,622 --> 00:16:58,599
Can't you hold your liquor?
You're in a frat.

320
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,220
- Yeah, I am!
- Good.

321
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,415
Then we'll see what
you got on the field tomorrow?

322
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,588
No, dad, rusty's
too busy studying...

323
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:07,525
No, I'm not!
Of course I'm playing.

324
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,852
All right.

325
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:11,901
Great. Let's get you
another beer, dad.

326
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,700
Can't wait to see
how fast you are off the line.

327
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:19,453
Yeah, just wait till you see
how fast I am on the line.

328
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:22,196
Make it stop, please make it stop.

329
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,602
What happened to booktacular?
I waited for an hour.

330
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:34,586
Can you believe that
after all that, she died?

331
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,589
That's not Jodi Picoult!

332
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,295
I did the dirty, OK?
I tried to tell you about it before...

333
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:45,071
- With the landlady?
- Yes.

334
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:47,481
It was magical... Ly disgusting.

335
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:49,270
She made noises like a banshee,

336
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:52,083
like a farm animal
in late-stage labor.

337
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:55,114
Leaving me feeling as soiled
as the veterinarian's glove.

338
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:57,248
Are you sure that you did it right?

339
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,827
- And now god's mad at you?
- Yeah.

340
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,361
I asked for forgiveness,
so everything should be fine.

341
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:10,846
Speaking of things that are fine...

342
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:15,088
Hail mary!

343
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:18,221
- It's mary-elyse, actually.
- Oh, a girl with two names.

344
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:19,892
Yeah, and three gods.

345
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,755
What's the deal with
this trinity bunk?

346
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,435
I know that the formalities of the
catholic church can seem daunting,

347
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:28,412
but it offers an ordered path to
salvation that helps people find

348
00:18:28,537 --> 00:18:30,608
the answers that have eluded them
for centuries.

349
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,518
I have heard your people
dole out some pretty harsh

350
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:36,840
- punishments to sinners.
- Only if you've been very bad.

351
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,799
You have no idea.

352
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:42,932
Why don't the two of you join me
at mass tonight, 9pm,

353
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,664
saint ignatius full of sorrow?

354
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,587
All right. I'll be there.
But I'm not doing any kneeling.

355
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:53,417
Oh, don't worry, I will.

356
00:18:57,316 --> 00:19:00,065
She told me she was 18,
but I knew she was lying.

357
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,541
I acknowledge that.

358
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,930
Now the other girl...

359
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:05,215
Sorry, dad, casey's
gotta yell at me. Gotta go!

360
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:07,786
I was gonna make up
something polite, but OK.

361
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,330
I assume you're wondering
why I told ashleigh the truth.

362
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:13,474
Yeah. That was the first
thing I was going to yell.

363
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,684
I didn't trust you not
to tell her sooner or later.

364
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:17,848
You're best friend.
You tell each other everything.

365
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:20,028
As for the second thing
i'm going to yell...

366
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:21,999
Why'd I drag you into it? Simple.

367
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:24,142
Ashleigh's kind
of the best friend I have.

368
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:26,131
I screwed up and
she may never forgive me.

369
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,142
But I figured if
she's mad at both of us,

370
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,502
it'd take a little
of the heat off me.

371
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,324
I know, right?
I'm kinda brilliant.

372
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:34,309
And kind of evil!

373
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,802
You realize what you've done?
Ashleigh isn't like you, or even me.

374
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,963
She's all heart.
This could destroy her.

375
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:41,131
Let's go, girls.

376
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:49,528
And now, the time has come for
the zbz father/daughter welcome song!

377
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,543
Oh, daddy, daddy
I once sat on your knee

378
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:05,063
and I still remember
the lessons you taught me

379
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,963
like always eat your vegetables

380
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:10,228
but first you must give thanks

381
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:14,169
like never tell a lie
unless you want to die

382
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,626
those aren't the words...

383
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:18,354
Like never trust a slut

384
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,735
who has a big ol'butt

385
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:26,765
I do not have a big ol'butt!

386
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,527
You do have a big mouth, though.

387
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:30,687
All right. Let's settle
this right now, you and me!

388
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:32,265
Yeah, bitch.

389
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,439
- You're the bitch.
- You're both bitches!

390
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:45,787
Anyone else turned on right now?

391
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:49,121
What? Those aren't my daughters.

392
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:55,083
We're supposed to be sisters!

393
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:14,229
Girls, we can't help if you
don't tell us what's wrong.

394
00:21:14,502 --> 00:21:16,462
Is it possible that
there's something going on

395
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:19,039
that may have put all
three of you in bad moods?

396
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:21,024
Something... In the body?

397
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:24,014
'cause I read that when
girls live together...

398
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:26,242
No, dad, it's not our periods.

399
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,347
OK. Well, if it's not hormonal,

400
00:21:28,472 --> 00:21:30,669
why can't the three of you
just talk it out?

401
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,331
Sounds good to me.

402
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:35,293
I don't have anything
to talk to you about.

403
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,356
You kissed my boyfriend.
And you hid it from me.

404
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:40,696
Wait. Fisher? Where does
he live? I will kick his ass!

405
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,012
Sit down, dad.

406
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,982
Becky, are you self-sabotaging
again?

407
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:47,788
Please don't let our unstable
relationship sully your ability

408
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:50,608
- to form lasting bonds.
- Shut up, dad.

409
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,387
Your dad is right, rebecca.

410
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,507
You should learn to keep
your hands off other girls' boyfriends.

411
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,023
You kept your hands off
cappie during spring break?

412
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,526
You were broken up.
And we only kissed.

413
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,903
- I only kissed fisher!
- We weren't broken up.

414
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,536
And you slept with evan!

415
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:06,491
At least I didn't sleep
with a 16-year-old!

416
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:07,992
Omd.

417
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:11,142
You know what? I didn't
betray either one of you.

418
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:12,757
And I never would.

419
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,797
Do you think it might be a good
idea to go apologize to ashleigh?

420
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:18,308
Dad, I'm not a child!

421
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,048
Becky, I beg you,
call my hypnotherapist.

422
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:26,118
You need to deal with your
narcissistic attention-seeking.

423
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:29,583
I am not gonna be lectured by a
man who missed my ballet recital

424
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:32,182
because he was busy filibustering
a legislative aide.

425
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:39,399
Well, that didn't go as well
as could be expected.

426
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:42,239
For what it's worth,
I was thinking the same thing.

427
00:22:42,364 --> 00:22:44,375
About the periods and bodies.

428
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,214
Women and their emotions!

429
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:48,268
Rofl.

430
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,785
I did get the impression ashleigh
was a little bit hyper-emotional.

431
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,028
We're just talking
about a little kiss.

432
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,344
My daughter is the victim here.

433
00:22:56,628 --> 00:23:00,086
Victim? Do we really need to use
politically-correct language?

434
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,777
I will use whatever language
I want when talking about

435
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:04,588
your daughter betraying my daughter.

436
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:07,647
All right, let's just
calm down right now!

437
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:11,846
But ken, you have to admit,
when it comes to rebecca,

438
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:15,518
the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree. Right?

439
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,359
Your daughter should have
told my daughter the truth.

440
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:31,933
I've never been talked to
in such a displeasing manner.

441
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:38,320
I suck at football.

442
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:40,437
You gotta help me think
of a way out of this game.

443
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:42,562
But it's gotta be a manly way.

444
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:47,477
How about tomorrow you say
we went bungee jumping,

445
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:50,367
I got injured trying to rescue you.
That sounds bad-ass, right?

446
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:52,635
OK. Don't sweat the game, rusty.

447
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,301
Is that some kind of sports lingo?

448
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:55,707
If it is, I don't get it.

449
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:57,996
Every year, the fraternity
team throws the game.

450
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:00,276
That means we let the dads win.

451
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:02,483
Makes them feel
young and virile for a

452
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,644
brief, shining moment,
until they go back to

453
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:06,844
aging wives and unrewarding
white-collar jobs,

454
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:08,487
counting the days until retirement.

455
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,237
So I have to help you lose?

456
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:12,628
- I can do that.
- Yes.

457
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:14,865
Your total lack of athletic
prowess will fit right in.

458
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,141
Now go pay attention
to your girlfriend instead

459
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,117
of obsessing about her dad.

460
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,542
Thanks, cal.

461
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,129
Yeah?

462
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,348
Don't let him see you run.

463
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,732
Nice.

464
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,909
I'm such an idiot.

465
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:52,037
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

466
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,825
I find that a little hard
to believe right now.

467
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:58,032
I was drunk.
And I screwed up big time.

468
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,648
I didn't even know what was
happening until it happened.

469
00:25:00,963 --> 00:25:03,543
Believe me, if there was any way
I could take it back...

470
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,292
But that's the problem.

471
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:07,532
I can't believe you anymore.

472
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:10,464
When someone cheats on me,
then it's over.

473
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,846
Even if it was just a kiss?

474
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,097
I thought we really had
something great together.

475
00:25:17,397 --> 00:25:19,960
We still can. Please?

476
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:26,315
How can I trust you again?

477
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:27,975
I can't.

478
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:42,753
The idolatry wasn't nearly
as distracting as I'd imagined.

479
00:25:42,878 --> 00:25:44,583
I'm glad you guys enjoyed mass.

480
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:47,836
Absolutely. The priest gave me a bunch
of hail marys to atone for my sin.

481
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:49,349
Plus, the beads.

482
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:51,066
Have any literature on flogging?

483
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:53,332
Mary-elyse, we should
we get out of here.

484
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:55,976
No. Hold on, buddy. I got a few more
questions for mary-elyse.

485
00:25:56,195 --> 00:26:00,199
What say we go get a cup of coffee
and really dig deep into vatican ii?

486
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,940
- Sure...
- Fantastic.

487
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:04,584
Excuse me. Sorry.

488
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,022
I need mary-elyse for the night.
You can have her tomorrow.

489
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:10,182
What kind of sucker
do you take me for?

490
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:13,256
My spiritual needs outweigh carnal ones.
She's mine tonight.

491
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:16,876
I know we agreed
our friendship benefits

492
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,333
from avoiding expression
of deep emotions.

493
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,611
Yeah. Agreed, especially due to our
shared past with the same woman.

494
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,796
Right. But look.

495
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:34,682
The truth is
i'm in a little bit of a funk.

496
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:39,512
All right, just go.

497
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:41,135
Yes! Bless you.

498
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:43,085
Come on.

499
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:47,035
After you.

500
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:13,039
We have to talk about this.

501
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:17,550
You're my best friend. I hate
to see you hurt like this.

502
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:21,167
That's why I didn't tell you.
I was trying to protect you.

503
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:24,055
- You're such a good person...
- I'm a good person.

504
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,715
That doesn't make me
incapable of handling this.

505
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:30,313
I know that.

506
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,991
- Ash, I was just...
- I dumped fisher.

507
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,452
Really?

508
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,862
Are you sure?

509
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,881
It was just a kiss.

510
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,784
Case, I'm not exactly like you.

511
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:45,350
I'm not cool enough to stay
with my boyfriend after he cheats on me.

512
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:48,916
- It's not always that simple.
- Well, for me, it is.

513
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:00,971
Gotcha!

514
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,243
I have one question.

515
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,118
Yeah, I have some in the drawer.

516
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:25,894
What? Really?

517
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:31,660
But I actually wanted to ask you

518
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,812
if you think your dad was impressed
that

519
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:35,616
I was gonna play in
the game tomorrow.

520
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:36,881
Seriously?

521
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,082
I don't want to talk
about my dad right now.

522
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:53,814
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

523
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:08,621
Sweetie, I think I left my...

524
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,206
What the hell are you
doing to my daughter?

525
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:53,822
Sir, I just want to apologize
again for last night.

526
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,367
I know what it looked like,
but I was giving her a back rub.

527
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:59,379
I know exactly
what you were rubbing.

528
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:02,556
Now how about we settle this
on the field, cartwright?

529
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,090
I'm fine right here.

530
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:05,636
What's the matter, you scared?

531
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,377
Because I'm about to bring the pain.

532
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,309
Sounds good.

533
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:15,428
Can't wait!

534
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:17,597
Good!

535
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:19,197
I'll see you out there.

536
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,154
Ready for the big game?

537
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,495
Ready as I'll ever be.

538
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,871
Sorry for, butting in yesterday.

539
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,570
I know that was none of my business.

540
00:30:38,632 --> 00:30:41,045
You know, if you curl
your fingers up as you cut,

541
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,607
you're less likely
to get nicked. You want to be careful.

542
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,153
I am careful.

543
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:47,811
Why is it so hard for you to
trust that I know what I'm doing?

544
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:49,719
You'll always be my little girl.

545
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:52,109
If I had my way, I'd always
be able to protect you

546
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:53,826
as easily as I could back then.

547
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:57,604
But the good thing about growing up
is that you taught me to protect myself.

548
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:00,287
When you baby me, it makes me
feel like you think I'm an idiot.

549
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:01,885
I don't think you're an idiot.

550
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,464
- But you make me feel that way.
- I'm just trying to protect you,

551
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:06,952
just like you were
trying to protect ashleigh.

552
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:16,799
What a wonderful world.

553
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:18,750
If I was one of those
douchebags who say,

554
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,880
"i'm high on life,"
i'd say it right now.

555
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,113
Have you talked to mary-elyse today?

556
00:31:23,238 --> 00:31:26,129
I left her a few messages.
I think I got a bum set of beads.

557
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:28,670
I was rubbing these
up and down all night,

558
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:30,553
and I feel just as impure as before.

559
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,243
Now that you mention it,
i'm waiting for the lovely m-e

560
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:35,412
to return my calls.

561
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:40,394
And speaking of the angel...

562
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:45,902
- Should I buy a hair shirt?
- How about a date?

563
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:47,598
Excuse me for a moment.

564
00:31:49,036 --> 00:31:50,792
You're kind of smothering me.

565
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,036
Both of you.

566
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,596
- You're cute.
- Thank you.

567
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,468
But leaving me five messages
since last night?

568
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:02,585
That's creepy.

569
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:08,299
As for your messages, dale, I didn't
appreciate your threatening tone.

570
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:11,010
Maybe you're not catholic material.

571
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,650
"Grown men" on three! Let's go!
One, two, three!

572
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,997
Grown men!

573
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:26,256
Let's go!

574
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:39,038
Ready, set, hut, hut, hut!

575
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,801
Come on!

576
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:48,970
Here! Come on!

577
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,468
I'm open!

578
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,840
What are you doing?

579
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,671
- Fumble!
- Time out!

580
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:07,135
- What the hell was that?
- Dumb call!

581
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,660
Are you blind?
Can you see over here?

582
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,121
I'm wide open!

583
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:13,767
This game is gonna be
harder to throw than we thought.

584
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,390
- Come on. Let's get in.
- It's all right.

585
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:21,040
- Throw it to me. I was wide open.
- Wide open like your daughter!

586
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:26,545
- Let's just focus on the game here.
- Don't patronize me, Cartwright.

587
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,798
Same play. It's gonna work.

588
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,780
Grown men on three. One, two, three.

589
00:33:31,905 --> 00:33:33,458
- Grown men!
- Let's go, boys.

590
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:38,515
Can I sit with you?

591
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:40,968
Maybe.

592
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:50,211
I...

593
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,987
should have given you more credit.

594
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,332
Of course you can take care of yourself.
And I should have told you about fisher.

595
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,057
I'm so sorry, Ash.

596
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:02,654
That's OK.

597
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:04,684
You meant well.

598
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:07,753
And I kind of need
my best friend back,

599
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,256
especially since I just had
my heart broken and all.

600
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:13,505
Come here.

601
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,232
Are we making up now?

602
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:19,598
We're still mad at you!

603
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:34,947
Nice one, Dad!

604
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:36,699
Better luck next time, Rus!

605
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,448
Eat my dust, Cartwright!

606
00:34:56,547 --> 00:34:58,512
Rusty, no! It's flag football!

607
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,672
Oh, my God!

608
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:14,834
Eat that!

609
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,141
- Is it over? Did we win?
- Rusty, what did you do?

610
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,284
- What?
- My back!

611
00:35:22,562 --> 00:35:23,899
- Honey.
- You OK?

612
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:25,622
He frickin' tackled!

613
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:29,501
- I know. I saw.
- God, what did he do?

614
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,851
Hey. May I have a pitcher
of beer? Thanks.

615
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,511
Right away.

616
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:44,134
What are you doing here?

617
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:45,893
{\pos(192,210)}You're not a ZBZ dad.

618
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:48,082
{\pos(192,210)}Well, not that I know of.

619
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,092
{\pos(192,210)}Who won the game?

620
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:53,108
{\pos(192,210)}It was called on account
of a medical emergency.

621
00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:57,493
{\pos(192,210)}Which, fortunately,
was just a pulled muscle.

622
00:35:57,618 --> 00:36:00,854
Jordan's dad is resting comfortably,
being tended to by his daughter.

623
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,942
Rusty tackled him.

624
00:36:05,217 --> 00:36:06,224
I warned him.

625
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,458
Hemingway? At dobler's?

626
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:12,316
New book club selection. I'm behind.

627
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:14,474
I keep finding myself preoccupied.

628
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:20,060
- Here you go.
- We...

629
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:22,478
We read that
in my freshman lit class.

630
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:26,568
Tragic love story.

631
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:28,398
Some would say.

632
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,439
Yeah, they just couldn't seem
to get the timing right.

633
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,942
{\pos(192,210)}And then he got his junk blown off
in World War I.

634
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,418
{\pos(192,210)}See ya.

635
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:04,763
You think Jordan will break up with me
now that I almost killed her dad?

636
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,308
When I offered to go to his hotel,
she said that wasn't a good idea.

637
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:12,589
Trying to impress a girl's father
is a losing battle.

638
00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:15,973
It's hard not to be the only man
in your daughter's life.

639
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,114
And it's hard to admit
they need someone else.

640
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:25,665
Why do you think I hated
all of Casey's high school boyfriends?

641
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:32,207
So are you saying that Jack is probably
just as scared of me as I am of him?

642
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:34,187
You did almost paralyze him, son.

643
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:37,421
Yeah, that wasn't good.

644
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:43,003
I would have thrown it to you
if I thought you'd catch it.

645
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:46,044
It's not about catching.
It's about throwing.

646
00:37:46,169 --> 00:37:48,424
You wouldn't have caught it.
You have sandals.

647
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:49,892
You're both wrong.

648
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:52,502
This is ridiculous.

649
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:57,448
You guys!

650
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,151
You guys are all adults.

651
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,402
Whatever is going on
between Ashleigh, Rebecca and me

652
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:04,156
doesn't involve you.

653
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,388
And didn't the fact that
one of your own got taken down by Rusty

654
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:09,582
remind you that you're not getting
any younger,

655
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:11,830
and life is too short
to hold a grudge.

656
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,667
Dad. Would you like to start?

657
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:19,421
Is there something you want to say
to mr. Logan and Mr. Howard?

658
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,840
No hard feelings?

659
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,427
Well, I'd like to apologize
if I insinuated that your daughter is...

660
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,721
- There's no need to expand on that!
- OK!

661
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:29,306
Apology acknowledged.

662
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:34,904
Well done.

663
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,409
So I don't suppose I can convince you
that life is too short to hold a grudge

664
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:53,580
against me? For one little kiss?

665
00:38:58,146 --> 00:38:59,294
I acknowledge that.

666
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,102
Have I walked into a
transgenderedcathycomic?

667
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:22,555
Guess you're breaking up
with catholicism?

668
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:25,490
Don't sweat it.
It was a rebound religion anyway.

669
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:27,990
Just like Mary-Elyse
was a rebound girl for me.

670
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,622
Who are you rebounding from?

671
00:39:30,594 --> 00:39:32,035
You know our woman in common?

672
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,644
I think I wasn't over her.

673
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,688
Even though I had the chance to be
with her, and I didn't take it.

674
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,857
That is so Casey.

675
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:43,676
You know, she makes you love her
and then she turns away.

676
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,419
I am in a funk. And I guess

677
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:49,970
book clubs, tennis, video games,

678
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,540
beer and even the lovely
and treacherous Mary-Elyse

679
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:55,183
aren't gonna make it easier.

680
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:56,560
Word.

681
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,397
But the important thing is there's lot
of other girls, and gods, in the sea.

682
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:05,110
You know, I don't want another god.
I just want mine back.

683
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,528
I hear.

684
00:40:27,096 --> 00:40:28,656
Saved one of your favorites.

685
00:40:29,424 --> 00:40:30,424
Red velvet.

686
00:41:10,503 --> 00:41:12,010
Sorry I almost paralyzed your dad.

687
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,614
He's fine now.

688
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:15,305
You might have done him a favor.

689
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,933
He promised to finally
go get a physical.

690
00:41:18,783 --> 00:41:20,093
He should thank me then.

691
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:22,100
Yeah, don't push it.

692
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:28,401
Do you mind that your dad
doesn't like me?

693
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:32,123
I think that I like you enough
for the both of us.

694
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,284
Your dad isn't gonna stop by, is he?

695
00:41:56,409 --> 00:41:58,014
I don't think so, but...

696
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,440
Let's wait until he goes back
to Columbus.

697
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:12,512
So...

698
00:42:12,868 --> 00:42:14,823
You ready to get your old dad
out of your hair?

699
00:42:15,832 --> 00:42:18,618
I'm gonna miss you, dad.
I had a lot of fun this weekend.

700
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,087
Even with all the...

701
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:21,935
Craziness.

702
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,457
Me too.

703
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:27,460
It's not my business, but did you figure
everything out with your gal pals?

704
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:28,883
More or less.

705
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,640
You know, college,

706
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,878
lots of drama.

707
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:36,279
Don't let the drama get you down.

708
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,868
Ever since you were a little girl,
you've been able to handle anything.

709
00:42:40,653 --> 00:42:42,559
Now that you're not
a little girl anymore,

710
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,971
the world better look out
for my daughter.

711
00:42:46,142 --> 00:42:47,173
Thanks, dad.

712
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,691
It's nice you think that about me.

713
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,109
It's the truth.

714
00:42:58,015 --> 00:43:00,202
- You sure you changed that oil?
- Dad!

715
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,741
Just checking!

716
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,503
Love you.

717
00:43:10,795 --> 00:43:11,880
Love you, too.

718
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,642
{/ecriture tableau de bord}

719
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,810
Crap.
