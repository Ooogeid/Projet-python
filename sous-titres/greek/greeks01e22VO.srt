1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:02,463
- <i>Previsously...</i>
- You're my little brother.

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:05,730
- To trust me, take this back.
- Going back to Omega Chi.

3
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:07,013
So Evan wins.

4
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:10,155
We said we weren't gonna let our houses
get in the way of us being friends.

5
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:12,425
- You did nothing.
- It was a prank!

6
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,666
I used to see everything in terms
of whether it would piss off my parents.

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,574
I just didn't want people to think
I was dating you to get to her.

8
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:21,296
- You like Michael, right?
- I think so.

9
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,464
Gentlemen,
it's time to get your fake Ids.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,277
Chad Stewart.

11
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,281
I'm not interested in being
anyone's warm body.

12
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:32,284
I'm gonna go tell Casey I'm an idiot
and I want her back.

13
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:33,948
She wants us to be friends,

14
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,542
I said I was on board,
but I don't think I am.

15
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,875
Did you pay Shane Mullen
to stay away from me?

16
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:43,126
- How could you be so spiteful?
- I didn't do it to be.

17
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:44,922
- Why?
- Because I love you.

18
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:47,234
I think you should take some time.

19
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:49,413
- Get your head together.
- We're done.

20
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:52,596
Maybe instead of trying to keep
all the guys away from one girl,

21
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:55,015
find a girl who thinks
you're the only guy.

22
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:58,341
Why do you want to be a lawyer?

23
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,288
It was easier to follow Evan's path.

24
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,750
I know what kind of law
I want to practice: none.

25
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:15,949
Can you pick up my mail
while you're... You're packing?

26
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:18,256
It's spring break.
Why would I not be?

27
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:21,039
I assumed that you were gonna
be sticking around campus.

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,476
I need a break.
I'm not a machine,

29
00:01:23,596 --> 00:01:25,909
contrary to what my academics imply.

30
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,295
So while you're submerged in surf, sand

31
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:30,807
and sin with your fraternity brothers
in South Carolina,

32
00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:34,215
I am gonna be engaged in something
far less reckless in Virginia.

33
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:35,674
You're...

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,256
- I have no idea.
- Wild turkey hunting with my family.

35
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:43,981
Killing turkeys is safer
than going to the beach?

36
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:46,483
Are you familiar with the dangers
of spring break?

37
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,113
Drunken injury?

38
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,846
Pregnancy?
Parasailing gone awry?

39
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:53,949
What about the people injured
or killed while hunting?

40
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,258
They're just morons.

41
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,399
This is spring break.

42
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,119
This is the most sacred
of college traditions.

43
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,460
Why waste that on your parents?
Do something with your friends,

44
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,462
like take a road trip to warmer weather.

45
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:08,172
As if it ever gets that cold here.

46
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:13,177
Have fun killing turkeys.

47
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,264
Have fun perpetuating stereotypes
of wasted, reckless, youth.

48
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:22,703
Two minutes, girls.

49
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,142
And windows...

50
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:26,610
Check.

51
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,821
The house is officially ready
for lockdown,

52
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,512
which means in two minutes
I am officially on spring break!

53
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,411
I can feel the weight of my presidential
duties lifting from my shoulders.

54
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,997
Could you put it on my suitcase?

55
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:45,207
We're going to Myrtle Beach for a week,
not a year-long expedition to Mars.

56
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:47,416
I have to bring everything
Teresa bought me.

57
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:51,691
- Teresa Visa. She's very generous.
- But your card is a Credit Plus.

58
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,552
I know, but nothing cute rhymes
with Credit Plus.

59
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:57,679
- There!
- Think this will fit in your car?

60
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,681
Lucky for you, I packed light.

61
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,645
All I need is sunscreen, a sarong
and an iPod filled with beach music.

62
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:07,734
I'm leaving the rest of my baggage
behind: literally and figuratively.

63
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,045
No Jimmy Buffet.

64
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:13,153
We have plenty of time to listen to him
when we are old and sad.

65
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:15,492
No Buffet.

66
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:18,091
No ex-boyfriends.
No Zeta Beta business.

67
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:21,353
Most of all, no worrying
about the gaping hole that is my future.

68
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:23,583
I plan to flirt with boys

69
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,300
and check things
off the spring break list.

70
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:29,184
Oh my god, where did you find this?

71
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:32,005
In my old beach towel. Remember
when we made these freshman year?

72
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:34,341
We were such wide-eyed
spring break virgins.

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,920
There are still things on here.
I'd like to finish it.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,965
- Like what?
- Playing a drinking game,

75
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,836
entering a contest and skinny dipping.

76
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:43,996
Casey Cartwright gone wild!

77
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:46,765
It's time.

78
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:50,747
Let's go, let's go!

79
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:52,478
Spring break awaits!

80
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,027
Lift off!

81
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:10,014

00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:17,743
Hurry up!
You're wasting valuable party time!

85
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:19,043
Get in here!

86
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,665
Welcome aboard.

87
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:33,920
We know you have many choices in travel
and we thank you for choosing KT Air.

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,314
I love this bus.

89
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:39,313
It has taken the Kts to Myrtle Beach
for 32 spring breaks in a row.

90
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:40,888
It is a legend.

91
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,978
Pledge Cartwright will be serving chips
and fries in the main cabin.

92
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:49,156
And this bus makes only five stops
and five stops only for gas.

93
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,815
- What about...?
- Only for gas.

94
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,030
So cool.

95
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:05,462
Come on, come on.

96
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:16,847
Are we there yet?

97
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,024
Wait for me!

98
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,566
Final answer!

99
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:53,021
Excuse me.
Hi, we're checking in.

100
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,973
Welcome to the Yacht House Inn,
where your vacation is shipshape.

101
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:02,067
- How may I help you?
- Reservation under ZBZ, CRU Chapter.

102
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,853
Two rooms for the week. Enjoy.
I said: "Final answer!"

103
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:14,153
I think there's been a mistake.
We have five rooms reserved.

104
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,102
No you don't.

105
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:24,869
We'll take three more rooms, please.
And you can put it on the card.

106
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:28,974
We're sold out, suge. I don't know
if you've heard, but it's spring break.

107
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,054
Connie?

108
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:40,277
We'd like some ice in my room,
please, and a few extra towels.

109
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,397
Rebecca, you're here.

110
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:48,632
- And so are you, finally.
- How did you beat us?

111
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:51,824
We took her father's jet
and it was awesome!

112
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:55,540
And Daddy's travel staff booked us
this huge suite.

113
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,586
You should come up to our floor later.

114
00:06:58,406 --> 00:06:59,463
Wait up.

115
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:04,003
There's been a minor snafu
with our reservation.

116
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,999
Would you and the pledges be willing to

117
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:08,462
share your rooms with us sisters?

118
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,777
After all, nobody wanna
sleep on the floor.

119
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:16,575
Actually we're going to use this week
to bond as a pledge class.

120
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:19,274
Having sisters in the room
would change the dynamic, so...

121
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,577
No problem, little sis.

122
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,629
Who plans on sleeping anyway?

123
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,773
Check out this dingy motel.
This is even dingier than I imagined.

124
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,518
- Was that a...?
- It was a car backfiring, probably.

125
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:45,649
Whoever wants to hit downtown,
we're leaving <i>ahora</i>!

126
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:49,665
Isn't this place great?
Only $199 a night!

127
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,144
Has anyone seen my bag?

128
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:10,065
Coming through!

129
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:12,606
Watch the outfit!

130
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,881
That's a brand-new flip...

131
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:19,922
- ... flop.
- Sorry.

132
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,755
I've got these giant clown feet
that aren't always under my control.

133
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:26,674
Giant feet.

134
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,612
How about let my flip flop
make it up to yours.

135
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,373
- How did you... do that?
- It's my secret weapon.

136
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,066
Double-fisting tonight, huh?

137
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:47,946
Just single-fisting.
I mean, I'm single.

138
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,290
Just an FYI.

139
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,742
I hope to see you around.

140
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,791
You will.

141
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,174
Where have you been?
That beer run was more of a marathon.

142
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:10,214
I just met the man I'm going to molest.

143
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:12,317
He is crazy gorgeous

144
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,094
super generous.
He opened our beers with his shoe.

145
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,170
What's up?

146
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:22,071
So who is he? Where's he from?

147
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:25,245
No clue! That is the great thing
about spring break!

148
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,448
All new boys to play with.

149
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:30,185
Please tell me
it's not the guy in the doo-rag.

150
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:32,842
I know how you love men
with accessories.

151
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:39,139
Where the hell is he?

152
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,509
I'm sure he's around here somewhere.

153
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,030
He's like Bigfoot.

154
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,107
He's the Hot Ness Monster.

155
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:54,089
This is a party!
It's great, huh?

156
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:57,452
It's like an Omega Chi party,
only with less clothes.

157
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:01,628
And that, my friend,
that is the beauty of spring break.

158
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:24,015
Some pretty chilly body language.

159
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:28,355
I think I'm ready
for a new conversation.

160
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,198
- Happy spring break, Evs.
- Right back at ya, Frannie.

161
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:43,828
Keep moving.
Nothing to see here.

162
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,084
- Wishing you'd taken the jet?
- Miss Beaver moon a state trooper?

163
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:56,483
Never. Our spring break pilgrimage
is a sacred tradition.

164
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:59,905
If you want a ride home,
the skies are very friendly.

165
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,680
Miss Logan, you're putting my tray table
in its upright position.

166
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:12,674
- Let's go for a walk on the beach.
- But I was gonna meet the boys out.

167
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:16,052
We're gonna go to a bar
with all-you-can-drink beer for $5.

168
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:18,904
- You spent all day with 'em on the bus.
- It's happy hour.

169
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:21,349
- You should come with us.
- Look around.

170
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:25,238
We've got you, me, the moon, sand, surf.

171
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:26,896
Pretty romantic, huh?

172
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,649
Spring break's for being rowdy,
not romantic.

173
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:32,128
Our romance is often rowdy.

174
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,905
I guess I can take a little stroll.

175
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,196
Great!

176
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:38,908
I'll grab my jacket.

177
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,860
I'll grab a beer.

178
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:49,109
- If it isn't President Cartwright.
- Actually, it isn't.

179
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:51,684
Tonight I'm just
Spring Break Cartwright.

180
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:53,754
With patented dual beer grip.

181
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:57,333
- A gift.
- Thank you. I love gifts.

182
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:00,096
Enjoy. I've got to get going.
We're playing Thumper.

183
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,882
A drinking game?
With your gag reflex?

184
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:05,684
It's on my spring break list.

185
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,384
Blast from the past.

186
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:11,900
- You gonna pierce your belly button?
- Once was enough, thank you.

187
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:14,652
I'm just tackling
some unfinished business.

188
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:15,984
Like Thumper.

189
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:19,074
- You in?
- You might wanna find an easier target.

190
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:23,351
- Is anyone easier than you?
- How I would love to prove you wrong,

191
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:25,455
but I promised a walk on the beach.

192
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:28,853
Very romantic.

193
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,615
- Am I interrupting something?
- Not at all.

194
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:38,202
Enjoy your walk.

195
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:47,076
Maybe we can spend two hours.

196
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:50,100
- Think of how far we've come.
- I just want to dance it out.

197
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,066
- I need to see Ids.
- What? I'm a really good dancer.

198
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,884
Get ready.

199
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,786
Chad Stewart?
The musician?

200
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:09,499
Isn't that you?

201
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:14,918
We can say that guy stole your ID.
We'll totally back you up.

202
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,841
What are the odds?
I can't go in now.

203
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:20,218
We'll just go somewhere else.

204
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:21,881
It's OK.

205
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:25,411
I'm gonna go back to the motel.
I'll rest up for tomorrow night,

206
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:27,392
I'm gonna go bananas!

207
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:31,157
Ids, please.

208
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:39,028
Look at that line.

209
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,323
There's no way
we're waiting in this line.

210
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:55,179
So we are looking
for someone to buy drinks for.

211
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,744
Blueberry barnacle
with a vita-boost, please. Thank you.

212
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:28,956
I don't know what I was thinking.
That was at least 50 yards or something.

213
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:31,039
This shirt does not work.

214
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:35,668
- Sorry I missed you last night.
- Did you and the pledges get rowdy?

215
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,899
- You OK?
- Just a little asthma flair-up.

216
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,067
- If you need anything, let me know.
- Will do.

217
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:48,890
Healthy.

218
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:56,879
Cheers.

219
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,520
<i>Are you in Myrtle?
Are you having fun?</i>

220
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,685
Things are fine.
I'm just sitting on the beach.

221
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,639
Just relaxing
from a full night of partying.

222
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,448
<i>Are you using your inhaler?</i>

223
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,731
You're so using your inhaler.
Liar.

224
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,801
I'm using my inhaler.

225
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,011
I meant about you having fun.

226
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,050
I just kind of expected this to be
kinda the most amazing time of my life.

227
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,040
It's the New Year's Eve Syndrome.

228
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,562
It can't always live up to the hype.
I blame the media.

229
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,089
I've been up since 4am,

230
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,483
when the rest of the pledges got home
from that club that I couldn't get into

231
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,443
because of stupid Chad Stewart.

232
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:45,316
- Who's Chad Stewart?
- I have no clothes.

233
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,359
I have no travel guide.

234
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,826
And, for some reason,
my stupid asthma's back.

235
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:52,632
But the worst should be behind me, huh?

236
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,457
Are you wearing sun block?

237
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:07,510
Any spottings?

238
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:11,182
The Hot Ness Monster
is an elusive beast.

239
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,116
What do you think, Mandi.
Over there?

240
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,605
Prime real estate.

241
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,408
That'll do, thank you.

242
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,378
Tropical Storm Rebecca.

243
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:40,460
I slept in the bathtub because of her,
and now she's ruining our boy view.

244
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:43,393
Why can't she get over it?

245
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:46,322
Have you ever considered
she might be threatened by you?

246
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,612
Why? She's the senator's daughter
with the invisible jet.

247
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:53,094
Because you're Zeta Beta president.
You're beautiful.

248
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:54,455
Go on.

249
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:57,137
You're the ex-girlfriend
to a certain Cappie,

250
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,806
with whom you looked
pretty chummy last night.

251
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,150
<i>In about five minutes,
we start the sand castle contest.</i>

252
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:07,056
<i>Winners get free drinks at Club Paradox!</i>

253
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:11,945
- Whatever.
- Cappie and I are finally friends.

254
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:13,850
Truly. I'm over him.

255
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,554
Just like I'm over drama, remember?

256
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:20,449
Which means I'm not gonna let
this beached whale get me depressed.

257
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:23,793
- Let's go build a sand castle!
- I don't want to get my bikini wet.

258
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:27,507
- Display purposes.
- Entering a contest is on my list.

259
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,073
You seem to not be enjoying
the parade of possibility.

260
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:39,569
It's not really my kind of parade,
you know?

261
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:46,455
We could go to the gay bar around here.
They have cages.

262
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:49,549
That was a lot of information.

263
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,464
When Casey and I came down here

264
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:54,070
our sophomore year,
she wanted to go...

265
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:57,759
She heard they had cages
you could dance in. So we went.

266
00:17:57,888 --> 00:18:00,401
Thanks for the offer,
but I'm not looking for a guy.

267
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:02,450
I miss the one I already have.

268
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,360
You remember when you're so excited

269
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,796
about someone you want to spend
every moment with them

270
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:09,661
to make up for the time
you're not together.

271
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:14,793
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

272
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:24,007
- You up for some volleyball?
- Absolutely.

273
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,739
What do you think?
It'll be fun.

274
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:30,009
- I don't know.
- Well, my friend thinks you're cute.

275
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,865
- You go. Have fun.
- Are you sure?

276
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,165
Go on.

277
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,469
You're sure you have to go?

278
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:59,682
Honestly, I totally forgot
that I have this project due

279
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:03,818
or my polymeric materials class.
It's due on the Monday we get back.

280
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:07,886
Damn the competive world
of polymer science.

281
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,485
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You can't win 'em all.

282
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:15,590
Travel safe, Spitter.
I got you a little gift for the road.

283
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:17,617
I'll see you next week.

284
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:30,860
No way.

285
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:45,538
- This is she.
- <i>I'm calling from The Washington Post.</i>

286
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,188
I don't need a subscription.

287
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:01,288
I'm in college.
I have no need for a newspaper.

288
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,692
<i>Actually, this isn't
about a subscription.</i>

289
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:07,208
<i>A matter we'd like to talk to you
about if you have a couple moments.</i>

290
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:14,459
Isn't this fun?

291
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,247
I haven't built a sand castle
since I was 12.

292
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:20,957
Back when my biggest burden
was having to play with Rusty.

293
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,778
I just wish there wasn't all this sand.

294
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:26,561
It lingers in places long
after you leave the beach.

295
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:38,607
I think the Hot Ness Monster
has breeched the surface.

296
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,742
Go get him!

297
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:46,664
I got it!

298
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:50,644
Sorry about that.

299
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:54,773
- Can I give you a hand?
- Actually, I could use a torso.

300
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:57,822
Lucky for you,
I'm well-versed in torsos.

301
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:01,762
You sure you have time? Rebecca's
not planning another walk on the beach?

302
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:03,716
I've got all the time in the world.

303
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:06,659
As long as we're done by five.
She booked us a banana boat ride.

304
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,545
A banana boat? You?

305
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:11,725
I'm man enough to ride
a giant yellow phallus.

306
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,726
Besides, it's her first spring break.

307
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:17,111
I vaguely remember you riding one
your freshman year.

308
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:20,108
It was the first thing
I crossed off my list.

309
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,277
I guess it's the circle of life.

310
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,827
It's really good to see you so...

311
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:29,531
... relaxed.
You're like your old self again.

312
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:44,044
But your mermaid is in dire need
of a breast augmentation.

313
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,796
I'll be right back.

314
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:07,278
Wait up.

315
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,700
- Where are you headed?
- Back to my room.

316
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,212
- Thought I'd take a nap.
- Want some company?

317
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,435
Go, have fun.

318
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,277
Are you OK?

319
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:25,953
Why wouldn't I be?

320
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:58,847
Excuse me.

321
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,939
Folks, just got off with dispatch.

322
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,852
We should have another bus
to take us back in about six hours.

323
00:23:23,855 --> 00:23:25,165
Thanks very much.

324
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:31,550
- Where are you going?
- Gotta be a town up ahead.

325
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,899
I was gonna head over and find a car.

326
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:39,462
Can I go with you?

327
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:41,341
Suit yourself.

328
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:07,540
I think we need another round.

329
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:10,723
- I'll go get them.
- Let us contribute something.

330
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,474
What are you gonna contribute?

331
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,671
Thank you for your contribution.

332
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:24,274
You're welcome.

333
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:25,841
I'll get the drinks.

334
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:37,628
- What's up?
- This place is wild!

335
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:39,761
Look how packed it is.

336
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:42,733
I bet you've met a majority
of the female population.

337
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,570
You wanna come hang out with us?

338
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:49,855
You go have fun.

339
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:06,655
I need to rent a car, please.
Just one-way to Cyprus, Ohio.

340
00:25:06,777 --> 00:25:09,969
I need to see your driver's license
and a major credit card.

341
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:14,793
When did you get your own credit card?

342
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:19,187
I'm sorry.
You gotta be at least 21 years of age

343
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,730
to rent an automobile
in the state of North Carolina.

344
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:23,899
I can die for my country
but I can't rent a car?

345
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,120
I've heard that one before.
I'm sorry, the law's the law.

346
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:30,856
I'll get it.

347
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,054
And this is faker than my hair color.

348
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:43,983
There's no way on God's green earth
that you're 24.

349
00:25:44,384 --> 00:25:45,548
I am.

350
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:50,735
My name is Chad Stewart.

351
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,505
I live at 2343 Homer Terrace.

352
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:55,890
- What color are your eyes?
- What color?

353
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:57,572
That's what I thought.

354
00:25:58,353 --> 00:26:02,221
- I'm gonna need to confiscate this.
- Take it. It's cursed or something.

355
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:05,941
When did you get a fake ID?

356
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:14,188
- We shouldn't have left the bus.
- This isn't my fault.

357
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,743
I didn't invite you to join me.

358
00:26:15,886 --> 00:26:18,363
I didn't want to let you walk off
in the dark alone.

359
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:21,249
I feel so much safer
now that you're here.

360
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:26,421
You're on your own.
I'm gonna get my own ride home.

361
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:29,752
Just how I wanted it.

362
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:52,853
Your target is about six-foot-two,
brown hair, dreamy eyes.

363
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,491
And he's got a bottle opener
in his flip-flop.

364
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:59,496
- Could you be a little more specific?
- Check your phones.

365
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,716
Yesterday, I got close but was thwarted
by a rogue football game.

366
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:05,209
Luckily, I was close enough
to snap a cell phone pic.

367
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:06,961
I've texted it to each of you.

368
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:09,938
This is just a blob.

369
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:13,203
A hot blob, and we must find him.

370
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:15,219
But be warned, he's elusive.

371
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:18,884
So if you spot him, pin him down
and text me immediately.

372
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,354
- Are you sure...?
- There's no time!

373
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:33,566
Have you seen this blob?

374
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:36,592
Maybe it's hanging out
with Rebecca somewhere.

375
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:38,735
- Birds of a feather...
- I can't find her.

376
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:41,410
- She missed the banana boat.
- I wouldn't worry too much.

377
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,997
Rebecca's a big girl.

378
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:55,603
<i>It's time for the event
you've all been waiting for.</i>

379
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,062
<i>Let's hear it for our spring break</i>

380
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:00,709
<i>wet T- shirt contestants!</i>

381
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,010
I might be able to take a break
for a sec. Recharge.

382
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,525
We want boobs!

383
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:29,495
No, you don't!

384
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:31,378
What the hell are you doing?

385
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:33,881
I'm gettin'rowdy!

386
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,120
- Get down from there.
- Set those glorious mounds free!

387
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:41,959
Mounds? Really?

388
00:28:43,543 --> 00:28:45,702
Fine. Almond Joys!

389
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:49,780
You need to get down.
Get down from there.

390
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,630
- You're making a scene.
- Big sis is pissed.

391
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,481
You gonna tell my parents?

392
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,579
News flash: what I do on spring break
is none of your business.

393
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:04,536
- It is when you're wearing ZBZ letters.
- Fine, I'll take them off.

394
00:29:06,316 --> 00:29:08,237
Let me get my camera first.

395
00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:13,629
You're seriously doing this?
This is really beneath you.

396
00:29:13,994 --> 00:29:15,007
Beneath me?

397
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:18,818
- You know what's beneath me?
- Don't do this.

398
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:21,551
- Not right now, please.
- You're beneath me.

399
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:23,180
Whenever you're ready.

400
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,349
You can't even get
over your ex-girlfriend.

401
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,425
- Don't bring me into this.
- You've always been in this.

402
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:29,813
And you always will be.

403
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:32,784
Maybe you should get up there, too.

404
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:38,561
My only regret:
wasting the last four months on you.

405
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:43,083
Stop acting like a spoiled daddy's girl
who didn't get her way.

406
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,653
- It's a cliché.
- You know what?

407
00:29:46,276 --> 00:29:48,870
We're done.
Consider this our spring breakup.

408
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:53,294
Don't go!

409
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:58,841
You chased the boobs away!

410
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:04,439
Are you OK?

411
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,710
- Man, where have you been?
- What? I made some new friends.

412
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:19,835
Friends? As in plural?

413
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:22,272
You guys, Chambers is on a roll!

414
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:25,709
All right, settle down.
What's going on?

415
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,693
You guys going to the condo?

416
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:30,735
What are you, my grandpa?
We're going to Paradox.

417
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:35,611
There's no way
I'm going back to that club tonight.

418
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:39,386
- Wanna raid the vending machine?
- Sounds so good. Let's go.

419
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:50,846
I'm sorry you had to drive all this way.

420
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:55,232
You can take us
to the nearest bus station if you want.

421
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,703
I'll drive you guys back to Cyprus.
No big deal.

422
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,220
What about the hunting trip
with your parents?

423
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,296
My mom's been hitting the firing range

424
00:31:02,437 --> 00:31:04,617
pretty hard, has developed quite an ego.

425
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,526
Do you wanna tell
your side of the story first?

426
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:17,037
Not really. We've got four more hours
to go, It's been a long day.

427
00:31:17,157 --> 00:31:19,087
- Let's get back to school.
- All right.

428
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:23,383
Anybody hungry?
I got some turkey jerky in the trunk.

429
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:24,901
I'm starving.

430
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:27,239
Did you kill it?

431
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:28,864
Does it matter?

432
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:37,940
You wanna jump out
and find that jerky bag?

433
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:39,083
Trunk food.

434
00:31:51,614 --> 00:31:53,420
I don't see anything back here.

435
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,106
It's back there.

436
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,513
Would you go help him?

437
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:10,031
There's really nothing back here.

438
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:16,728
I'm not letting either one of you jokers
back in until you work out your issues.

439
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:24,992
You feeling better?

440
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,359
Feels like my brain is taking
clogging lessons.

441
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,472
I was worried about you.
You got hit hard.

442
00:32:29,592 --> 00:32:31,493
And then the drunk guy punched me.

443
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:35,646
- Do you have any idea why she...?
- Can we not talk about Rebecca?

444
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:38,199
Please It was awkward
enough before all this.

445
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,001
You know what, you're right.

446
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:41,849
We're on spring break!

447
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:47,609
We get to spend an entire week
on the beach with our best friends.

448
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:51,903
- There's only one more of these...
- One more? Speak for yourself.

449
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:55,420
And they kick us out into
the harsh reality of 40-hour work weeks.

450
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,800
Forty hours? Wake up,
Mary Tyler Moore. Try 80.

451
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:01,481
In cubicles.
With two weeks vacation.

452
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:04,192
By the way,
did I tell you I'm switching my major?

453
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:07,483
Anatomy was fun
but less hands-on than I expected.

454
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:11,775
I'm sorry, Cap.

455
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:14,870
About what?
The fact that I don't have a "plan"?

456
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,929
About the fact that I judged you for it.

457
00:33:19,234 --> 00:33:20,284
I was wrong.

458
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:27,753
- What has gotten into you?
- What do you mean?

459
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:31,485
You're so nice and carefree
and beach-babe beautiful.

460
00:33:31,624 --> 00:33:33,472
I feel like I'm in a tampon commercial.

461
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,244
That's because in four days
I have to go back to school

462
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:38,644
figure out what I wanna do
with the rest of my life.

463
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:41,438
What about that ten-year plan?

464
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:44,479
Let's just say I copied off
of someone's else's paper.

465
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:47,547
And now I don't know
what I'll be doing in ten minutes.

466
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:50,957
I'm staring out into the...

467
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,792
vast empty ocean

468
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,179
that is my future.

469
00:33:59,226 --> 00:34:00,735
Feels good, doesn't it?

470
00:34:01,355 --> 00:34:02,355
It does.

471
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:04,772
And it feels...

472
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:06,763
... terrifying.

473
00:34:34,983 --> 00:34:36,851
Please unlock the doors.

474
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:40,414
No can do, buddy.
Not until you two make amends.

475
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,904
Look either turn off the music
or leave us out here to die.

476
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:52,100
The scary thing is I actually knew
the words to that song.

477
00:34:57,279 --> 00:35:00,267
I just wished you would have at least
called after the prank war thing.

478
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:03,734
Do you want to know why I didn't?
Because I was mad.

479
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:05,861
You made me feel like the bad guy

480
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,608
because I chose to stay with OC
and the friends I have there.

481
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,430
Like Evan Chambers?

482
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,900
When I was outed
and was gonna quit the fraternity,

483
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,948
Evan asked me to trust him and I did.

484
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,160
- He hasn't let me down yet.
- Well, what about me?

485
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:21,896
I was the first person
that you came out to, remember?

486
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:23,367
Doesn't that count?

487
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:27,351
It does, but you're demonizing
a fraternity full of people I like...

488
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:29,995
It's hard to have a rational
point-of-view of people

489
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:32,536
when they're duct-taping you
to the side of a building.

490
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:34,031
What about your fraternity?

491
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:38,054
The Kts are such good guys because
they're laid back and aren't ambitious?

492
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:40,644
When did ambition become
such a terrible attribute?

493
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,414
I think in the eighties.

494
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:45,353
You know, maybe they're right.

495
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:48,190
Maybe you just can't have friends
who are in rival houses.

496
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:53,452
This is the officially the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

497
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,468
If your stupid houses are so important,

498
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:59,014
why are both of you here now
instead of down at Sinner's Beach?

499
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,662
You've gotta stop putting your houses
before everything else in your life.

500
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,605
Before your schoolwork,
before your roommate

501
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,342
and before each other.

502
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:09,412
Think you can do that?

503
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:16,468
We can agree we were both wrong.

504
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:19,942
I'd say there was plenty of fault
on both sides.

505
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:21,888
I'm sorry.

506
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:28,962
Sunburn.

507
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,541
The Three Musketeers are back!

508
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,984
Take me home!

509
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:40,956
I'm Betsy!

510
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:43,660
You sure are.
Loud and proud.

511
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,167
I'm so glad that we're sisters!

512
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:50,119
We really need to get you a boyfriend
so he can manage these moments.

513
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,673
You're so soft!

514
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:55,115
He's here. I smell him.

515
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:57,585
No, that might have been my chili dog.

516
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,597
I'm gonna come right back here
and be disgusted by that comment.

517
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:04,105
But right now I need to run
find someone.

518
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:07,726
So here, meet my friend,
Mr. Lifeguard Stand.

519
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:11,242
I liked you on Baywatch.

520
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,069
Here we are.
Back at the hotel.

521
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:08,925
- You think you might wanna...?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

522
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:11,076
You've suffered head trauma. Besides,

523
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:13,144
there are ten people
sleeping in my room.

524
00:38:13,513 --> 00:38:15,863
I was going to say get some breakfast.

525
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:19,376
That sounds nice.

526
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:20,806
Let me go get my purse.

527
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:24,829
<i>Ohio senator Ken Logan, known for
his strong stance on family values,</i>

528
00:38:25,256 --> 00:38:29,029
<i>has been implicated in a sweep
of a high-end prostitution ring.</i>

529
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:32,479
<i>As the nation reacts to the scandal,
we'll have all the latest...</i>

530
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:38,059
Go.

531
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:41,016
She needs you.

532
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:43,721
About tonight...

533
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:45,759
It was nothing.

534
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:49,140
"Kissing a boy on the beach"
was 11 on my list.

535
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,072
Thanks for the help.

536
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:15,598
I'm starting to feel human again.

537
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:19,476
Processed food will do that
for some reason.

538
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:25,635
I kinda feel like you've been blowing me
off the past couple of days.

539
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:29,236
Not at all.
You had a lot of things you need to...

540
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:33,058
... do this weekend.

541
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:35,095
You pushed me to be

542
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:38,236
more assertive,
and go after what I want.

543
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:43,133
Sorry things didn't work out
with you and Casey...

544
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:44,253
I'm not.

545
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:53,369
I'm...

546
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:58,743
... not looking to be another notch

547
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:01,135
in the Myrtle Beach belt.

548
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:03,646
Warm body rule applies even here.

549
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:06,089
I've had plenty of warm bodies.

550
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,040
Million-dollar question:

551
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:20,272
Are you doing this because...

552
00:40:21,227 --> 00:40:22,887
... you want to be with me

553
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,800
or because you wanna get back at Casey?

554
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:28,939
Both.

555
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:32,526
Million-dollar question:

556
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:35,226
Are you going to do this
because you want to be with me

557
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:38,271
or because you want to be
with Evan Chambers?

558
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:42,111
Both.

559
00:40:58,578 --> 00:41:00,041
It doesn't matter now.

560
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:02,794
I heard about your dad.

561
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:05,657
They didn't even call me.

562
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:08,324
I found out from a reporter.

563
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,175
What a night.

564
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:30,406
You can say that again.

565
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,113
Care to explain the flip flop?

566
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:37,366
It's proof
that the Hot Ness Monster does exist.

567
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:40,654
And it gives me hope
that I might see him again.

568
00:41:40,774 --> 00:41:42,624
He made quite an impression.

569
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:46,476
Do you think it's possible
to meet someone

570
00:41:46,596 --> 00:41:49,814
and just feel they're your soulmate?

571
00:41:54,865 --> 00:41:57,609
But I have to believe
that we have many soulmates.

572
00:41:57,729 --> 00:41:59,486
If not, the world has

573
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,840
a twisted sense of humor, right?

574
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,758
What happened tonight?

575
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:09,827
I was on a search mission
for your monster when I ran into...

576
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:15,176
You know what, no.
I'm not gonna tell this story.

577
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:19,084
You've heard it a million times anyway.

578
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:22,815
- But it sounds important.
- What's important is...

579
00:42:23,728 --> 00:42:25,756
I'm watching a beautiful sunrise

580
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,109
with my best friend.

581
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:33,753
No matter what,
we'll remember this moment forever.

582
00:42:38,229 --> 00:42:41,179
You know what would make it
even more memorable?

583
00:42:41,597 --> 00:42:42,886
If we were naked.

584
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:46,270
Didn't see that coming.

585
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:50,409
It's the only thing left on my spring
break list. Skinny dipping.

586
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:51,688
Wanna?

587
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,863
- Please.
- Let's do it.

588
00:43:07,274 --> 00:43:08,706
Dude, naked chicks!

589
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:11,545
You thinking what I'm thinking?
