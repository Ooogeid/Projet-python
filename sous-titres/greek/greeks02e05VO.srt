1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,922
- <i>Previously...</i>
- This is my money, my freedom.

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,800
- I'll be able to do whatever I want.
- It's an incentive trust.

3
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:09,220
My girlfriend's dead. She discovered
this tiny lump on her neck.

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:10,532
Still tough.

5
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:13,808
And I guess that's why I haven't really
gone out with anyone

6
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:17,228
- since she died.
- It's my credit card bill!

7
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:19,105
- Thirteen hundred?
- Dollars?

8
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:20,482
I have to get a job.

9
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:23,610
You can start your first
exciting campus tour next week.

10
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:26,529
We're sisters forever, Frannie.
Just no longer friends.

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,741
Casey has a warped sense
of sibling relationships.

12
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:33,161
I've done nothing but support her,
advise her constantly,

13
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:36,832
- this is the thanks I get.
- Maybe you should stop being so nice.

14
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:39,578
- Just get back in the game.
- Well, maybe you're right.

15
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:44,464
Welcome to the majestic
and historic Cyprus-Rhodes University.

16
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:48,952
To our right you'll notice Dressel Hall,
which was named for Daniel Dressel,

17
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:51,638
the scientist celebrated
for inventing...

18
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,359
- For inventing...
- I can't stand the suspense.

19
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:58,795
Our campus is huge!

20
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,865
And historical. It sucks.

21
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:04,504
I have two days to memorize
this entire book before my first tour.

22
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:07,051
- An entire book!
- Just relax.

23
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:09,643
And think about how,
one day soon, you'll be able to...

24
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:10,944
shop again.

25
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,032
If I'll still remember how.

26
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:15,214
I know this building.

27
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,315
Coming up on our left
is the Cutler Planetarium,

28
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,763
the site
of Casey Cartwright's first kiss

29
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,301
with Max,

30
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:27,922
Somebody,
the celebrated polymer science major.

31
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,386
Our first date's tonight.

32
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,808
I'm nervous.
I haven't dated somebody so...

33
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,437
Tragic?
Tragic is hot.

34
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,531
Russell Crowe in <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>.

35
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:39,935
You can be all Jennifer Connelly
and save him from the brink.

36
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,565
We're keeping tonight low-key.
No psychotic breaks, just dinner.

37
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:47,072
- A Beautiful Meal.
- And maybe Dobler's after.

38
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:50,471
You really like him.
You can't stop smiling.

39
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:51,998
It's like your face is broken.

40
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:54,576
Max and I haven't even gone
on an official date.

41
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,933
But the other night
was so cosmically incredible.

42
00:01:58,656 --> 00:02:00,582
Like Cappie or Evan incredible?

43
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:03,673
Kind of. Except with Evan
it was all about the Greek system

44
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:06,331
and with Cappie it was all about...

45
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:07,464
pie.

46
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,345
Max is smart.
And soulful and wounded.

47
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,637
He's swimming in the deep end of life
while I've been in the kiddy pool.

48
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,638
I think I'm ready to join him.

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,559
After all, there's more to life
than the Greek system and pie, right?

50
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:24,355
Pie!

51
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,813
Gotcha.

52
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,976
And on our right you'll notice Frannie
has parked in your presidential spot.

53
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:38,041
Look who's back from the Vineyard.

54
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:40,497
He never took me there. Jerk.

55
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,355
Someone peed in your kiddy pool.

56
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:47,998
It's a beautiful day.
We'll park down the street.

57
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:50,055
You can practice walking backwards.

58
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:54,741
Have fun in the deep end.
You know I can't swim!

59
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:05,118
Horseshoes are a real backbreaker.

60
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:07,286
He couldn't bear
to have them cleaned here?

61
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,710
- You're welcome.
- Wade, I have your rocks.

62
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:12,462
Pack 'em how I like it.

63
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,296
And what does he need
with the fireworks, anyway?

64
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,480
Fourth of July's four months away.

65
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:21,700
Real question is, why are we
the only ones doing this crap?

66
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:23,373
Nachos!

67
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:30,088
Thanks, Spitter.
You're the breast.

68
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,590
I mean, best.
Good one, Beav.

69
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:36,231
I know Pickle screens his calls
to avoid chores.

70
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:38,716
He only answers if I call
from an unknown number.

71
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:42,183
And Gonzo, that guy's lazier
than Paris Hilton's left eye.

72
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:43,875
I haven't seen him at the house.

73
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:47,272
If I pick up their slack one more time
I'm gonna go postal on their asses.

74
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:53,360
What are you trying to do to me here?
That's cilantro on my'chos.

75
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:56,905
- Are you allergic or something?
- I don't like vegetables.

76
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,574
Cilantro's an herb.

77
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:01,781
Which doesn't belong on nachos.

78
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:03,872
Go get new ones. Quickly.

79
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:05,540
Sans herbs.

80
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,019
I say before tonight's pledge meeting,

81
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,755
give everybody a kick in the ass.
Kind of redistribute the load.

82
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:14,993
It's mail call.

83
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:18,359
My pledge brothers are
about to receive my package.

84
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:24,695
Greek 2x05
Pledges Allegiance

85
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:26,895
¤Akazab¤, Benj!, Kasius.

86
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:28,804
seriessub.com
sub-way.fr

87
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:37,732
- So, this is Dobler's.
- What was that?

88
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:41,792
I guess it's pretty loud in here.
What did you think of the restaurant?

89
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:43,590
It was good, it was good.

90
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,915
I've never had Korean barbeque before.

91
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,492
It really should be cheaper,
since we cooked the food ourselves.

92
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:00,308
Never mind.

93
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,645
- Are you not having fun?
- I was gonna say, it...

94
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,648
I haven't been on a date
since Sarah died.

95
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:15,559
Didn't realize it would be weird. Sorry.

96
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,679
It's fine, Max.

97
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:18,655
Do you want to talk about her?

98
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:20,787
I don't know.

99
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,160
A first date conversation about my dead
girlfriend might be a little heavy.

100
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:26,615
Heavy? I love heavy.

101
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,000
- She grew up in Illinois.
- Just like me.

102
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,337
- What was her major?
- Philosophy.

103
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,339
That's so interesting.

104
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,465
It's not like she wanted
to be a philosopher.

105
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,590
She always knew
she wanted to help people.

106
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,027
By studying how various cultures
fundamentally differed in how they live

107
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,849
then she'd be able to interact
more efficiently with them.

108
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:51,279
She wanted to join the Peace Corps
and just travel the world

109
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:53,648
doing whatever she could
to make it a better place.

110
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:55,607
She was kind of a Buddhist that way.

111
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,582
That's great.

112
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:04,222
- That felt pretty good.
- See? Not too heavy at all.

113
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:05,729
Light.

114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,165
If Sarah were here, she'd say, " Stop
talking about me, talk to your date."

115
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:16,045
Tell me, Casey, what's...
What's on your mind?

116
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,560
Well, actually, this girl, Frannie,
she stole my parking spot at the house.

117
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,380
She and I have this whole...

118
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,890
You know what? Never mind.
It's so not important.

119
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:32,800
Should we get drinks or something?
Are you thirsty?

120
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,438
Because I am dying!

121
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,985
I meant to say I'm dying of thirst.

122
00:06:39,397 --> 00:06:40,402
Got it.

123
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:43,398
I'll get us a couple of beers.

124
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,064
This is the nicest restaurant in town.

125
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:04,177
- Evan's treating. He insisted.
- Really? Why?

126
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:06,405
We haven't talked
since he sold his soul.

127
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,519
- I'm assuming they pay well.
- Hi. Chambers?

128
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,246
Couldn't we have had dinner
someplace normal?

129
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,033
Maybe for Evan this is normal.

130
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:18,135
I was beginning to think you guys
ditched us for a better offer.

131
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:21,018
Well, we were meeting Donatella
in Barcelona for tapas,

132
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:22,820
but she had a case of the vapors.

133
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,503
It's my fault. I'm desperately trying
to finish my dissertation.

134
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,779
I just have to dot some I's
and cross some T's

135
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:33,705
and then I'm officially overeducated
and underemployed.

136
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:35,838
Is it too early to toast
to your accomplishment?

137
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,087
It's never too early to toast.
You want to do the honors?

138
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:45,122
So, Frannie, how was Martha's Vineyard?

139
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:46,432
Gorgeous.

140
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:48,506
The house was indescribable

141
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:50,799
and the staff were so warm
and welcoming.

142
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,434
- So, Michael, after the dissertation?
- The job hunt begins.

143
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:57,229
Just getting an interview
for a professorship is impossible.

144
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,517
- It'll be tough.
- Who's tougher than you?

145
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:02,599
Evan said the B-minus you gave him
was the lowest grade he's ever gotten.

146
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:05,135
And O'Toole's failing your class
for the third time.

147
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:07,489
Tough's got nothing to do
with actually getting the job.

148
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:10,993
- A lot of it's who you know.
- Have you decided on a wine?

149
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,703
Just pick something reasonable.

150
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,084
You, the French expert, what's the wine
you'd order if money was no object?

151
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,838
The'92 Montrachet.

152
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,490
Excellent choice, sir.

153
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,943
I'm really excited about this wine.

154
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:32,806
I first heard about it when I was
in France my freshman year.

155
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,851
It's supposed to be amazing.

156
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,125
Before Wade and Cappie join us
for our weekly pledge meeting...

157
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,646
Wait a second.
Where's Gonzo?

158
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,736
He had a thing, or something.

159
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,545
And this is my point.

160
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,049
I feel

161
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:52,702
a few of us pledges are being a tad lazy
when it comes to our pledge duty.

162
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,312
Easy, champ, I don't think I like
where this is going.

163
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,740
No, he's right.

164
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:01,614
Today, for instance, we had to get lunch
for Beaver, rocks for Wade,

165
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:03,931
- fireworks for Heath...
- Judas.

166
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:05,910
- Who said that?
- What martyrs.

167
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,783
I had to clean under Ferret's bed.

168
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:10,010
Want to know
what's on all those tissues? No.

169
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,405
I had to wash Jeremy's hair
with scented oils on Tuesday.

170
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:15,015
Smell my hands.

171
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:17,001
- We've all had to do that!
- Judas!

172
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,435
Who keeps saying Judas?

173
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:22,981
- What's all the racket down here?
- Ben and Rusty are all like,

174
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:25,221
"Hey, we do more pledge work
than you do."

175
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:28,832
Everybody else is like, "No way,
man, we totally do more pledge work."

176
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:31,204
I had to mulch the entire front yard.

177
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:32,992
You're coming at us with mulch?

178
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:35,399
- We've all did that.
- You look at me like...

179
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,536
- Quiet!
- I do this for fun.

180
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:39,247
We hear your concerns.

181
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:41,374
Pledge responsibilities are taking
their toll.

182
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,919
You all work very hard

183
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:46,255
and maybe it's time for us
to celebrate that.

184
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,965
Are you thinking Old Folks Home
weekend, Cap?

185
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:52,762
- I am, indeed, Wade.
- Wait. Philanthropy?

186
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,347
No, not philanthropy.

187
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:56,973
- Old Folks Home is a classic.
- Classic.

188
00:09:57,135 --> 00:09:59,355
Every spring, usually about this time,

189
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:02,291
the KT men lock themselves
inside the house

190
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:05,574
and engage in a 24 hour period
of drinking,

191
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:08,875
- TV, card playing.
- Love cards.

192
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,145
Fine meals.

193
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:14,061
- And other fratelicious fun.
- Wouldn't it be better with girls?

194
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:18,330
I admire your libido, but while
all other KT parties are about girls...

195
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,581
Old Folks Home is
about pledge/active bonding.

196
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:22,707
- Bonding.
- And giving you all a sneak peek

197
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:26,212
of what it will be like
when you become actives and move in.

198
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,759
So, all you pre-actives,

199
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:35,373
be here with your sleeping bag
and party stamina tomorrow afternoon.

200
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:39,015
Campout.

201
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:48,899
- Who got dumped?
- Frannie bought a ton of marshmallows,

202
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,458
chocolate and graham crackers.
We're making s'mores in the oven.

203
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:54,334
- Tell Casey your great idea.
- What great idea?

204
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,171
Well, I know how busy you are
as the interim president,

205
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,707
and how hard it must be to also function
as the pledge educator.

206
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,917
Here, let me.

207
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,886
And I'm just afraid that you, or we,
may be losing sight may be losing sight

208
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,379
of one of ZB's most valuable resources,

209
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:09,797
the pledges.

210
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,716
- Here. Let me.
- We smell chocolate!

211
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:15,628
Girls, have some please.

212
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:18,566
Anyway, I thought
I could do my sisterly duty

213
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:20,933
and offer to relieve
your responsibilities.

214
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:25,312
After all, I served as the pledge
educator before I was elected president.

215
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,101
- We think it makes sense.
- You have sort of slacked off

216
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:30,977
- with the pledges this semester.
- Don't you think it would be hard

217
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:34,969
on the pledges, to change leadership
midstream like that?

218
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,165
- I'll survive.
- Couldn't care less.

219
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:39,229
And a good leader delegates.

220
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,715
Thank you.

221
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:48,655
I'd love for you to take
the pledge educator reins.

222
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,731
- That'd be great.
- Thanks, Case.

223
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:52,291
We'll have so much fun.

224
00:11:56,253 --> 00:12:00,048
Built in 1927, the Katherine
Anne Findley Memorial Library

225
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:03,059
houses over 1.5 million volumes of books

226
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,047
and is outfitted
with nearly 50 miles of shelving.

227
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:10,156
- Doesn't that sound kind of braggy?
- No, it's fascinating.

228
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,096
So, my first date with Max
was a bit of a mess.

229
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:17,308
His girlfriend wanted to right
the wrongs of the world,

230
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:20,769
the only injustice I could talk about
was Frannie stealing my parking spot.

231
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,749
Plus, she's pledge educator now?

232
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,004
I'm not gonna let
that little stuff get to me.

233
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,997
If some pledge class participation
makes her happy, then

234
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,057
who am I to deprive my mortal enemy
of that small pleasure in life?

235
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,546
I just want to focus on swimming
in the deep end with Max.

236
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,595
- As long as you're being yourself.
- You know better than that.

237
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,807
You can't truly be yourself
until date nine. It's like this tour.

238
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,684
You lead with bragging
before you reveal

239
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,602
that every Saturday night some
drunk couple has sex in that fountain.

240
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,307
I'd rather know that stuff up front.

241
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:53,755
- So, when's your next date?
- Tonight.

242
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,736
But I thought we'd do something
more meaningful than Dobler's

243
00:12:56,897 --> 00:13:00,032
so I suggested that we go to the drama
club's Shakespeare in the park.

244
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,468
- How romantic.
- Let's hope so.

245
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:08,278
Wait.
Where are we?

246
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:10,987
This can't be good.

247
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:20,296
Pre-active.

248
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:22,995
I do like the sound of that.

249
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:28,778
Whippersnappers, time to get to work.
Pickle, whip up some Jell-O salad.

250
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:31,775
Woodchuck, take this cane and beat
the filth out of the couch cushions.

251
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,401
- Pickle, you're on keg pumping duty.
- Wait, guys.

252
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,734
Do I make the Jell-O salad
before I work the keg?

253
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:39,519
This is a torch.
Find Jeremy for further instructions.

254
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,450
- After the keg? During?
- Pickle, figure it out.

255
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,046
Arrowhead,

256
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:46,890
take these kneepads
and go see Beaver.

257
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:49,771
Disperse!

258
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:57,766
I thought we were getting a preview
of living in the house like an active.

259
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:58,971
So it is.

260
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:01,127
Over the next 24 hours
you and your pledge brothers

261
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:02,553
will watch us be actives,

262
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:05,556
so you know what you have to look
forward to when you're made active.

263
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:08,225
{\Right now,}You're still pledges and pledges
need to know their place.

264
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:10,436
As my very own big brother,
Egyptian Joe,

265
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:12,833
said to me
at our Old Folks Home event,

266
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:15,392
"If you want to live in a democracy,

267
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:18,368
"don't buy store-bought
Rice Krispie treats."

268
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,529
What {\the hell}does that mean?

269
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:22,781
I was a pledge.
It wasn't my place to ask.

270
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,198
These are for you.

271
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:39,964
Human remote,

272
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:42,176
find blood sport on TV.

273
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:43,860
I want to see dudes fight.

274
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,431
Beav, I've been through every channel
four times already. It's not on.

275
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,100
Do you have to use the megaphone?

276
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,631
Hey, watch your Van Damme mouth,
human remote.

277
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,208
Now change the channel!

278
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,283
Leave it on
the Spanish channel for now!

279
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:04,490
- I've got an idea.
- Chesty Spanish beauties. OK.

280
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:08,994
Human remote,
how you holding up?

281
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:10,219
I'm exhausted.

282
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,374
And my eyes are killing me from
standing so close to the television.

283
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:14,788
That's the spirit.

284
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,835
Hey, could you make me
a Chicago-style hot dog?

285
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:25,919
Listen, Spitter,

286
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:29,056
I know you're tired.
I know you're worn down.

287
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:31,815
But there's one thing
that you shouldn't forget.

288
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:34,792
The celery salt
on the Chicago hot dog.

289
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,487
That's what makes it delicious.

290
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:37,874
Pickle, mush.

291
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,207
Spitty, can you bring back
a couple of dogs for me and Waderito?

292
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,335
Spitty? Two.

293
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,805
Hey, Ben, can you help me
with the hot dogs?

294
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,553
It's hot dogs, Cartwright.

295
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,654
I've got a delicate crème brulée
situation here.

296
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:03,711
Not burning myself and the plastic
is damn near impossible.

297
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,065
No, Ben, come help me
with the hot dogs!

298
00:16:07,786 --> 00:16:10,265
Hot dogs. Right. Got it.

299
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:14,184
God, enough.

300
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:15,762
I'm taking it.

301
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,608
Last night didn't bother you at all?

302
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:24,655
I thought the escargot
were a little chewy.

303
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,148
- Is that what you mean?
- The French food, fancy wine.

304
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,478
I didn't even know
Evan liked that kind of stuff.

305
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:33,260
- How much was that wine, anyway?
- Four hundred a bottle.

306
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,149
You guys drank three bottles.

307
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,656
I don't even have a hangover.
It was like, magic wine.

308
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:40,683
Yeah, for 1,200 bucks, it should drive
you home and tuck you into bed.

309
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:43,303
I don't care if you have
Oprah money, that's crazy.

310
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:46,343
Look, if you're concerned
about Evan, don't judge him.

311
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:49,883
Just be there for him
if or when he needs a friend.

312
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:51,951
Can I judge Frannie?

313
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:54,016
If it makes you feel better.

314
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:59,020
Cal, to a person like Evan, 1,200 bucks
is like me taking you to the movies.

315
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,700
I just wish I was the one
who could lavish you

316
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,235
with expensive dinners.

317
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:08,530
I don't mind that you're poor.

318
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,004
I just prefer you to not use
the word "lavish" again.

319
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:13,779
- It's weird.
- Judging.

320
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:15,626
Sorry.

321
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:22,304
Oh, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!

322
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:30,853
You leaving, Case?

323
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,347
This is my spot, Frannie.

324
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:35,287
I {\just}need to unload
some stuff for tonight.

325
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,392
What's tonight?

326
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:38,560
A lock-in with the pledges.

327
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:41,494
- Oh, I didn't know about that.
- Why would you need to?

328
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,774
Presidential approval
isn't required for a lock-in.

329
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,543
Yeah, true.

330
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:47,252
What's all the stuff?

331
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:48,612
Oh, nothing.

332
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:50,948
Arts and crafts, gift bags.

333
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,616
{\Gift bags?}What kind of gift bags?

334
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:55,703
Oh, picture frames, t- shirts,

335
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:58,664
little pads. I'm kind of running late,
Casey, so if you're going...

336
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:01,557
I'm not leaving. I mean,
I'm leaving to go on a date,

337
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:03,210
but my car's staying here.

338
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:04,420
In my spot.

339
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,663
I was just getting a CD
out of my car.

340
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,093
Then why were you pulling out?

341
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,028
The stereo only ejects Cds
if the car's in reverse.

342
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,062
It's better for the environment
that way, I guess. It's a hybrid.

343
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:20,274
Regardless, the car is staying here.

344
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:21,570
Not me.

345
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:27,609
See? I got it.

346
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:38,704
Hajume!

347
00:18:40,932 --> 00:18:42,096
That means, begin.

348
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,272
I don't want
to fight you, Rusty.

349
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,857
I wanted to yesterday when you
were being such a pain in the ass

350
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:12,411
about pledge duties,

351
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:13,947
but not like this,

352
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:15,619
not for them.

353
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,229
It'll all be fine, all right?

354
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,330
Just give Ben Bennett
enough time to get the...

355
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:22,957
Hey, Cap.

356
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,650
Rub this grease all over your body.

357
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,354
It'll make it impossible for Woodchuck
to get you in a choke hold.

358
00:19:28,474 --> 00:19:30,420
Where's Ben Bennett?
He needs to grease up too.

359
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,740
I got five big ones
on him against Stork.

360
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,519
Cap!
I cannot fight Woodchuck.

361
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:37,636
He's too much man. It's scary.

362
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:39,993
Dude, the grease will work.

363
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:43,560
Fire! Everybody out!
We gotta go!

364
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,733
Fire?

365
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,192
Quick, go!

366
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,987
Everybody, quick! Go!

367
00:19:54,147 --> 00:19:55,313
Go, go, go!

368
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,860
Oh, man, that was close.

369
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,147
Thank god we had {\those}the fire alarms.

370
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:09,767
The pledges!

371
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:12,840
Wait, we don't have fire alarms.

372
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:16,176
They're locked inside.

373
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:18,178
They'll be burned alive!

374
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:19,666
Drop and roll!

375
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,326
Beav, there's no fire.

376
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:26,061
Seems we've fallen victim
to a pledge prank.

377
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,770
All that alcohol might've impaired
our judgment. I've read it can do that{\to you}.

378
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,564
- They just mooned us.
- Except for Rusty.

379
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:45,189
He just showed his underpants.

380
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:47,207
A pledge insurgency.

381
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:50,192
- I didn't think they had it in them.
- What do we do now, Cap?

382
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,540
Well, now...

383
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,622
we get back inside that house.

384
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:04,007
To think that Caesar bears
such rebel blood

385
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:08,103
that will be thaw'd
from the true quality...

386
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:15,152
... with that which melteth fools.

387
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,573
So in the world,'tis furnish'd

388
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:23,213
well with men,
and men are flesh and blood...

389
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:27,630
You're late.
And wet.

390
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,958
I'm so sorry.
I walked.

391
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:33,086
So, you're... sweaty?

392
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:34,942
Huh? Oh, no.

393
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:38,300
I cut through the dean's estate
right as his sprinklers turned on.

394
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,586
I wanted to call,
but my phone got water on it.

395
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:42,105
It's broken.

396
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,097
Let me see it.

397
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:46,558
Maybe it's not broken-broken.

398
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:50,361
If you need to make a call,
check with Brutus.

399
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:52,735
He's wearing a Bluetooth headset
for some reason.

400
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:56,276
- Great Caesar!
- Doth not, Brutus,

401
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:58,153
bootless kneel?

402
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:00,431
Speak, hands, for me!

403
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,018
And Caesar is a blonde chick?

404
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:18,215
Sorry, Max, this isn't really
the evening I had planned.

405
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,229
It's OK.

406
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,985
I'm glad you're here now.

407
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:27,933
Et tu, Brute?

408
00:22:38,248 --> 00:22:39,459
That bitch.

409
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:43,073
Caesar?
I don't think it was her fault.

410
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:50,497
Max, I really have to go.

411
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:53,100
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, I just... I have to go.

412
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,537
Hopefully, I'll get a chance
to explain it all to you

413
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:57,004
on our ninth date.

414
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:00,615
I'll call you.

415
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:02,258
OK, bye.

416
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,017
Make sure the basement windows
are locked.

417
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:12,728
We've got to barricade
these doors!

418
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:15,990
Upstairs windows secure.
Just in time.

419
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,251
Hedgehog was shimmying up
the gutter pipe.

420
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:19,866
He's a little bit ninja.

421
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:25,190
Let us in!

422
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:28,289
Ben Bennett, Pickle,
help me push this bookshelf.

423
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,875
Good. Kitchen?

424
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:36,894
Wait, wait, wait.

425
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:39,399
Is the siege over?

426
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:41,270
No way.

427
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:43,216
They're out there, scheming.

428
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:45,108
I can feel it in my bones.

429
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:47,012
Dude, chill, chill, chill.

430
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,100
They're retreating.

431
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,285
They're heading toward town.
Maybe they're going to Dobler's.

432
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:57,041
Yeah, drink off their anger.

433
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:59,561
When they get a nice little buzz
they'll think we're awesome

434
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:01,526
for pulling such a cool prank.

435
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:06,150
What do we do now?

436
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,223
Let's dance it out, man.
Come on.

437
00:24:14,283 --> 00:24:16,250
Hey, shouldn't you
be out with Max?

438
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,156
And what's with the wetness?

439
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:20,374
I know what she's doing.

440
00:24:20,722 --> 00:24:22,464
- Who?
- Frannie McBrutus.

441
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:25,873
The pledge lock-in,
the gift bags, friggin' s'mores.

442
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:28,845
I should've known. She's solidifying
her power base among the freshmen.

443
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:30,756
Frannie can't run
for president again.

444
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:33,809
It's against national rules.
She was officially removed.

445
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:36,603
But that doesn't mean she can't
find someone to run against me.

446
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:40,732
She did invite all the officers
over for the lock-in tonight.

447
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:42,943
You see? She's Karl Rove
with hair extensions.

448
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:45,161
She'll talk someone
into running

449
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:47,459
then use the pledges
to get them elected president,

450
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:51,326
then she'll be pulling all the strings,
unraveling the sweater that is my life.

451
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,871
OK, did Max see you like this,
'cause you kind of got crazy eyes.

452
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,788
I can't talk to him
about this stuff.

453
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,377
It'll just sound ridiculous.

454
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:03,505
Once I win the presidency,

455
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:06,336
then I can dive back into
the deep end with Max.

456
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,061
But right now
I need to borrow your phone

457
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:11,425
so I can deal
with this hot Frannie mess.

458
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:24,043
I was just meeting
with my Econ professor.

459
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:26,153
Thought I'd stop by.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

460
00:25:26,313 --> 00:25:27,612
You are, thank god.

461
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,826
I'm grading exams.

462
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,523
Now I can give you
this thank you note in person.

463
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,009
You didn't have to do that.

464
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:36,453
I'm a compulsive Miss Manners
freak, so I kinda did.

465
00:25:36,573 --> 00:25:38,394
It was my pleasure.
In fact,

466
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,671
when we left the
restaurant, I started thinking.

467
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,253
My mom is on the alumni board
at Princeton,

468
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,046
so she could make a call

469
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:46,702
if you think that might help you.

470
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:48,908
Really? She would do that?
She doesn't even know me.

471
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:51,141
Well, she knows me
and I know you.

472
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,972
And like you said,
it's all about who you know, right?

473
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:57,776
That would be
unbelievably generous.

474
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:58,910
Happy to help.

475
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:03,064
Maybe you can help me with O'Toole.

476
00:26:03,224 --> 00:26:05,609
It's obvious
he's gonna fail French yet again.

477
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:09,070
So I was hoping
you could intervene?

478
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:12,263
- You mean tutor him?
- Yeah, no, he's tried tutors.

479
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:14,045
He's tried practice tests.

480
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:16,882
We even force fed him
a wheel of brie.

481
00:26:17,002 --> 00:26:18,914
The guy is just allergic to French.

482
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:21,746
Why do you care
if he passes my class?

483
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:23,543
Well, he's a brother in need.

484
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:26,671
And I like helping needy people.
Call me a philanthropist.

485
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:30,028
{\Come on,}It's not like he needs an A.

486
00:26:30,148 --> 00:26:32,655
He's taking it pass/fail,
so just pass him.

487
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,303
What's the harm?

488
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:36,223
I don't change grades, Evan.

489
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:40,393
Well, no harm in asking, right?

490
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:42,812
And just remember,
if you change your mind

491
00:26:43,575 --> 00:26:44,856
it could change your life.

492
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:48,195
My mother is
a very persuasive woman.

493
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:50,537
People say I take after her.

494
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:02,959
Frannie, can I steal you for a sec?

495
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,029
Date over already?
Don't get discouraged.

496
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:08,331
- There are more fish in the sea.
- I left my date early.

497
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:11,424
- I couldn't stop thinking about us.
- Oh, Case,

498
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:15,053
some girls may want to experiment
in college, but I don't.

499
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,533
Oh, Frannie. I can always
count on you to make me laugh.

500
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:23,287
Which is why I'd like
to clarify that whole

501
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:25,956
"we're sisters, not friends"
thing I said after Greek Week.

502
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,274
Sisters fight.

503
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:29,109
They say things they don't mean.

504
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:32,175
- Really?
- They also make up.

505
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,447
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

506
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:35,949
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:40,328
And I'm grateful that you're
taking over as pledge educator.

508
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:43,539
Casey, I'm really glad
that you said that.

509
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,542
It must've taken
an awful lot of courage.

510
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,460
So, truce?

511
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:53,018
Friends close, enemies closer?

512
00:27:53,877 --> 00:27:57,343
That's Politics 101, poodle,
and I believe I was your professor.

513
00:27:57,794 --> 00:27:59,850
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

514
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,743
Pledges and officers,
time to start the lock-in.

515
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:04,991
Tonight's agenda will be as follows:

516
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,896
First we will make collages
expressing our hopes

517
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:10,806
and dreams and then
we will have a share circle.

518
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,501
And then after that we...

519
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,133
I'll get it. Before we
start Frannie's way fun collages,

520
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:19,280
I thought I'd treat the pledges to

521
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:23,097
delicious gelato,
courtesy of Gianni's Gelato.

522
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,935
Gelato's way better than collages.

523
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:32,823
Officers first, sluts.
Hi, there.

524
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:37,597
The gelato could have been from both
of us, but I guess we're not friends.

525
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:40,699
I learned that from you, too.
Always have a Plan B.

526
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:44,858
FYI, I'm part poodle, part pit bull.

527
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:52,414
You should be a professional
prank planner, Spitter.

528
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:55,494
I mean, first the farm animals
at the O-Chi house, now this.

529
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:58,357
I do seem to have a knack for it,
but it was Ben Bennett's

530
00:28:58,477 --> 00:29:01,970
genius idea
of using Heath's smoke bombs.

531
00:29:02,546 --> 00:29:03,709
Nice.

532
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:06,483
Everybody grab one.
Dinner is served.

533
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,795
Actually, it took all of us
pledge brothers to pull this one off.

534
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:12,999
You know what?
I like to use the term "pre-actives."

535
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:17,863
OK, everybody take a deep breath,

536
00:29:17,983 --> 00:29:19,840
- count to ten.
- 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10.

537
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,033
The power's probably out because
somebody didn't pay the bill.

538
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:25,120
The power company's against us too, man?

539
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,914
Man, they're out there
with the actives, man.

540
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:30,603
And they got money and electricity, man.

541
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:33,690
Arrowhead, calm down.
Even if it is the actives,

542
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:35,927
they can't do anything
to us from out there.

543
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,653
They're gonna ram us.
They're gonna do us like Waco.

544
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:43,856
Game over. Game over!

545
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:51,583
They're having a dance party?

546
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,088
It's psychological warfare.

547
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:09,755
We go outside they kill us.
We stay inside we go insane.

548
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,037
It's like,
20 times in a row with this song!

549
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:15,604
The cops ain't coming. They probably
just think it's an Omega Chi party.

550
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:18,267
I say we go out and throw
ourselves at their mercy.

551
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,159
That's a great idea, Woodchuck.

552
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,225
Maybe if you talk to them real nice

553
00:30:22,508 --> 00:30:25,334
they'll let you stay on as pledge till
you're ready for the old folks'home.

554
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:27,857
Stop it.
The enemy is not us, it's them.

555
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:30,760
If we keep fighting, they win.

556
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:35,420
- So what are you suggesting?
- Amnesty.

557
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,943
Negotiate a settlement

558
00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:42,330
without additional punishment. Why would
they do that? They have all the power.

559
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,072
- We pissed them off.
- They need our dues.

560
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:47,406
If they lose the entire pledge class,

561
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:49,782
they won't have enough
money to keep this house open.

562
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:51,817
And if they lose the class,

563
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:54,339
it'll be harder for them
to get pledges in the fall.

564
00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:55,518
Exactly.

565
00:31:08,312 --> 00:31:09,526
Pledge problems.

566
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:10,869
Yep.

567
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:15,086
Good luck with that.

568
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,829
Vanilla? I thought you'd
have more adventurous tastes.

569
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:25,784
I've had enough adventures recently.

570
00:31:25,904 --> 00:31:28,126
I don't need to relive
them through my gelato.

571
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,131
Listen,
I'm sorry to hear about you and Cap.

572
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:33,639
OK!
Way to kill my sugar high.

573
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:37,792
I just wanted you to know
I'm here for you.

574
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:40,859
You deserve a Daytime Emmy,
Susan Lucci.

575
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:43,754
- What do you mean?
- I know campaigning when I see it.

576
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:45,313
That's not what I was doing.

577
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,281
You and Frannie are
battling over the pledges.

578
00:31:47,401 --> 00:31:49,570
She's trying to start
an anti-Cartwright faction.

579
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:51,827
You rallied admirably
with the gelato gambit.

580
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:52,958
Thank you.

581
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:56,409
Look, if the pledges are a swing state,
then you're their popular governor.

582
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:58,520
- I want your endorsement.
- We'll see.

583
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:00,686
I'm keeping my options open for now.

584
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:02,595
But for the record,

585
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:05,175
I appreciate how you stood up to Tegan.

586
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:07,816
Thanks.

587
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:11,770
And for the record,
I know how hard it is to get over him.

588
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:18,676
Well, you and el presidente
are looking mighty cozy.

589
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,733
I never mix personal with politics.

590
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,421
On the personal front,

591
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:25,375
Casey and I are OK.

592
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,249
On the political front,

593
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:29,382
it's open season.

594
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:31,975
You're smiley.

595
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:34,469
The polls are tracking in my favor.

596
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:39,385
Girls, put down your ice
butter and give me your attention.

597
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:42,225
My boyfriend, Evan Chambers,

598
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:46,114
he wanted to make sure this was the most
memorable lock-in ever,

599
00:32:46,388 --> 00:32:50,361
so he sent us these four masseurs
to give us some deep tissue treats,

600
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:53,932
so go grab your robes and get
down here for some Swedish satisfaction.

601
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:55,991
Hey, Ash, get...!

602
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:58,628
You know I'm on your side.

603
00:32:58,782 --> 00:33:00,380
But my chakras are a mess.

604
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:06,142
Hey, Casey, maybe you should go first.
You're looking a little tense.

605
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,212
So, we're in agreement?

606
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:13,654
No matter what happens,
we stick together.

607
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:26,223
I love you guys.

608
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,059
Break!

609
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,983
Where are they?

610
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,582
I don't know.

611
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:04,016
We're all gonna die!

612
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:07,740
Guys? Guys?
Ben?

613
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,665
Guys!

614
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:11,706
Guys!

615
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:13,892
Beav, we called a truce.

616
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,016
I feel all loosey-goosey.

617
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,298
I just wish I hadn't inhaled
all that gelato beforehand.

618
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,777
I need to stop eating
like a 500 pound man.

619
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:26,607
Hey, you guys, I have a great idea.

620
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:29,531
What if we play a game of I Never?

621
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,165
- Come on.
- OK.

622
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:37,158
How original.

623
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:39,388
- Are we gonna play?
- We have to.

624
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:42,677
What's a better way to learn about your
fellow sisters than by sharing secrets?

625
00:34:42,953 --> 00:34:45,475
- Everyone circle up.
- Great. Very good.

626
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,082
How do you play?

627
00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:49,608
Were you homeschooled?

628
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:52,849
Each girl says something
they've never done.

629
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,949
If another girl in the circle
has done that thing,

630
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:56,999
she steps into the middle of the circle.

631
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:59,544
Once they step out,
the game starts anew. I'll go first.

632
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:02,668
I never
have taken public transportation.

633
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:11,725
I never

634
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,351
ran up a 1,500 dollar
credit card bill in two weeks.

635
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:19,560
I see how it is.

636
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,543
I never

637
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:27,117
stalked an entire
a capella singing group.

638
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,947
Was that... Was that you?

639
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:39,705
I never had sex with Evan Chambers.

640
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:51,696
I never

641
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:55,720
served as ZBZ president
without being officially elected.

642
00:36:00,844 --> 00:36:04,985
I never lost my presidency after
being forced to resign in scandal.

643
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,438
I never lost my virginity to Cappie
and wrote some stupid poem about it.

644
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:24,209
- Come on, Case, get in the center.
- Don't you ever touch me again!

645
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:26,309
- Or what?
- Or this!

646
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:46,208
I fixed your phone.

647
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,013
Want some water?

648
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,763
So now you know, I'm a girl who...

649
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,177
I like to throw drinks
in other girl's faces.

650
00:37:02,297 --> 00:37:04,085
Is this a compulsive thing,
like Tourette's?

651
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:07,093
No, it was totally optional,
and you know what?

652
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:08,671
I enjoyed it!

653
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,266
But I can't do it anymore, Max!

654
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,326
I can't compete with Sarah.

655
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:17,055
She was

656
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:21,196
a world-saving Buddhist philosopher
who died tragically young from cancer.

657
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:22,256
Last week

658
00:37:22,383 --> 00:37:25,872
I got visibly upset someone dribbled
coffee on myEntertainment Weekly.

659
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:28,887
- Nobody likes stains.
- I've been trying to be

660
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:30,382
someone I'm not for you.

661
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:31,814
And...

662
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:35,277
it's tiring.
And it just doesn't work.

663
00:37:35,597 --> 00:37:37,374
No matter how great the guy is...

664
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,438
You think I'm a great guy?

665
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:42,311
Yeah.

666
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,530
I think you're great, too.

667
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:47,283
And look, Sarah was not a saint.

668
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:48,867
She smoked weed.

669
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:51,488
Bags and bags of weed.

670
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:54,586
She had severe bouts
of serious road rage.

671
00:37:55,154 --> 00:37:56,356
I once saw her litter.

672
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:57,827
My point is,

673
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:00,802
I like you.

674
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,926
I don't want you to be someone else.

675
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:04,179
You're so...

676
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:06,351
so alive.

677
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,164
You like me because I'm alive?

678
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:13,751
Pretty broad criteria.

679
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:16,235
You don't do anything halfway.

680
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:18,945
When you needed to learn how
to count cards you hired an advisor.

681
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:22,490
You bought me a vintage tux.
I still owe you money for that.

682
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,425
And I love the way you told me about

683
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,630
your ran over cat and then you
felt crazy for telling me.

684
00:38:28,091 --> 00:38:30,711
I love that you just threw
a drink in that girl's face.

685
00:38:31,148 --> 00:38:33,016
You're just...
you're the first thing

686
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,565
that's made me want to come
out of my room since Sarah died.

687
00:38:37,427 --> 00:38:39,241
I'm so happy when I'm around you.

688
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:43,596
And I'm happy when I'm around you, too.

689
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:55,006
Should we go finish
that girl off in there now?

690
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:57,382
She can wait.

691
00:38:58,116 --> 00:38:59,982
I'd rather finish my date with you.

692
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:17,083
Everybody out but the
pledges and Pledgemaster Wade.

693
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:18,749
Thanks for sitting on them.

694
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,003
Can I please stay and
watch you crush their spirit?

695
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:24,358
No, Beav.

696
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:31,507
Tonight's transgression
was a major letdown.

697
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,754
Because it took you so long to do it.

698
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:40,330
- What are you talking about?
- You passed the test.

699
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:44,879
No KT would put up with being
a maid all day this far into pledging.

700
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:47,328
We wanted you to bond
together and revolt.

701
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:50,530
Prove that you've got KT
blood coursing through your veins.

702
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,209
So, you're not gonna punish us?

703
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:54,159
Dude, you're a genius.

704
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:56,362
You got us to do
exactly what you wanted.

705
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:58,523
Does free will even exist?

706
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:01,337
- A question for another day, Arrowhead.
- That's impressive.

707
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:02,441
You know what?

708
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,544
You guys are impressive.

709
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,757
All right, everybody upstairs
for drinks and a Steven Seagal marathon.

710
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:11,644
Hard to Kill, followed by
another showing ofHard to Kill.

711
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:15,415
Come on, big guy.

712
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:17,274
Get up there, have fun.

713
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:21,389
So we wanted them to rebel?

714
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:23,714
It's elementary, my dear Wadeson.

715
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,162
If our intent wasn't
for the pledges to revolt,

716
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:28,557
then the pledges got one over
on the actives.

717
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:32,125
The pledges are in control, then
the lunatics have taken over the asylum.

718
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:34,970
Black is white, up is down,
left is right,

719
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:37,378
boobs are bad,
cuddling is good etcetera,

720
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:39,821
etcetera, etcetera, so on and so forth,

721
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,956
until we're back to being cavemen.

722
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,354
I guess you're right.

723
00:40:46,248 --> 00:40:47,880
Do you rember when we were pledges

724
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,460
and we...

725
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:52,830
we handcuffed Egyptian Joe
to that truck stop urinal?

726
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:54,931
Yeah.

727
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:56,699
He said it was genius.

728
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,515
- Then he hazed the crap out of us.
- That's right.

729
00:41:00,855 --> 00:41:03,584
Their guard's down now, which
is exactly where we want them to be.

730
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:05,189
For Hell Week.
Hell, yeah.

731
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:11,170
I look forward to meeting you,
too, Dr. Hanson.

732
00:41:12,397 --> 00:41:13,215
Merci.

733
00:41:17,013 --> 00:41:19,170
You look like you're about to faint.
Who was that?

734
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,824
That was Princeton on the phone.

735
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:23,349
They want to meet.
Evan mom made the introduction.

736
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:24,623
That's awesome.

737
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:28,847
He didn't even mention anything to me.
I guess he is using his power for good,

738
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,770
keeping it a secret,
like a superhero.

739
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:35,989
Why don't you look like someone
who's about to meet with Princeton?

740
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,924
I'm just a little nervous, I guess.

741
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:41,285
- Leaping into the unknown.
- Here's something to calm your nerves.

742
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:43,291
- What's this?
- A gift.

743
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,958
It's the bottle of wine
you ordered at dinner last night.

744
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:48,436
A case and thought it would be

745
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:51,341
Nice to give you a bottle to thank
you for introducing him to it.

746
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:52,419
Nice guy?

747
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:54,756
Yeah.

748
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,478
All right, so let's go back
to your apartment and celebrate.

749
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:00,420
Why not?

750
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:08,258
And we're walking,
and we're walking and we're walking.

751
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,745
Over there is the Michael
Grant Fitness Center.

752
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:14,640
Built in 2003 with
a 20 million dollar endowment by

753
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,279
Michael Grant, CRU's firs
ever professional baseball player.

754
00:42:18,674 --> 00:42:21,145
Inside you will find state
of the art exercise equipment,

755
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:23,935
and lots of toned, sexy people.

756
00:42:24,663 --> 00:42:26,278
Moving on, to our right,

757
00:42:26,772 --> 00:42:29,264
that there tree is known as Shady Lady.

758
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,896
And lounging beneath her awesome boughs

759
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,496
are my best friend, Casey,
and her new boyfriend, Max.

760
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:41,245
They are CRU's cutest
and newest couple on campus.

761
00:42:42,182 --> 00:42:43,563
Finding a quality mate is just

762
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:46,562
one of the many advantages
to attending Cyprus-Rhodes.

763
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:49,789
And we're walking and we're walking...
