00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,398
<i>Previously on</i> Greek

2
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:03,525
- Are we in the wrong house?
- I'm Lizzi.

3
00:00:03,743 --> 00:00:06,379
I'm gonna be here until ZBZ National
determines that you girls

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,323
are back on the straight narrow.
I could be anchored down here a while.

5
00:00:09,996 --> 00:00:12,451
It sucks we have to follow
these new rules,

6
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,224
but I'm fully confident,

7
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:18,259
- that we can still have fun.
- It is our mission,

8
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:20,829
to execute some of the most ass-kicking,

9
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:24,386
rule-bending parties that this campus
has ever seen.

10
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:27,684
Did you see anyone from school
over break?

11
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,569
- Just a fling.
- Fling-tastic!

12
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:33,639
I just want you to consider
giving Omega Chi another chance,

13
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:35,974
- we might surprise you.
- A gay frat guy is just weird.

14
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:40,236
The greek social calendar
will now be much less crowded.

15
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:43,087
I'll be watching you.

16
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:57,531
Excuse me.

17
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:00,678
This is so freaking stupid.

18
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:03,808
I don't know who to kill first,
Lizzi or myself.

19
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,282
Sorry. That was a tod louder
than I anticipated.

20
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,722
5 minutes and not a single one of you
completed a full rotation.

21
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,432
That's disappointing.

22
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,573
Rush group A front in center.

23
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:20,436
Speed spot, speed spot!

24
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:24,977
As rush group A, you represent the top
conversationalists of this house.

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,884
I expect you to set an example
for rush groups B through F.

26
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:32,674
A rush rotation group should run
like a well-oiled machine,

27
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:35,579
so we can keep that potential sisters
focused right here,

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,456
on you, on ZBZ.

29
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:43,296
What am I doing?

30
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:47,353
The signal that the rushee looks bored
in the conversation installed,

31
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:50,927
and that you need me to come help you
as fast as possible.

32
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:53,520
But it took you 30 seconds
to answer Casey's signal.

33
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,387
I think the girls are getting
a little tired,

34
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:59,866
and possibly wondering why it is
we're practicing on a Friday night,

35
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:01,602
when rush isn't until next year.

36
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:04,323
We do these drills
because practice makes perfect,

37
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,106
if we wanna get this house
back in shape,

38
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:08,642
we need all the perfect we can get.

39
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:14,885
- Where are you going?
- I can't be here anymore.

40
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,176
This sorority has become like a job.

41
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,871
Right now, I'm in college
so, I don't have to have a job.

42
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:23,414
This situation is only temporary and,

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,077
this whole Greek crackdown
will blow over eventually.

44
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,448
- Where's your ZBZ spirit?
- I've been faking it,

45
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:31,683
a lot.

46
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:40,345
I know than loosing a sister
brings up difficult emotions,

47
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:41,656
but trust me,

48
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:44,646
I am not some tyrant
here to work you to death.

49
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,350
Just because I'm a little older,

50
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:50,669
a little wiser, it doesn't mean
that I don't need some R&R.

51
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:52,740
ZBZs work hard,

52
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,303
and we play hard.

53
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:55,877
Define play.

54
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,549
Back at Polytech,

55
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,161
we started a book club.

56
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,789
We could do the same thing here.

57
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,874
<i>The Great Gatsby</i> is one of my favorites.

58
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:07,738
We'd have to read it?

59
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:10,466
It still resonates, Gatsby is like

60
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:12,905
like the super rich
Omega Chi wanna-be.

61
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:15,193
He threw really wild ravaged parties.

62
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,944
Who wouldn't wanna read about
wild parties rather than have them?

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,768
Adieu mister social calendar
of the greek system.

64
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,479
Never have in our line a newspaper
to find something to do.

65
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:30,245
- Any good movies?
- I've seen 'em all.

66
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:32,876
Movies are all I do these days.

67
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,604
I'm starting to worry
about pop corn **long?**

68
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:39,590
How long you have to wait for Omega Chi
to make a decision about you going back?

69
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:41,785
I don't know,
I'm sort of in a holding pattern.

70
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:44,669
My purity pledge group
is playing biojeopardy tonight

71
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,665
There's free refreshment and girls.

72
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,966
There was a girl one time.

73
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,255
I think it was a girl,
I'm almost positive.

74
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,375
- I'm gonna keep looking.
- The circus is in town...

75
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:58,719
Last time, I won the entire
Rascal Flatt's catalog

76
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,530
- on CD.
- If you wanna hang out

77
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,849
with your KT brothers,
I completely understand.

78
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:08,145
Why don't you hang out
with my Kappa Tau brothers forever?

79
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:13,358
- That sounds harmless.
- No I'm serious, you can pledge KT.

80
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:17,218
You're still technicly just a pledge
at Omega Chi, why wait around for them?

81
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:20,449
There's been a couple days
and no notice.

82
00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:22,367
We'd have so much fun together.

83
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:24,870
Let me think about it.

84
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,788
OK but what are we doing tonight?

85
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,710
You know what, this guy in my dorm
mentioned something about a '70s party

86
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,987
Normaly I pull these things off
but it could be fun.

87
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:38,907
The Carpenters are one the greatest
most underated duos of all time.

88
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,729
Do you wanna join us?

89
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,799
It's like I'm living ever.

90
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,883
I bet the party money
went towards the disco bar.

91
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:10,101
I think I'm gonna swing by Kappa Tau
tomorrow.

92
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,427
Episode 1x12

Transcript: Kasius, Allysiah,
HorcKs, AkaZab,

00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:21,301
[www.sub-way.fr]
[www.seriessub.com]

95
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,025
Here you are.

96
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,477
I guess we should talk strategy.

97
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:33,494
You, don't worry.

98
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:36,316
This afternoon, I'm gonna pick up
a ton of copies of TGG.

99
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:42,155
<i>The Great Gatsby</i>, I think it feel
really nice to get for the girls.

100
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:47,722
You might not have to buy too many
since all the girls are quitting.

101
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:51,152
Andrea last night,
Annabel last week.

102
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:52,773
Don't get me wrong.

103
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:55,832
I am in love with your book club idea.

104
00:05:56,292 --> 00:06:00,273
I think maybe the girls
need a bigger moral boost.

105
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:04,250
Something by Dickens,
<i>Great Expectations</i>.

106
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:06,388
Little orphans are so cute.

107
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,886
I don't think the book choice
is the problem,

108
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:12,533
I think we could all use some real fun,
like a party,

109
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:14,360
with actual boys.

110
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:16,588
That's a wonderful idea.

111
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,890
- Seriously?
- Seriously, I love it.

112
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,718
A great Gatsby theme party,
but educational.

113
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:25,337
As all parties should be.

114
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,500
The roaring '20s, what a wonderfully
rich historical period.

115
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:32,580
The fashion and music and prohibition.

116
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,305
Prohibition, like...

117
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:37,150
No liquor?

118
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:40,922
I'm sorry, this chapter is not ready
for a party with alcohol.

119
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:44,432
We have to find a place to host
because of the rules.

120
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:46,923
Prohibited co and
sociolizing in the house.

121
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:50,555
We must check the girls' GPA and their
house points to see who can attend.

122
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:53,106
Don't forget
about the 11 o'clock curfew.

123
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:57,034
We could have a dance instructor.

124
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:01,263
I'm gonna e-mail Nationals
and tell them all about it.

125
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:02,680
They'll be so happy.

126
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:07,972
So will the girls.

127
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,691
Score one for the pledges.

128
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:19,130
We're gonna have to get rid
of your handicap, nice shot Bener.

129
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,712
Glad you could make it.

130
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:24,525
- I didn't know you were golfing today.
- We discussed it at the last meeting.

131
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:26,562
That's right, you weren't there.

132
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,457
As our brother,
you deserve our forgiveness,

133
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:31,963
and our loving ridicule.

134
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,018
Line it up.

135
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,799
For

136
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,785
Curses...

137
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:46,428
You met my friend Calvin,
I was wondering,

138
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:48,907
if you'd consider taking him
as one of our pledges,

139
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:51,159
he dropped out of the Omega Chis.

140
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:54,913
- He's smart, really good at sports.
- You'd me at "dropped out of the OCs."

141
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,752
Cultivating a new pledge, not to mention
stealing one from our arsh enemies,

142
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,629
- this is what brotherhood is all about.
- I do what I can.

143
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:09,177
- I'll get it
- You're not sucking up, I'll get it.

144
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:17,644
Which Law & Order are you with?

145
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,188
Can I have to issue you your citation?

146
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,298
Open container of an alcoholic beverage.

147
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,632
Again?

148
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,048
There's nothing even here.

149
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,438
Except of maybe the tiniest bit of foam.

150
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,619
That's not gonna hold up
on a court of law.

151
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,141
Try to stay out of trouble.

152
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,166
Give my love to dean Bowman.

153
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:46,312
Here's your ball.

154
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,976
At least, we're gonna have a party.

155
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:54,715
I went to wilder parties in elementary
school, I can't believe this, it's like

156
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:57,809
I have no control anymore,

157
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,503
my relationship with Evan
span out of control,

158
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,289
- I can't manage with Lizzi.
- OK stop.

159
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,866
Compromise
is what comes with territory,

160
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:09,462
- you're just being a good president.
- I'm a terrible president.

161
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:12,631
The idea is to keep girl from leaving,
not drive them away.

162
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,103
Frannie'd have found
a way around this.

163
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,705
Let's play "What would Frannie do?"

164
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,291
Go with me girl.

165
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:24,235
She'd make Lizzi cry.

166
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,493
And?

167
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,051
Tie her up and put her
on a basement somewhere.

168
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,072
I don't know.

169
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:37,742
- The Kappa Taus have a basement.
- Buffalo Bill, let's put a pin in that.

170
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:39,964
Wait...

171
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:43,185
- You have an idea?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:53,148 --> 00:09:56,386
You just have got to be the #1 weapon
on the fight for abstinence.

173
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,371
I thought you enjoyed being ravaged
by me in super places.

174
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:02,012
It's like we're secret sex spies.

175
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:05,233
I say we remove cars from
our list of spy places.

176
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:10,526
We're running out of places,
library, aiport,

177
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,302
- that church.
- We'll be more creative for the future.

178
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,972
You believe we have a future together.

179
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:19,133
Hypothetically.

180
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:21,810
In a world where there's no Casey,

181
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:24,004
you're a one-woman men and

182
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:25,564
people don't gossip.

183
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:29,827
Miss Logan, I'm surprised you worry
about such things.

184
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:31,196
I don't.

185
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:32,984
But maybe you do.

186
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:40,002
You're not contradicting me.

187
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,248
Which is why secret sex
is so appealing right now.

188
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:45,422
No complications.

189
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,909
Get out.

190
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:51,553
I have class and
we can't be seen together.

191
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:52,716
It'll blow our cover.

192
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,798
Fine, but just for the record,

193
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,014
you cannot be more wrong.

194
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:03,810
Spies are supposed to be better liers.

195
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:07,986
Enjoy your walk.

196
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:29,377
Come by the house this afternoon.
I'll show you around.

197
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:32,422
I guess I could check it out.
Normal fellows, right?

198
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:35,927
From the beginning, you were stuck at OC
because of your dad.

199
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:38,825
- Now you're not stuck with those guys.
- They're were not all bad.

200
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,138
<i>A cappucino for Evan.</i>

201
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,148
- How's it going?
- Good... Just drinking coffee.

202
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,691
We're gonna have a special meeting
this week on you coming back.

203
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:53,610
Just hang it tight.

204
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:57,253
You guys are losing a great pledge.

205
00:11:58,261 --> 00:11:59,973
I don't think we're losing anybody.

206
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:02,994
You have a history of letting
great people get away from you.

207
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:06,706
You know what? I've tried to
be nice to you by not kicking your ass.

208
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:09,417
Last semester, I've put up
with the digs, with the insults

209
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,812
out of respect for Casey.

210
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,422
She and I are not together anymore.
You do the maths.

211
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:18,148
- He's just sticking up versus...
- I can do maths.

212
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,325
I'm good at it.

213
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,932
I hear a lot of buzzing,
but no actual words.

214
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:28,102
That's what insects do.
They buzz around, try to sting you.

215
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,230
Be careful, insect!

216
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:34,228
Some insects are quite deadly.

217
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,303
Tse-tse fly can kill you.

218
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:41,616
What?

219
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:44,064
Just drinking coffee.

220
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,833
To what do I owe this honor?

221
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:54,277
- Is this a bad time?
- No, I just really need to sit down.

222
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:55,778
Much better...

223
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,882
Do you see a clean towel over there?

224
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:03,374
- Honestly... Not really.
- Never mind. What's up?

225
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,639
I wanna say thank you
for what you did for us at the...

226
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,925
- carnival.
- I go where I'm needed.

227
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:11,872
That's what makes me superhero.

228
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,357
I know I haven't really
been that super to you in the past.

229
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,360
Are you in some kind of 12-step program,
or something?

230
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:20,621
Unless they started a one for idiots,

231
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,935
who, stripted their lavaliere and are
having a hard time getting over it.

232
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,688
I can give you some pointers there.

233
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,226
Not that I've had ex boyfriends.

234
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:34,156
What I wanna say, Cap',

235
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:35,855
is that I'm hoping

236
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,318
you and I can...

237
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,221
start over.

238
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,115
Be friends.

239
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,439
We've definitely tried
the other thing, right?

240
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:52,811
With a lot of fun, but not much success.

241
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,839
Friend Cappie, at your service.

242
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:00,847
Thank you.

243
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,529
What don't you tell me what you really
came here for?

244
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:06,803
- Why do you assume...
- Cause even though we're startin' over,

245
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:08,355
we're not really.

246
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,496
I know you.

247
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:14,656
Fair enough.

248
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:19,332
How would the KTs like to party
with the ZBZs?

249
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:21,022
- What kind?
- The biggest,

250
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:24,270
baddest most rule-breaking party
CRU will never see.

251
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:26,713
When you put it like that.

252
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:28,438
We're in.

253
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:29,574
Good!

254
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:35,259
Is you shirt on inside out
and backwards?

255
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,110
It's just... joggging.

256
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:47,022
This is the common room.

257
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:51,527
It looks like TV football,
viewing party last night.

258
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:54,611
You guys surely know
how to have a good time.

259
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:59,297
Welcome to our temple of good times
and life-long brotherhood.

260
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,779
Our <i>casa es su casa</i>.

261
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,150
We're walkin'.
You got any question so far?

262
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:07,822
- What are your academic requirements?
- Every active member

263
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,640
must take one course per semester

264
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:11,498
or you get us skip talking to.

265
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:16,424
But I mean, you have to take four course
just to be in the Greek system?

266
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:19,787
I'll look into that.

267
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:22,672
We're still walking.
Here are our lovely gardens.

268
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:27,222
Do you have any kind
of mentorship program?

269
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:33,625
The OC, they had a lot of connections.
You know, CEO and like so.

270
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:36,743
Last summer, bunch of the active did
some paid internships.

271
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,549
That's a good point.

272
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:42,513
Jack Rabbit gives all the active
and pledges

273
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:45,322
20% discount at his hut.

274
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,755
- Is that what you meant?
- Kind of.

275
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:50,495
It's good.

276
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,926
And here is the lovely recreation
and relaxation room.

277
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,401
Excuse me.

278
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,134
This is Calvin.

279
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,170
You're thinking about the pledging
from the Omega Chi.

280
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,647
Spitter and Quiter.

281
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:09,170
Excellent.

282
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,199
You're awesome.

283
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,598
Thanks, I think.

284
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,571
Hey Eth, you met my friend Calvin.

285
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:18,566
I have.

286
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,708
On more than one occasion.

287
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,708
The mystery guy.

288
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,230
That's cool.

289
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:37,668
It's weird for me to picture but...

290
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:39,597
completely cool.

291
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,845
So, how've you been?

292
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:46,071
Couldn't be better.

293
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,414
So fellas,
I have a little anouncement to make.

294
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,272
Join me, in the basement, for a chapter
meeting in five.

295
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,078
All right, libations

296
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,272
will be provided.

297
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,858
- He can stay, right?
- Well, can he keep a secret?

298
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,311
Because, if you can't keep a secret.

299
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,230
You should leave the room right now.

300
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:14,156
- You all with me?
- Can we see a little of the ZBZ swear?

301
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:18,581
We're going to throw a party.

302
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:21,753
A theme party based on the book
<i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

303
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,894
Which we all know is a big
Lizzi favorite.

304
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:26,726
There will be great costumes, fun music

305
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:29,915
and a dance instructor that's gonna
teach us dances from the 20.

306
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:32,481
Did I just fell asleep
with my eyes open?

307
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:36,499
I haven't finished yet.
That's just...

308
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,529
- the upstairs party.
- But downstairs,

309
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:41,104
A once in a lifetime,

310
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,777
down and dirty, secret,

311
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:47,380
Prohibition party, in our old
so humble ground.

312
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,707
- A what party?
- A prohibition party, a speakeasy.

313
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,291
Here is how it's gonna work.
Upstairs,

314
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:57,241
there's gonna be the authority pleasing
<i>Great Gatsby</i> party.

315
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:00,056
Downstairs, will be a delightful,
delicious,

316
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:03,595
- Den of inequity.
- You've heard of the 18th amendment?

317
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,827
You know,
alcohol was illegal in the 20s.

318
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:14,580
Is that why they call it
the Great Depression?

319
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:18,175
This is absurd, Lizzi is never going
to allow a speak-easy.

320
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:21,679
- Lizzi's never going to know about it.
- Where are we having this party?

321
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,308
What respectable fraternity is
ever going to agree to this risk.

322
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:28,210
It's already arranged.
We're doing it in the KT house.

323
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,405
I still have aches from the last time
we partied with them.

324
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:37,816
Score baby.

325
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,613
I can't believe Casey's endorsing
a secret party.

326
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,985
Those girls are super hot.

327
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:45,374
Rebecca Logan is the hottest.

328
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,670
Gentleman, please, come on.

329
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,962
Let's respect the ladies and try to stay
on point here.

330
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,661
Who here is with me?

331
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,399
It's gonna be awesome.

332
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,567
We'll wear flapper dresses and
garter belts.

333
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:03,739
So we throw this dangerous party.

334
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,377
What do we do if Lizzi finds out about
the secret room?

335
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,194
We could loose our social calendar.

336
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:12,344
What? That's not acceptable.

337
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,136
The only thing I've got on the calendar,

338
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,003
is a group trip to the outlet mall
in four weeks.

339
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:20,720
What I should say is that we really got
nothing to loose.

340
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:23,962
What if it gets back to dean Bowman
and the administration?

341
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,308
- We could get seriously busted.
- Then, I'll take the blame.

342
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:28,920
I'll step down as president.

343
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:31,175
Are you sure about that?

344
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:34,574
I'm sure, because we're not going
to get caught.

345
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,600
Even if we don't get caught, it still
the KTs.

346
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:39,639
They're like a dealest fraternity.

347
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:41,745
And the front hall always smells
like vomit.

348
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:45,200
Excuse me.

349
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:49,979
I know I was initialy sceptical
but I think Casey's plan has real merit.

350
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,264
I mean, think about it.

351
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:55,998
Would you rather party
with real flesh and blood KTs,

352
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,268
or read about some fake characters,

353
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:01,861
in a tired, old dusty book about
a bunch of crap that never happened.

354
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,481
Who's with me?

355
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:09,304
I am!

356
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:10,723
Let's do it!

357
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,835
OK then it's settled.

358
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:17,354
Let's get started.
We need a sound proof down here.

359
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:20,784
Tom, Dave, you still have
your disturbingly loud band?

360
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:22,688
Disturbingly loud?

361
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:24,662
Why wouldn't the band still be together?

362
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,366
No reason.

363
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:30,167
And one day,
I'm sure you'll be hugely successful.

364
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:34,419
Anyway, you guys need to isolate the
room so no sound can make it upstairs.

365
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,717
and then you'll have a room to practice,
you'll become great big rock stars.

366
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:39,988
Next, we need enough liquor

367
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,477
to incapacitate

368
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:43,047
David Hasselhoff so

369
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:45,734
who's gonna go and
hit the store with me?

370
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:49,691
That was super honorable
of you to say you'd step down.

371
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:50,861
Yeah, right?

372
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:53,361
What the hell was I thinking?

373
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,210
You said it we're not gonna get caught.

374
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:57,273
Hi!

375
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,477
Lizzi, what happened? We were worried.

376
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,909
I've been running around
like a crazy person.

377
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,495
Think you gave me the wrong address.
There's no book store on 3rd.

378
00:21:06,677 --> 00:21:08,080
Oh my God! Did I say 3rd?

379
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:09,688
I meant 13th.

380
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:11,275
I feel terrible.

381
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,412
No, it's alright! I found a store

382
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:16,112
that gave me a 40% book discount.

383
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,090
I'm so excited right now.

384
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:19,699
Did you tell the girls?

385
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,449
They loved the idea.

386
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:25,355
I'm gonna go in a girls' room and
freshen up and we've to start planning.

387
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:27,280
ASAP cause I wanna be involved

388
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:28,898
in every single detail.

389
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,293
Partez!

390
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:40,329
You're having a party?

391
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,334
Sure you've got enough liquor there?

392
00:21:47,448 --> 00:21:49,758
You know, smuggling liquor for a party.

393
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:53,668
It isn't just a violation for you,
it's gonna reflect poorly on all of us.

394
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,294
Then it's a good think
we only got diet soft

395
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:57,564
drinks, Evian.

396
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,084
You gotta be kidding me.

397
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:04,345
You got him working for you now?
You with them?

398
00:22:04,527 --> 00:22:06,007
They're my friends, that's all.

399
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,768
Actually,
he's thinking 'bout pledging with us.

400
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:12,353
Just realized the Kappa Taus are a whole
lot more fun than the Omega Chis.

401
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,846
Is that true?

402
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,566
Just considering my options alright?

403
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:20,176
Been a little tired of waiting
for you, guys.

404
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:22,231
You're not going to.

405
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:24,782
Hope you guys got plenty
of Cosmo to mix for the fairy.

406
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:26,114
What you say?

407
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:32,104
Don't mess up the party clothes.

408
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:34,750
- Come on.
- I don't even like Cosmo, bitch!

409
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:38,694
Come on, go, that's great!

410
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:52,120
I almost sweat him, man.

411
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,228
Kappa Taus're like the
gay fraternity on campus.

412
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:56,919
Fit right in, good riddance.

413
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,774
I want you to leave Omega Chi.

414
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:00,556
Excuse me?

415
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:04,030
I want you to pack up
your crap and get the hell out.

416
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,432
Because of him?

417
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:08,993
It's time for Omega Chi to work harder
on the quality of guys we bring in

418
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:12,345
Calvin Owens has more potential
than you'll ever have.

419
00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:15,410
And truthfully, Trend, I just

420
00:23:15,943 --> 00:23:19,043
don't have the time and
the patience to teach you tolerance.

421
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:21,198
I don't know who elected you,
emperor of Omega Chi but

422
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,652
you don't have the authority to kick
me out, I'm not going anywhere.

423
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,982
Actually you're about
3 months late on your dues

424
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:30,222
which if your checked the house rules
is due cause for exposure.

425
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,220
I'll rally the brothers.

426
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:36,414
- I'll call nationals if I have to.
- Go ahead and call nationals.

427
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,369
'Cause if I told them half the crap
you've been making my ears blead with,

428
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,420
you're gonna be bounced anyway.

429
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:45,383
I'm doing you a favor.
Take the easy road out.

430
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,145
You have until tomorrow.

431
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:18,532
I actually think these restrictions
from the dean are god-sent

432
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,720
'cause they force us
to be so much creative.

433
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:24,117
This is way better than
some loud rowdy fraternity party.

434
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:26,685
I agree.
This was an inspired idea you did

435
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,614
an absolutely lovely
job pulling it together

436
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:30,271
so quickly

437
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:34,154
Jasmine, please keep your
hands off your partner's buttocks!

438
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:38,624
Some of the girls are getting restless

439
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:41,682
Someone has to stay upstairs.

440
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:45,816
Fine, you can take one couple downstairs

441
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:48,886
but make sure you send people up
to replace them.

442
00:25:37,564 --> 00:25:39,792
You look....

443
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:42,396
Are you having fun?

444
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:44,422
Yeah, it's great but,

445
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:46,859
aren't you freaking out, a little bit?

446
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,124
You're president of the sorority now.

447
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,820
- It's a pretty big decision.
- Not at all.

448
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:54,589
I did what I had to do
and it's working just fine.

449
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,490
Relax! I am!

450
00:25:57,738 --> 00:26:00,488
Can I borrow your lovely sister
for a moment?

451
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:07,495
- You really pulled it off
- I couldn't have done without you.

452
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,297
What now?

453
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:14,778
I say if you can slip away,
we see what the real party's like.

454
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:19,701
Hopefully it's some more
of your naughty little clappers.

455
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:24,501
Dean Bowman?

456
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:25,855
What a surprise!

457
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,590
Come on in.

458
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,925
You're here! I'm so glad!

459
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:34,346
How can I refuse an invitation
to a party of the infamous Kappa Taus.

460
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:38,767
- Mind if I look around?
- Not at all! Let me have your coat.

461
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:44,035
You know what, Cappie...

462
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,459
Cappie can take his coat.

463
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:50,356
Who invited dean Bowman?

464
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,681
Me. It seemed like
the perfect opportunity

465
00:26:52,682 --> 00:26:55,177
to show him the concivilized
and educational events

466
00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:57,351
ZBZ's gonna be hosting this semester.

467
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:59,371
It's gonna buy us a little good-will.

468
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:01,321
It's what good leaders do.

469
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,591
We are so screwed.

470
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,821
What are we going to do?
This's a total nightmare.

471
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:24,272
Don't panic,
I'll figure something out. Wait!

472
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:27,197
- I need to buy your expertise.
- Plan B.

473
00:27:27,198 --> 00:27:29,004
Not yet, that's way too dressed

474
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:32,319
Find out where the dean lives,
get about 10 gallons of gas.

475
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:36,909
Wait, where's dean... Bowman!

476
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:39,305
I was looking for the punch.

477
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:41,870
It's right over there.
Do you want me to get you some?

478
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,985
That's fine, I'm fully capable.
Thank you.

479
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:47,445
Then I'd like to get myself a tour
of the house, if it's alright?

480
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,565
Of course!

481
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:53,702
I told the girls I'd step down as
sorority's president if we got caught.

482
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:56,365
- I have my stun gun upstairs.
- You know what?

483
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:57,735
I'll handle it. Make sure

484
00:27:57,736 --> 00:27:59,667
Bowman and Lizzi stay away
from the basement door.

485
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:02,786
- What you gonna do?
- I'm gonna be a sorority's president.

486
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,370
Ladies, we have an emergency.
I need 8 quadro in formation

487
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:12,108
Sisters, you're about to

488
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:14,698
make urgent use
of your rush rotation skills.

489
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:18,524
We have an unexpected visitor
in our mix namely dean Bowman.

490
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:22,302
Our mission is to keep him occupied,
failure is not an option.

491
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:24,014
Are you with me?

492
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,532
Good! Let's move out!

493
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:31,047
Are you guys coming back?

494
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:35,098
Incredible! And then what happened?

495
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:38,497
- I graduated from highschool.
- Highschool?

496
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,849
That's facinating!

497
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,654
- And, then what?
- I went to college.

498
00:28:48,775 --> 00:28:51,495
So... so do you live around here?

499
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:55,262
Dean Bowman, can I tell you
what a privilege it is to have you

500
00:28:55,382 --> 00:28:58,407
at your party? What a great tie!

501
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:08,435
So?

502
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:12,302
Are you really thinking
of joining the Kappa Taus?

503
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:14,582
I haven't decided yet.

504
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:16,552
What do you think about it?

505
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,851
You see how much fun we can have.

506
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:22,466
- I know you love strip clubs.
- Boobs.

507
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:26,553
You don't think
it wouldn't be awkward though?

508
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:30,188
- I mean, if we're dating other people.
- Doesn't have to be.

509
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:33,778
You should meet Greg,
I really think you'd like him.

510
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:37,279
Yeah, it'll be a little awkward.

511
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:42,273
I don't want
to change your mind or anything.

512
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:46,378
I really miss hanging out with you.

513
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:48,556
Me too.

514
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,562
The ultimate secret sex spot.

515
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:02,736
All these people around...

516
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:06,041
Where should we start?

517
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:11,423
Let's hold off on that for right now.

518
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:14,108
We're on high alert.

519
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,535
Who choose out this song? It's so good!

520
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:23,969
You're monopolizing the dean's time.

521
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:27,204
I'm sorry. Dean Bowman,
this is Ashleigh Hawards,

522
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:30,017
social chair at ZB,
would you excuse me? I'm gonna

523
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:33,204
go check on the refreshments.

524
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:36,093
It's such a treat to have you here.

525
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:42,686
So I guess you're also a big fan
of the book?

526
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,138
Which book?

527
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,162
Oh <i>The Great Gatsby</i>! Yeah!

528
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,515
Totally! It's one of my favorites.

529
00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:53,397
Mia Farrow is one of the great tragic

530
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:55,689
characters in modern literature.

531
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:04,988
- Awesome!
- Better than watch movies alone, right?

532
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:09,883
It's the Omega Chi dropout!

533
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:12,603
We love you, man! You're beautiful!

534
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:16,353
Good going man!

535
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:17,921
Omega Chis suck!

536
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:27,866
I'm starting to feel more like a trophee
than prospective pledge.

537
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:30,369
No, I want you here,
'cause you're a good friend.

538
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:33,020
and all around, great guy.

539
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,082
You'd be around other great guys.

540
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:38,851
- As opposed to Evan?
- As opposed to Evan.

541
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:42,593
A jerk and Greek bro,
and the rest of Omega Chi.

542
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:46,069
I had a lot of good times there.

543
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,414
It's gonna be a hard decision.

544
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,197
I don't want it to be about you,

545
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:51,860
or Evan or my dad.

546
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,630
You know, I just gotta...

547
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,283
do what feels right.

548
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:57,795
Or you'd be picking Kappa Tau.

549
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,310
Need a drink?

550
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,869
I could use 'bout a million drinks,
I've been running around all night.

551
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,404
What do you want? Sparta hooch?

552
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:14,121
Actually, I brought my own.

553
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:18,690
Nice flask.

554
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:23,227
Sorry, I crossed the line,
I didn't mean to...

555
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,322
Apology accepted.

556
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:31,328
To a long and meaningful friendship.

557
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,398
Right, friendship.

558
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:50,013
I gotta go back upstairs.

559
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:52,618
Find someone.

560
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,036
Which is why I think in many ways,

561
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:02,377
Ferris Bueller
is my generation's Gatsby.

562
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:05,831
So...

563
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:10,205
do you think that Gatsby
is really great or just

564
00:33:10,775 --> 00:33:12,636
a totally decent guy?

565
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,965
Would you excuse me?
I need to find a bathroom.

566
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:20,145
I don't think you're heading
in the right direction.

567
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:22,406
Sure I am.
I've seen a lot of people round here.

568
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:24,877
Maybe you should use the one upstairs,
it's much nicer.

569
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,828
- There's pot pourri.
- That won't be necessary.

570
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:30,596
No, you can't go in there.

571
00:33:30,838 --> 00:33:33,557
- Why not?
- A girl got sick.

572
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:37,162
Not that she was drinking or anything.

573
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,813
I think it was a bad trip fajitas.

574
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:44,878
Yes?

575
00:33:46,878 --> 00:33:49,468
I'll be right there. Excuse me!

576
00:34:06,307 --> 00:34:07,674
What are you doing?

577
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,006
Pretty naughty!

578
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,906
What do you think about us
going on a real date?

579
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:20,247
I mean don't get me wrong,
secret sex is awesome.

580
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:26,351
Really awesome, but I think
that you and I actually dating

581
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:29,085
awesom... er.

582
00:34:33,181 --> 00:34:34,987
On that thought.

583
00:34:36,627 --> 00:34:38,183
We have a situation up here.

584
00:34:38,184 --> 00:34:42,020
What sort of situation?
I'm kinda busy in here.

585
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,352
Code red.

586
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,808
I'll be right back.

587
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:05,657
Someone drop the dime,
called the coppers.

588
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:07,983
Someone on the Greek task force
phoned Bowman to say,

589
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:09,575
claiming there's booze.

590
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:11,226
- Come on.
- Chambers.

591
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:15,534
Execute plan B.

592
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:18,318
- But there's not time.
- I wouldn't be so sure

593
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:20,337
There's always time for plan B.

594
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,438
You fellas and spread out.

595
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:29,186
Hey, boys!

596
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:30,921
Care to join me for a drink?

597
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:32,513
What the hell are you doing?

598
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:36,123
Taking your cruise out on the open road,
see if I can hit a few miles an hour.

599
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:38,617
You wanna join me,
I'd love to have company!

600
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:41,476
Let him go,
we always know where to find him.

601
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:44,664
- Not with my squad car.
- This thing is kinda peppy.

602
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:46,615
You got a turbo on this thing?

603
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:54,669
You fellas spread out.

604
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:58,860
What's going on?

605
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,499
I have no idea.

606
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,017
I want you guys to check down here.

607
00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:14,327
I've noticed a lot of foot traffic
down these stairs tonight.

608
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:15,478
Foot traffic?

609
00:36:15,836 --> 00:36:17,690
There's been no foot traffic.

610
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,446
Let's go.

611
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:29,436
"Involuntarily, I glanced seaward.

612
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,121
"and distingued nothing,

613
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:34,556
"except the single green light.

614
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:37,032
"Minute,

615
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:39,042
"ran my nute."

616
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:41,145
Probably "my nute".

617
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:42,913
"My nute,

618
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:44,508
"and far away

619
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:47,144
"that might have been the end
of the dock.

620
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:50,094
"When I looked once more for Gatsby,

621
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,880
"he had vanished

622
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,674
"and I was alone again,

623
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,719
"in the unquiet darkness."

624
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,406
What the hell is this?

625
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:01,486
It's like a...

626
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:02,849
a literacy thing.

627
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,018
A literacy thing?

628
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:09,067
Yes, many of these poor boys

629
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:10,982
have trouble reading.

630
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:12,750
Nice work, Beaver.

631
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:14,596
I can read.

632
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:17,923
You're doing a great job.

633
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:21,438
The ZBZ sisters have been helping
them learn a little.

634
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:23,815
Secret philantropy, if you will.

635
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:26,127
They're a bit embarassed
about their deficiency.

636
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:28,257
So we give them a safe place to

637
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,644
practice.

638
00:37:43,506 --> 00:37:45,456
That was the best party ever.

639
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,612
Girls!

640
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:53,544
I'm ashamed of you, all of you.

641
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:55,955
And you, most of all.

642
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,321
I'm sorry.

643
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:01,259
We snap.

644
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,393
We don't clap.

645
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:06,363
And Casey Cartwright,
you have earned yourself

646
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:09,251
a grand round of snaps, right, girls?

647
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:15,797
This was truly a magical evening.

648
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:20,445
You see how much fun you can have when
you play by the rules and help other.

649
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,944
Come here.

650
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:32,869
I can't remember the last time
I stayed up past 11.

651
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:38,064
- Good night!
- Good night.

652
00:38:41,857 --> 00:38:43,607
I had an amazing evening.

653
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:45,303
Thanks, big sis.

654
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,125
OK, was Rebecca just being nice to you?

655
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:57,557
I'm too tired to worry about that now

656
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:00,432
OK, that was the most

657
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:03,913
stressful, exhausting evening
of my entire life.

658
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:07,807
We pulled it off.

659
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:15,148
And it's been almost a full 48h
since I last thought about Evan.

660
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,795
And tomorrow you'll think about him
even less,

661
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:21,641
And the next day even less.

662
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:24,711
And eventually,
it'll just be "What's his name".

663
00:39:25,892 --> 00:39:27,032
I hope so.

664
00:39:30,347 --> 00:39:32,438
I wish you were a boy and

665
00:39:32,558 --> 00:39:34,659
we could be together forever.

666
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:38,087
That's weird.

667
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:43,668
Why do I have to be the boy?

668
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:45,552
'Cause you're taller!

669
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:53,936
We want you to come back.

670
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:56,312
Look, Evan, I thought a lot about it.

671
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:58,189
Right, I just, with Trend...

672
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,795
Don't worry about Trend,
he decided to deactivate.

673
00:40:02,204 --> 00:40:04,954
That's convenient.
What about the other guys?

674
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,285
There's always gonna be guys
that don't like you.

675
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:09,721
Not everyone likes me.

676
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,202
That's true.

677
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,990
Thanks.

678
00:40:14,149 --> 00:40:17,050
I think you can't let the way
people feel about you

679
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,237
determine how you live your life.

680
00:40:19,902 --> 00:40:21,660
You're my little brother.

681
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,592
I garantee you I got your back.

682
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:27,323
So trust me.

683
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:30,697
And take this back.

684
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:39,092
At least think about it.

685
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,159
What you doing now?

686
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,776
I'm heading to the house to celebrate
Cappie's release from CRU jail.

687
00:40:57,777 --> 00:40:59,417
I'm not gonna be able to make it.

688
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,057
More movies?

689
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:02,190
Actually, no.

690
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,191
I'm going back to Omega Chi.

691
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:08,824
Are you kidding?

692
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:10,155
I belong there.

693
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:14,478
You can't run away
'cause things aren't perfect

694
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:15,977
So Evan wins?

695
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:19,249
I thought you said
it wasn't a competition.

696
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:23,488
Are you forgetting? It's the same
Evan Chamber who fought me at Dopplers

697
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:25,354
who humiliated my sister
at the carnival.

698
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:27,313
I don't know what you want me to say.

699
00:41:27,314 --> 00:41:28,314
Alright?

700
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:31,782
There're 2 sides to every story,
Evan can be a real

701
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:33,208
decent guy.

702
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:35,682
Are you saying
Casey deserved what he did to her?

703
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:39,450
I'm not.
You're perfectly justified to hate him.

704
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,004
I'm saying he's really gone back for me.

705
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,887
He's always been a good friend to me.

706
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:48,653
That's funny
'cause I thought I was your friend.

707
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:54,455
Look, our friendship

708
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,117
has always been
outside the Greek system.

709
00:41:57,237 --> 00:41:59,018
You always said, you're not gonna let

710
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,957
our houses get in the way
of us being friends.

711
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:03,353
So let's not lose that.

712
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,571
I see you later.

713
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,601
Hey heavy Poo!

714
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:32,818
You're here to give the dean
his morning foot massage.

715
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:36,525
You know, I don't think I've ever
seen you in the sunlight before noon.

716
00:42:36,526 --> 00:42:38,665
You're getting troubles
with the law again?

717
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,716
100 hours of community service.

718
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:42,415
I consider myself lucky though.

719
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,923
Could have been a lot worst,
I was the only one who got busted.

720
00:42:45,924 --> 00:42:48,611
And by the way, you're a total dushbag.

721
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,130
Why's that?

722
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:53,301
Because you raided out our party.

723
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:56,219
I knew it was someone
on the Greek task force

724
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,553
You're the only one
I know with personal vendetta.

725
00:42:58,554 --> 00:43:00,693
Still, pretty low.

726
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:02,599
even for you.

727
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,668
Now you'll think twice before trying
to pouch one of your pledges.

728
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:08,094
He came to us.

729
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:12,705
I don't know why I'm bothering
explaining myself to you. Take care.

730
00:43:12,706 --> 00:43:13,797
Bing.

731
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:17,944
- What did you call me?
- You heard.

732
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:22,008
Just to let you know,
there will be retribution.

733
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:24,942
Bring it.
