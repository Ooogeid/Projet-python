1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,110
In a land of myth and the time of magic,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,160
the destiny of a great kingdom

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,847
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

4
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:10,308
His name...

5
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:12,470
Merlin

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,830
Arthur... .

7
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,080
Arthur...

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,498


9
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:14,532


10
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:20,449
<font color="#4096d1">subtitle: chocolate</font>

11
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,129


12
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,260
What is it?

13
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,570
You really are a total buffoon, aren't you, Merlin?

14
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,810
I was just asking...         Who? Me or the deer?!

15
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,129
We're supposed to be hunting.

16
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:54,719
It requires speed, stealth and an agile mind.

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,090
So you are able to get by on two out of three, then?

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,390
What was that? Quiet!        Help!

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,890
No, no, I beg you. Mercy.

20
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,010
Help me!

21
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,710
Forbearnan firgenholt!

22
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,990
Stroke of luck.        And let that be a lesson to you!

23
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,479
What?

24
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,009
I was covering your back.

25
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:12,209
Are you all right? They didn't hurt you?

26
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,590
No... Thanks to you.

27
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,190
I'm Sophia. This is my father.

28
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,450
Arthur Pendragon...

29
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,360
at your service.

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,276
My name is Aulfric, heir of Tirmawr,

31
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,450
this is my daughter Sophia.

32
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,370
You're a long way from home. What brings you to Camelot?

33
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,180
Our home was sacked by raiders,

34
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,700
we barely escaped with what few possession we could carry.

35
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,430
These are dangerous times. What will you do?

36
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,578
We travel west to Caerleon where we have family

37
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:56,211
and I hope, a new life.

38
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,020
You must stay here a while, break your journey.

39
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,910
A noble family like yours is always welcome at Camelot.

40
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,370
Make sure you put her in a decent room.

41
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,240
The one next door is empty.

42
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,380
The one next door's fine.

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,890
Excellent, in fact.

44
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,080
Shut up, Merlin.        

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,463
I didn't say anything! You didn't have to.

46
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,979
I want to make it clear that my intentions towards Sophia

47
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,835
are completely honourable.

48
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,230
Put her in a room on the other side of the castle.

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,890
It's warmer, more comfortable.        Of course.

50
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,480
She is, um, very beautiful.

51
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,030
Yes, she is.

52
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,910
And if your intentions are honourable...

53
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,473
Oh, they are.Most definitely.

54
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:03,411
Then what's the problem staying next door?

55
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,740
There isn't one.

56
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,470
You've convinced me.

57
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,520
Put her in the room next to mine.

58
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,800
If you need anything, just let me know.

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,120
thank you.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,510
Who is that?        Sophia Tirmawr.

61
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,777
We rescued her in the woods.

62
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:33,102
Well, Arthur did most of the rescuing...

63
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:34,476
She can't stay here.

64
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,210
Well, the King said that she and her father

65
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,316
are welcome in Camelot.

66
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,490
Is everything OK?

67
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,780
Yes. Thank you.

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,080
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

69
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,540
Nonsense, my child. My favourite patient is always welcome.

70
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,820
I'm sorry about the mess.

71
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,112
Most of it's Merlin's.

72
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:07,152
If I'd known you were coming, I'd have tidied up.

73
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:09,754
It's not that... Your bench is on fire.

74
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:12,375
My bench is on fire? What are you...

75
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,800
My bench is on fire!

76
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,410
Here.

77
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,220
You're always getting me into trouble.

78
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,530
What brings you to this dark corner?

79
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,180
I had another dream.

80
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,150
I see.

81
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,860
I saw Arthur lying under water, drowning,

82
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,160
and there was a woman standing over him, watching him die.

83
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,390
And she's here. In Camelot.

84
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,061
The mind plays tricks.

85
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:54,467
It borrows from everyday life and plays out its own fantasy.

86
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:56,554
I had this dream before she came to Camelot.

87
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:58,123
You must be mistaken.

88
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,950
I know what I saw.

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,150
It was so real...

90
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,390
so vivid.

91
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,589
I saw him die, Gaius.

92
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,530
She's going to kill him.

93
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,880
These are just dreams, Morgana, nothing more.

94
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,043
Are you taking the sleeping draught I made up for you?

95
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,327
It doesn't help.

96
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,020
Here.

97
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,350
Try this.

98
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,030
It will induce a deeper sleep.

99
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,780
You've nothing to fear.

100
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,730
Thank you, Gaius.

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,380
Morgana...

102
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,420
Don't bother Uther about this - no need to worry him.

103
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,130
You can dispense with the unpleasantries - your payment.

104
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,780
I want more.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,040
My friends are dead because of you.

106
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,030
Yes. I'm sorry. Such a dreadful waste of a life.

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,870
If it's any consolation, you'll see them again soon.

108
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,590
Marouf kino toyno!

109
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,961
I'm taking Sophia out for a ride today.

110
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,524
You know, show her around.

111
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,540
Where do I come in to this?

112
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,417
I'm supposed to be on patrol with the guard

113
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,423
and my father this morning,

114
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,780
so I need you to cover for me.

115
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,880
What, and lie to the King?

116
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,710
No way. No, he'll see right through me.

117
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,721
He'll have me in the stocks

118
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:04,159
quicker than you can say "rotten tomatoes".

119
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,198
Merlin...I need you to do this for me

120
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,913
I am a terrible liar. I start sweating, 

121
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:11,332
my vision blurs, my brain stops working. 

122
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:13,047
Well, no change there, then.

123
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:15,760
Look,I promised Sophia I'd take her out.

124
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,437
If I don't turn up, it'll blow my chances.

125
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,430
You like her, then?        Yeah! What's not to like?

126
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,605
I want to spend some time with her,

127
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,459
but I need to get my father off my back.

128
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,640
I can't order you to lie to the King

129
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,840
but you'll be a friend for life if you do.

130
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,670
Go on, then. You don't want to keep her waiting.

131
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,820
Thanks, Merlin. I won't forget it.

132
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,130
You're sure it's her?

133
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,220
I could never forget that face.

134
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,090
You should speak to the King.        And tell him what?

135
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,597
That I can see the future?

136
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,665
If you think Arthur's life is in danger...

137
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:57,060
You know how he'd react.

138
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:59,597
You're his ward. He wouldn't harm you.

139
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:01,550
He hates magic more than he cares for me.

140
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,040
That's not true.        Would you care to put it to the test?

141
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,070
But what else can you do?

142
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,880
I'm going to have to try and stop her myself.

143
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,420
Where's my son?

144
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,697
I'm not sure where he is.

145
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:20,643
I, um, I think there's been a mistake.

146
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:22,609
But it's not his fault. I mean...

147
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,315
Stop gibbering and tell me where he is!

148
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:26,809
It's probably... No, it's definitely my fault.

149
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:29,009
Where is Arthur!?

150
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,120
He's not here.        I can see that.

151
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,813
Arthur wasn't sure his order,so he asked me to check with guard

152
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,587
to see if he was riding out this morning

153
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:37,544
and...well...I may have forgotten.

154
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,499
You forgot?         I'm sorry, My Lord.

155
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:43,340
I'm sure he would have been here had I told him.

156
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,630
If this was a time of war, I would have you flogged.

157
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,080
And since it's not, we'll let it go just this once?

158
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,910
I forgot how much fun this was(!)

159
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,150
The river's not far. It's just down here.

160
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,690
Arthur...wait.

161
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,690
What is it?

162
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,850
Tuch von phrixur ator.

163
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,350
You there.

164
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,310
Halt!

165
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,690
Sorry. Sorry?!

166
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,728
You nearly shot a crossbow in my face.

167
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,680
Are you OK?

168
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,150
Yes. Thanks to you.

169
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,504
They were searching for the bandits that attacked you yesterday.

170
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:04,247
Here.        Don't touch that!

171
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,320
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,870
Maybe we should go back?        It's fine.

173
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,331
I'm sorry, I was upset. 

174
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,482
Now, don't let this spoil our day together.

175
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:19,322
We were having such a nice time. Let's go down to the river.

176
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,742
I'm taking you back to Camelot.

177
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:22,120
Your father would never forgive me

178
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,438
if I let anything happen to you.

179
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,520
Have you been playing with your food again?

180
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,478
The King put me in the stocks.

181
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,372
What did you do this time?        Nothing.

182
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,150
Honestly, it wasn't my fault.

183
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,941
Arthur wanted to get out of going on a patrol with Uther

184
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:45,676
and the guard,

185
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,900
so I covered for him and took the blame.

186
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,450
And Arthur was prepared to let you do this?

187
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,840
It was his idea.

188
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,882
What made him neglect his duties?

189
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:56,972
Must have been something terribly important.

190
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:01,618
Sophia        The girl from the forest?

191
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,250
He wanted to take her out for the day. He is besotted.

192
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,300
But they've only just met.        I know.

193
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,800
I guess it must have been love at first sight.

194
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,200
Yes...

195
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,610
I suppose it must be.

196
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
Can I help?

197
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,466
Forgive me! The door was open. 

198
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,084
I thought someone may have broken in.

199
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,580
It looks like they have.

200
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,840
I apologise for imposing on you.

201
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,840
It won't happen again.

202
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,760
Make sure it doesn't.

203
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,370
You're sure you'll be all right?

204
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,850
Yes.

205
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,860
Thank you for today.

206
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,910
Good night, Arthur.

207
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,310
Sorry! Lady Morgana, isn't it? I'm Sophia.

208
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,364
What are you doing here? 

209
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,282
My father and I are guests of the King.

210
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:10,459
You're lying. I know what you're going to do to him, 

211
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:11,718
and I won't let it happen.

212
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:14,950
Does Arthur know you feel this way about him?

213
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,930
Of course he does.

214
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,050
I suspect he's already turned you down.

215
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,250
Don't think you can make a fool out of me.        I won't have to.

216
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,513
You're managing to do that well enough already. 

217
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:27,424
Stay away from him!        Or what?

218
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,250
Jealousy is such an unattractive trait in a women.

219
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,200
If anything happens to Arthur...

220
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,710
I'll find you.

221
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,720
However long it takes.

222
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,070
You've not been gone as long as I expected.

223
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,810
We were interrupted.        What happened?

224
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,112
I was nearly killed. 

225
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:59,434
For a moment, 

226
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:01,479
I felt what it would be like to die a mortal death.

227
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,050
He saved me.

228
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,670
Someone so weak, so feeble, saved ME.

229
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,100
I can't bear to be like this a moment longer.

230
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,940
You won't have to.

231
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,714
Once his heart is yours, 

232
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:17,635
the gates of Avalon will open once again for us

233
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:19,760
and we can regain our true form.

234
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,770
I need a little more time.

235
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,990
You must hurry. The physician can see us for what we truly are.

236
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,900
And he is not alone.

237
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,250
The Lady Morgana.

238
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,720
She fears her powers, 

239
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,200
but that will not keep her quiet for long.

240
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,740
Tomorrow, you have to finish the enchantment,

241
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,776
otherwise our chance to rid us of these mortal shells 

242
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:41,520
will be lost for ever.

243
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,770
You seem very fond of her.

244
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,730
You make that sound like a bad thing.      Not necessarily.

245
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,090
I've just never seen you fall under a woman's spell so quickly.

246
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,581
If you're jealous Morgana, it's OK to admit it. 

247
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,877
Don't flatter yourself!

248
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,070
Come on. Wouldn't be the first time, now, would it?

249
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,588
Arthur, I'm trying to protect you. 

250
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,142
She isn't what she seems.        Why?

251
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,770
What makes you say that?

252
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,240
I just have a feeling.

253
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,600
It's difficult to describe.

254
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,000
I had a dream...

255
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,340
a nightmare.

256
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,680
You really are very sweet, Morgana.

257
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,180
Why are you laughing?

258
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,800
You. Your feelings, bad dreams. 

259
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,640
you don't have to make these stuff up.

260
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,370
You can tell me the truth.

261
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,640
It's obvious you like me.

262
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,750
Less and less by the second.

263
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,170
All right. Whatever you say.

264
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,390
You're intolerable.

265
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,850
I just hope I'm wrong about her.

266
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,940
You're dressed!        Nothing gets past you, does it, Merlin.

267
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,305
 You're supposed to be wearing these.

268
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:03,776
Your father is bestowing a knighthood on 

269
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:04,734
one of your men this morning.

270
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:06,104
 I'm giving it a miss.

271
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,040
Won't the King mind?

272
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,680
Not if you cover for me. By the way, thanks for yesterday,

273
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,370
I heard you ended up in the stocks. Bad luck.

274
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,270
They were throwing potatoes. It's supposed to be rotten fruit.

275
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,070
I'm not sure there are hard-and-fast rules,

276
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,120
but if it's any consolation, I think it was worth it.

277
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:25,981
It went well?        Great. Fantastic...

278
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:28,740
She's incredible.

279
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,570
Don't worry. I'll find a way to get you out of it.

280
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,697
Just make sure you don't end up in the stocks this time.

281
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,227
 I won't!

282
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,244
I think I'm starting to get the hang of 

283
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,826
this whole deception lark.

284
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,250
Wait!

285
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,180
Careful.

286
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,100
Don't worry.

287
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,840
I will be.

288
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,850
Tuch von phrixur artur.        What are you doing?

289
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Cheek nom fogish.

290
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,770
Jamea mortharisher.

291
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,840
Tuch von phrixur artur.

292
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,620
Not again Merlin, surely?

293
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,980
You'd think the appeal of pelting the same person with fruit

294
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,980
would wear off after a while, but, oh, no!

295
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,130
I heard that Arthur wasn't at the knighting ceremony.

296
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,990
Yeah, he wanted to make the most of his time left with Sophia.

297
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,327
So you helped him?        I'm his servant. I had too. 

298
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:44,186
You shouldn't done that Merlin.

299
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,580
I fear that Sophia may not be all that she seems.

300
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,370
Why?

301
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,090
What do you know about seers?

302
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,093
Not much. They're supposed to be able to see the future.

303
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:58,017
 Like prophets.

304
00:19:58,017 --> 00:19:59,570
It's said to be an innate ability.

305
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,150
Those who have it are born that way.

306
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,111
Some aren't even aware that what they see is the future. 

307
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,903
It comes in their dreams.

308
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,090
What's this got to do with Sophia?

309
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,869
The night before she and Aulfric came to Camelot, 

310
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,356
Morgana had a dream.

311
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,180
Sophia was in it.        Before she arrived in Camelot?

312
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,220
I've been watching Morgana since she was very young.

313
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,490
Though I've tried to persuade myself otherwise,

314
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,281
I realised that some of the things 

315
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,139
she said she'd dreamt came to pass.

316
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,305
I kept it secret from Uther, of course. 

317
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:34,555
The gift of prophecy is too close to the work of magic.

318
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,510
You think Morgana is a seer?        No, I don't think it.

319
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,550
I fear it.

320
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:45,600
Morgana said she dreamt that Sophia killed Arthur.

321
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,500
Couldn't that have just been a dream?

322
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,889
Maybe the woman Morgana saw just looked like Sophia.

323
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:52,986
 That's what I hoped.

324
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,220
But Aulfric caught me in Sophia's room

325
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,480
and, in a flash of anger, his eyes changed colour.

326
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
Who are they?

327
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,640
It's not WHO they are that worries me.

328
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,420
It's WHAT they want with Arthur.

329
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,870
Our love is strong. You feel the same way, too.

330
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,510
If we were ever to be parted...

331
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,210
I'd never let that happen.

332
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,960
You may not have the choice.

333
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,450
There are some here who don't want us to be together.

334
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,150
I'll never let them come between us.

335
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,550
Because we are in love.

336
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,210
Because we are in love.

337
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,750
You must seek permission for us to marry...

338
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,800
so that we can be together.        Till death do us part.

339
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,680
Tuch von phrixur artur.

340
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,280
Till death do us part.

341
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,870
He's ready. Tomorrow he'll do what we need him to.

342
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,930
Good, you have done well. I must go to the elders.

343
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,780
I seek an audience with the Sidhe elders!

344
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,210
Not gwithim sar!

345
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,900
Dar labran trimshah!

346
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,460
I come before you to plead

347
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,200
for the chance to win passage back to Avalon

348
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,270
and a life of immortality!

349
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,369
Your punishment for killing another sidhe 

350
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:40,490
is a mortal body and a mortal life.

351
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,600
You will never be able to return to Avalon.

352
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,200
The crime was mine, not my daughter's.

353
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,400
The gates of Avalon remain closed to your daughter.

354
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:58,090
Unless the soul of a mortal prince be offered up to them.

355
00:24:58,269 --> 00:24:59,822
 Thank you.

356
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,700
An immortal life for my daughter is all that I desire,

357
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,685
so I promise you the soul of the greatest prince of all. 

358
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:12,038
Arthur Pendragon!

359
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:52,070
Avalon. What you saw at the lake. It's Avalon. It must be.

360
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,300
What's...        The land of eternal youth.

361
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,440
Mortals are only supposed to glimpse it the moment before death.

362
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,540
I've seen it and I'm still here.

363
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,910
Extraordinary. What did it look like?

364
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,811
Does it matter? They're going to sacrifice Arthur 

365
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:05,062
and we don't even know who "they" are yet.

366
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,932
We do now. 

367
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:09,250
I found writing like this on the top of Aulfric's staff.

368
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,850
It's Ogham, an ancient script.

369
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,330
Abas ocus bithe. Duthectad bithlane.

370
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,710
"To hold life and death in your hands."

371
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,976
From the writing on his staff and what you saw at the lake, 

372
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:21,649
I'm afraid now I'm certain.

373
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,730
We're dealing with the Sidhe.

374
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,370
That does not sound like a good thing.

375
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,477
They're masters of enchantment. 

376
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:30,582
Do you think Arthur's been enchanted?

377
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,670
Almost certainly.

378
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,620
I'm afraid Morgana's dream is coming true.

379
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,957
Our request this audience, Father, 

380
00:26:40,957 --> 00:26:43,170
to discuss a matter of great importance.

381
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,093
It cannot have escaped your attention that 

382
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:49,812
I and Lady Sophia Tirmawr

383
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,230
have grown very close.        Not too close, I hope.

384
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,940
We're in love.

385
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,798
Which is why I come before you today 

386
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,620
I assume you're joking.

387
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,880
No. I'm going to marry her.

388
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,780
But you only met two days ago.

389
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,450
We're in love.

390
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,190
In love?

391
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,140
We had no idea that you were such a romantic, had we, Morgana?

392
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,200
No, he's full of surprises.

393
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,080
I'm going to marry her.

394
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,780
I don't care what either of you think about it.

395
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,540
I thought you'd come to ask my permission.

396
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,900
Out of courtesy, nothing more.

397
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,290
Guards, door.

398
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,590
You've forgotten whose court you're standing in.

399
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,120
You won't stop me.

400
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,860
If I want to marry her, I will.

401
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,010
Arrest Sophia and Aulfric Tirmawr.

402
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,010
What are you doing?

403
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,695
And inform the executioner 

404
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:11,062
his services will be required tomorrow morning.

405
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:12,380
You can't do this. 

406
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,684
Yes, I can, and you show me some respect, I will!

407
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,670
Release them.

408
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,510
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

409
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,040
Sophia is no doubt your first love

410
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,330
but she certainly won't be the only one.

411
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,040
Enjoy yourself while you can.

412
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,210
You're not planning on springing any surprises on me, are you?

413
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,294
You should be taking this more seriously. 

414
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:54,112
He's young, foolish and in love.

415
00:28:54,147 --> 00:28:56,920
Give it a week and he'll be chasing after the next girl.

416
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,282
Sophia won't let that happen. 

417
00:28:58,282 --> 00:28:59,833
Do you bear a grudge against her?

418
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,522
There's something about her I don't trust. 

419
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:03,926
You've seen the way Arthur's changed.

420
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:06,144
He's a fool in love.        She's dangerous. 

421
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,617
Dangerous? To who?

422
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:10,310
Arthur.        Why do you say that?

423
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,580
I just have a sense, a feeling.

424
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,140
And what has she done to make you have this feeling?

425
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,370
Nothing, yet, it's what she's going to do.

426
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,790
I don't know how to tell you this.        Try.

427
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,110
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

428
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,478
I've just seen girls like this before. 

429
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:45,859
They string men along and then drop them.

430
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,560
I don't want to see him get hurt.

431
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,969
I know you want to protect him 

432
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:52,558
but some lessons we have to learn for ourselves.

433
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,810
He'll hurt for a week and then Sophia will be forgotten.

434
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,270
I hope so. Are you sure there's nothing else behind this?

435
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,080
Yes, it's nothing.

436
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,480
Get out. I thought the King was a bit harsh.

437
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,540
I don't need sympathy, Merlin, especially not from you.

438
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,130
But I did think he had a point.

439
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,450
I ordered you to get out. Now leave me!

440
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,930
I know you think you're in love with Sophia...

441
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,082
Who are you to tell me what I'm thinking?

442
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:29,824
 I'm your friend.

443
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,200
No, Merlin, you're my servant.

444
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,720
You don't know what you're doing.

445
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,210
She's cast a spell on you. You're enchanted.

446
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,580
I told you people would try to keep us apart.

447
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,850
I know. I won't let that happen.

448
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,790
Don't listen to her, she's controlling you.

449
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,350
We can elope together.

450
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,150
Get away from this place. These people. I saw you.

451
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,580
I followed him. They're planning to sacrifice you.

452
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,600
You let your servant talk to your guests this way.

453
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,066
I know what you're going to do. 

454
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:04,042
I followed you to the lake and heard everything

455
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,980
You must believe me.

456
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,640
Don't listen to him, Arthur.

457
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,660
Let's go. Let's leave tonight.

458
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,160
She's going to kill you.

459
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,680
Sophia plans to sacrifice you to buy a life of immortality.

460
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,430
If you go with her, you'll die.

461
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,230
It doesn't make sense. We're in love.

462
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,870
They're magical beings. Look at the writing on the staff.

463
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,740
Look at his eyes.

464
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,330
Look at him. Do you believe me now?

465
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,360
Arthur, do you see?        I see everything.

466
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,057
He's gone, Arthur's gone with her. She's taken him. 

467
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,131
Slow down.

468
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:16,303
I know you don't believe me 

469
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:17,823
but I'm so sure it's going to happen.

470
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:20,414
My dream will come true.        I do believe you. 

471
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:21,761
I've got to tell Uther.

472
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:23,792
You can't.        I've got to do something, 

473
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,218
if I don't then Arthur'll die.

474
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:26,890
You can't tell Uther about your dream.

475
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,230
If Uther thinks you've got the seers' power, 

476
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,890
he'll charge you with witchcraft.

477
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,950
I don't have a choice. 

478
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,865
I couldn't live with myself if I'd let him die.

479
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:34,446
 Wait.

480
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:37,974
We've known each other a long time, you trust me don't you?

481
00:32:37,974 --> 00:32:39,338
 Yes, you know I do.

482
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:40,580
Then trust me now. 

483
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,130
Stay here and don't say a word to anyone about this.

484
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,720
But Arthur...        I'll take care of it.

485
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,400
Where are you going?        To find someone who can help.

486
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,490
Merlin! What happened to you?

487
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,570
Aulfric. Where's Arthur?

488
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,700
I have got to go after him. What's that buzzing noise?

489
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,500
Careful, Merlin, you can barely stand up.        I have to go.

490
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,320
You can't, not in this state.

491
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,869
You owe it to your powers that you survived this at all. 

492
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,007
I'll be fine, he needs me.

493
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,536
Has that buzzing stopped?

494
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:30,775
 Yes.        Liar.

495
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,880
I have to go, Gaius. He'll die if I don't.

496
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,820
The Sidhe are a vicious people. You must be careful.

497
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,510
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. Merlin?

498
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,890
This way.        Just testing.

499
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,470
Go. They're waiting for you.

500
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,680
I don't understand. You're coming too.

501
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,470
Only one of us can pass through. This was never meant for me.

502
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,700
I only wanted this so we could both return to Avalon.

503
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,530
Your destiny is on a different path to mine.

504
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,640
It is my fate to live a mortal life.

505
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,870
I don't want to leave you.        You must.

506
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,410
Once the ceremony begins you must go through with it.

507
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,188
The elders expect a soul. 

508
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,432
If they don't get his they will take yours.

509
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,510
Goodbye.

510
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,860
I will never forget you.

511
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:17,398


512
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,210
Father! No! No! Og kelis!

513
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,460
Arthur! Arthur!

514
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,400
Arthur?

515
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,950
Arthur? What happened?

516
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,550
Where am I?

517
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,270
Can you remember anything?

518
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,790
Ow! Oh, my head!

519
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,210
There was a girl.

520
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,390
Sophia, she...

521
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,550
I asked my father something about her, I asked him...

522
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,990
What was I thinking?

523
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,260
Well, we did wonder.

524
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,730
Especially when you eloped with her last night.

525
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,290
I did what?        Merlin had to bring you back to Camelot.

526
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,395
I don't recall any of this. It must've been some blow.

527
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,829
What blow? 

528
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:15,674
Well, when I caught up with you 

529
00:39:15,674 --> 00:39:16,946
I couldn't persuade you to return

530
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,180
you were beyond reason.

531
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,130
So I had to make you.

532
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,110
You managed to knock me out?

533
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,970
Yep. With a lump of wood.

534
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,970
He only did it to bring you back safely.

535
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,650
No-one can know about this.

536
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,930
Any of it.

537
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,070
Is that understood?

538
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,740
When you failed to show up for patrol this morning,

539
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,540
I feared you'd eloped with Sophia in a fit of passion.

540
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,350
I wish he had.

541
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,637
Because then I wouldn't be standing in front of you 

542
00:39:58,637 --> 00:40:00,654
feeling like an idiot...again.

543
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,470
This is becoming a near daily occurrence for you.

544
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,700
There was a mistake. And I would not say it was anyone's fault.

545
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,440
Not really.

546
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,790
You could say it was mine.

547
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,500
Could somebody tell me what happened?

548
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,750
Well... Someone with a brain.

549
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,217
After Sophia left, 

550
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:24,250
I wanted to take my mind off her so I went for a hunt.

551
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,710
And killing things mends a broken heart?

552
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,520
No, but it's good fun.

553
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,973
Merlin was meant to inform you that 

554
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,213
I wouldn't be back until later today.

555
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,490
Have you some kind of mental affliction?

556
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,440
Probably.        I'm looking into it, sire.

557
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,010
Well, I hope for our sake you find a cure.

558
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,260
Or we'll find ourselves with a food shortage on our hands.

559
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,130
Food shortage?

560
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,660
Morgana.

561
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,350
I've had some troubled nights.

562
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,260
I prepared another draught for you.

563
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,440
Have the dreams stopped?

564
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,550
Arthur told me what actually happened.

565
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,800
You must have hit him round the head really hard.

566
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,410
Yeah. I feel really bad about that.

567
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,855
Here you are. 

568
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,955
Remember, every night just before you go to sleep.

569
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,410
Thank you, Gaius.

570
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,790
She must never find out the truth.

571
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,350
Why not? She had a premonition that helped save Arthur's life.

572
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,787
It could've cost her her own. 

573
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:53,561
If Uther ever found out, things would never be the same again.

574
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,910
It must remain a secret.

575
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,210
Is she like me?

576
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,960
Can she use magic?

577
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,050
No-one's like you, Merlin.

578
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,220
But she has the gift?

579
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,860
For her sake, I hope not.

580
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:36,541


581
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:39,300
You should not protect this boy.

582
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,419
He's a druid. His kind would see me dead 

583
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:44,331
and you would help them.

584
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,960
If the boy lives you cannot fulfil your destiny.

585
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,250
Enough!

586
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,229
We need your help. 

587
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:53,565
So now you want me to risk my neck too.

588
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,930
You're telling me that little boy is going to kill Arthur?

9999
