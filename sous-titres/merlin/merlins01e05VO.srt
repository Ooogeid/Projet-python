1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
In a land of myth and time of magic,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,120
the destiny of a great kingdom rests of shoulders on a young boy.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,040
His name...Merlin.

4
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,980
Run run!

5
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,630
It's gone.

6
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,300
You saved my life.

7
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,470
I'm Merlin.

8
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,160
Lancelot.

9
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:50,592


10
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:55,645


11
00:01:55,872 --> 00:02:02,073


12
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:13,620


13
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,100
The wound is superficial.

14
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,800
The fever will pass.

15
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,180
He should be fine by morning.

16
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,070
What creature could've done this?

17
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,720
We found no tracks in or out.

18
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,470
What the villagers say must be true.

19
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,640
It has wings.

20
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,150
and

21
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,230
what?

22
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,130
..and it took no livestock - only people.

23
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,500
Whatever it is,  it has a taste for human flesh.

24
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,380
Post sentries at all the outlying villages.

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,260
Put the lookouts on full alert.

26
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,520
If this thing should make for Camelot,

27
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,940
we must be ready.

28
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,460
Ever since I was a child, I've dreamed of coming here.

29
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,400
It's my life's ambition to join the knights of Camelot.

30
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,920
I know what you're thinking. I...I expect too much.

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,980
After all, who am I?

32
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,880
They have their pick of the best and bravest in the land.

33
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,930
Lancelot.

34
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,030
Yes.

35
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,310
They're going to love you.

36
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,600
They are?

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,470
I've seen you in action.

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,620
You could shame Arthur himself.

39
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,980
I hardly think so.

40
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,570
In fact, you know what I'll do?

41
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,300
I'll talk to him right now.

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,130
Yo know Arthur?

43
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,480
Oh, yes.

44
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,860
Right, you jumped-up dung beetle,

45
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,450
this is it final test.

46
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,900
Pass this and you're knight at Camelot,

47
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,100
Fail, and you're no-one.

48
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,240
You face the most feared of all foes, the ultimate killing machine.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,910
You face me.

50
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,970
Your challenge - the last one minute, free combat.

51
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,880
Grimond, second son of Wessex.

52
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,020
Your times starts now.

53
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,070
Take him away.

54
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,500
He's the third to fail this month.

55
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,150
How can I defend Camelot with rubbish like that?

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,410
I think I might be able to help.

57
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,890
You, Merlin?

58
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,110
You have no idea what it takes to be knight

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,310
courage, fortitude, discipline.

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,940
No, of course I don't. But I do know someone who dose.

61
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,010
Yeah?

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,510
Save my life.

63
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,890
That's blown it for starters!

64
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,530
He's really good, honestly.

65
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,530
I'm sure he's terrific.

66
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,900
You forget Camelot's first code.

67
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,780
What?

68
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,900
The first code.

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,120
Only noblemen can be knights.

70
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,770
So unless your friend is a nobleman...

71
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,670
He is ... a nobleman.

72
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,560
- Is he?  - Absolutely.

73
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,190
Very well. Bring him to the training ground tomorrow.

74
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,830
Make sure he brings his seal of nobility.

75
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,330
Thanks, Arthur. You wont't regret it.

76
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,930
Well? Did you speak to him?

77
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,920
I spoke to him.

78
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,050
And?

79
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,360
And...

80
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,710
He'd like to meet you.

81
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,070
Yes!

82
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,660
Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,270
Hey, it's no problem, really.

84
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,510
It was nothing.

85
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,470
You're not a nobleman by any chance, are you?

86
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,480
A nobleman? No. Good lord, No.

87
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,720
Why do you ask?

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
It's just that...

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,705
The first code of Camelot states that

90
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:52,790
only those of noble blood can serve as knight.

91
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,141
Uther created the knights to protect this kingdom

92
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:56,690
from those who wish to destroy it.

93
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,120
He knew he'd have to trust each of his knights with his life.

94
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,280
So he chose those who'd sworn allegiance to him.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,110
The nobility.

96
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,280
Thus the first code of Camelot was born.

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,930
And ever since that day, only sons of noble families

98
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,580
have served as knights.

99
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,750
That is not fair.

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,980
Fair or unfair, that's the way it is.

101
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,850
I'm sorry, Lancelot.

102
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,600
Truly I am.

103
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,160
Why do you want to be a knight so much?

104
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,780
When I was a boy, my village was attacked by raiders from northern plains.

105
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,560
They were slaughtered where they stood -

106
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,500
my father, my mother, everyone.

107
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,160
I alone escaped.

108
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,540
I vowed that day that never again would I be helpless in the face of tyranny.

109
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,240
I made swordcraft my life.

110
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,790
Every waking hour since that day I devoted to the art of combat.

111
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,860
When I was ready, I set forth for Camelot.

112
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,090
And now it seems my journey ends.

113
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,580
Everything I've fought for - wasted.

114
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,740
I give you my word,

115
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,660
whatever it takes, I will make this right.

116
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,700
Homework.

117
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,940
(spell)

118
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,040
Come on, come on yes!

119
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,430
It's, um, a real page-turner.

120
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,150
What's that?

121
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,840
This is your seal of nobility.

122
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,860
I don't understand.

123
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,250
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lancelot,

124
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,640
fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbira.

125
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,920
No, Merlin, no.

126
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,630
So you don't want to be knight then.

127
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,270
Of course I do!

128
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,630
What? The rules don't allow it?

129
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,320
Damn the rules. The rules are wrong.

130
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,970
But it's a lie. It's against everything that stands for.

131
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,910
You have as much right to be a knight as any man. I know it.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,110
But the rules, Merlin...

133
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,470
We're not breaking the rules.

134
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,300
We're bending them.That's all.

135
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,500
You get your foot in the door.

136
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,470
After that, you'll be judged on your merit alone.

137
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,890
And if you succeed, if they make you a knight,

138
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,330
it'll be because you have earned it, noble or not.

139
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,970
I can't change the way things are done here,

140
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,820
but you can... if you let me help you.

141
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,210
This is very kind of you, uh...

142
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,720
Gwen.

143
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,470
Short for Guinevere. Ah.

144
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,590
Then thank you, Guinevere.

145
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,770
Don't thank me. Thank Merlin.

146
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,480
Merlin would do anything for anyone.

147
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,350
Sorry, can you raise your arms?

148
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,090
Thank you. Sorry.

149
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,770
I think it's great that Merlin's got you this chance.

150
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,020
We need men like you.

151
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,490
You do?

152
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,240
Well, not me personally but, you know, Camelot.

153
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,000
Camelot needs knights.

154
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,220
Not just Arthur and his kind,

155
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,550
but ordinary people like you and me.

156
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,140
I'm not a knight yet, my lady.

157
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,310
And I'm not a lady.

158
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,490
Sorry, I...

159
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,050
Ok, we're done.

160
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,940
I should have these ready in no time.

161
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,800
It's nice to meet you, Lancelot.

162
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,520
She seems lovely. Guievere.

163
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,330
Oh, yeah, yeah, she is.

164
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,100
And the best seamstress in Camelot, I promise.

165
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,850
Are you two...you know?

166
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,690
No. No, no.

167
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,270
Just friends.

168
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,320
One.

169
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,520
Two.

170
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,250
Three.

171
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,310
Four.

172
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,440
One.

173
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,060
Two.

174
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,180
Three.

175
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,040
You certainly look the part.

176
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,310
Doesn't he just?

177
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,810
I dont feel it.

178
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,660
That'll do for today.

179
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,320
Well done.

180
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,960
Here's your chance. Go for it.

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,750
Yes? Lancelot, fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbria.

182
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,050
Lance-a-lot?

183
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,950
My servant mentioned you.

184
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,430
Got your seal?

185
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,230
Sire.

186
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,010
Sluggish reactions.

187
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,760
On a battlefield, you'd be dead by now.

188
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,020
Come back when you're ready.

189
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm ready now, sire.

190
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,610
You are, are you?

191
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,140
Fine. You can start by cleaning out the stables.

192
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,710
I'm sorry about Lancelot.

193
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,400
I could see you were upset.

194
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,900
Oh...you know, that's life.

195
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,220
You win some, you lose some.

196
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,820
You're taking it very well.

197
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,070
I have to say. Very mature.

198
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,550
Thank you, Gaius.

199
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,630
How'd it go?

200
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,870
He found work at the stables.

201
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,590
I see.

202
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,670
And the truth, before I lose my temper.

203
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,050
He's, uh... trying out for the knights.

204
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,950
The first code of Camelot has never been broken for any man.

205
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,900
What have you done, Merlin?

206
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,770
I bent the rules a little.

207
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,440
But they're wrong, they're unfair.

208
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,330
You bent the rules using magic?

209
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,640
It was nothing, honestly.

210
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,880
It was more of a trick than actual magic.

211
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,960
Your magic is not toy for you to use or abuse as you see fit.

212
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,410
I know. Then why did you do it?

213
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,830
I owe Lancelot my life.

214
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,370
I am paying for that debt the only way I can

215
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,500
by giving him the opportunity he deserves.

216
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,700
If you want to punish me for it, go ahead.

217
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,290
Not bad.

218
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,420
Would you like me sweep the guardhouse agian, sire?

219
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,980
It certainly needs sweeping.

220
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,950
First, I'd like you to kill me.

221
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,830
Sire.

222
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,960
Come on. Don't pretend you dont want to.

223
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,250
Hell, if I were you, I'd want to.

224
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,400
Come on.

225
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,480
Come on, Lancelot.

226
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,850
You're not beating a carpet.

227
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,540
Congratulations, Lancelot.

228
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,340
You just made basic trainning.

229
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,020
You're safe now. I promise.

230
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,570
How is she? OK.

231
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,850
What happened to these people?

232
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,480
Their village was attacked by a winged monster.

233
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,330
I'd hunt this thing, but I cant track a creature through the air.

234
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,700
You dont have to track it.

235
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,510
First Greensward, then Willowdale.

236
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,700
It's heading south towards the mouth of the valley.

237
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,760
To Camelot.

238
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,470
You must prepare your knights, Arthur.

239
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,890
Have faith, Father. We'll be ready.

240
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,780
The wings of an eagle and the body of a lion.

241
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:38,100
The wings of an eagle and the body of a lion.

242
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,670
The beast is heading for Camelot.

243
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,900
It's fast and agile,

244
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,600
but big enough to hit and to hit hard.

245
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,830
Starting today on training routines,

246
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,590
we'll concertrate on an attack strategy.

247
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,740
We dont have much time.

248
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,880
Dismisssed.

249
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,380
Yes Lancelot.

250
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,840
Is there anything I can do, sire?

251
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,510
I knwo in the event of battle, only a knight may serve.

252
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,610
That's correct and you are not yet a knight,

253
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,580
which is why I'm bringing your test forward.

254
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,140
You can face me in the morning.

255
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,580
Well, here we are - your final challenge.

256
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,310
Succeed and you join the elite.

257
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,880
Fail and your journey ends here.

258
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,280
Lancelot, fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbria...

259
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,210
...your time starts now.

260
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,280
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,130
Shame.

262
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,140
Do you submit, sire?

263
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,110
On your knees.

264
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,980
Arise, Sir Lancelot, Knigh of Camelot.

265
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,780
Who is this man?

266
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,670
He seems to have come out of nowhere.

267
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,700
I know. He's been a bit of a surprise to all of us.

268
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,500
You do us a great honour, Sir Lancelot.

269
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,250
The knighthood is the very foundation of Camelot.

270
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,950
The honour is all mine, sire.

271
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,220
You father would be very proud.

272
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,700
Yes sire.

273
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,130
I've not seen Lord Eldred for many years,

274
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,110
longer than I'd imagined it seems.

275
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,270
Last time I saw him, he only had four sons.

276
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,440
Well...here I am.

277
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,480
Indeed you are.

278
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,719
And I've kept you too long already.

279
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,130
Enjoy the celebrations.

280
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,160
Sire.

281
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,600
Take this seal to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the court genealogist.

282
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,910
I want his opinion by morning.

283
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,130
Look at him, Gaius.

284
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,720
Dose Lancelot not deserve this moment?

285
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,780
I never said he didn't.

286
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,240
But destiny and deserts are not the same thing.

287
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,800
You played God, Merlin.

288
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,579
You set him on a path of your choosing.

289
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,400
You brought him triumph but the future is uncertain.

290
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,109
I dont know what it said in you invitation,

291
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,890
but in mine, it said celebration.

292
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,910
Point taken.

293
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,540
Don't come back too late.

294
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,680
All right.

295
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,900
Here's trouble.

296
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,850
Tell me, do you think her...beautiful?

297
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,300
Yes sire, I do.

298
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,770
Yeah, I suppose she is.

299
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,250
You know what? I think our Sir Lancelot might have eyes for you, Gwen.

300
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,770
Dont be silly. What if he did? Would it be so bad?

301
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,480
He's not really my type.

302
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,160
Well, there's a surprise.

303
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,405
Sometimes I wonder if you'd know your type,

304
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:43,090
if he was standing right next to you.

305
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,310
You're probably right.

306
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,510
Oh, thank you.

307
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,864
So come on - just for the sake of argument,

308
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:57,380
if you had to, Arthur or Lancelot?

309
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,920
I don't have to and I never will.

310
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,260
Oh, you are no fun, Gwen.

311
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:12,530
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to our new recruit,

312
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,480
our new knight of Camelot, Sir Lancelot.

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,720
Two yards of ale? Two miles, more like.

314
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,376
Good morning gentlemen.

315
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:37,450
Dont look at it. Dont smell it, just down it in one.

316
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,270
Better? Good.

317
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,790
Can't have you nodding off first day on the job, Lancelot.

318
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,370
Sir Lancelot, if you dont mind.

319
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,280
What are you doing?

320
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,020
King's orders.

321
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,650
Stop!

322
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,590
Tell him what you told me.

323
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,130
These credentials are faked.

324
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,270
The seal itself is faultless.

325
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,150
Forgery of the highest possible standard,

326
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,780
but a forgery it must be.

327
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,620
There is no record of

328
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,400
a fifth son of Lord Eldred of Northumbria.

329
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,570
-Therefore, he... -Lied.

330
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,160
Do you deny it?

331
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,600
No, sire.

332
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,170
You've broken the first code of Camelot.

333
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,100
You've brought shame upon yourself and upon us.

334
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,940
You're not worthy of knighthood.

335
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,200
You never were and you never will be.

336
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,000
Get him out of my sight.

337
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,650
Sire...

338
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,630
Do you contest my judgment?

339
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,510
His deception was inexcusable.

340
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,380
But he meant no harm, sire. I'm sure of it.

341
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,270
He only wished to serve.

342
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,650
The first code is a sacred bond of trust.

343
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,300
It is what binds the knights together.

344
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,990
How can you trust a man who's lied to you?

345
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,790
I don't know what to say to you, Lancelot.

346
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,740
-You're not to blame. -Yes, I am.

347
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,410
I pushed you. I made you lie.

348
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,880
The choice was mine.

349
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,680
My punishment is mine to bear, and mine to bear alone.

350
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,750
I wish there was something I could do.

351
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,710
There is.

352
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,770
You can stop blaming yourself.

353
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,360
Merlin?

354
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Whatever you do, you don't say I told you so.

355
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,420
I have no wish to gloat.

356
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,550
What's done is done.

357
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,410
Here, come and take a look at this.

358
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,150
I've realised my mistake.

359
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,550
I've been looking for the creature in the wrong place,

360
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,280
The records of all known living things in the kingdom.

361
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,680
Then I thought,

362
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,330
What about creatures only recorded in legend? In myth?

363
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,150
And I just discovered this.

364
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,400
That is it! That's the monster!

365
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,070
On me! On me!

366
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,510
Defence!

367
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,880
What's happening?

368
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,460
Charge!

369
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,750
You said your knights were the best in the land.

370
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,660
You proved that today.

371
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,970
All I know is it's still out there.

372
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,510
Let's not wait for it.

373
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,890
The kingdom has been menaced by this creature for too long.

374
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,810
We finish this now.

375
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,610
Sire, if I may?

376
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:29,670
Gaius?

377
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,810
I've researched this creature, sire.

378
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,970
I believe it to be a griffin.

379
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,940
A griffin?

380
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,840
What's in a name?

381
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,060
Griffin is a creature of magic.

382
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,960
I don't have time for this, physician.

383
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,720
It is born of magic, sire,

384
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,150
and it can only be killed by magic.

385
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,690
You are mistaken.

386
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,590
It's a creature of flesh and blood like any other.

387
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,160
Arthur proved that today.

388
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,500
I'm not so sure, father.

389
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,530
I think there may be some truth in what he says.

390
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,510
What truth?

391
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,290
The griffin was unharmed, sire.

392
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,840
Our weapons were useless against it.

393
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,890
Useless?

394
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,410
I think not.

395
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,940
No. It's tasted our steel once.

396
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,820
The next time will be its last.

397
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,040
When will your knights be ready to ride again?

398
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,280
An hour, maybe two.

399
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,830
Good. We finish this tonight.

400
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,060
Is it true...

401
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,180
that the griffin can only be killed by magic?

402
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,950
Yes, Merlin. I'm certain of it.

403
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,680
If Arthur rides out against it, he'll die.

404
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,730
Then he must be stopped.

405
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,250
Uther must see reason.

406
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,060
Where magic is concered, our king is blind to reason.

407
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,740
And yet,

408
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,050
magic is our only hope.

409
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,510
You're not suggesting...

410
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,390
It is your destiny, Merlin.

411
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,130
The true purpose of your magic.

412
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,780
You saw it, Gaius. I can't go up against that thing.

413
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,390
But if you do not, then Arthur will surely perish.

414
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,590
No, no. This is madness.

415
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,060
I don't have magic that powerful. There must be another way.

416
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,320
This's the only way.

417
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,010
Do you even care what's happening to me?

418
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,390
Do this Merlin! Do that Merlin! Kill the griffin, Merlin!

419
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,010
I just sit here warm my feet by fire

420
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,930
Merlin!

421
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:35,310
Merlin... you are the only thing I care about in all this world.

422
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,380
I would give my life for you without a thought.

423
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,660
But for what? I cant save Arthur.

424
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,810
It is not my destiny. You know.

425
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,610
I am sorry.

426
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,870
I dont know what else I can say.

427
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,440
Then I'll say it for you.

428
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,220
We have two hours to find a way to kill that thing.

429
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,240
I should have known. How could I have been so stupid?

430
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,880
You don't look like a knight!

431
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,560
-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry too.

432
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,800
Because you fight like a knight.

433
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,160
And I need... Camelot needs...

434
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,040
-The creature...-We could not kill it.

435
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,550
I have never faced its like.

436
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,280
I faced it myself, sire.

437
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,740
Some days past. I struck it full square.

438
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,610
I wondered how it endured.

439
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:51,040
There are those that believe this creature, this griffin,

440
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,790
Is a  creature of magic, that only magic can destroy it.

441
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,850
Do you believe this?

442
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,620
It doesnt matter what I believe, the use of magic is not permitted.

443
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,650
The knights must prevail with steel and sinew alone.

444
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,800
Sire...

445
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,810
There's a horse waiting outside.

446
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,710
Thank you. Thank you, sire.

447
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,690
Lancelot...take it and never return to this place.

448
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,790
No.

449
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,190
No, please, it's not my freedom I seek.

450
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,550
I only wish to serve with hornour.

451
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,080
I know.

452
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,160
Then let me ride with you.

453
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,360
I cannot.

454
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,790
My father knows nothing of this. I release you, but can do no more.

455
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,960
Now go before I change my mind.

456
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,850
There. You must do this for Arthur.

457
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,760
I've never cast a spell of enchantment this powerful.

458
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,440
Nothing less will kill it.

459
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,310
Here. Try.

460
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,940
You have it within you. I know you do.

461
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,000


462
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,780
Don't worry Merlin. We've plenty of time.

463
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,380
Sorry to disturb you, my lady.

464
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,710
Lancelot, What are you doing here?

465
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,740
There's no time, I need weapons, armour.

466
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,850
What's it about?

467
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,540
Arthur's in peril.

468
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,550
I must do what I can to protect him.

469
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,550
It's my duty, knight or not.

470
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,890
You really believe that, dont you?

471
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,020
Yes my lady.

472
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,670
Lancelot, I don't believe I've ever met your like before.

473
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,250
Guinevere, if I should not return...

474
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,910
Don't go Lancelot. Please.

475
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,400
But go I must.

476
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,350
It's time.

477
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,230


478
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,230


479
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,650
Dont worry, Merlin, I know you're trying.

480
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,230
And failing. If Arthur dies because I'm not good enough...

481
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,490
Merlin!

482
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,220
Merlin! Lancelot's ridding out to kill the griffin!

483
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,350
He's what?

484
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,470
Merlin!

485
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm coming with you.

486
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,070
No, you're not.

487
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,480
Try and stop me.

488
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,810
You're not a soldier.

489
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,190
Suit yourself

490
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,980
Arthur needs all the help he can get. Now let's go.

491
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,660
For Camelot.

492
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,080
For Camelot!

493
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:23,634
Arthur!

494
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:24,394
Arthur

495
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:27,764
Well?

496
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,190
He's alive.

497
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,540
Ok, Merlin. It's now or never.

498
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,180
Bregdan anweald gafeluec.

499
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,650
Bregdan anweald gafeluec.

500
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,010
Bregdan anweald gafeluec.

501
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,220
Bregdan anweald gafeluec.

502
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,900
Yes!

503
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,450
Lancelot.

504
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,250
Sire.

505
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,540
Yo did it!

506
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,970
You killed it. Lancelot!

507
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,600
You did it?

508
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,290
I did it.

509
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,630
Thank God!

510
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,390
You did it, my son. You did it!

511
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,590
Not I, Father. It was Lancelot.

512
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,160
What's he doing here?

513
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,910
Father, I can explain.

514
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,060
You! Wait outside.

515
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,790
You have no right to...

516
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,860
What are they doing?

517
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,830
Deciding my fate.

518
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,240
I confess it, sire. I released him. I'll take the consequences.

519
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,700
But surely Lancelot's actions change things.

520
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,930
They change nothing. He broke the code.

521
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,130
He laid down his life for me!

522
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,080
He served with honour.

523
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,190
I see you feel strongly about this, Arthur.

524
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,670
Under the circumstances, a pardon, perhaps.

525
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,580
No. Not good enough, Father.

526
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,410
You must restore Lancelot to his rightful place,

527
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,010
As a knight of Camelot.

528
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:11,860
Never! The law is the law. The code bends for no man!

529
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,620
Then the code is wrong!

530
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,090
They'll restore your knighthood, of course they will.

531
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
You killed the griffin.

532
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,850
But I didn't kill the griffin. you did.

533
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,410
That's ridiculous.

534
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,290
"Bregdan anweald..."? I heard you. I saw you.

535
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,050
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

536
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,150
But I cannot take credit for what I did not do.

537
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,780
There'll be no more lies. No more deceit.

538
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,350
What are you going to do?

539
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,400
The only thing I can do.

540
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,360
What is this?

541
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,620
Let me speak!

542
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,080
Wait! I'll hear him.

543
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,570
Forgive me, sire.

544
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,440
I've come to bid you farewell.

545
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,980
What is this Lancelot?

546
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,890
I lied to you both, and now there is conflict between you.

547
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:14,290
I cannot bear that burden, as you should not bear mine.

548
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,540
I must start again, far from here.

549
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,920
Then maybe one day fate shall grant me another chance,

550
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,140
To prove myself a worthy knight of Camelot.

551
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:32,340
But, Lancelot, you've already proved that to us.

552
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,530
But I must prove it to myself.

553
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,590
Your Highness. Prince Arthur.

554
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,860
Gwen? Guinevere?

555
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,570
Lancelot?

556
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,250
Yes!

557
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,760
Come, Gwen. Busy day ahead.

558
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,240
Yes, my lady.

559
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,220
Perhaps you were right, Gaius.

560
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,180
I should never have got involved.

561
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,600
No, Merlin. I was wrong.

562
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,700
Lancelot needed you and you needed Lancelot.

563
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,540
Your destinies were entwined.

564
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,060
Will he ever return?

565
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,760
That I cannot say.

566
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,190
Till next time, then...

567
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,630
Sir Lancelot.

568
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,530
My name is Edwin Muirden and I have a remedy to cure all ills.

569
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,670
We cannot preserve her life for much longer.

570
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,080
She has hours, maybe less.

571
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,540
You have magic? I wonder what Uther will do. Probably have him burnt.

572
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,320
Find Edwin!
