1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,999
In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

2
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:04,348
the destiny of a great kingdom

3
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,686
rests of the shoulders
of a young boy.

4
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:09,813
His name...Merlin.

5
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:32,425
I understand you have
a shield for me.

6
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:43,345
With your swordcraft and this shield,
I guarantee you'll win.

7
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:47,025
- Show me how it works.
- Certainly.

Thara ymbsittendra

9
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:58,398
When you're competing
in the tournament,

10
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:02,841
you pin your opponent under
the shield, a snake strikes...

11
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:06,346
Your opponent will be paralysed.

12
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:11,818
The snakes are now
under your command.

13
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,329
They will do anything???

14
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:18,025
- Anything?
- Just say the word.

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,306
Kill him.

16
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:48,937
Knight Valiant
of the Western Isles.

17
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,984
- I'm here for the tournament.
- Welcome to Camelot.

21
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:27,905
Ready?

22
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:29,824
Would it make any difference
if I said no?

23
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:32,306
Not really.

24
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:37,407
ARTHUR: Body. Shield. Body. Shield.
MERLIN: Shield.

25
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,314
- Head.
- Head? Ow.

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,057
Come on, Merlin.
You're not even trying.

27
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,314
i know

28
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:44,290
Once more.

29
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:48,305
To the left. Right.
And left. Head.

30
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:49,919
Come on, Merlin.

31
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,594
I've got a tournament to win.

32
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,986
Can we stop now, please?

33
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,786
Shield. Body. Shield. Shield.

34
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:11,269
Braver than you look. Most servants
collapse after the first blow.

35
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,618
- Is it over?
- Just a warm-up.

36
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:17,426
How's your mace-work coming along?

37
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:27,105
So...how was your first day
as Arthur's servant?

38
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,825
Do you hear clanging?

39
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:35,132
It was horrible.

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,506
And I've still got to learn about
tournament etiquette by the morning.

41
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:43,986
Unheran achtun bregdan.

42
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:49,319
Oi! What have I told you
about using magic like this?

43
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,482
If I could actually feel my arms...
???

44
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:54,666
??? What do I do if you get caught?

45
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,505
What would you do?

46
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,225
Well, you just make sure it doesn't???

47
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,971
I save Arthur from being killed
and I end up as a servant.

48
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:06,111
How is that fair?

49
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:09,948
Not sure if fairness comes into it.
You never know, it might be fun.

50
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:14,507
You think mucking out Arthur's horses
is gonna be fun?

51
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,972
- Should hear my list of duties.
- We all have duties. Even Arthur.

52
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:23,833
Must be tough for him.
With all the girls, the glory.

53
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,986
He is a future king.
People expect so much of him.
He's under a lot of pressure.

54
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:32,305
That makes two of us.

55
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:45,137
So you've got voiders on the arms.
The hauberk goes over your chest.

56
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,626
???

57
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,672
I guess you know what to do
with the helmet.

58
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:53,026
Yeah. That was the only bit
I'd figured out.

59
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:56,394
How come you're better
at this than me?

60
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,986
I'm the blacksmith's daughter.

61
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:03,255
I know pretty much all about armour,
which is actually kind of sad.

62
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,324
No, it's brilliant.


63
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:15,790
You do know the tournament
starts today?

64
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:18,226
Yes, sire.

65
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,093
You nervous?


66
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:26,559
I don't get nervous.

67
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:30,425
- Really? I thought everyone did.
- Will you shut up?

68
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:51,145
- Great. I think you're all set.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

69
00:05:52,073 --> 00:05:54,145
My sword.

70
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,956
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

71
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,545
Guess, uh, you'll be needing that.

72
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:02,305
That went well.

73
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,704
UTHER: Knights of the realm,

74
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,843
it's a great honour
to welcome you to Camelot.

75
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,797
Over the next three days,
you will test your bravery,
your skills as warriors

76
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:44,635
and, of course, challenge
the reigning champion,

77
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:47,346
my son, Prince Arthur.

78
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:51,705
Only one can have the honour
of being crowned champion,

79
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:56,025
and he will receive a prize
of 1,000 gold pieces.

80
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,636
It is in combat that we learn
a knight's true nature,

81
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:05,385
whether he is indeed
a warrior or a coward.

82
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,786
The tournament begins!

83
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:25,066
I trust you will make me proud.

84
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,745
Yeah! Come on!

85
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:27,306
Yeah!

86
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:14,746
Knight Valiant looks pretty handy
with a sword.

87
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:32,986
May I offer my congratulations
on your victories today?

88
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:34,665
Likewise.

89
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:37,067
Hope to see you at the reception
this evening.

90
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:42,345
Creep.

91
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:48,440
Uh, for tomorrow, you need to
repair my shield, wash my tunic,

92
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:52,906
clean my boots, sharpen my sword
and polish my chain mail.

93
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:12,419
- Are you using magic again?
- No.

94
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:14,346
What's all this, then?

95
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:19,786
Just came to tell you supper's ready.

96
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:25,117
Knight Valiant of the
Western Isles, my lord.

97
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:28,141
I saw you fighting today.
Very aggressive.

98
00:10:28,187 --> 00:10:30,769
As my lord said,
"To lose is to be disgraced."

99
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,350
I couldn't agree more.

100
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:37,345
Knight Valiant, I present
the Lady Morgana, my ward.

101
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,072
My lady.

102
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:46,945
- I saw you competing today.
- I saw you watching.

103
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:51,934
I understand the champion
escorts my lady to the feast.

104
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,120
That's correct.

105
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,146
I will give everything to win.

106
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:58,745
My lady.

107
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:08,785
- Arthur.
- Father.

108
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:13,376
They all seem rather impressed.

109
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,539
- Not the only ones.
- Not jealous, are you?

110
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:20,186
I don't see there's anything
to be jealous of.

111
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,265
Could Arthur be any more annoying?

112
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,354
I so hope Knight Valiant
wins the tournament.

113
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:33,586
- You don't really mean that.
- Yes. I do.

114
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,225
Hello?

115
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:54,505
Is there someone there?

116
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:19,626
Can I help you with something, boy?

117
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,306
Nope. I'm good.

118
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:27,826
I...I was just...
um...gathering my master's armour.

119
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:31,290
Then you'd best be on your way.

120
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:34,825
Right. Yeah. No problem.

121
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:52,547
- You did all this on your own?
- Yes, sir.

122
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,226
Let's see if you can get me into it
without forgetting anything.

123
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,502
That was much better. Not that
it could have got any worse.

124
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:22,154
I'm a fast learner.

125
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,758
I hope for your sake that's true.


126
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,826
Good luck.

127
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:49,738
Is it my imagination or are you
beginning to enjoy yourself?

128
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:54,746
It... It isn't totally horrible
all the time.

129
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,906
Yes!

130
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:34,906
Strike him.

131
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,230
Strike him.
SNAKE HISSES

132
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:54,785
I think he's badly hurt.

133
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:11,026
- How is he?
- It's most odd.

134
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:15,826
Look at this. These two small wounds?
Looks like a snakebite.

135
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,186
How could he have been
bitten by a snake?

136
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:19,419
He was injured
in the swordfight.

137
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:21,907
The symptoms are consistent
with poisoning.

138
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,722
- Slow pulse, fever, paralysis.
- Can you heal him?

139
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,583
If it's a bite, I have to extract
venom from the snake ???

140
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,443
to make an antidote.

141
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,186
If he doesn't get antidote? 

142
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:35,583
There's nothing I can do.

143
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:37,506
He's going to die.

144
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,375
He was fighting Knight Valiant.

145
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:46,585
- What's that?
- Nothing.

146
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,679
Dinner time.

147
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,633
come on

148
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:59,566
1I've just seen one of the snakes
on Valiant's shield come alive.

149
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:01,426
He's using magic.

150
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:02,986
Are you sure?

151
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:07,125
The snake ate a mouse -
one swallow, straight down.

152
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:10,586
Ewan was fighting Valiant
when he collapsed.

153
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:13,666
It must've been one of the snakes
from the shield.

154
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,125
I have to tell Arthur.

155
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:17,754
Is there any chance
you might be mistaken?

156
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:21,940
- I know magic.
- Perhaps. Have you any proof?

157
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,173
Don't you believe me?

158
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:26,026
You'll land yourself in trouble.

159
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:30,081
- How would you explain...???
- What does that matter?

160
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,616
He's using magic to cheat!???

161
00:17:32,662 --> 00:17:35,290
You can't accuse a knight
without proof -

162
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:38,360
the King wouldn't accept the word of
a servant over that of a knight.

163
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:39,965
So what I say doesn't count?


164
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:43,245
It counts for very little.???

165
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,339
You telling me
you've got to fight that?

166
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,735
Yes, and he's strong as a bear.

167
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:12,107
But he's slow.

168
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:15,745
- Ah, and you're fast.
- Exactly.

169
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,825
You're not worried, are you?

170
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,546
No.

171
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,970
- How are you getting on?
- Fine.

172
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,947
 Just doing my job.

173
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:50,923
Minding my own business.

174
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:48,226
Valiant's going to fight
Arthur in the final.

175
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,986
He'll use the shield to kill him.

176
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,945
Merlin, about
what I said yesterday...

177
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:20,225
Look, Uther really wouldn't
listen to you or me.

178
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:23,838
But you are right.

179
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,559
We can't let Valiant
get away with it.

180
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:28,560
But we don't have proof.

181
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,118
If we can cure Ewan,

182
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:32,490
he could tell the King
Valiant was using magic.

183
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:34,978
The King would believe
another knight.

184
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,839
But how we get the antidote,
that's another matter.

185
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,385
Merlin?

186
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:47,863
ALL: Long live Valiant!

187
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:52,607
So, Valiant, you think you stand
a chance of defeating my son?

188
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:58,866
He is a great warrior, my lord.
I do hope to be a worthy opponent.

189
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:02,911
You should stay in Camelot
after the tournament.

190
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:05,705
I could do with
more knights like you.

191
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,586
I'd be honoured, my lord.

192
00:22:33,128 --> 00:22:35,569
I'll get started
preparing the antidote.

193
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:38,686
- I'm going to tell Arthur.
- You'll need this.

194
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,407
And, Merlin, what you did
was very brave.

195
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:49,426
You?

196
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,466
You chopped its head off?

197
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:54,746
Ewan was bitten by a snake
when he was fighting.????

198
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:57,222
You can see the wounds
where he was bitten.

199
00:22:57,268 --> 00:22:59,758
Ewan was winning - he had to cheat!

200
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:02,013
Valiant wouldn't dare
use magic in Camelot.

201
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,990
Ewan was pinned under the shield -
no-one could see it bite him.

202
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:08,688
I don't like him
but I don't think he's cheating.

203
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:13,786
Gaius is preparing an antidote. When
Ewan's conscious, he'll tell you.

204
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:18,666
If you fight him, he'll use
the shield so he can beat you.

205
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:22,866
Look at it! Have you seen snakes
like this in Camelot?

206
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:31,550
I know I'm just a servant

207
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,550
and my word doesn't
count for anything.

208
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,923
I wouldn't lie to you.

209
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:43,906
I want you to swear to me
what you're telling me is true.

210
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:46,905
I swear it's true.

211
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:50,945
Then I believe you.

212
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:21,306
Welcome back.

213
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:23,626
There was a snake on his shield.

214
00:24:24,578 --> 00:24:26,625
- It came alive.
- You're weak. 

215
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:29,415
The snake's venom
is still in your system.

216
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:30,555
I must warn Arthur.

217
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:33,974
Arthur knows. He's requested
an audience with the King.

218
00:24:34,021 --> 00:24:38,486
They'll want to talk to you.
Rest. You'll need your strength.

219
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:42,742
I need to fetch more herbs.
I'll be back.

220
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:08,586
Why have you summoned the court?

221
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:12,814
I believe Knight Valiant
is using a magic shield

222
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,791
to cheat in the tournament.

223
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:19,706
- What do you have to say to this?
- Ridiculous. I've never used magic.

224
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:22,629
Does your son have evidence
to support this???

225
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:25,001
- Do you have evidence?
- I do.

226
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:37,769
I'm afraid this potion
tastes like toad water

227
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:40,397
but it'll get you back on your feet.

228
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:43,786
Ewan?

229
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:51,375
Let me see this shield.

230
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:53,794
Don't let him get too close.

231
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,106
Be careful, my lord.

232
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:02,865
(Merlin!)

233
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:06,539
We need Ewan.
Find out what's happening.

234
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:08,795
???It's an ordinary shield.

235
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,354
He's not gonna let everyone
see it come alive.

236
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,935
How do I know
what you say is true?

237
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:16,306
I have a witness.

238
00:26:16,306 --> 00:26:20,075
Knight Ewan was bitten
by a snake from the shield.

239
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,704
Its venom made him grievously ill.
However, he's received an antidote.

240
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,960
He will confirm Valiant
is using magic.

241
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:29,797
Where is this witness?

242
00:26:29,843 --> 00:26:33,426
He should be here.

243
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:40,466
Where's Ewan?

244
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,658
He's dead.

245
00:26:41,705 --> 00:26:43,626
I'm waiting!

246
00:26:57,962 --> 00:27:00,101
I'm afraid the witness is dead.

247
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:03,706
So you have no proof
to support these allegations?

248
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:06,906
Have you seen Valiant use magic?

249
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:10,666
No.

250
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:15,591
But my servant fought...

251
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:17,893
Your servant?

252
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,666
You make these outrageous accusations
against a knight

253
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,290
on the word of your servant?

254
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:25,964
I believe he tells the truth.

255
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,801
Am I really to be judged
on hearsay from a boy?

256
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:34,386
- I've seen those snakes come alive.
- How dare you interrupt?!

257
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,500
Guards.

258
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:43,426
- My lord...
- Wait.

259
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,734
I'm sure he was merely mistaken.

260
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,585
I wouldn't want him punished
on my account.

261
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:57,706
You see? This is how a true knight
behaves - with gallantry and honour.

262
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,618
My lord, if your son
made these accusations

263
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:02,828
because he's afraid to fight me,

264
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:05,688
then I will graciously
accept his withdrawal.

265
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,466
Is this true?

266
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:10,060
Do you wish to withdraw
from the tournament?

267
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,785
No!

268
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:14,866
What am I to make
of these allegations?

269
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:31,385
Obviously there has been
a misunderstanding.

270
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:36,745
I withdraw the allegation
against Knight Valiant.

271
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,865
Please accept my apology.

272
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:42,826
Accepted.

273
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:05,158
I believed you, I trusted you,

274
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:08,716
and you made me look a complete fool.

275
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:11,146
I know it didn't go to plan...

276
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:16,465
"Didn't go to plan"?!

277
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:20,531
My father and the entire royal court
think I'm a coward.

278
00:29:20,577 --> 00:29:22,866
You humiliated me!

279
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:26,986
We can still expose Valiant.

280
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,532
I no longer require your services.

281
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:32,532
- You're sacking me?
- I need a servant I can trust.

282
00:29:32,578 --> 00:29:34,043
You CAN trust me.

283
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,745
Got me nowhere. Get out of my sight!

284
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,346
Where are you?!

285
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,001
I just came to tell you...
whatever you think my destiny is,

286
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:24,234
whatever it is you think
I'm supposed to do,

287
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,346
you've got the wrong person.

288
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:33,786
That's it.

289
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,945
Goodbye.

290
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:47,445
DRAGON: If only it were so easy
to escape one's destiny.

291
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,631
How can it be my destiny
to protect someone who hates me?

292
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:55,375
A half cannot truly hate
that which makes it whole.

293
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:59,051
Very soon you shall learn that.

294
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:02,842
Oh, great(!)
Just what I needed - another riddle.

295
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:08,307
That your and Arthur's path
lies together is but the truth.

296
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:09,935
What is that supposed to mean?

297
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:14,168
You know, young warlock,
this is not the end.

298
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:18,265
It is the beginning.

299
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,866
Just give me a straight answer!

300
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:37,225
Hello, Merlin.

301
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:39,026
All right?

302
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:47,226
Is it true
about Valiant using magic?

303
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:52,915
What are you gonna do?

304
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:56,171
Why does everyone think
it's down to me?

305
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,845
Because it is. 

306
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:00,946
..Isn't it?

307
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,226
You have to show everyone
you were right and they were wrong.

308
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:07,986
And how do I do that?

309
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:10,345
I don't know.

310
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,306
(That's it!)

311
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,506
Where are you going?

312
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:31,786
Do you have a wheelbarrow?

313
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:37,756
What are you doing with that?

314
00:32:37,803 --> 00:32:41,706
Letting everyone see the snakes
for themselves.

315
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,866
"Bebay odothay.

316
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:09,066
"Bebay odothay arisan quickum."

317
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:15,905
Bebay odothay arisan quickum.

318
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:20,596
Bebay odothay arisan quickum!

319
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:23,905
Bebay odothay arisan quickum!

320
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:56,545
(Bebay odothay arisan quickum.)

321
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:04,746
Bebay odothay arisan quickum.

322
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,106
I thought I told you
to get out of my sight.

323
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:23,066
Don't fight Valiant
in the final tomorrow.

324
00:34:24,044 --> 00:34:26,811
- He'll use the shield.
- I know.

325
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:29,765
Then withdraw.
You have to withdraw.

326
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:33,106
Don't you understand?
I can't withdraw.

327
00:34:33,486 --> 00:34:34,974
The people expect me to fight.

328
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,022
????a coward.

329
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:39,510
Valiant will kill you.
If you fight, you die.

330
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:41,946
Then I die.

331
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:45,719
How can you go out there
and fight like that?

332
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,466
Because I have to.

333
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:52,585
It's my duty.

334
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:26,465
Bebay odothay...

335
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:30,546
..arisan quickum.

336
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:04,237
Let me.

337
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:17,106
I used to help my father
with his armour.

338
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:29,905
Thanks.

339
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:38,305
Arthur.

340
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,706
Be careful.

341
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:50,026
See you at the feast.

342
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:54,465
Bebay odothay arisan quickum.
GROWLING

343
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,548
Bebay odothay arisan quickum.


344
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:08,785
I did it!
MERLIN LAUGHS

345
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:19,853
- Arthur's fighting Valiant.
- I know, I'm on my way.

346
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:24,186
Oh, don't go into my room.
We'll deal with it later.

347
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:12,545
(Bebay odothay arisan quickum!)

348
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:18,346
What are you doing?

349
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:22,586
- I didn't summon you.
- He IS using magic.

350
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,386
Now they see you
for what you really are.

351
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,513
Kill him!

352
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,346
Arthur!

353
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:54,865
Looks like I'll be going
to the feast after all.

354
00:41:40,505 --> 00:41:44,031
My honourable guests,
I give you Prince Arthur,

355
00:41:44,078 --> 00:41:46,666
your champion.

356
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,799
- My lady.
- My champion.

357
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:59,126
See, I told you he gets
all the girls and the glory.

358
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:01,893
And he owes it all to you.

359
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,893
Has your father apologised
for not believing you?

360
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:07,386
He'll never apologise.

361
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:10,475
???You're not disappointed
Valiant isn't your escort?

362
00:42:10,522 --> 00:42:13,946
Turns out he wasn't
champion material.

363
00:42:15,306 --> 00:42:17,452
That was some tournament final.

364
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:21,306
???It's not every day a girl
gets to save her prince.

365
00:42:21,615 --> 00:42:25,345
Um, I wouldn't say
I needed exactly saving.

366
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:27,267
I would've thought of something.

367
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:30,145
You're too proud to admit
you were saved by a girl.

368
00:42:30,546 --> 00:42:32,756
Because I wasn't.

369
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:35,616
??? I wish Valiant WAS escorting me.


370
00:42:35,617 --> 00:42:36,896
Me too.

371
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:38,245
Then I wouldn't
have to listen to you.

372
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,306
- Fine.
- Fine.

373
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:48,966
Do you believe Morgana?
She says she saved me.

374
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:51,625
Like I needed any help.

375
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:58,426
I wanted to say I made a mistake.

376
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:02,706
It was unfair to sack you.

377
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,829
No, don't worry about it.
Buy me a drink and call it even.

378
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:13,585
I can't really be seen to be
buying drinks for my servant.

379
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:17,226
Your servant?

380
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:18,985
You sacked me.

381
00:43:18,985 --> 00:43:20,626
Now I'm rehiring you.

382
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:23,434
My chambers are a complete mess,
my clothes need washing,

383
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:27,109
my armour needs repairing,
my boots need cleaning,

384
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:31,690
my dogs need exercising,
my fireplace needs sweeping,

385
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:37,305
my bed needs changing and someone
needs to muck out my stables.

386
00:43:40,366 --> 00:43:43,346
We have to discover
how this illness is spreading.

387
00:43:43,714 --> 00:43:44,924
Search every room.

388
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,902
- What for?
- The sorcerer.

389
00:43:46,948 --> 00:43:49,111
Where is the magic book I gave you?

390
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:52,705
The most likely cause is sorcery.

391
00:43:53,018 --> 00:43:54,435
- Gwen
- MorganaI haven't done anything.


392
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:56,041
???I'm innocent.

393
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:57,599
It was me.

394
00:43:57,646 --> 00:43:59,436
Merlin, you will pay for this!

395
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:03,025
No! Please help me!

396
