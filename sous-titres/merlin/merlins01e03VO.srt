1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,990
In a land of myth and time of magic,

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,950
the destiny of a great kingdom

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,960
rests of shoulders on a young boy.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,830
His name...Merlin.

5
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,510
(Spelling)

6
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,220
(Spelling)

7
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:51,321


11
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,590
Aren't you scared?

12
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,760
Of What?

13
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,890
But you might catch whatever it is.

14
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,220
I need cooperation.This is part of my job.

15
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,040
Only a dead.There is nothing really to be scare of.

16
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,270
What you were saying?

17
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,200
People mustn't see this. Cover it up.

18
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,880
Dad, This is your sandwich.

19
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,170
What's in it?

20
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,450
It's smoked pigeon. But I'd say...

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,800
that's more smoke than pigeon.

22
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,040
You're so good a girl to me.

23
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,360
I've done you watercress soup tonight.

24
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,470
Dont tell me

25
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,280
There is more water than cress.

26
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,880
See you later

27
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,800
OK. Bye.

28
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,910
Wot are you doing?

29
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,570
weighting something.

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,790
Looks heavy

31
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,000
Something really...

32
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,470
Someone got you flowers

33
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,700
Oh, no.

34
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,610
Would you like one? a purple one.

35
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,800
purple one suits you.

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,160
er, I am saying that red doesnt suit you.

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,840
Thanks. well, er...

38
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,160
er, see you

39
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,470
Bye

40
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,440
You look happy.

41
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,230
I picked these for you.

42
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,890
Oh, thats so sweet.

43
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,570
To cheer you up. I know you're not sleeping well.

44
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,960
You cheer me up.

45
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,030
Would you like me to put them in water for you?

46
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,280
I've never seen anything like this before.

47
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,540
Some kind of plague?

48
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,960
No.  this could never from nature.

49
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,440
But who has this kind of power?

50
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,990
You think its casued by magic?

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,630
Merlin!

52
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,180
I'm on my way. Sorry I'm late.

53
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,740
Dont worry. I'm getting used to it.

54
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,700
Oh.er,Gwen, she gave it to me.

55
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,000
Tell Gaius my father wants him.

56
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,100
ok...

57
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,400
Gaius...

58
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,390
I heard.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,940
Why not tell you himself?

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,090
Because it is the way it is.

61
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,140
You are a servant

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,750
If he knew who i was..

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,650
You'd be a dead servant.

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,630
right. get this covered up.

65
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,100
Im not YOUR servant.

66
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,900
No. You're my dogsbody. Come on, hurry up.

67
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,810
Whats happened?

68
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,600
I dont know, Sire, this is the Second case I've seen today.

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,250
Why not report it?

70
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,960
I wanted to find the cause.

71
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,920
and you concluded?

72
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,020
No hurry for conclusions. The scientific process is a long one.

73
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,380
Wot are you concealing from me?

74
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,900
sire, i have seen nothing like it.

75
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,060
the victim are dying in 24 hours. it's spreading fast.

76
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,900
so what is the cause?

77
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:40,570
I think, should say the cause, those likely cause, is sorcerer.

78
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,060
We have to find this.

79
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,000
I will, father.

80
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,590
Increasing your process in the town.

81
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,830
Double the guards at all the gates. And learn the position you served.

82
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,790
Dad!

83
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,980
We need Gaius to find the cure.

84
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,010
If he needs help, we'll give him.

85
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,120
If Gaius is right, believe me, this city will be white dead.

86
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,019
This is kind of magic that undermines the authorities,

87
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,730
challenges what we have done.

88
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,800
If we can not control this plague

89
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,570
people will turn to magic for kill.

90
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,970
we have to find this sorcerer and quickly.

91
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,130
yes father.

92
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,860
Gaius, Gaius. He's still alive.

93
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,800
I think there's nothing we can do, I am afraid.

94
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,780
We havn't tried!

95
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,720
If we dont know the diease, how can we cure him?

96
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,890
with magic!

97
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,720
Have a look. They are suspicious of everyone.

98
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,300
this is not the time to be using magic.

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,660
science will lead us to the source of the disease.

100
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,560
what are you doing?

101
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,460
examining the contents of that man's stomach.

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,480
will that tell you who did it?

103
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,700
No. but maybe how its spread.

104
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,550
One thing i do know - this is magic of the darkest kind.

105
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,600
why would someone use magic like that?

106
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,730
Magic corrupts. Pepole use it for their own ends.

107
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,690
But not all magic is bad. Iknow

108
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,190
It's neither good nor bad. It's how you use it.

109
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,270
Over there.

110
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,940
Sorry,guys. we're searching every room.

111
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,930
what for?

112
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,110
the sorcerer.

113
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,450
why would he be here?

114
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,900
Just doing my job.

115
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,840
we've nothing to hide.

116
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,490
Go on, then, search.

117
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,410
What are these books and papers?

118
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,068
My life's work, dedicated to science.

119
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,960
You are quite welcome to read through them if you wish.

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,350
what's this room up here?

121
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,548
It's mine.

122
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,838
what do you expect to find there?

123
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,130
I'm looking for evidence suggesting use of enchantments.

124
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,560
what have you done with the magic book I gave you?

125
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,130
Merlin, come here.

126
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,450
Look what I've found.

127
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,575
I found a place we can put things.

128
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,250
It's called a cupboard.

129
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,128
How long do you think before you find a cure?

130
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,268
Depends on the interruptions I get.

131
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,800
Of course. I'm sorry.

132
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,330
We are finished here.

133
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,820
We have to hide that book.

134
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,570
No.

135
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,180
we must use it.

136
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,918
Don't be stupid.

137
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,948
I have this legacy. What is it for?

138
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,228
You can tell me it's not for playing tricks.

139
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,455
You want to practise magic with the king hunting for sorcerers?

140
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,680
Are you mad?

141
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,598
Merlin, you're destined for important things.

142
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,529
What if I don't practise,

143
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,458
how would I become this great warlock?

144
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,450
In time your skills will be recognised.

145
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,388
when? how long do I wait?

146
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,358
Patience is a virtue.

147
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,490
Sitting by and doing nothing is a virtue?

148
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,240
Your time will come.

149
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,980
I could cure that man we saw.

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,658
I know it's tempting to use the way you find easiest.

151
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,310
It would save a life!

152
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,129
It's no good saving one person.

153
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,908
We have to discover how this is spreading.

154
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,288
Arthur is out right now looking for the sorcerer.

155
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,770
A sorcerer this powerful will never be found searching the town.

156
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,340
so what can we do?

157
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,180
Hope that science can find the answer before it kills us all.

158
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,800
we've searched everywhere the entire city.

159
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,230
Nothing?

160
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,660
I don't know where else to look.

161
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,210
Impose a curfew.

162
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,240
No one is to be on the street after the great bell.

163
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,618
- Father?   - Cordon off the lower town.

164
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,438
Why?

165
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,660
It's where most of the victims are.

166
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,960
Let's isolate it and stop this disease from spreading.

167
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,420
what about the people who live there?

168
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,280
You think I haven't considered it?

169
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,300
what else can I do?

170
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,670
I have to protect the rest of the city.

171
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,680
What's different about this victim?

172
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,010
Um...she's a woman.

173
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,010
Sometime I do wonder

174
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,460
whether your magic talent were given to the right person.

175
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,940
Anything else?

176
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,838
em...she's courtier

177
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,358
How does that help us?

178
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,868
Courtiers seldom go to the lower town.

179
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,950
What does that mean?

180
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,720
um...she hasn't spoken to any townspeople.

181
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,268
Yes it suggests that the diease is not spread by contact.

182
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,158
They probably eat different food.

183
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,370
Good. Anything else?

184
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,858
Don't breathe the same air.

185
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,650
what's the only thing they do share?

186
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,480
Water.

187
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,248
You think this diease is spread by water?

188
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,970
Merlin, you're a prodigy.

189
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,750
It's time to get up, dad.

190
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,690
Dad!

191
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,120
Gwen?

192
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,920
Gwen?

193
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,138
Gwen.

194
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,440
Gaius.

195
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,080
Who have the sickness?

196
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,584
My farther.

197
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,088
Please, Gaius, he's all I have.

198
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,568
Gwen, I have no cure.

199
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,138
I am begging you.

200
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,715
I hope there is something anything,

201
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:17,290
but so far the remedy is beyond what I can achieve.

202
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,170
I'm sorry , Gwen.

203
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,998
There must be something we can do.

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,598
My best. Let's hope this can provide answers.

205
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,178
Too late for Gwen's father.

206
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,880
I hear you maybe right.

207
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,560
What about that one?

208
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,520
In there.

209
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,690
Sentries,sir.

210
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:34,680
Father, what's happened? I can't believe it!

211
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,460
Don't touch it.

212
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,260
I have this in the water for no more than a few hours.

213
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,278
Where the water from?

214
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,658
From the people's daily supply.

215
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,350
We must stop using it.

216
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,198
The city can't survive without water!

217
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,950
We have to find the sorcerer!

218
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,918
I don't believe they are inside Camelot.

219
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,918
Then extend the search to the villages.

220
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,288
We've started, but I can't search the entire kingdom.

221
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,000
Any I can't stand by and watch our people dying.

222
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,850
How's your father?

223
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,240
Is he feeling better?

224
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,240
Yeah. It's incredible.

225
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,920
It's a miracle.

226
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,800
His skins clear? Back to normal?

227
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,690
Yes.

228
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,720
Great.

229
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,198
You don't seem surprised.

230
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,710
No, no I am. It's a miracle.

231
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,990
But how did you know he's well?

232
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,488
Er...cause is your smiling.

233
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,255
That's really weird.

234
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,020
I haven't told anyone. but you know.

235
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,430
How could you know?

236
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,440
Yep, all right.

237
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,128
You finally found out.

238
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,860
I will tell you.

239
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,650
I'm psychic.

240
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,928
No, you're not.

241
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,348
It's true.

242
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,040
All Right, what am I thinking?

243
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,748
That I'm not a psychic.

244
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,340
You're strange.

245
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,580
I don't mean that in a nasty way.

246
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,520
You just funny.

247
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,870
I like that.

248
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,240
I'm pleased for you.

249
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,480
Thank you.

250
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,540
What for?

251
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,768
Don't know. just for asking.

252
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,360
I didn't like to see you upset.

253
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,490
Alright, I have to go.

254
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,870
Get on.

255
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,940
The story is you were sick.

256
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,690
Not any more.

257
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,070
Perhaps you are suffering from some other ailment.

258
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,560
Oh, you're joking.

259
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,430
I feel like death itself.

260
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,270
Not enough to strength in me to stir the air.

261
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,948
And...what happened?

262
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,741
I don't know. suddenly it was gone.

263
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,598
I'm fitter than I was before.

264
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,080
That's Remarkable. was anybody with you when all these happened?

265
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,880
Just my daughter gwen.

266
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,880
Seize her.

267
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,220
No.

268
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,311
Guinevere,

269
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:21,870
I'm arresting you for crimes in contravention to

270
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,478
the laws of camelot. That you did practise enchantments.

271
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,078
Gwen!

272
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,180
I haven't done anything! help me!

273
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,250
What are you doing?

274
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,678
We found a magic poultice in her house.

275
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
That's ridiculous.

276
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,588
How else do you explain her father recovery?

277
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,778
But she's innocent. you know she is innocent.

278
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,120
What can I do? I can't turn the blind out.

279
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,909
No! please! listen to me.

280
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,950
Please, I haven't done anything false! Authur, listen to me, please!

281
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm innocent! I swear!

282
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,260
Let me go! I swear!

283
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,160
Merlin! merlin! please help me!

284
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,010
Why don't you listen to me?

285
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,801
No, please!

286
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,928
-what have you done?  -what?

287
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,730
I warned you!

288
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,040
Oh, I understand, you thought you were doing good.

289
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,160
I couldn't let her father die,

290
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:13,011
knowing I could cure him.

291
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,628
But do you think it might looks a bit suspicious, curing one man!

292
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,940
Well, then, all I have to do is,

293
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,880
I'll cure everyone. no one has to know it was magic.

294
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,620
It's too late. they think gwen is a sorcerer and she cause the disease.

295
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,670
But she didn't!

296
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,820
And how are you going to prove that?

297
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,130
Please listen to me. I have done nothing. please.

298
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,130
I swear I haven't done anything.

299
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,150
Well done.

300
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,600
Why will no-one believe me?

301
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,070
He got better. he just recovered. I didn't do anything!

302
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,040
I believe you. perhaps this disease is not always fatal.

303
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,790
Have you thought of that?

304
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,248
Perhaps he recovered naturally.

305
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,460
And what of this poultice that was found?

306
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,390
What poultice? I don't know anything about a poultice.

307
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,980
It was found in your house.

308
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,260
Undo this enchantment. put an end to this contagion.

309
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,750
I can't.

310
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,518
I can show you no mercy.

311
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,858
I'm not a witch! I don't know how to stop the illness.

312
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,778
If you will not undo your sorcery, I must find your guilty.

313
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,308
But I have told you I ...

314
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,670
It's therefore my duty to pronounce judgment.

315
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,480
Under the circumstances, I have no choice but to sentence you to death.

316
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,738
No.

317
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,078
I can only hope that when you die, the evil plague dies with you.

318
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,610
Take her away.

319
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,750
No!

320
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,410
Please no! I'm innocent! please! please no!

321
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,220
Please help me! please, I beg you.

322
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,498
I know gwen. she's my maidservant, not an enchantress.

323
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,180
Have you ever seen an enchantress?

324
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,520
Believe me, they bear no sign, no mark.

325
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,248
There is no sense of evil in the eye.

326
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,160
I've seen the way the girl works.

327
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,100
Her fingers are worn, her nails are broken.

328
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,991
If she was a sorceress, why would she do this,

329
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:12,492
why would she kneel on a cold stone floor,

330
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,260
Morning after morning,

331
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,460
When she could make this things happen with a snap of her fingers?

332
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,750
Like an idle king!

333
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,948
You have no right...

334
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,438
You have a right to cast a judgement.

335
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,900
I have a responsbility to take care of this kingdom.

336
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,178
I take no pleasure in this.

337
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,690
You're sentencing the wrong person.

338
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,808
She's right, father.

339
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:34,039
You hear with the magic. you no longer listening.

340
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,358
You saw yourself. she used enchantments.

341
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,202
Yes, maybe.

342
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:38,538
But to save her dying father,

343
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,742
it doesn't make a guilty of creating a plague.

344
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,778
One's an act of love, the other of evil.

345
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,518
I don't believe Evil isn't in this girl's heart.

346
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,110
I have witnessed what witchcraft can do.

347
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,480
I've suffered at its hand.

348
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,160
I cant take that chance.

349
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:54,822
If there is a slightest chance about that girl

350
00:23:54,823 --> 00:23:57,268
She must die or the whole kingdom may perish.

351
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,770
I can't understand that.

352
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,230
One day you may become a king.

353
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,490
Then you will understand.

354
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,860
Such decisions must be made.

355
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,968
There are dark forces that threaten this kingdom.

356
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,180
I know. witchcraft is an evil, faher.

357
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:13,375
so is injustice.

358
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,378
Yes, I am yet to be king and I don't know what kind of king I will be.

359
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,290
But I do have a sense of the kind of camelot I wish to live in.

360
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,740
It would be where the punishment fits the crime.

361
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,650
I fear you're right.

362
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,468
She's played with fire.

363
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,770
And sadly, she must die by fire.

364
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,480
I thought I was doing good.

365
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,970
And that curing gwen's father would help her.

366
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,130
I thought I was saving a life.

367
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,768
It seemed...so simple.

368
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,170
An easy solution is like a light in a storm, merlin.

369
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,167
Rush for it at your peril. it may

370
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:11,588
not always lead you to a safe harbour.

371
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,218
I can see that now.

372
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,970
I have warned you about the responsibilities of a warlock.

373
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,600
I must see her.

374
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,020
Gwen!

375
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,410
Thank you.

376
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,838
What for?

377
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,180
Coming to see me.

378
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,258
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,900
It's not your fault.

380
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,270
Well...it's all right. don't worry about me.

381
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
There's no point crying about it.

382
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,868
I mean, I'm not saying you were going to cry about me.

383
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,850
Obviously I dont think that.

384
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,128
Oh, gwen, I cant have this happen.

385
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,368
Please, one thing.

386
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,080
You dont have to.

387
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,900
But...

388
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,100
What?

389
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,050
Remember me.

390
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:36,570
You're not going to die. I'm not going to let this happen.

391
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,180
What if burning this witch doesnt stop the poison?

392
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,878
How do I protect my people?

393
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,570
We've closed down the water pumps.

394
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,468
The emergency supply won't last much longer.

395
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,848
We have to find a way to cleanse the water of the disease.

396
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,688
But how?

397
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,850
Well...

398
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,540
It was me.

399
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,470
It was me who used magic to cure gwen's father.

400
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,910
Gwen is not the sorcerer. I am.

401
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,268
Merlin! are you mad?

402
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,140
I cannot let her die for me.

403
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,498
I place myself at your mercy.

404
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,568
He doesn't know what he's saying.

405
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,650
I do.

406
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,390
Then arrest him.

407
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,039
Father, please. this is madness!

408
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,288
there's no way merlin is a sorcerer.

409
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,940
Did you not hear him? Yes

410
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,550
He admitted it.

411
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,828
He saved my life, remember?

412
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,230
Why should he fabricate such a story?

413
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:47,220
As gaius says, he's got a grave mental disease.

414
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,860
Really?

415
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,180
He's in love.

416
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,198
What?

417
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,618
With gwen.

418
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,488
I am not.

419
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,080
Yes, you are.

420
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,790
I saw you with that flower she'd given you.

421
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,288
But...i'm not in love with her.

422
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,808
It's all right. you can admit it.

423
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,158
I dont think of her like that!

424
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,700
Perhaps she cast a spell on you.

425
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,270
Merlin is a wonder

426
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:21,270
but the wonder is that he's such an idiot.

427
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,590
There's no way he's a sorcerer.

428
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,540
Don't waste my time. let him go.

429
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,078
Arthur's an idot, you know

430
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,436
Arthur was right to do that he did.

431
00:28:41,437 --> 00:28:44,388
he saved you from you own stupidity.

432
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,298
What else could I do? it's my fault gwen's going to die.

433
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,848
You dont prove her innocence by jumping into the flames.

434
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,900
You do it by finding out the cause of the disease.

435
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,388
Well, whatever it is, arthur's not going to find it.

436
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,008
He thinks he's so sharp.

437
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,990
Even when I said I was a wizard, he still couldnt see it.

438
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,120
It's pretty hard to spot.

439
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,818
Maybe I should get a pointy hat.

440
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,120
I dont think you'll find one big enough.

441
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,368
Anyway, forget that.

442
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,340
To save gwen, we have to find out what's contaminating the water.

443
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,300
This water supplies the whole town.

444
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,470
Take a sample.

445
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,330
Let's take it back and examine it.

446
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,090
What the hell was that?

447
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,150
There.

448
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,430
It was an afanc.

449
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,478
An...a what?

450
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,500
A beast born of clay and conjured up. only by the most powerful sorcerer.

451
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,220
Now we have to find a way to defeat it.

452
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,100
But where?

453
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,120
That could take days. gwen'll be dead by then.

454
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,820
Have you got a better idea?

455
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,030
Gwen?

456
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,390
I'm going to get you out.

457
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,400
I will.

458
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,440
Hello?

459
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,160
Hello.

460
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,090
The great warlock returns,as I knew he would.

461
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,258
I need to know how to defeat an afanc.

462
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,390
Yes I suppose you do.

463
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,320
Will you help me?

464
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,730
Trust the elements that are at your command.

465
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,740
Elements? but what is it I have to do?

466
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:22,200
You cannot do this alone. you are but one side of a coin.

467
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,640
Arthur is the other.

468
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,778
I dont understand.

469
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,980
Just tell me what it is I have to do.

470
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,150
No!

471
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,730
Please! please help me!

472
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,460
I have!

473
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,550
Oh, yeah, right, thanks.

474
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,850
Have you found anything more?

475
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,060
I have tried.

476
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,580
Then keep looking.

477
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,260
People are dying. we cant delay any longer.

478
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,530
We must kill the witch. bring her execution forward to tonight.

479
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,638
Merlin, what are you doing?

480
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,260
Looking for a book.

481
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,210
Care to tell me which one?

482
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,430
A book on elements.

483
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,170
Elements?

484
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,668
Yes. which one would I find them in?

485
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:41,070
Most of them. the study of base elements is at the heart of science.

486
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,400
How does that help kill the afanc?

487
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,340
The Afanc is a creature made of earth and water,

488
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,440
that's two of the four base elements.

489
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,780
What are the other two?

490
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,480
Perhaps they will destroy it.

491
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,840
You want fire. Wind and fire.

492
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,218
How did you find this out?

493
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,890
I just knew. Part of my powers.

494
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,288
What else did your powers tell you?

495
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:05,190
I am only one side of the coin. The brighter side, obviously.

496
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,540
Who's the other side?

497
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,280
I think it might be Arthur.

498
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,288
They are bringing forward the execution.

499
00:34:10,288 --> 00:34:11,988
We have to prove Gwen's innocent.

500
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,068
We're trying.

501
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,988
Please. Just tell me what I can do to help.

502
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,980
We need Arthur.

503
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,138
Arthur?

504
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,948
There's a monster, an Afanc in the water supply.

505
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:20,348
That was causing the plague.

506
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,520
We must tell Uther.

507
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,828
I think it's a creature forged by magic.

508
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,490
Uther would just blame Gwen for conjuring it.

509
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,588
So, what are we to do?

510
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,160
We need to destory it.

511
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,560
The plague will stop and Uther may see sense.

512
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,158
That's why you need Arthur.

513
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,520
He's our best chance.

514
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,390
But he won't want to disobey the king.

515
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,660
Leave that to me.

516
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,450
You're alright?

517
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,180
Sorry about all this. Merlin's not been in today.

518
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,060
Poor Merlin.

519
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,200
Yeah.

520
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,540
To offer to give up his life to save Gwen's...

521
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,980
I can't imagine any man loving me so much.

522
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,170
No, I can't imagine that either.

523
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,290
It's because you're not like Merlin.

524
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,830
He's a lover.

525
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,360
Maybe that's...I haven't found the right person to love.

526
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,870
Sadly, the age of gallantry seems to be dead.

527
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,828
Look around and all you see are small men.

528
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,580
Not big enough to fill their armour.

529
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,700
There's not one of them able to stand up for what is right.

530
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,670
What do you want me to do?

531
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,740
You'd better be right about this, Merlin.

532
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,260
You should stay here.

533
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:17,990
I'm coming with you.

534
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,970
No.

535
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,278
Scared I'll show you up?

536
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,888
Father will slam us both in chains

537
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,888
if he knows I'd endangered you.

538
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,188
Good he doesn't know, then.

539
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,800
Turn back. You could get hurt.

540
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,988
So could you...

541
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,710
If you don't get out of my way.

542
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,050
How are we going to find it?

543
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,650
Just hope we do, before it finds us.

544
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,070
-Stop!  -What?

545
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,420
It's just a shadow.

546
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,970
Spread out.

547
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,108
What is it? Are you all right?

548
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,030
Yeah.

549
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,498
-Did you see it? -Yes.

550
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:46,820
-What does it look like? -It's ... it's quick.

551
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,600
Where is it?

552
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,770
I think it's gone this way.

553
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,720
Arthur, use the torch!

554
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,570
(Spell)

555
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,570
Merlin!

556
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,150
This is very good.

557
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,278
Good news, sire.

558
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:45,078
There are no new deaths, and the sick is recovering.

559
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,050
Good.

560
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,148
Strange, I've never heard of an Afanc before.

561
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,390
It's conjured from the clay by powerful magic.

562
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,978
The type that can only be invoked by an ancient sorcerer.

563
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,820
One who has the power to mirror the spirit of life.

564
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,860
I found this at the water source.

565
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,680
It bears the mark of Nimueh.

566
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,880
We must be vigilant, sire.

567
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,890
Will I never be rid of her?

568
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,090
Sire...

569
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,430
Leave me!

570
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,350
Dad!

571
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,990
Thank you!

572
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,500
Don't thank me. It was more Merlin.

573
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,080
Really?

574
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,690
He's the real hero here.

575
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,350
I don't know what to say.

576
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,220
I didn't do anything.

577
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,430
I'm grateful to you all. Come on, Gwen.

578
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,630
Merlin, I wanted you to know...

579
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,920
you secret's safe with me.

580
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,988
My secret?

581
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,700
Merlin, don't pretend.

582
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,598
I know what you did.

583
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,628
You do?

584
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,338
Saw it with my own eyes.

585
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,348
You did.

586
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,228
I understand why you don't want me to know.

587
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,540
Well, obviously...

588
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,490
But I won't tell anyone.

589
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,540
Yo don't mind me talking to you about it?

590
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,190
Er, no. It's...

591
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,190
You have no idea how hard it is to keep this hidden.

592
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,118
Well, you can continue to deny it.

593
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,118
But I think Gwen's very lucky one.

594
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,370
Gwen?

595
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,090
It's our secret.

596
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,038
The fish didn't come from the water, did it?

597
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,150
Where else would it come from?

598
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,718
Water's fine now. That's not your worry.

599
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,720
This is the work of a very powerful sorcerer.

600
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,288
I only hope you didn't come to her attention.

601
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,578
Doubt it. No-one else seems to appreciate my skills.

602
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,600
I just want someone to see me for who I am.

603
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,210
One day, Merlin.

604
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,800
One day.

605
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,318
One day what?

606
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,550
One day people won't believe

607
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,550
what an idiot you were.

608
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,150
Thanks.

609
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,280
Merlin, you will pay for this.

610
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,160
Merlin.

611
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,788
If I don't get the antidote, what happens to Merlin?

612
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,190
He will die.

613
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,490
His pulse is weaker.

614
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,120
His fever's getting worse.

615
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,000
He's dead?
