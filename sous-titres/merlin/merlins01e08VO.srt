1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,300
myth and the time of magic,

2
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:04,400
the destiny of a great kingdom

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,900
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,300
His name...

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,600
Merlin

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,246
Do you have my supplies ready?

7
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:41,601
We must leave the
city without delay.

8
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:48,801
Everything you asked for -
it's all here. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,681
Seize him! Stop there!

10
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,800
Run! Run, run!

11
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,521
Help!

12
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,200
Help me!

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,201
Please.

14
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,566
'Please. '

15
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:00,201
'You have to help me. '

16
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:06,000
'Help me. '

17
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,560
Search in there.
Take the other side.

18
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:15,401
You, did you see a boy run in here?

19
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:19,521
'They're searching for me. '

20
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:22,521
'Why are they after you?'

21
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,760
'They're going to kill me. '

22
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:28,817
Guards!

23
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,840
In here.

24
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,561
'This way. '

25
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:53,201
'Run. Run!'

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,601
Hey. There he is!

27
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:05,640
Alert the rest of the guards!

28
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,725
In there.

29
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,121
Quick, down there.
We've got 'im.

30
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,245
Have you forgotten
how to knock, Merlin?

31
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,361
The guards are after him.
I didn't know what to do.

32
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:25,721
My Lady?

33
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,240
My Lady?

34
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:32,001
In there.

35
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,726
Sorry to disturb you, My Lady.

36
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:47,561
We're searching for a young Druid
boy. We believe he came this way.

37
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:51,038
I haven't seen anyone.
It's just me and my maid.

38
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:54,480
- Best keep the door locked.
- Of course. Thank you.

39
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:08,120
The Druid was only in Camelot to
collect supplies. He meant no harm.

40
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:11,560
- Is it necessary to execute him?
- Absolutely necessary.

41
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:13,680
Those who use magic
cannot be tolerated.

42
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:15,246
The Druids are a peaceful people.

43
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:20,040
Given the chance, they would
return magic to the kingdom.

44
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:23,086
They preach peace,
but conspire against me.

45
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:26,961
- We cannot appear weak.
- Showing mercy can be a strength.

46
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:29,005
Our enemies will
not see it that way.

47
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,320
We have a responsibility
to protect this kingdom.

48
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:35,601
Executing the Druid
will send out a clear message.

49
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:38,681
Find the boy.
Search every inch of the city.

50
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,165
People of Camelot,

51
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,040
the man before you is guilty
of using enchantments and magic.

52
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:07,361
Under our law, the sentence
for this crime is death.

53
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:10,246
We're still searching
for his accomplice.

54
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:15,121
Anyone found harbouring the boy
is guilty of conspiracy,

55
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:18,006
and will be executed as a traitor.

56
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,820
Let this serve
as a warning to your people.

57
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:25,600
You have let your fear of magic
turn to hate.

58
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:29,961
- I pity you.
- I can't watch this.

59
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,280
No!

60
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:07,686
Do you know much about the Druids?

61
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:10,340
Very little.
They're very secretive people.

62
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,960
Especially now they're
being hunted by Uther.

63
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,960
Merlin, please tell me you haven't
got yourself mixed up in this.

64
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:21,406
Me? No. Mixed up in what?

65
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,561
For someone with such a big secret,
you are a terrible liar.

66
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:26,681
Well, I haven't done anything.

67
00:07:26,716 --> 00:07:28,441
Merlin...

68
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,900
I heard the boy calling out.

69
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:37,126
He was nowhere to be seen,

70
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:41,041
but I could hear him...
like he was inside my mind.

71
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:44,485
Yes, I've heard of this ability.

72
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,420
The Druids look for children with
such gifts to serve as apprentices.

73
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:52,320
While they're searching for this
boy, you must be especially careful

74
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,446
otherwise it will be your head
on the block.

75
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:59,960
- I'm always careful. You know me.
- Yes, Merlin, unfortunately I do.

76
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
- How is he?
- He's sleeping.

77
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:27,605
He's very pale.

78
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,880
I worry he may have
lost a lot of blood.

79
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,081
- Has he said anything at all?
- Nothing.

80
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,080
He won't even tell me his name.

81
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,366
You know, er, for a moment there
earlier,

82
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:51,681
I thought you were going
to hand us over to the guards.

83
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:54,286
I'm glad you have
so much faith in me, Merlin.

84
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:57,480
No, no, sorry. Erm,
I meant, you're the King's ward.

85
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,098
You're taking a huge risk
helping the boy.

86
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,681
I wouldn't see an
innocent child executed.

87
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,446
What harm has he ever done anyone?

88
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,921
Uther believes he has magic,
and that makes him guilty.

89
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,561
- Uther's wrong.
- You believe that?

90
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:17,961
What if magic
isn't something you choose?

91
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:20,441
What if it chooses you?

92
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:26,521
- Why're you looking at me like that?
- Nothing.

93
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:29,041
Why are you helping him?

94
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,440
It was a spur of the moment decision.

95
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,720
What d'you think we should do
with him? He can't stay here.

96
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:44,880
We have to find a way to
get him back to his people.

97
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,360
You seem troubled, Morgana.
Is something wrong?

98
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:04,206
No, My Lord.

99
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:07,246
I am sorry I'm not better company.

100
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,280
I was merely concerned
for your welfare.

101
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:12,480
Thank you, My Lord. All is well.

102
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:16,881
What news of the hunt
for the Druid boy?

103
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,521
We have conducted
an extensive search.

104
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:21,206
The boy is nowhere to be found.

105
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:24,640
- You mean you failed to find him?
- Perhaps he's already left the city.

106
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:28,601
You're telling me that a wounded boy
is able to escape the city?

107
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:31,401
Nonsense, someone's hiding him.
I want him found.

108
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:34,281
He's just a boy.
What harm can he do?

109
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,606
He is a Druid, so he's dangerous.

110
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,860
The Druids would see your
father's kingdom destroyed.

111
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:42,080
I had no idea you were
such an authority on Druids.

112
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,361
Morgana is right.
Double your efforts.

113
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:47,165
Yes, father.

114
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Keep searching until you find him.

115
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,881
- How long has he been burning up?
- Since early this morning.

116
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,726
I think his wound may be infected.

117
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,521
We need Gaius
before it gets any worse.

118
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:07,938
We can't involve Gaius.
It's too dangerous.

119
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:10,285
If he finds out,
he'll execute me himself.

120
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,361
We need to get him out of Camelot,
and we can't while he's sick.

121
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:14,601
We need a physician.

122
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,205
I'll treat him.

123
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,566
treat an infected wound?

124
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,800
Not exactly, but I'm a fast learner.

125
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,485
Arthur! To what do
I owe this pleasure?

126
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,565
It's not a social call.
I'm looking for the Druid boy.

127
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,840
- You're not searching my chambers.
- Don't take it personally.

128
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,377
I have to search the entire castle.

129
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,880
It will only take a few minutes.

130
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:01,126
I'm not having you
mess up my things.

131
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:04,561
I'm not interested in your things,
I'm just looking for any evidence

132
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:07,238
that the Druid boy's in the castle.

133
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,737
Perhaps he's hiding in your chambers.

134
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,166
They're such a mess,
you'd never know.

135
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:15,201
It's hardly my fault I have
such a lazy idiot for a servant.

136
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:21,801
If you can't even find your own
servant how can you find the boy?

137
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,926
I'm touched
by your confidence.

138
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:30,561
But the sooner we get started,
the sooner we'll be finished.

139
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,846
Well, I'll save you the trouble.

140
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:38,680
Trust me,
if I could find him, I would.

141
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,360
The Druid boy's hiding
behind the screen.

142
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,880
I'm sure your father would love to
know how you wasted your time

143
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:52,326
by rifling through
my things. Go on.

144
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:57,001
So you can have the satisfaction
of making me look a fool?

145
00:12:57,036 --> 00:13:00,601
You don't need any help
looking like a fool.

146
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:03,366
What are you waiting for?
Take a look.

147
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,961
Why don't you go back
to brushing your hair,

148
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,338
or whatever it is
that you do all day?

149
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,680
Bye, Arthur.
Good luck with the search!

150
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:20,081
Bites, bruises, burns, wounds...

151
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,560
Infections...

152
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,280
Ah, there you are. I need you
to pick some heather for me.

153
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:46,961
Can I do it later?
I was just going out.

154
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:49,365
Who's had this book out?

155
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,246
It was me. I was doing some reading.

156
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:55,680
Oh? I'd given up hoping you might
take more of an interest in my work.

157
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,445
No. It's fascinating.

158
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,680
Merlin, you are riddle
wrapped inside a mystery.

159
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,845
That's me. I was getting
some cleaning supplies.

160
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,760
Arthur's been complaining
about the state of his chambers.

161
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:08,640
We're not missing the chance
to begin your education.

162
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:11,925
- Really. I should go.
- Sit.

163
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,240
We'll start
with some basic anatomy...

164
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,566
What took you so long?

165
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:31,281
Sorry. Once Gaius gets talking about
anatomy, there's no stopping him.

166
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:39,961
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- I'm doing my best.

167
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,600
I'll get you some more water.

168
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,880
'Thank you, Emrys. '

169
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:53,080
'Emrys? Why do you call me that?'

170
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:55,920
'Among my people, that is your name. '

171
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:59,721
'You know who I am. How?'

172
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,120
Speak to me.

173
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,360
I don't know if he can't speak,
or... he's just too scared to.

174
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,760
Hello?

175
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,761
Do you have to do that?
You scared the life out of me.

176
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,081
The young warlock. No doubt you're
here about the Druid boy.

177
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:03,320
- How did you know?
- Like you, I hear him speak.

178
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:05,457
Why does he call me Emrys?

179
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:07,525
Because that is your name.

180
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,761
I'm pretty sure my name's
Merlin, always has been.

181
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:13,721
- You have many names.
- Do I?

182
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:19,401
How does the boy know who I am?
I've never even met any Druids.

183
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:23,360
There is much written about you
that you have yet to read.

184
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,520
You should not protect this boy.

185
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,446
Why?

186
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:32,166
He has magic. He's just like me.

187
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,721
You and the boy are as different
as day and night.

188
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:39,360
- What do you mean?
- Heed my words, Merlin.

189
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:41,240
Why should I not protect him?

190
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
Let me care for him for a while.

191
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,565
You need to sleep.

192
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,560
You'll make yourself sick
if you go on like this.

193
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:08,000
- His fever's getting worse.
- 'Morgana. '

194
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:10,765
- Did you hear that?
- What?

195
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,560
- He said my name.
- Did he? I didn't hear anything.

196
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:16,641
It's Merlin.

197
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,446
- How is he?
- He's getting weaker.

198
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:36,681
What you did yesterday hasn't worked.
We have to ask Gaius for help.

199
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,361
After all you've done,
you can't give up now.

200
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:44,246
Please!

201
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,680
If he doesn't receive
treatment, he'll die.

202
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:47,601
OK.

203
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:52,960
The search for this Druid boy
is becoming a real nuisance.

204
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:55,957
With all the extra security
around the castle,

205
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,920
it's taking me
twice as long to do my round.

206
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:00,721
Is that everything?

207
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:06,240
Morgana's hiding the
Druid boy in her chambers.

208
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,681
When you say that Morgana's
hiding the Druid boy,

209
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:21,158
- I take it you're helping her?
- Sort of.

210
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:24,600
You promised you
wouldn't get involved.

211
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:28,045
I know. I'm sorry. I had no choice.

212
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,200
Every guard in Camelot
is searching for this boy,

213
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,285
and you're harbouring him
under their very noses.

214
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,286
Can't you see how dangerous that is?
What were you thinking of?

215
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:38,560
- Was I supposed to hand him over?
- You think you can save this boy?

216
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,366
Who's going to save you?

217
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:42,880
You're saying it's wrong
to harbour a young magician?

218
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:55,400
The difference is, Merlin,
that your magic is still secret,

219
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,440
although it's a wonder how,
considering how careless you are.

220
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:03,240
The boy's hurt. He's really sick.

221
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,760
I've tried to treat him.

222
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,965
We need your help.

223
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,645
So now you want me
to risk my neck, too?

224
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,040
I wish the boy no harm,
but it's too dangerous.

225
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,180
If you don't, we may as well
hand him over, cos he'll die anyway.

226
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,721
You didn't turn your back on me.
Please don't turn your back on him.

227
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,761
I will treat the boy, but as soon
as he's well, get him out of Camelot.

228
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:50,680
And woe betide anyone
caught helping him.

229
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,361
Well, one thing we know for certain.

230
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:03,406
What's that?

231
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:05,361
You're no physician.

232
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:09,846
Halt there.

233
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:11,960
The guards are searching
everyone leaving the town.

234
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:14,286
There is another way out.

235
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:18,041
There's a secret door in the armoury.
It leads to the lower town.

236
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:20,040
No. It's too dangerous.

237
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:21,565
I'll do it.

238
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,980
I'm good with secret
doors and things.

239
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,360
If you are caught,
Uther will execute you.

240
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,525
The boy's my responsibility.

241
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,820
I'll smuggle him out of the castle.

242
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,080
You'll need a key for the door.

243
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:36,160
- Who has it?
- Arthur.

244
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:57,881
Is there any bread? What was that?

245
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,241
- What?
- There was a sound.

246
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:02,241
Was there?

247
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,281
What is that?

248
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,445
Can't you hear it?!

249
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,801
- I can't hear anything.
- Are you deaf?

250
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:20,400
It's like a jangling sound.

251
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,205
- There!
- What?

252
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,081
I thought I saw something.

253
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,206
- What was that?
- What?

254
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:43,241
A different sound, like a splash.

255
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:48,321
Bread?

256
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,840
It'll have to do.

257
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,800
I fear I've put you in danger
without asking how you feel about it.

258
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:10,405
I'm sorry.

259
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,201
I know how it feels
to face the threat of execution.

260
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:16,841
It's Merlin.

261
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,885
We're going to get you
out of Camelot.

262
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,680
I won't let anything
bad happen to you. I promise.

263
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:30,165
Are you ready?

264
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,441
Did you get the keys?

265
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:38,601
Yeah. The door is behind the
shield at the far end of the armoury.

266
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:41,681
I'll pack you some food
and water for the journey.

267
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:43,801
Be careful.

268
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,641
I hope they're OK.
Morgana really cares about the boy.

269
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,760
I've never seen her
this way with anyone.

270
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm sure
she just wants to protect him.

271
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:54,080
Hmm.

272
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:04,161
A servant saw someone entering.
They had a boy with them.

273
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,760
Sound the warning bell.

274
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,880
They're coming.

275
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:32,526
There's enough food for three days.

276
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:35,120
Your horse is fed and watered.
I'll take you to it.

277
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:37,680
- No point in us all risking it.
- What about you?

278
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:39,486
- I'll take my chances.
- Morgana...

279
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,761
I couldn't live with myself if
anything happened to either of you.

280
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:45,166
We must go.

281
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,160
'Goodbye, Emrys. '

282
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:26,001
Fan out.

283
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,561
Halt, or I'll run you through.

284
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:10,520
Show yourself.

285
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,240
Let him go. I beg you.
He's just a child.

286
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:33,720
Restrain them.

287
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,286
All this time, you've been
hiding the boy in my own palace.

288
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:46,401
- How could you betray me like this?
- I would not see him executed.

289
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:49,481
I've treated you like a daughter.
Is this how you repay me?

290
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:51,046
I did what I thought was right.

291
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:53,321
To conspire
with my enemies against me?

292
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:55,405
He's just a boy.

293
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,486
- He is a Druid.
- Is that such a crime?

294
00:26:57,521 --> 00:27:01,001
His kind would see me dead
and you would help them.

295
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,601
Then punish me... but spare the boy.

296
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:06,966
I beg you.

297
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,961
Make arrangements for the boy
to be executed tomorrow morning.

298
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:11,458
No! Please. He's done nothing.

299
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:13,927
Let this be a lesson to you.

300
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:16,326
You don't have to do this.

301
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:18,120
Do you hear me?
I want him executed at dawn.

302
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:20,686
Yes, father.

303
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,320
What have these people done to you?

304
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:24,565
Why are you so full of hate?

305
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,605
Enough!
I will not hear another word!

306
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,520
Do not speak to me until
you are ready to apologise.

307
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:49,961
I promised that I wouldn't
let anything bad happen.

308
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:53,121
- You tried your best.
- It's not enough.

309
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,161
He's in jail now.
There's nothing more we can do.

310
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,921
I will not let him die.

311
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,601
Can I count on your help?

312
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,081
Thank you.

313
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:27,961
Perhaps imprisonment is a more
suitable punishment for the boy.

314
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:31,966
It would allow him to grow
until he strikes against us.

315
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,601
We don't know he's gonna strike
against us. He's yet to do anything.

316
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:36,886
It is enough that his people
conspire to overthrow me.

317
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:40,081
This is harsh, but necessary. I
take no pleasure in killing the boy.

318
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:42,485
Then spare him for Morgana's sake.

319
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,281
If you execute him
I fear she will never forgive you.

320
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:50,880
I do not seek her forgiveness!

321
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:53,081
She has betrayed me.

322
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,921
Yet you're sparing her.

323
00:29:01,361 --> 00:29:04,161
She has the promise I made her
father to thank for that.

324
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:06,921
The boy enjoys no such privilege.

325
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,960
He will be executed at dawn.
Is that clear?

326
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,566
Make yourself at home

327
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:28,721
You can't let your father
execute the boy.

328
00:29:28,756 --> 00:29:31,045
You're lucky he's not executing you.

329
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,560
Was he really behind the screen when
I came to search your chambers?

330
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,361
I know you believe your
father's wrong to execute him.

331
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:42,758
What I believe doesn't matter.

332
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:44,756
My father's made up his mind.

333
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,685
He won't be talked out of it.

334
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,980
- I tried.
- Then the time for talking is over.

335
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:53,240
Whatever you're thinking,
it's not going to happen.

336
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:55,320
We have to get the boy back
to his people.

337
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:56,085
No. Forget it.

338
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,200
You'd let an innocent child die?

339
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:02,280
It's too late. He's been caught.

340
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,526
I have no choice.

341
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:09,000
And is this how you will rule
when you are king?

342
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:10,800
You're not like your father.

343
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,160
- I will not betray him.
- If I know you at all,

344
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:19,121
you won't stand by
and let this happen.

345
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,681
Please.

346
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:28,601
If you won't do this for the boy,

347
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:31,080
then do it for me.

348
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,286
Sorry. Was I interrupting something?

349
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:55,341
Nothing you need
concern yourself with.

350
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,361
Make yourself useful,
muck out my horses.

351
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:00,160
I trust Merlin.

352
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,281
We're going to break the Druid boy
out of the dungeons.

353
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:13,966
You can't do that.

354
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:16,641
We have to. Uther's going
to have him executed him at dawn.

355
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:18,685
I mean...

356
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,925
it's too dangerous.

357
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,600
if the King catches you a second
time he'll never forgive you.

358
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,645
- I'm not worried for myself.
- Merlin's right.

359
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,601
When my father finds out the boy's
escaped, he will suspect you.

360
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,005
It's suicide.

361
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,725
You must go to my
father and apologise.

362
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,685
Dine with him, so you're with him
when the boy escapes.

363
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,880
You need me if the plan is to work.
You can't do this on your own.

364
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,565
- Merlin will take your place.
- Me?

365
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm going to take the boy
out through the burial vaults.

366
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,997
There's a tunnel
that leads beyond the city walls.

367
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:58,005
Get my horse from the
stables and meet me there.

368
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,200
There's a grate that covers
the entrance to the tunnel.

369
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:04,041
- Bring a rope and grappling hook.
- No, I can't.

370
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:06,726
Merlin. Do you understand?

371
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:08,960
If you're not there to meet us,

372
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,040
we will surely be caught.

373
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,220
I need to know why you
told me not to protect the boy.

374
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:29,440
You seek my counsel
and yet you choose to ignore it.

375
00:32:29,475 --> 00:32:31,045
Just tell me why.

376
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,721
If the boy lives,
you cannot fulfil your destiny.

377
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:39,680
You said it's my destiny
to protect Arthur?

378
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:43,160
Then you have the answer you seek.

379
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,001
You're telling me that little boy
is going to kill Arthur?

380
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:53,280
It seems that is up to you.

381
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:00,605
No.

382
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,965
You can't know that for certain.

383
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,485
You have it in your power
to prevent a great evil.

384
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,760
There must be another way?
The future isn't set in stone.

385
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,880
You must let the boy die.

386
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:30,606
the plight of the Druid boy

387
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:34,080
that's causing your forehead
to wrinkle like a lizard's elbow.

388
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:40,885
Would you let
something terrible happen

389
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,001
if it meant you'd stop something
even worse happening in the future?

390
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:49,200
I suppose it depends
on what the 'terrible'

391
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,401
and 'even worse' things were.

392
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:53,841
One of them's bad,

393
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,840
really bad.

394
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:02,201
And the other... it's unthinkable.

395
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,440
It sounds as if you've already
made your decision.

396
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:12,766
You can only do what you believe
to be right, Merlin.

397
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:16,521
I just hope it doesn't involve you
putting yourself in terrible danger.

398
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,161
For once, you don't have to worry.

399
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:27,641
I'm going to do nothing.

400
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,566
Thank you.

401
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:44,406
What is it? What's wrong?

402
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:49,320
You're risking so much for this boy.
You don't know anything about him.

403
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:53,321
- You don't even know his name.
- There's a bond between us.

404
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:56,678
Stronger than the bond
you have with Uther?

405
00:34:56,713 --> 00:34:59,776
It's like nothing
I've ever felt before.

406
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:02,840
Perhaps I was always
meant to help him.

407
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,838
How can that be?

408
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:06,801
I don't know.

409
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:11,561
I can't explain it.

410
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,521
I must go to Uther.

411
00:35:19,556 --> 00:35:22,481
Good luck.

412
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:43,640
I have come to apologise, my Lord.

413
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:50,601
You have been generous,
kind and fair.

414
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:53,681
And I owe you everything.

415
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:57,560
I truly don't know
what came over me.

416
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,600
I acted without thinking
of the consequences.

417
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,841
My behaviour was unforgivable.

418
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,161
I am glad you have seen sense.

419
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:19,361
Dine with me. Let's put this
unfortunate incident behind us.

420
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,606
Don't be scared.

421
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,960
I have sent word to your people,
I'm taking you to them.

422
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,640
You must come with me.

423
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,960
This way.

424
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,521
It's the Druid boy. He's escaped!

425
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:44,441
Merlin... Merlin!

426
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:50,441
Don't worry, he'll be here.

427
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,165
Guard!

428
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,880
Find out why they have sounded
the warning bell.

429
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:05,440
Yes, my Lord.

430
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:12,881
Damn it, Merlin!

431
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,800
'Emrys?'

432
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:43,525
'Emrys?

433
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,441
Where are you, Emrys?

434
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:50,086
'Emrys. '

435
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:53,001
'Help us. Please!'

436
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:55,881
'They're coming. '

437
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:05,321
Look down here.

438
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,606
'I'm scared, Emrys.

439
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,840
'They will kill me. Don't do this. '

440
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,086
'Don't ignore me. '

441
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:18,561
'I know you can hear me.
I thought you were my friend. '

442
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:21,641
'We're the same.
I don't want to die. '

443
00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:24,720
'Emrys! Emrys,'

444
00:39:24,755 --> 00:39:28,000
'Emrys!'

445
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,245
Hey!

446
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,126
Where the hell have you been?

447
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:43,881
I had trouble getting
out of the castle.

448
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,520
Get this grate off, they're coming.

449
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,286
If my father asks where I am,
I've gone on a hunting trip.

450
00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:05,961
You'd better make yourself scarce,
or they'll execute you in his place.

451
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:12,000
'Goodbye, Emrys. I know that
someday we will meet again. '

452
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,006
My Lord. I regret to report

453
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:28,480
that the Druid boy
has escaped from the dungeons.

454
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:29,926
- What!? How?
- My Lord.

455
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,645
He was assisted by some accomplices.

456
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,620
The guards are searching
Camelot as we speak.

457
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:37,560
Find him and his accomplices
and kill them.

458
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:38,961
Yes, my Lord.

459
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,721
If I discover that you were somehow
involved in freeing this boy,

460
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:51,886
will be extremely severe.

461
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:56,520
My Lord, you know I respect you too
much to ever betray you like that.

462
00:40:56,555 --> 00:41:00,681
I made a promise to your father
that I would protect you.

463
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:02,566
But if you cross me again,

464
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:06,321
I will break that promise
without a second thought.

465
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:49,881
We are forever indebted to you,
Arthur Pendragon

466
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,726
for returning the boy to us.

467
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:55,601
You must not let it be known that
it was I who brought him to you.

468
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:59,360
We will tell no-one.
You have my word.

469
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:12,240
Wait, I don't even know your name.

470
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,161
At least tell me your name.

471
00:42:16,196 --> 00:42:18,641
It's all right.

472
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:22,720
My name is Mordred.

473
00:42:25,841 --> 00:42:29,361
Good luck, Mordred.

474
00:42:56,481 --> 00:43:01,321
- Tristan's tomb is empty.
- Dead men do not return.

475
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:03,641
Single combat. To the death.

476
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,000
He's been conjured
from the dead.

477
00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:10,005
This will be your death.

478
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,280
I need to find a weapon
that will kill the dead.

479
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,560
AAAAGH!
