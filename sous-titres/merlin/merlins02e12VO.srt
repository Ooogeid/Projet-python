1
00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:03,334
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,591 --> 00:00:05,404
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:05,574 --> 00:00:08,070
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:09,705
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:11,030
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,630
<i>Arthur's Knights</i>

7
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,990
Merlin - 2x12
<i>The Fires of Idirsholas</i>

8
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,719
I'm a herder
from the Northern Plains, Sire.

9
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,590
Three nights back, we were camped
beneath the walls of Idirsholas...

10
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,592
I would've not chosen such a place.

11
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,870
Good pasture is scarce, Sire.

12
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,710
- What is it you have to tell me?
- While we were there...

13
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:39,870
we saw smoke
rising from the citadel.

14
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,510
- And did you see anything else?
- No.

15
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,630
Did you go inside?

16
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,173
Nobody has stepped over that threshold
for 300 years.

17
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,670
You must know the legend.

18
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,630
"When the fires of Idirsholas burn,
the Knights of Medhir will ride again."

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,030
Give him some food
and a bed for the night.

20
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,230
Take a ride out there.

21
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,310
Why?

22
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,790
- So we can put people's minds at rest.
- Surely this is superstitious nonsense.

23
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,630
Gather the guard and do as I say.

24
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,920
Why's Uther so worried?

25
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,730
Because the Knights of Medhir
are a force to be reckoned with.

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,136
- So you believe the story as well?
- It is more than a story, Merlin.

27
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,350
Some 300 years ago,

28
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:34,303
seven of Camelot's knights
were seduced by a sorcerer's call.

29
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:37,209
One by one,
they succumbed to her power.

30
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:39,076
At her command,

31
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:41,230
they became
a terrifying and brutal force

32
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,510
that rode through the lands
leaving...

33
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,430
death and destruction in their wake.

34
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,630
What happened?

35
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,619
It was only after the sorcerer herself
was killed

36
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,270
that the Knights of Medhir

37
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,150
finally grew still.

38
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,540
If what Joseph says is true,

39
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:59,550
then something has awoken them.

40
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,470
I fear for each and every one of us.

41
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:47,850
Are you all right?

42
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,710
Just a little cold.

43
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,345
- Do you need something warmer?
- No. Thank you.

44
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,317
What is it, Merlin?

45
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:08,573
Don't tell me you've been listening
to Gaius' bedtime stories again.

46
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,619
I hope that's all they are.

47
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,270
You look well.

48
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,640
Thanks to you.

49
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:53,078
I wear it all the time.

50
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:55,460
I can't remember
when I last had a bad dream.

51
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:58,390
You do not seem happy.
Why's that?

52
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,042
I would be,

53
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,590
if I didn't have to pretend.

54
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,705
Pretend?

55
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,782
That I am Uther's loving ward...

56
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:11,608
when I hate him.

57
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,501
Have you ever imagined a new world?

58
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:22,311
One where Uther was no more?

59
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,150
Sometimes.

60
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:27,950
Is that what you'd like?

61
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,470
I once had the chance
to be his assassin.

62
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,757
And what stopped you?

63
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,022
I don't know.

64
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,109
I believed he cared for me.

65
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:39,868
But not any more.

66
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:41,668
He cares for no-one.

67
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:45,070
So you want Uther destroyed
and his reign to end?

68
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,146
More than anything.

69
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,858
But it doesn't matter what I want.

70
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,150
The future is not of my making.

71
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:57,230
You are wrong, Morgana.

72
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,168
You underestimate your importance.

73
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:05,539
The decisions you make now
will change the shape

74
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,591
of everything that is to come.

75
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:09,950
What do you mean?

76
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,550
Whose side are you on?

77
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,950
Are you with Uther,

78
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,350
or are you with me?

79
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:19,327
Are you prepared to help me
bring about his downfall?

80
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,417
I am.

81
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:29,275
I can't tell you how much it means
to hear you say that.

82
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,002
Good morning, my lady.

83
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,910
Did you sleep well?

84
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:24,950
Better than you by, the looks of it.

85
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,833
Sorry.

86
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:34,781
I have court business
that needs attending to.

87
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,630
You have to stay in bed, Sire.

88
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,148
You have a fever.

89
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,110
I'll prepare a tonic.

90
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,550
When did he first fall ill?

91
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:48,536
It came on this morning.

92
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:51,576
It's not something to worry about?

93
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,985
It'll soon pass.

94
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:56,670
Be sure to let me know
if there's any change.

95
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:24,310
- What's that noise?
- What noise?

96
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,150
A sort of trembling sound.

97
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:28,190
That's your knees knocking together.

98
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,754
I fear this contagion is spreading.

99
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,549
You're the fifth person today.

100
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,270
It's nothing.

101
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,169
Damn!

102
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:47,749
I'll pick that up later.

103
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:51,409
I think I might need
a little something myself.

104
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:54,698
If I can ever find
what it is I'm looking for.

105
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,739
Seems part of Joseph's story
was true.

106
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,937
Probably just travellers
passing through.

107
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:23,150
Or maybe not.

108
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:15,390
Run, Merlin!

109
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:21,230
Will you do as I say!

110
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,935
What happened to your arm?

111
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,235
- Must have caught it on something.
- Let me see.

112
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:57,670
Your first battle wound.

113
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,990
Here.

114
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,070
- No, don't... You'll ruin it!
- Don't worry.

115
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:06,510
You can mend it.

116
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,519
Did anyone else escape?

117
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,351
We need to get back to Camelot.
Gather reinforcements.

118
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:32,590
Are they dead?

119
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,257
No. They're breathing.

120
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:37,310
What's happened to them?

121
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,110
I don't know.

122
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,080
What's going on?

123
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,510
I'll get Gaius.

124
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:44,022
They're all fast asleep.

125
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,990
- It must be some kind of sickness.
- Where's my father?

126
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,697
Where is he?

127
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,545
It must be the work of magic.

128
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:11,394
We have to find my father.

129
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:03,270
It's me, Morgana.

130
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:05,970
What's happened?

131
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,784
- I didn't know it was you.
- Calm down, Morgana.

132
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,270
Tell me what happened.

133
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,790
People were complaining,
saying they weren't feeling well.

134
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,050
And then?

135
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,796
They started falling asleep.

136
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,550
- Everyone. Everywhere I went.
- Was someone here?

137
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:24,630
- Then why were you hiding?
- I told you I didn't know who you were.

138
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,150
Where's my father?

139
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:29,835
- I don't know.
- She's distressed!

140
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:32,110
If she was awake,
then she must've seen something.

141
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,417
I saw nothing.

142
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:35,590
You saw people getting sick.
What did you do?

143
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:38,790
- What could I do?
- I don't understand.

144
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:42,270
Why is it that
you're the only person awake?

145
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:02,008
Don't worry, I won't say anything.

146
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:03,613
- About what?
- The illness.

147
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,271
- That has nothing to do with me.
- No, but you have magic.

148
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,830
- You haven't told anyone that?
- No. I won't tell Arthur, but...

149
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,223
There must be something
keeping you safe.

150
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:15,870
And I think that must be it.

151
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:18,030
Right.

152
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,510
I've found him!

153
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,630
- Father!
- See, he's all right.

154
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:30,070
- He is not all right!
- He's just asleep.

155
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:33,830
All we have to do is find a cure,
a way to wake them.

156
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,630
Who could have done this?

157
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:42,350
You're the only one not affected.
There must be a reason.

158
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:48,070
- I don't know.
- That's all you keep saying.

159
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:49,910
You must know something.

160
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:52,786
They just fell asleep, one by one!

161
00:15:54,424 --> 00:15:55,492
It's obvious.

162
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,740
When she started feeling sick,
Gaius gave her a potion, right?

163
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,990
When was she sick?
She never said that.

164
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,244
She was one of
the last to be affected.

165
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:05,070
Somehow the potion must've helped.

166
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:07,110
What about everyone else?

167
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,596
Gaius was too ill.

168
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:15,045
He didn't have the chance
to treat anyone else.

169
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,944
Go and see
if you can find this potion.

170
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:22,910
I'll search for signs of life.

171
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,430
Morgana, you stay here

172
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,690
and look after my father.
Keep him safe.

173
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
Here.

174
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:30,371
Protect him with your life,
you understand?

175
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,123
All right.

176
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:06,981
Gaius, this is going to wake you.

177
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,602
All right...

178
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:33,805
We can try this.

179
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:43,876
Well, maybe not.

180
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:48,823
Come on, Gaius.

181
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,019
I need you to wake up.

182
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,491
I really need your help.

183
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,544
Here we go.

184
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,811
Come quickly!

185
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:15,154
According to the legend,
there were only 7 Knights of Medhir.

186
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:17,622
- Then who's the extra rider?
- I don't know.

187
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,779
But Camelot is defenceless.

188
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:21,830
We have to get back to my father.

189
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,310
This will be the first place they look.
We have to hide him.

190
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,270
- What's going on?
- We're under attack.

191
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,615
No time to explain.
Grab his legs, carry him.

192
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,390
Don't sweep the floor with him!

193
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,710
- Pick his feet up.
- His feet aren't the problem.

194
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,070
Give him a hand.

195
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,910
It is not funny, Merlin.

196
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,630
Did you find the potion?

197
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,430
We can't leave him.
We have to lift him onto the bed.

198
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,550
Why? He's asleep.
He's not going to know.

199
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,070
Well... I'll get him a pillow.

200
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,430
He's the King!

201
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,763
All right, two pillows.

202
00:19:58,009 --> 00:19:59,030
Are you all right?

203
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,070
You feeling the same?

204
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:03,830
We're getting sick.

205
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,645
We can't let that happen.
We must keep my father hidden.

206
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,992
Why don't we disguise him?

207
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:15,670
- That might work.
- We could dress him as a woman.

208
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:19,004
That, on the other hand...

209
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,070
- And as a servant?
- That's better.

210
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,165
I'll get him some clothes.

211
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,396
Are you all right, Morgana?
You seem quiet.

212
00:20:31,268 --> 00:20:32,270
I'm fine.

213
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:33,836
Are you sure?

214
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,883
I can always tell when you're lying.

215
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,550
Don't worry.
I won't let any harm come to him.

216
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,950
What's going on?
Why is everyone asleep?

217
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,635
Please, not you as well.

218
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,029
I need your help.
What am I going to do?

219
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:54,102
Don't pretend.

220
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,082
I know you're listening to me.

221
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:00,476
I don't need to listen to you.

222
00:22:00,646 --> 00:22:02,809
You always say the same thing.

223
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:04,120
"Help me!"

224
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:07,986
And yet you refuse
to give anything in return.

225
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:10,920
Now you will face
the consequence of that decision.

226
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,470
Camelot's end is nigh

227
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,750
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

228
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,590
I know, I promised to free you.
And I will.

229
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,790
I will, I promise!

230
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,470
I no longer trust your promises.

231
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:28,458
I swear on my mother's life.

232
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,911
Careful what you say.

233
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:39,994
You have to help me.

234
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:42,750
Please!

235
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,110
Her life matters more to you
than your own.

236
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:49,847
This is an oath I believe
you will honour.

237
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:51,017
I will.

238
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:55,719
It is one thing to cast a spell
that puts everyone to sleep.

239
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,830
The power to maintain it

240
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,798
is a very different matter.

241
00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:03,558
It will need more than just words
to break this enchantment.

242
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:06,350
- What do you mean?
- You must...

243
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,411
eradicate the source, Merlin.

244
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,167
- Great, what is that?
- Not what, but who.

245
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:14,043
Such spells need a vessel,

246
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:17,250
a constant living presence
to give them strength.

247
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,030
The source of this pestilence

248
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,070
is the witch, the Lady Morgana.

249
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:28,070
- It can't be.
- I have warned you

250
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,892
about her in the past,
but you have failed to take heed.

251
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:32,830
She is dangerous.

252
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,616
And now she has chosen
to turn her back on her own.

253
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:47,173
How do I stop her?

254
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:49,910
That is easy, young warlock.

255
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:51,808
You must kill her.

256
00:23:56,296 --> 00:23:57,710
The spell is woven

257
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,910
with magic of such power
that even you are not immune.

258
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,081
You must act now,
before it's too late.

259
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,882
If you do not,

260
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:09,950
then Camelot will fall
and Arthur will die.

261
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:13,070
And the future
you were destined to share

262
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,865
will die with you.

263
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:06,899
What took you so long?

264
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:09,028
I didn't know Uther's size.

265
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:27,430
I was worried about you.

266
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,784
They're here in the castle.

267
00:25:30,954 --> 00:25:33,030
- Where's Arthur?
- He's gone to find somewhere safe.

268
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:36,950
Thank you for not saying anything.

269
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:38,830
That's all right.

270
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,059
You're a good friend.

271
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,426
We have to move my father
before Morgause gets here.

272
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,870
Come on, let's go.

273
00:25:57,948 --> 00:25:59,444
You're not surprised?

274
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,863
No, I am not.

275
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,450
We should be safe in here
for a while.

276
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,470
It must be the potion
Gaius gave her.

277
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:23,670
Yeah, must be the potion.

278
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,329
We can't keep this up much longer.

279
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:28,508
I know.

280
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,705
We're in a servant's quarters.
If we leave him here,

281
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,630
- they'll think he's a servant.
- Not if Morgause sees him.

282
00:26:37,587 --> 00:26:39,230
We need to get him out of Camelot.

283
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:43,630
When we arrived,

284
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,150
there was a cart in the main square.
Remember?

285
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,390
You are full of good ideas today.

286
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,350
You go and look.

287
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:18,274
We won't make it to the cart.
Not carrying Uther.

288
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:20,830
That's why we've made this.
We're going to pull him.

289
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:35,461
Get down and keep quiet.

290
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,803
Protect the King,
get him out of here!

291
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,210
Please!

292
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,230
Help me.

293
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:30,324
We need the remedy
that Gaius gave you.

294
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:34,866
- I don't have it.
- I know that.

295
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:36,550
But you must remember

296
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:37,870
what it was.

297
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:39,470
What was in it?

298
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,550
Come on,
we can't keep going much longer.

299
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,915
- Think!
- Sorry...

300
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,110
We can't get it, anyway.
We're trapped.

301
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,441
There has to be something we can do!

302
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,396
Why didn't that knight kill you?

303
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:56,750
How do I know?

304
00:29:57,554 --> 00:29:58,630
Because I'm a woman?

305
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,590
Maybe.

306
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,974
Unless we can rid ourselves of this,
I don't see how we can hold out.

307
00:30:07,144 --> 00:30:09,070
We have to destroy
the source of the magic.

308
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:10,582
Which is...?

309
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:13,630
I don't know.

310
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,497
Then our only chance
is to get out of Camelot.

311
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,969
Help me with my father.

312
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:32,070
Cut the blanket up,

313
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,155
we'll tie it to my father
and we'll lower him onto the cart.

314
00:30:37,264 --> 00:30:38,910
Please, just do as I say.

315
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,830
I'll fetch the cart
round to the window.

316
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,270
You're going out there?

317
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,390
I'll come with you.

318
00:30:49,937 --> 00:30:52,510
You stay, you protect my father.

319
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,590
- You won't reach the cart alone.
- We have no choice.

320
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,711
- How are you feeling?
- Not bad.

321
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:00,550
- You sure?
- Yeah. You?

322
00:31:00,954 --> 00:31:02,310
Never better.

323
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:04,150
Get me a pillow.

324
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,754
Don't mess around.

325
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,510
You need to stay awake.

326
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,790
That's better.

327
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:17,390
If you ever do that again...

328
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,150
Well, don't fall asleep, then!

329
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:32,590
That your knees again?

330
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:43,750
- If I need a servant in a next life...
- Don't ask me.

331
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:56,870
He's not going to survive.

332
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:00,230
I know.

333
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,750
We've got to do something.

334
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:06,575
I know.

335
00:32:15,215 --> 00:32:16,350
You tear this up.

336
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:18,350
I'll make some rope.

337
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:42,270
Here, have some water.

338
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,550
I'm not thirsty.

339
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,499
If we get out of here,
you couldn't drink.

340
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,070
If we get out of here.

341
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:18,750
Here.

342
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:20,310
I'm fine.

343
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:23,606
You have some before I finish it.

344
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,335
Thank you.

345
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,721
What has he done to you?

346
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,516
I had to.

347
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:06,630
You poisoned her!

348
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:13,590
You gave me no choice.

349
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,895
Tell me what you used
and I can save her.

350
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:16,870
First,

351
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,670
stop the attack.

352
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,774
You're nothing but a simple servant.
You don't tell me what to do.

353
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,390
If you want to know what poison it is,
you will undo the magic.

354
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,562
- Tell me the poison or you'll die.
- Then she'll die with me.

355
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,229
I don't want this any more than you.

356
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,082
But you give me no choice.

357
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:49,230
Stop the knights
and you can save her.

358
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,150
- What have you done with my father?
- He's safe.

359
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,299
Keep away from her.

360
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:26,331
I couldn't find you.

361
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:30,717
Are you all right?

362
00:37:31,308 --> 00:37:33,123
Is there still no sign of her?

363
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:35,350
We've looked, Father.

364
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:41,150
Morgause must not be allowed
to get away with this!

365
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,590
Yes, Father.

366
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,683
I haven't had a chance
to say thank you.

367
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:54,437
I failed, Father.

368
00:37:54,745 --> 00:37:56,343
I should have protected Morgana.

369
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,497
That was my duty.

370
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:04,190
Her loss will be on my conscience,
not yours.

371
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:32,910
You did the right thing.

372
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,470
You don't mean that.

373
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,950
Morgana was your friend, too.

374
00:38:42,143 --> 00:38:43,465
You cared about her.

375
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:44,635
I did.

376
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:46,710
I fear that, unlike you,

377
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,710
Morgana chose
not to use her gift for good.

378
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,397
You had no choice.

379
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:00,716
Would we be sitting here now

380
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,270
if you had not made that decision?

381
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,100
Where are you going?

382
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,390
I'll eat that later.

383
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:29,523
There's something I have to do.

384
00:39:45,538 --> 00:39:49,030
<i>You must steal a sword
from the Knights of Medhir.</i>

385
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:55,476
<i>Their blades were forged
by the Old Religion.</i>

386
00:39:57,496 --> 00:40:00,500
<i>If you harness its power
to your own,</i>

387
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,958
<i>you will have the strength
to break the chains</i>

388
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:06,921
<i>with which Uther Pendragon
keeps me prisoner.</i>

389
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,630
The time has come, young warlock.

390
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,628
Where will you go?

391
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:31,616
I am the last of my kind.

392
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:34,430
There is but one road I can take.

393
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,430
- What does that mean?
- You will see.

394
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:42,630
Before I do this,

395
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,590
you promise me

396
00:41:46,815 --> 00:41:48,699
that you will not harm Camelot.

397
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,190
I think there have been
enough bargains.

398
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,383
Don't you?

399
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,110
Now!
