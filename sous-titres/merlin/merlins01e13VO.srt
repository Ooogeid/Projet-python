1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,961
In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

2
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:08,970
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

3
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,690
Merlin! Spear.

4
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:41,811
Do you have any
natural gifts, Merlin? No.

5
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:44,250
Let me think...

6
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,530
I'm not naturally rude
or insensitive.

7
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,530
Just naturally irritating.

8
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:04,331
It's probably more scared of you
than you are of it.

9
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,211
Have we lost it? Who's missing?

10
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:52,931
Where's Sir Bedivere?

11
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:55,611
Aaaaagh!

12
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,451
The creature you describe
has all the characteristics

13
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:37,610
of the Questing Beast.
Surely that's a myth.

14
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,771
The appearance of the Questing Beast

15
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:43,131
is supposed to foreshadow
a time of great upheaval.

16
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,891
Gaius, that's an old wives' tale.

17
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,451
Look, whatever it is,
it is spreading panic.

18
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,891
The people fear
it will enter the city.

19
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:54,731
Then we must kill it. Arthur, gather
the guard together. We ride at dawn.

20
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:06,091
I beg you, Sire - do not
dismiss this. The beast is an omen.

21
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:10,011
I have seen it come before - the
night your wife Ygraine passed away.

22
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:13,650
I've told you not to speak
of that night again.

23
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,491
I have conquered the Old Religion.
Its warnings mean nothing to me now.

24
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:25,010
Arthur will destroy the beast
and we no longer suffer at its hand.

25
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,411
This is no ordinary beast, Merlin.

26
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,171
Don't worry. No, listen to me.
You don't understand.

27
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,850
Uther may not respect the Old
Religion, but it is very real.

28
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,330
To face a beast such as this, you
must understand where it came from.

29
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,651
What do you mean? At the very heart
of the Old Religion

30
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:48,170
lies the magic
of life and death itself.

31
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,371
The Questing Beast
carries that power.

32
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,771
One bite, you die.

33
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,891
And there is no cure.

34
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:11,970
Morgana! Morgana!

35
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,050
Wake up! No! No!

36
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,570
It's me, it's Gwen! Stop it.
It was just another dream.

37
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,570
It was terrifying. It's all right.

38
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,571
You've seen the foe we face.

39
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:31,971
It's a creature of nightmare.

40
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,530
But you are the best knights
in the realm.

41
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,291
We can and will kill it, before it
harms another citizen of our kingdom.

42
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,371
For the love of Camelot!
For the love of Camelot!

43
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,811
Arthur!

44
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:55,050
Morgana, what are you doing?
You cannot face it!

45
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,411
Morgana, go back to bed.

46
00:04:57,411 --> 00:05:01,571
There is nothing to be afraid of.
Please, Arthur. I have seen
terrible things.

47
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,371
You cannot go. She's probably had
a bad dream, Sire.

48
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,011
I'll take her to see Gaius.
No, I will not let you go!

49
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:10,090
Please, Merlin, get her inside. No!

50
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,851
I will make sure he is safe,
my lady. I promise. No! No!

51
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,410
Let's follow the trail.

52
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,851
Keep close.

53
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,531
What is it?

54
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,730
Shh!

55
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,451
Hey!

56
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:11,691
Aaagh!

57
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:21,131
Fleoge. Bregdan anwiele gefeluec!

58
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,571
It didn't bite you, did it?

59
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,531
Arthur!

60
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,051
Somebody help me!

61
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,170
What's happened?

62
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,251
He's been bitten!
I tried to save him.

63
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:58,530
We must tell the King.

64
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,290
There must be something you can do.
I wish there was. I'll find a cure.

65
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,011
Merlin! Trust me.

66
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,970
Can you hear me, Sire?

67
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,571
Here.

68
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,211
The King will be here any moment.
He can't die.

69
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,410
It is my destiny to protect him.

70
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,570
We haven't done all the things
we're meant to do!

71
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,930
That is the lament of all men.
Gaius, he's my friend.

72
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,171
Then save him.

73
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,731
Gethlio!

74
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,771
Thurhaele!

75
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:48,131
Maybe the spells need time
to take effect.

76
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:51,690
The bite of the Questing Beast
is a death sentence
that no magic can overturn.

77
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,130
Where is my son? Arthur!

78
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:02,490
Do something, Gaius!
I am trying, Your Majesty.

79
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,931
Gaius will find a cure.
He will not let him die.

80
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,690
I will do everything in my power.

81
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,090
I will bear him to his chamber.

82
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,571
I have failed Arthur,

83
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,330
failed in my destiny.

84
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,450
And yet, you would not be here
if that were true.

85
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,330
He was bitten by the Questing Beast.

86
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,011
He's going to die.

87
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,771
Does he still breathe?

88
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,451
Only just.
Then there is still time to heal him.

89
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:43,331
I've tried, I cannot save him.

90
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:46,610
You do not know how to save him.

91
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,091
But you can tell me how?

92
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:51,410
Perhaps.

93
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,611
It will not be easy.

94
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,651
I will do anything. Anything?

95
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:59,970
Please. Just tell me
what I have to do! Very well.

96
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,970
The Questing Beast is a creature
conjured by the powers
of the Old Religion.

97
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,050
You must use the same
ancient magic to save him.

98
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,211
The Old Religion died out
centuries ago.

99
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:16,131
The Old Religion is the magic
of the earth itself.

100
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:19,170
It is the essence which binds
all things together.

101
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,691
It will last long beyond
the time of men.

102
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:24,851
But how can that help me
save Arthur?

103
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,091
You must find those
who still serve it.

104
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:34,091
Those who hold dominion
over life and death.

105
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:38,331
Go to the place that men call
the Isle of the Blessed,

106
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,650
where the power of the ancients
can still be felt.

107
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,531
There you will discover
Arthur's salvation.

108
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,010
Thank you.

109
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,091
Thank you. And Merlin -

110
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:58,691
the young Pendragon must live,
no matter what the cost.

111
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:06,491
Merlin, you're back.

112
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:10,491
I need your help. We must get this
to Arthur to ease his passing.

113
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:13,451
No. We have to save him.
We've already tried.

114
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:17,331
The Beast comes from
the Old Religion - the cure
must come from there as well.

115
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:19,131
There are few left with such an art.

116
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,410
There is an island beyond
the white mountains... No!

117
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:28,410
The Isle of the Blessed -
you know it?

118
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,851
It was said to be the centre
of the Old Religion,
the focus of its power.

119
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:38,450
Why did you keep this
from me? Because it was
too dangerous, Merlin.

120
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,851
It's our only chance!

121
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,170
I have to find it.

122
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,650
And once you are there, what will
you ask? For Arthur to be saved.

123
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,570
The Questing Beast chose Arthur.
That means the Old Religion
has decided his fate.

124
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,410
Then I will convince them to change
their minds. It is not that simple!

125
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,651
The high priests have the power
to mirror life and death.

126
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:05,810
But there will be a price to pay.

127
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,610
Merlin, please, I beg of you...

128
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,011
I'm sorry, Gaius.

129
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:24,011
But whatever the price is,
I will pay it gladly.

130
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:49,130
Here. You'll need a map.

131
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,331
And I'm going to give you this.

132
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,771
My mother gave it to me.

133
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,250
It's a rabbit's foot.

134
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,051
To keep you safe? It was said
to protect you from evil spirits.

135
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:08,130
It's rubbish.
I don't believe the superstition.

136
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,930
I don't know why I gave it to you.
No.

137
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,811
I want it.

138
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,051
Thank you.

139
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:20,810
You've got to keep Arthur alive
until I get back.

140
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:52,131
HE MOANS IN PAIN

141
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,370
Sleep, Arthur.

142
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,011
'You must travel to the place that
men call the Isle of the Blessed,

143
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:23,410
'beyond the white mountains, through
the Valley of the Fallen Kings.

144
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:33,371
'To the north of the Great Seas
of Meredor, you will find a lake.'

145
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,850
Gaius.

146
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,490
You should get some rest.

147
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,210
He must not be left alone.

148
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,250
I will nurse him.

149
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,971
You're not going to die, Arthur.
I'm telling you.

150
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,210
Because I know that one day,
you will be King,

151
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,091
a greater king than your father
could ever be.

152
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,211
It's what keeps me going.

153
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,490
You are going to live to be the man
I've seen inside you, Arthur.

154
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,530
I can see a Camelot
that is fair and just.

155
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:51,250
I can see a king that the people
will love and be proud to call
their sovereign.

156
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,610
For the love of Camelot...

157
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,770
you have to live.

158
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:26,250
Is there anything
I can get Your Majesty?

159
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,810
The people have begun
to say goodbye.

160
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:36,850
He is not yet gone, Sire.
But he will not recover.

161
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,651
Not without a miracle.

162
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:41,370
I don't believe in miracles.

163
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,850
Astyre!

164
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,530
Hello?

165
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,131
Hello, Merlin.

166
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,890
You?

167
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,971
Do you know who I am? Nimueh.

168
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,371
You can't be who the Dragon meant.

169
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:38,930
And why is that?

170
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,690
You tried to kill me.

171
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,090
Before I understood your importance.

172
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,770
And Arthur... Arthur was never
destined to die at my hand.

173
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,130
And now, it seems I will be
his salvation.

174
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,330
So you know what I've come to ask?

175
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,530
Yes. Will you do it?
I do not have the power

176
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,291
to mirror life itself
and yet give nothing in return.

177
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,570
I know a price will be asked. To
save a life, there must be a death.

178
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,171
The balance of the world
must be restored.

179
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,451
I willingly give my life
for Arthur's.

180
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:12,050
How brave you are, Merlin.

181
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,731
If only it were that simple.
What do you mean?

182
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:19,410
Once you enter into this bargain,
it cannot be undone.

183
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,330
Whatever I have to do, I will do.

184
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,131
His life is worth a hundred of mine.

185
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,491
The Cup of Life,

186
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:33,090
blessed by centuries of powerful
sorcery so that it contains
the very secret of life itself.

187
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,571
If Arthur drinks water from
the cup...he will live.

188
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:52,251
Tidrenas!

189
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,571
The bargain is struck.

190
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,170
I hope it pleases you.

191
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:50,010
Merlin!
We need to give this to Arthur.

192
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:54,651
What is it?
Water, drawn from the Cup of Life.

193
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:58,170
If Arthur drinks from it,
he will recover. Please hurry!

194
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,891
What are you waiting for?

195
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,491
What price did you pay
to redeem his life?

196
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:11,370
Whose life did you bargain?

197
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,930
We don't have time. Merlin!

198
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,731
Don't worry, Gaius,
everything's going to be all right.

199
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,451
What are you doing, physician?
What are you giving him?

200
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,770
It's, er...

201
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:41,291
It's a tincture,
made from the lobelia plant.

202
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,651
An ancient remedy
for poisonous bites.

203
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,090
A cure?

204
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,251
We hope.

205
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:55,451
Do you really think
it will have some effect?

206
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:56,931
It's our last resort, Sire.

207
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,290
Perhaps you should allow him
to rest. I will not leave him.

208
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,770
Please, Merlin, you must beware.

209
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,250
This is only the beginning.

210
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,091
Arthur!

211
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,811
The Prince lives.

212
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,530
I thought we'd lost you.

213
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,610
Don't worry, Father,
I'm not going to die.

214
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:55,211
I think there's someone watching

215
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,171
Maybe you're right.

216
00:24:57,171 --> 00:25:00,411
On your long journey to become King,

217
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,331
you'll need a guardian angel.

218
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:06,690
I shall inform the court
that their Prince lives.

219
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,411
I knew it.

220
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:19,011
I said you'd be all right.

221
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,811
I can remember you talking to me.

222
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:30,570
You can? You stroked my forehead.

223
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,211
I was tending to your fever.
Never lost faith.

224
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:37,011
I was just talking.
Tell me again what you said.

225
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:38,811
I don't remember.

226
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:40,731
Yes, you do.

227
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:42,890
No, I don't. Come on.

228
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,010
Something about
the man I am inside.

229
00:25:49,211 --> 00:25:52,811
No, I never said that. Guinevere!

230
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:54,890
I have to get these washed, Sire.

231
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,171
THUNDER RUMBLES

232
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,691
Aagh!

233
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,650
Gaius!

234
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,250
I'm alive! What is it?
What's happened? Merlin, stay there.

235
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,170
What's wrong?

236
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,451
No, don't.

237
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:32,291
Mother?

238
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:37,410
Merlin...

239
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,210
What's happened to her?
She's gravely ill.

240
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,450
Do something!
If I could... Please, Gaius.

241
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,771
Merlin, this is no ordinary illness.

242
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,290
This cannot happen! Who did you meet
at the Isle of the Blessed? Nimueh.

243
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,011
Nimueh?! It was as you said.

244
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:57,891
She demanded a price. But I
bargained my life, not my mother's!

245
00:27:57,891 --> 00:28:02,051
Merlin, I wish there
was something I could do.

246
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:09,010
I will make you better. I will.

247
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:16,771
You knew this would happen!

248
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:19,691
You had me trade
my mother's life for Arthur's!

249
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:21,770
You said you would do anything.

250
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,850
Did you know my mother would die?

251
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,890
I knew the price would be
a heavy one. But you sent me anyway.

252
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,490
We need Arthur to live.

253
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,691
I'm not one of you!

254
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:34,091
We are both creatures
of the Old Religion.

255
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:36,170
It is the source of your power.

256
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,370
What's that supposed to mean?

257
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,290
Your destiny is to protect the young
Pendragon until he claims his crown.

258
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,051
And when he does,
magic can be returned to the realm.

259
00:28:47,051 --> 00:28:50,970
Only then will I be free.

260
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,371
So that's all you cared about?

261
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:59,570
I thought you were my friend.

262
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,251
I am more than that, Merlin.

263
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:04,611
I am your kin.

264
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:09,930
No, the only family I have is my
mother, and you had me murder her.

265
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,291
Her life has not been taken in vain.

266
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:16,210
We will achieve great things
together, you and I.

267
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:25,130
For what you've done, I'll make sure
you never see the light.

268
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,330
Merlin!

269
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:44,130
You...won't see me...again.

270
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,130
Where is she?

271
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,811
She's sleeping.

272
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:27,090
I have to save her. You cannot.

273
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,770
If the balance of the world needs
a life, then Nimueh must take mine.

274
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,411
No, Merlin.

275
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:37,050
Yes. I will return to the island.

276
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:42,371
You are young.
Your gifts, your destiny,
are far too precious to sacrifice.

277
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:45,611
My destiny? This is my mother.

278
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:49,650
My powers mean nothing
if I cannot save her.

279
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,010
You have taught me so much.

280
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,091
You taught me who I am,
taught me the purpose for my skills,

281
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:09,011
taught me that magic should only
be used for great deeds.

282
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:17,730
But most of all, you have always
taught me...to do what is right.

283
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:22,530
Merlin...

284
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,171
I need to say goodbye to Arthur.

285
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,651
Ah, Merlin. How are you?

286
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:53,290
Good.

287
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,530
I'm pleased.

288
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,170
Yes.

289
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,610
I owe it all to Gaius.

290
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,130
I need to talk to you.

291
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,330
You still haven't
got it yet, have you?

292
00:32:10,491 --> 00:32:12,291
I decide when we need to talk.

293
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,931
Not today.

294
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:18,011
I sometimes wonder
if you know who I am.

295
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:20,250
Oh, I know who you are.

296
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,451
Good. You're a prat.

297
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,571
And a royal one.

298
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,970
Are you ever going to change, Merlin?
No. You'd get bored.

299
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,770
Promise me this, if you get another
servant, don't get a bootlicker.

300
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,931
If this is you trying
to leave your job... No.

301
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:49,691
I'm happy to be your servant,
till the day I die.

302
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,490
Sometimes I think I know you, Merlin.

303
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,570
Other times... Well, I know you.

304
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,531
And you're a great warrior.

305
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:11,970
One day you will be a great king.

306
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,811
That's very kind of you.

307
00:33:13,811 --> 00:33:18,210
But you must learn to listen as well
as you fight. Any other pointers?

308
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,530
No.

309
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,651
That's it.

310
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,530
Just...

311
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,610
don't be a prat.

312
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,570
Gaius had to go
and get some supplies.

313
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,731
He asked me to keep an eye on her
until you got back. Thank you.

314
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,651
I'm sorry. No, she'll get better.

315
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:07,011
I've tried to make her
feel comfortable.

316
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:12,251
You've such a good heart, Gwen.

317
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,810
Don't ever lose that.

318
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,290
I'm gonna make you well again.
I promise.

319
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,251
You'll see.

320
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,050
You're such a good son.

321
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,970
But I don't want you
to worry about me.

322
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,570
I know that the Gods
will look after me

323
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,011
and that one day,
I will see you again.

324
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,851
I will miss you.

325
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:04,490
I'll miss you, too.

326
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:30,930
Gaius?

327
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,010
'Dear Merlin,

328
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,050
'my life is already near to its end.

329
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:57,891
'There has, for the most part,
been very little purpose to it.

330
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:00,771
'Very little
that will be remembered.

331
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:07,811
'In contrast, Merlin, your life
is destined for greatness.

332
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:13,251
'Live by the tenets
I have taught you,

333
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:19,451
'and I believe you will, in time,
become the greatest warlock ever.

334
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:23,610
'To have known you has been
my greatest pleasure,

335
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:28,530
'and to sacrifice myself for you
is but an honour.

336
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:34,450
'You are, and will always be,
the son I never had.'

337
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,691
No!

338
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,330
I never thought
I'd see you here again.

339
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,171
My Lady.

340
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:20,411
It is a long time since you called me
that. I've come to ask for your help.

341
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:23,651
As you once did before, for Uther.

342
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:25,650
You did not like the outcome.

343
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,451
I offer a chance for you to atone
for the death of his wife.

344
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:30,690
I have saved the life of her son.

345
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,171
What more do you ask for?

346
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,170
That this time, you take
a just price.

347
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,130
Merlin intends to offer
his life for his mother's.

348
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,970
I want you to take mine
in his place.

349
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,211
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

350
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:47,451
With all my powers of prediction,
I could never have foretold this.

351
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,211
Gaius the hero!

352
00:37:58,211 --> 00:38:00,731
Why should I grant your wish?

353
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:04,210
You stood and watched as our friends
burned in the Great Purge.

354
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:10,491
Merlin is the one man who can bring
magic back to this land.

355
00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:13,771
At Arthur's side, he can help
forge a new kingdom.

356
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:18,130
A world of peace and beauty
that we can only dream of.

357
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,451
And you're willing
to give your life, Gaius,

358
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,851
for the future they will bring?

359
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:26,090
I'm waiting.

360
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:31,051
Are you ready to die, Gaius?

361
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:37,290
Gaius?

362
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:43,090
For Merlin, I will give my life.

363
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:56,571
Ic, seo heahsacerd, the acwelle
strengthe ealdan aewfaestnesse!

364
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:57,611
Stop!

365
00:38:57,611 --> 00:39:01,491
Back again so soon, warlock?

366
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,571
What have you done?

367
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:06,371
Your mother is safe.

368
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:07,890
Isn't that what you wanted?

369
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,691
Have you killed him?

370
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:12,370
It was his wish.

371
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,051
I bid my life for Arthur's,
not my mother's, not Gaius'!

372
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:20,370
The Old Religion does not care
who lives or dies.

373
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,171
Only that the balance
of the world is restored.

374
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:27,250
To save a life, a life must be taken.
Gaius knew this.

375
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,610
It is not the Old Religion
that has done this. It is you.

376
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,771
Come, now.

377
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,211
We are too valuable
to each other to be enemies.

378
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:37,050
No! I share nothing with you.

379
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,291
With my help,
Arthur will become King.

380
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:42,571
I will make Arthur King.
But you will never see that day.

381
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:44,250
Astrice!

382
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:49,691
Your childish tricks
are useless against me, Merlin.

383
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,771
I am a priestess of the Old Religion.

384
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:53,930
Forbearne!

385
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,770
You too are a creature
of the Old Religion.

386
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,011
You should join me.

387
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:12,170
You think I would join forces
with such a selfish and cruel magic?

388
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,371
Never.

389
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:16,251
So be it. Akwele!

390
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,731
Pity.

391
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,971
Together, we could
have ruled the world.

392
00:40:48,891 --> 00:40:51,131
You should not have killed
my friend.

393
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,211
Gaius!

394
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:27,050
Gaius!

395
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:36,971
No-o-o! No-o-o!

396
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,211
Merlin... Merlin...

397
00:41:49,211 --> 00:41:50,730
Gaius!

398
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,091
Gaius, you're alive!

399
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,411
What did you do?

400
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,730
Nimueh's dead. The balance
of the world has been restored.

401
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,810
You amaze me.

402
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:14,211
You've mastered the power
of life and death itself.

403
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:19,850
We'll make a great warlock
of you yet!

404
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,331
So you believe in me now?

405
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:28,370
Well, I would do...if...

406
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,930
if you could...

407
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,851
stop this blasted rain!

408
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:55,370
Merlin!

409
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:02,770
No! Aaagh!

410
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,490
