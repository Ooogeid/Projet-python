1
00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:03,625
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,635
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,405
<i>rests of the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:10,020
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,190
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,310
- Yes, Sire?
- Are you deaf?

7
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:25,245
I wish.

8
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:28,310
I want you to go down there
and tell them to stop.

9
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,135
But they're working
under the King's orders.

10
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,310
And you're working under mine.

11
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,950
Hello?

12
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,790
Arthur's Knights

13
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,190
Merlin - 2x01
<i>The Curse of Cornelius Sigan</i>

14
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:31,205
How do you think he died?

15
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,945
Do you know whose tomb is it?

16
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,670
I'm not sure.

17
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:47,190
Do you think it might be cursed?

18
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:02,085
You've just saved my life.

19
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:06,590
- Thank you.
- ... guarded at all times.

20
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:11,415
Idiot.

21
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,255
Were you born clumsy
or do you work at it?

22
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,045
It's just one of my many gifts.

23
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,220
Well, this is quite a find.

24
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:21,315
You see, guys, I was right.

25
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:24,835
There is treasure to be found
under Camelot.

26
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:29,350
Which of my predecessors
do I have to thank for all this?

27
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,430
I'd have to look into it, Sire.

28
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,270
How did he die?

29
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,070
He seems to have unwittingly
triggered a trap here.

30
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,830
To deter grave robbers.

31
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,350
There's plenty in here
people would want to steal.

32
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,870
Have them secure the tomb. Guarding
it is your responsibility, Arthur.

33
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,710
Yes, Father.

34
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:03,550
So this jewel...
What size did you say it was?

35
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,815
- About that size.
- My word, really?

36
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:08,590
About that size. Well, I never.

37
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:10,660
Here you are. Drink up.

38
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,597
And this tomb...

39
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:16,390
I bet they got that locked up
nice and safe, haven't they?

40
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,990
Tighter than the King's coffers.

41
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:20,630
Must be a way in, though?

42
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:23,225
Only with the keys...

43
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:26,590
Right, right. Right.
And who's got the keys?

44
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:32,310
You must think I'm stupid.
I'm not telling you that.

45
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,770
Course not.

46
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,510
A bright lad like you knows what
that sort of information's worth.

47
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:41,430
We don't want everyone to see.

48
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:43,465
Believe me. This place is

49
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,555
full of thieves and fingersmiths.
Put it inside your tunic

50
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:50,495
And careful of that fellow
over there.

51
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,370
Which one?

52
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:55,030
Far end of the bar.
See him?

53
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,155
- He keeps on watching you.
- Yeah, yeah, the one with the beard.

54
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,550
That one.

55
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,590
I got my eye on him.

56
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,285
Thank you.

57
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,825
So who's got the keys?

58
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,350
Only the prince.

59
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:18,835
But don't get your hopes up.

60
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,910
He keeps them
in his private chambers.

61
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:23,979
And there's only one person
allowed in there:

62
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:25,990
his servant.

63
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,350
- Hurry up, Merlin.
- Sorry.

64
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:48,670
- I don't understand.
- Well, there's a surprise.

65
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,550
- I did that girth up myself.
- That might have been a problem.

66
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,665
It wasn't my fault!

67
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:56,190
Would you like me to fit the girth
properly for you, Sire?

68
00:06:58,565 --> 00:06:59,565
Thank you.

69
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:02,310
It's an honour to be of service
to the prince.

70
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:05,550
An honour.
Do you hear that, Merlin?

71
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,750
Allow me the honour
of brushing your clothes down.

72
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,025
The honour.

73
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:17,245
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Sire?

74
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,965
You can give Merlin, here,
a kick up the backside.

75
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,675
I wouldn't wish to deprive you
of the pleasure, Sire.

76
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,030
What's your name?

77
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:28,465
Cedric.

78
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,630
I've come to Camelot
in search of work.

79
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,025
Good.

80
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:34,725
You can be a beater on the hunt.
We're short of a man or two.

81
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:36,625
You're too kind, Sire.

82
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,825
Here, you'll need a beater.
Oh, sorry.

83
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:37,630
Who threw that?

84
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Was it you?

85
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,180
You've just saved my life.

86
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,910
Honestly, Sire, it was nothing.

87
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,870
I shall be forever indebted to you.
You must be rewarded.

88
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,635
No. I couldn't possibly...

89
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,295
Come on.

90
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,285
What do you wish for?

91
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:10,990
- I desire only one thing, Sire.
- Anything.

92
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:14,335
- A position in the royal household.
- Bien.

93
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,720
Consider it done.

94
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,195
You can have that back now.

95
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:23,445
Sorry.

96
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,435
What's wrong?

97
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:48,735
I saved Arthur's life.
Someone else got the credit.

98
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:50,045
Just the usual.

99
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:52,005
What are you doing?

100
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:55,350
I found this inscription
on the sceptre.

101
00:10:57,905 --> 00:10:59,285
What language is that?

102
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,725
I don't know.

103
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,165
Sigan would have known
many languages.

104
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:05,195
- Sigan?
- It's his tomb.

105
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:07,095
Who's he?

106
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,710
He was the most powerful sorcerer
to have lived.

107
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,150
Really?

108
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,630
You didn't grow up in Camelot,
but for those of us that did,

109
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,935
Cornelius Sigan
was a figure of nightmare.

110
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:21,925
Why?

111
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:24,635
Sigan's pass.

112
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,390
He could change day into night.

113
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:30,315
Turn the tides, and legend has it,

114
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:33,975
his spells helped
to build Camelot itself.

115
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,065
What happened?

116
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:38,695
In the end, he grew too powerful

117
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,950
and the King at that time
ordered his execution.

118
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,655
If he's dead,
why are you so worried?

119
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,710
Sigan couldn't bear the thought
that his wealth and power

120
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,355
would die with him,

121
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,075
so he became obsessed

122
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:55,390
with finding a way
to defeat death itself.

123
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:58,415
You think he might have succeeded?

124
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,295
Let's hope not.

125
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,065
For all our sakes.

126
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:12,145
What is it you want?

127
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:15,230
To seal up the burial chamber
and all its contents.

128
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:17,635
Don't be ridiculous.

129
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:19,585
The insignia on this ring,

130
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,750
belongs to Cornelius Sigan.

131
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,190
I believe it to be his tomb.

132
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:29,710
In the old religion
the name Sigan means "raven".

133
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:33,955
- No wonder the riches are so great.
- Then you're aware of the legend, Sire.

134
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,395
I have always enjoyed the tale

135
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:40,415
of the arrogant sorcerer
who came to an untimely end.

136
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:42,135
According to the story,

137
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:43,935
Sigan cursed Camelot.

138
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:46,750
He said he would one day return
and raise the city to the ground.

139
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:51,065
Gaius, you've long been my ally
in the war against sorcery.

140
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,945
You, more than anyone,
should not give into these...

141
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:55,465
irrational fears.

142
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:58,605
Thank you, Sire.

143
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,430
Do not spray panic
amongst my people.

144
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:07,390
This is foolish superstition,
nothing more.

145
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:35,575
My lady!

146
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,415
My lady, what's the matter?
It's all right, it's all right.

147
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,750
I'm here.
There's nothing to be frightened of.

148
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:54,165
- Is that lunch?
- No, it's breakfast.

149
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,835
This is lovely, Cedric.

150
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:03,790
Is there anything else
that you need doing, Sire?

151
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:07,035
No, I think
Cedric's got it all covered.

152
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:13,085
I regret, Sire, there's one thing
I've failed to do.

153
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,326
Muck out your horses.

154
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,455
Off you go.

155
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,875
I'll get the door for you.

156
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:47,235
What was this dream about?

157
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:48,635
A bird.

158
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,385
What kind of bird?

159
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,305
- A raven.
- A raven?

160
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:56,925
It was terrifying.

161
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:00,885
What do you think it means?

162
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:03,110
Probably nothing.

163
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,045
It's happening again, isn't it?

164
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:10,350
One raven certainly doesn't mean
that your nightmares are returning.

165
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:15,865
Are you taking the sleeping draughts
I prepared for you?

166
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,045
I'll get Gwen
to give you something stronger.

167
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:22,270
Like a blow to the head?

168
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:25,870
I'm sure she wants to.

169
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:52,790
Go on and have fun.

170
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:55,910
Go on. Go and have fun.

171
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,175
Sire!

172
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,510
Sire?

173
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:34,335
What are you doing?

174
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:38,550
- Nothing.
- I can see that.

175
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,375
I wasn't sleeping.

176
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,330
I was...

177
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:48,055
I was just bending down.

178
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:50,035
Looking for something?

179
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:53,830
- We may be looking for the same thing.
- What?

180
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,510
I don't know. The horses!

181
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,275
The horses?

182
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,630
One mistake I can understand,
everyone has a bad day,

183
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,830
but this is one thing after another!

184
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,525
I don't know what happened.

185
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:09,895
Sire?

186
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,595
Please, Sire. Don't be too hard on him.
He is a good servant, it's just...

187
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,110
- He's tired.
- I am not.

188
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:17,505
Maybe...

189
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,685
- if he had the evening off...
- I don't want the evening off!

190
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,910
- A good night's rest.
- I did not fall asleep!

191
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,975
I'm more than willing
to take over his duties tonight.

192
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,070
You're right.

193
00:17:27,415 --> 00:17:29,415
- Shut up, Merlin.
- Can't you see what he's doing?

194
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:32,735
He's trying to get rid of me and if you
weren't such a clotpole you'd see that.

195
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,085
A what?

196
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,975
Clotpole. He said clotpole.

197
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,185
Cedric's right.

198
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,225
He can look after me tonight.

199
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:48,355
You can go home.

200
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,985
And think about whether you want
to be my servant or not. But... go!

201
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:18,165
- What's that on your face?
- Nothing.

202
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,075
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

203
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:36,795
Here.

204
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,030
I am not an idiot.

205
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,790
What happened?

206
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,745
I just want Arthur to trust me.

207
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,325
And to see me for who I really am.

208
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:55,110
One day he will.

209
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,630
When?

210
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:00,030
Everything I do is for him
and he just thinks I'm an idiot.

211
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:03,805
Not everyone thinks you're an idiot.

212
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:07,695
Although, looking at you now...

213
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:16,190
Now is not the time
to be questioning these things, Merlin.

214
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,030
I believe that you and Arthur
are destined for greatness,

215
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,340
and that your calling
is to serve and protect him.

216
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:26,875
- It's hard.
- I know it's hard,

217
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,350
but Camelot is in grave peril.

218
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,615
I've translated the inscription.

219
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,550
<i>He who breaks my heart
completes my work.</i>

220
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:38,655
What does it mean?

221
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,155
Do you remembered the stone
in the tomb, how it glowed?

222
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,830
- I've never seen a jewel like it.
- That's because it's not a jewel,

223
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,030
it's the soul of Cornelius Sigan.

224
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:51,825
- You think he's alive?
- His soul is.

225
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:55,335
But in order to truly live,
a soul needs a body.

226
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:57,155
So if the stone

227
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:00,003
is removed from its setting

228
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,990
then the heart is broken
and the soul is released.

229
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,700
That's what I fear.

230
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:18,725
I'll be right outside
in the anteroom should you need me.

231
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:20,835
That'll be all, Cedric.

232
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:36,395
Sleep well, Sire.

233
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:23,495
Hello, ladies.

234
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:49,190
Sound the warning bell.

235
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:57,430
Whoever did this got more
than they bargained for.

236
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,045
I don't understand how they got in.

237
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:04,225
The gate's not even damaged.

238
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:06,990
- They must have used a key.
- Arthur's got the only key.

239
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:08,630
Where does he keep it?

240
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:11,625
- On his belt with the others.
- Does he ever take it off?

241
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:13,790
Only when he's asleep.
He keeps it next to his bed.

242
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:18,550
- Who get into his chambers last night?
- Just me and...

243
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,150
Cedric.

244
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:36,750
Cedric is possessed
by an evil spirit.

245
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:39,195
What?

246
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,635
He tried to steal the jewel.

247
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:44,710
But it wasn't a jewel. It was the soul
of an ancient sorcerer, Sigan

248
00:23:45,995 --> 00:23:47,830
Merlin, have you been on the cider?

249
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,070
Please... Listen to me.

250
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,230
Camelot is in mortal danger.

251
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,385
Sigan is using Cedric's body
to take his revenge.

252
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:58,150
This isn't helping you
keep your job.

253
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,102
You are not listening to me!

254
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,235
If you're going to shout anyway...

255
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:07,590
Will you escort Merlin
from the palace?

256
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:45,710
You've gone too far this time.

257
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,935
You can spend a few days
cooling off in the cells.

258
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:49,105
Guards!

259
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:01,345
He's going to destroy Camelot.

260
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:20,870
I am returned.

261
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:19,765
What this creature is,
where it's come from!

262
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:21,670
There's more than one.
There are several.

263
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,350
There's panic in the lower town.
People are fleeing the city.

264
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,035
You must hunt the creatures down

265
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:27,950
- and kill them.
- Yes, Sire.

266
00:26:59,895 --> 00:27:02,255
- Have you seen what's happening?
- It is as I warned you, Sire.

267
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:04,583
- This cannot be Sigan.
- It is his revenge.

268
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:10,030
You do not understand, Sire. You can't
kill a man who has conquered mortality

269
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,785
Don't tell me what cannot be done.

270
00:27:11,955 --> 00:27:14,445
Camelot will not fall to a sorcerer
while I am king.

271
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:36,950
Hello?

272
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:48,845
Regroup!

273
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,980
Form a phalanx.

274
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,150
We need more bandages, Gwen.

275
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:08,190
- You shouldn't be doing this.
- It's exactly what I should be doing.

276
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:12,030
- You need rest, Morgana.
- I'm likely to get it with all this?

277
00:28:44,185 --> 00:28:45,945
That thing could have killed you.

278
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,140
And it still might.

279
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:51,675
Sorry, Sire.

280
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:53,945
No, my pleasure.

281
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:10,495
I'll get you something
to stop the bleeding.

282
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:16,595
I wanted to say...

283
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:21,475
Just...

284
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:25,630
You always surprise me.

285
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:31,365
- Is that it, Sire?
- That's it.

286
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,610
And...

287
00:29:37,165 --> 00:29:38,215
Thank you.

288
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,390
It's nothing.

289
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:06,910
- Have we driven the creatures out?
- They have control of the lower town.

290
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:09,605
The market has been
all but destroyed.

291
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:10,924
How many dead?

292
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:12,390
Too many to number.

293
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:14,505
I'm sealing the citadel.

294
00:30:14,675 --> 00:30:16,430
- You can't.
- I have no choice.

295
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:19,710
I have to protect
those who have a chance.

296
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:21,755
If I don't, we will all fall.

297
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:25,265
- Where are you going?
- There are people

298
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:28,175
trapped on the drawbridge.
I'm not leaving them to die.

299
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,710
It's suicide.

300
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:32,990
It's my duty to Camelot
and to myself.

301
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:52,390
- What are you doing here?
- I have to help Arthur.

302
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:56,510
- Sigan's power is way beyond yours.
- I don't have a choice.

303
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,985
But Sigan is immortal and you are not.
If you face him, he'll destroy you.

304
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:01,230
There must be a way.

305
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:06,750
There is only one alive who is old
enough to give us the answers we need.

306
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:08,985
What do you mean?

307
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,590
The Great Dragon.

308
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:19,265
You knew, then.

309
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:23,030
- that I used to visit him?
- Yes, Merlin, of course I knew.

310
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,670
You're a creature of magic,
just as he is.

311
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:29,405
- I hope that he could help you.
- He helps no-one but himself.

312
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:32,190
- For Arthur's sake, you must go to him.
- I can't.

313
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,850
We have no choice.

314
00:31:50,905 --> 00:31:52,190
Check for survivors.

315
00:31:57,075 --> 00:31:58,075
On me!

316
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:02,190
Charge!

317
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:14,345
Hello?

318
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:20,055
Hello?

319
00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:27,055
Please, I need your help.

320
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,365
You told me
I would not see you again.

321
00:32:38,115 --> 00:32:40,110
I'm not here for myself,
I'm here for Arthur.

322
00:32:40,535 --> 00:32:42,350
Arthur's path lies with yours.

323
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,630
You have made it clear that
you do not walk in step with me.

324
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:48,585
You cannot want Cornelius Sigan
to win, you're not evil.

325
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:51,070
At least Sigan knows
where is loyalties lie.

326
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:53,550
You have shown that you do not.

327
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,590
So you will let Camelot fall?

328
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,670
I did not say that.

329
00:32:58,535 --> 00:32:59,750
Then you will help me?

330
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:02,645
To defeat Sigan,

331
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:06,965
you will need a spell more powerful
than anything you know.

332
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,710
Please. I have to try.

333
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:11,435
Very well.

334
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:14,190
But you must give me
something in return.

335
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:17,165
- What?
- A promise.

336
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,855
- A promise?
- That one day

337
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:22,830
you will free me.

338
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:31,790
If I release you, what will you do?

339
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:35,335
- That is not your concern.
- I don't trust you.

340
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,915
Nevertheless, you must promise,

341
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:40,005
or Camelot will fall.

342
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:45,925
I promise.

343
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:51,005
Now, please, give me the spell.

344
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:55,145
Close your eyes

345
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:57,465
and open your mind.

346
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,885
Few men have ever been gifted
such knowledge.

347
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:19,895
Use it wisely.

348
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:23,225
I will.

349
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:28,505
You made a promise, young warlock.

350
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,810
And one day...

351
00:34:31,665 --> 00:34:33,390
I shall keep you to it.

352
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:52,555
Retreat!

353
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,390
Regroup in the square!

354
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,165
Save yourselves! It's an order.

355
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:19,790
Retreat, retreat!

356
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:25,965
Seal the doors!

357
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:31,845
What's that?

358
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:34,335
Where is he?

359
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:36,535
You can't leave him out there.
He'll be torn apart.

360
00:35:36,705 --> 00:35:38,145
You can't go out there, Sire!

361
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:40,230
If you open that door, you will die,

362
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:41,835
we will all die.

363
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,030
Who would have believed it?

364
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,985
You, a sorcerer.

365
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,825
And a powerful one.

366
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:26,310
I won't let you hurt him.

367
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,310
And you're going to stop me?

368
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:33,815
I'll stop you.

369
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:38,005
He does not deserve your loyalty.

370
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:39,790
He treats you like a slave.

371
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:41,630
That's not true.

372
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:44,630
He cast you aside
without a moment's thought...

373
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:49,205
- It doesn't matter.
- But it must hurt so much.

374
00:36:49,715 --> 00:36:52,630
To be so put upon, so overlooked,

375
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,390
when all the while
you have such power.

376
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,475
- That's the way it has to be.
- Does it?

377
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,645
You are young Merlin.
Look inside yourself,

378
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:05,430
you have yet
to discover your true power.

379
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:07,615
I can help you.

380
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:12,230
Think, Merlin,

381
00:37:12,785 --> 00:37:15,255
to have the world
appreciate your greatness,

382
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:18,205
To have Arthur know you
for what you are.

383
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,310
- That can never be.
- It can.

384
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,935
If you join me.

385
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:31,265
Together we can rule over this land.

386
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:33,715
Arthur will tremble at your voice.

387
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,550
He will kneel at your feet.

388
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:45,535
I don't want that.

389
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,630
You'd rather be a servant?

390
00:37:49,555 --> 00:37:52,030
Better to save a good man
than to rule with an evil one.

391
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:55,325
So be it.

392
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:58,045
If you will not join me,

393
00:37:58,215 --> 00:37:59,630
I will become you

394
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,765
and your power
will be harnessed to my will.

395
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:57,950
Well done, my boy.

396
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:24,165
We must learn our lessons
from these terrible events, Gaius.

397
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,625
Indeed, Sire.

398
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:27,630
They prove beyond that
that I was right.

399
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:31,215
Magic is evil,

400
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:33,865
it is our greatest threat.

401
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:39,190
I have grown complacent, Gaius.

402
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:43,150
I wouldn't say that, Sire.

403
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:45,585
We must renew our efforts.

404
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:49,835
We must ensure that all sorcerers
and their followers

405
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:52,155
are eradicated from this kingdom.

406
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:56,005
Of course, Sire.

407
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:05,075
You know you won't get
any thanks, Merlin.

408
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:06,725
I'm not a complete idiot.

409
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:11,055
There you go. It's not much,
but you deserve something.

410
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:16,395
I've come to see Merlin.

411
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:21,005
I've not forgotten about your lazy,

412
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:25,110
insolent ways, or the fact
that you called me a "clotpole",

413
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:27,785
but I do have to admit

414
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:31,155
that there was some truth
in your accusations against Cedric.

415
00:41:32,535 --> 00:41:36,230
Does this mean you're admitting that
on this occasion I was actually right?

416
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:40,745
Not exactly, no.

417
00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:44,605
It means that I have a knighthood
to bestow first thing tomorrow

418
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:47,575
and no-one to clean my armour.

419
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:54,465
All that?

420
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:05,985
Clotpole?

421
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,390
- And what would you know about magic?
- Nothing.

422
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:22,510
Today you will fight for glory
and for honour.

423
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,995
That has got to hurt.

424
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,105
Nothing can ever happen between us!

425
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,295
When you're king,
you can change that.

426
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,310
You do realize your wife

427
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,590
- is a troll, Sire.
- What?

428
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:37,150
How could you resist such beauty?

429
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,545
Send for the witchfinder

430
00:42:40,235 --> 00:42:42,790
Your magic is a secret
to be guarded with your life.

431
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,910
I won't sacrifice
a friend to save myself.

432
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,030
Gaius is already doomed.

433
00:42:50,315 --> 00:42:51,470
My name is Lancelot.

434
00:42:57,915 --> 00:43:00,270
Do not believe that
you can lie to me.

435
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,880
We're going to kill each other.

436
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:16,415
The boy: Merlin.
