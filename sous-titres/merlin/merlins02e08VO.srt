1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,905
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:04,899
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,645
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:09,138
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,510
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,461
Arthur Pendragon,
a great destiny awaits you.

7
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:28,270
The battle for your soul
is about to begin.

8
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:33,670
Arise, Sir Vidor,

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,310
Arise, Sir Vidor, Knight of Camelot.

10
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:39,557
Arise, Sir Caridoc,

11
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,100
Knight of Camelot.

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,522
You have been accorded
a great honour.

13
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:49,870
With that honour
comes great responsibility.

14
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:52,552
From this day forth,

15
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:55,544
you are sworn to live
by the Knight's Code.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,630
You have pledged
to conduct yourselves

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,510
with nobility, honour

18
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:04,829
and respect.

19
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:07,350
Your word is your sacred bond.

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,989
You will find no-one

21
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,270
who better embodies these values
than my son.

22
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,711
Follow his example,

23
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,870
and you'll prove yourself
worthy of your title.

24
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:07,590
I accept your challenge.

25
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,587
If I am to face you in combat,

26
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:12,070
do me the courtesy
of revealing your identity.

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,083
My name is Morgause.

28
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,278
Arthur's Knights

29
00:02:54,775 --> 00:03:00,950
Merlin - 2x08
<i>The Sins Of The Father</i>

30
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:04,455
I've searched the records
going back more than 300 years.

31
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,750
I could find nothing to say
a woman cannot issue a challenge.

32
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,924
There must be some way
to stop to this.

33
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:13,110
According to the Knight's Rules,
her challenge is perfectly valid.

34
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:17,080
- There is nothing we can do.
- We don't know anything about her.

35
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,030
- I will not let you face her.
- I accepted the challenge.

36
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,470
If I refuse to fight,
it will be seen as cowardice.

37
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,110
She killed five guards.

38
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:26,070
You should not underestimate her.

39
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:28,519
I cannot demand
that my knights uphold the code

40
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:29,790
then break it myself.

41
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,809
I must face her tomorrow.

42
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:37,900
Who is she?

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,216
Why would she challenge Arthur?

44
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,550
It seems no-one's ever heard of her.

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,765
I feel as if I've met her
somewhere before.

46
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,990
Really?
Where could you know her from?

47
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,788
I don't know.

48
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:03,270
Why she challenged you?

49
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:06,922
I'm the King's son.

50
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:09,190
Perhaps she believed
she will prove herself.

51
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,030
You don't want to fight her, do you?

52
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,030
I have no choice.

53
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:16,022
If I refuse to fight her,
I'm a coward.

54
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,098
If I kill her, what am I then?

55
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:22,422
What is it?

56
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:24,937
You've never faced a woman
in combat.

57
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:27,528
What if you hesitate?
She could use that to her advantage.

58
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:28,750
She'll defeat me?

59
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:32,073
I'm just saying
you need to be cautious,

60
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,278
because it sounds
she's pretty handy with a sword.

61
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,710
Since when do you know
anything about combat?

62
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,219
I need you to take a message
to Morgause for me.

63
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:47,777
If I'm seen to do it,
it could be viewed as cowardice.

64
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,592
You must persuade her

65
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:53,005
to withdraw the challenge.

66
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:05,852
- What do you want?
- I have a message from Prince Arthur.

67
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:07,430
To withdraw your challenge.

68
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,590
Arthur has no desire to fight you.
If you withdraw,

69
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,430
he'll grant you safe passage
from the kingdom.

70
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:17,870
Leave now, while you still can.

71
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,950
If Arthur has no desire to fight me,
perhaps he should withdraw.

72
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,990
No. He'll never do that.
It's not in him to withdraw.

73
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,510
- Then we have that in common.
- If you fight him,

74
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:36,670
he will have to treat you
as he does any other opponent.

75
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:39,257
It won't matter that you're a woman.

76
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,350
I do not ask for special treatment.

77
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,190
Arthur has no quarrel with you.

78
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:45,910
Why would you challenge him?

79
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,896
My reasons are not your concern.

80
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,910
Don't put Arthur in a position
where he's forced to kill you.

81
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:54,339
Who's to say Arthur's life
won't rest in my hands?

82
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:10,360
You gave her a chance to withdraw.

83
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:14,345
Whatever happens,
you are not to blame.

84
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:29,790
The fight is by the Knight's Rules,

85
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,150
and to the death.

86
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,993
I'm offering you a final chance
to withdraw.

87
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:40,683
I suggest you take it.

88
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,641
Then you leave me no choice.

89
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:11,950
Make me a promise,
and I will spare your life.

90
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,590
- What is it you ask?
- Come to me three days hence,

91
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,230
and accept the challenge I set you.

92
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:19,030
And the nature of it?

93
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,830
That is for me to decide.

94
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:25,880
Do I have your word that you
will accept, no matter what?

95
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:28,910
You have my word.

96
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:55,319
You were fortunate.
The wound isn't too deep.

97
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,870
You seem familiar.
Have you visited Camelot in the past?

98
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:01,270
I was here many years ago.

99
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,390
I was just a baby at the time.
I doubt you would remember me.

100
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:10,949
I am grateful for your help.

101
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:20,876
- It could have been worse.
- How exactly could it have been worse?

102
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:22,661
You could be dead.

103
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,439
I wouldn't have to face everyone.

104
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:28,430
I have never felt so humiliated
in my entire life.

105
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:30,670
I was defeated by...

106
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:32,069
a girl.

107
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,750
It's actually quite funny
when you think about it.

108
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,350
Or not.

109
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:42,430
It's like you said. I was hindered
because I was fighting a woman.

110
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:45,880
I was worried I was going to hurt her.
That's why she won.

111
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:49,230
You didn't look hindered.

112
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:52,190
I'll stop talking now.

113
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,390
I didn't mean to intrude.

114
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:14,613
I wanted to introduce myself.
I'm the Lady Morgana.

115
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:15,899
I know who you are.

116
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:23,063
How is your arm? You were wounded.

117
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,662
It will heal soon enough.

118
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:28,795
You look tired.

119
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,511
I haven't been sleeping.

120
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,830
I know for myself
how troubling that can be.

121
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,790
Could it be that we have met
somewhere before?

122
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:40,819
I am glad we have met now.

123
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:48,310
- That's a beautiful bracelet.
- It was a gift...

124
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,990
from my mother.

125
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,028
Please. I would like you to have it.

126
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,635
It's a healing bracelet.
It will help you sleep.

127
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:57,807
I couldn't.

128
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,030
You must be tired.
I will leave you to rest.

129
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:03,030
I hope you'll remember me fondly.

130
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:00,870
Congratulations on your victory.

131
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:04,750
You are a skilful swordsman... woman.
Swords...

132
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:06,750
Swords-woman.

133
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,910
You have a beautiful horse.

134
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:21,390
- I expect to see you three days hence.
- How will I find you?

135
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,729
When the time comes,
you will know your way.

136
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,702
If I don't show up, it might be
because I don't know where I'm going.

137
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:32,110
The path you must follow
will become clear to you.

138
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,717
I should thank you for allowing me
to retrieve my sword.

139
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,350
I'm starting to wish I hadn't.

140
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,670
You showed yourself
to be a man of honour.

141
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,030
You inherited that trait
from your mother.

142
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:47,418
You knew my mother?

143
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,999
I knew her very well.

144
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:52,346
Wait!

145
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,030
I was fast asleep.

146
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,030
It's nearly midday.

147
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:14,950
I can't remember
the last time I slept so well.

148
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:16,919
I'll fetch you some clothes.

149
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:36,540
What is to be the nature
of this challenge?

150
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,710
She didn't say.

151
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,224
I gave her my word
I would accept it, no matter what.

152
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,020
You should never have made this promise.
You don't know what she might ask.

153
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,190
She had her sword to my chest.

154
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:48,065
I had no choice.

155
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,470
Morgause said
that she knew my mother.

156
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,910
She told you this?

157
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,524
Obviously, she's lying.

158
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:04,230
She's playing on your affections
for your mother to lure you into a trap.

159
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,510
That makes no sense.
She spared my life.

160
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:10,070
This confirms my suspicions.
I believe Morgause is an enchantress.

161
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,230
- How else could she defeated you?
- I don't believe she was using magic.

162
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,390
You would know for certain
if she were?

163
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,145
Under no circumstances
will you go to meet her

164
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,670
or accept this challenge.

165
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,230
- I gave her my word.
- I don't care what was said to her.

166
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,270
You will remain in Camelot.

167
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,562
I want to hear
what she knows about my mother.

168
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:29,790
She knows nothing! She is lying.

169
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,630
You will not go to her. I forbid it.

170
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,310
So I am to break my word?

171
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,221
Escort my son to his chambers.

172
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:38,834
Under no circumstances
will he be allowed to leave.

173
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:40,950
You're confining me?

174
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,932
I am protecting you
from your own foolishness!

175
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:55,870
Why are there guards here?

176
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:59,550
My father has confined me
to my chambers

177
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:03,258
and has forbidden me
from accepting Morgause's challenge.

178
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:04,990
Well, maybe he's got a point.

179
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,690
You don't know
what she might have asked you to do.

180
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,735
I gave her my word.

181
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,550
I take it we're going anyway?

182
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:16,990
You're smarter than you look.
Gather some supplies, we leave tonight.

183
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,790
Find a way to get me out of here.

184
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:23,031
How's Arthur?

185
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:26,189
You mean, after being defeated by a girl
in front of the whole of Camelot?

186
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,590
I've seen him happier.

187
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,150
You're enjoying this.

188
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,422
Maybe a little.

189
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,572
I got the supplies.

190
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,630
Is it my imagination,
or are you getting fat?

191
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,390
Are you sure
you're strong enough to hold me?

192
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,910
I'm stronger than I look.

193
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:12,709
What are you doing?

194
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:15,640
Lower the rope.

195
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,469
There is no more rope!

196
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,630
I don't know
if I can hold it much longer!

197
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,110
Do not let go of the rope.

198
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:55,270
Which way?

199
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:00,030
Do you actually know
where we're going?

200
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,190
This way.

201
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:04,935
Come on.

202
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,305
What is wrong with this horse?
It's even dumber than you, Merlin.

203
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,740
Where are you going?
You said it was left.

204
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,470
It's not me, it's the horse!

205
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,830
Morgause told me.

206
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:23,070
"When the time comes,
you'll know your way."

207
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:26,495
So the horse knows where we're going?
Great!

208
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,821
Come on, Merlin.

209
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,073
You have been guarding
an empty room!

210
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:56,390
Send out a search party.
Find Arthur, bring him back to Camelot.

211
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:04,149
Do you have any idea
what Morgause might want with Arthur?

212
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,276
I'm afraid I don't.

213
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:11,596
What if Morgause challenges you
to do something you don't want to do?

214
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,430
I'm not expecting it to be easy.
That's why it's a challenge.

215
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,615
So you'd do anything
she asks of you?

216
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,230
I gave my word.

217
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:19,896
It's a question of honour.

218
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:23,550
What if the challenge is to do something
less honourable than breaking your word?

219
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,910
Will you stop rabbiting on!

220
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:30,590
We're in Odin's territory.
We could be attacked at any second.

221
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,590
It's strange to agree to something
when you don't know what it is.

222
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,070
One more word out of you,
you'll take the challenge in my place.

223
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,030
Don't worry.

224
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,510
I'll deal with this. You lie there,
make yourself comfortable.

225
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,286
Maybe we should turn back.
The woods could be full of Odin's men.

226
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:36,385
You can go back if you want to.
I won't stop you.

227
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:38,350
You don't know anything
about Morgause.

228
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,125
You don't know
what she's going to ask you to do.

229
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,836
We don't even know where we're going.
We're following a horse!

230
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,918
Morgause said she knew my mother.

231
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,535
Come in.

232
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,883
I've brought you
your sleeping draft.

233
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:01,266
I could have saved you the trouble.

234
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,221
I've had the best night's sleep
I can remember.

235
00:21:05,716 --> 00:21:08,230
- No nightmares?
- I cannot tell you what a relief it is.

236
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,096
I only wish I could thank Morgause
for her gift.

237
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,590
Morgause gave you that bracelet?

238
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:17,051
She said it would help me sleep.
She spoke the truth.

239
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,550
What is it?

240
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,075
Nothing.

241
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:25,161
I am merely surprised
that it was so effective.

242
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:27,710
I feel
as if I somehow know Morgause.

243
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:30,048
I don't see how,

244
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:32,508
but I am pleased
you're feeling better.

245
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,653
What was your mother like?

246
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,406
I never knew her.

247
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:50,492
- She died before I opened my eyes.
- I'm sorry.

248
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:53,710
I barely know anything about her.

249
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,790
Can't you ask your father?

250
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,833
He refuses to talk of her.
It must be too painful for him.

251
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,150
Sometimes it's as if
she never even existed.

252
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,285
I still have...

253
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:10,095
a sense of her,

254
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,950
almost as though she is part of me.

255
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:18,070
That's the same with my father.
I never knew him.

256
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,910
And my mother
has barely spoken of him.

257
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:26,617
I've got this vague memory...

258
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,750
It's my imagination.

259
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:35,966
I would do anything
for even the vaguest memory.

260
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:40,348
Why you're so determined
to find Morgause?

261
00:22:40,824 --> 00:22:42,430
See what she knows
about your mother.

262
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,550
- Is that so wrong?
- No.

263
00:22:50,056 --> 00:22:51,436
We should get some rest.

264
00:22:58,248 --> 00:22:59,728
I must speak with you.

265
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,188
It concerns Morgause.

266
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,082
What?

267
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,466
While I was treating her wound,
I noticed...

268
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:08,738
that she wore a bracelet.

269
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,628
Go on.

270
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,230
It bore the mark
of the great house of Gorlois.

271
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,827
There is only one person

272
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,310
other than Morgana
who'd have cause to wear this bracelet.

273
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,289
That is, her half-sister.

274
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,294
I was led to believe
that the child had died.

275
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:34,990
The child lived, my Lord.

276
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,630
She was smuggled out of Camelot
shortly after her birth.

277
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,150
How do you know this?

278
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:45,950
It was I who entrusted the child

279
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,510
to the high priestesses
of the Old Religion.

280
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,891
You should have told me, Gaius.

281
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:56,070
I had sworn a solemn oath, my Lord.

282
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:58,350
I am only breaking it now

283
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,230
because I fear
what Morgause might do.

284
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:03,510
Does Morgana know?

285
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,052
I don't believe.

286
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,910
Morgana must never find out
she has a half-sister.

287
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,310
I will not have
her loyalties divided.

288
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:15,271
Of course.

289
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:20,190
The high priestesses
will have trained Morgause from birth.

290
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,281
Her magic will be powerful.

291
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:26,790
Then we must hope that the search party
finds Arthur before he reaches her.

292
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:35,270
Seems your horse has brought us
to a dead end.

293
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:39,230
Now where's he going?

294
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:41,487
You're going to get wet.

295
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,241
You don't say!

296
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,550
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

297
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,992
If we weren't sure Morgause
was a sorcerer before,

298
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:33,470
we can be certain of it now.

299
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:38,030
That must have been how she defeated me.
She was using magic.

300
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,385
It didn't look like she was.

301
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:46,172
And what would you know
about magic, Merlin?

302
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:48,971
Nothing.

303
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,030
Now what?

304
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,550
We should ask the horse.

305
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:22,700
There's no-one here.

306
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,663
You kept your promise.

307
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,430
What is the nature of the challenge
you wish to set me?

308
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,346
Place your head on the block.

309
00:26:44,193 --> 00:26:46,470
You gave me your word
you would do anything I asked.

310
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,030
Arthur, don't.

311
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:56,375
What are you doing?

312
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,470
- I won't let you do this!
- Stay out of this, Merlin.

313
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,871
You have shown
that you truly are a man of your word.

314
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:34,710
For that, I'll grant you one wish.

315
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,910
Tell me what it is
that your heart most desires.

316
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,513
You said you knew my mother.

317
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,390
- Tell me all that you know about her.
- Perhaps you would like to see her.

318
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,310
I want that more than anything.

319
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,270
As you wish.

320
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,419
The search party
were unable to pick up a trail.

321
00:28:03,597 --> 00:28:05,739
There is no sign
of Prince Arthur anywhere.

322
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,215
Re-double your efforts.
Send riders to the outlying villages.

323
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:10,790
I want my son found!

324
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,176
Yes, my Lord.

325
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:18,502
It chills me to think
what Morgause has planned for Arthur.

326
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:20,870
Had she chosen to,
she already could have killed him.

327
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:24,200
I believe
she has some other purpose in mind.

328
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,333
Morgause told Arthur
that she knew his mother.

329
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:31,937
- She knew Ygraine?
- I don't know.

330
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:34,898
Perhaps it is a lie.

331
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:38,148
She knew it would tempt Arthur
to go to her.

332
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,590
Morgause knows the true circumstances
of Arthur's birth?

333
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:46,115
I fear that more than anything.

334
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,950
Sure you want to do this?

335
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,630
If you were granted the opportunity,
would you not want to meet your father?

336
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,990
Uther won't forgive you if he finds out
you've collaborated with a sorcerer.

337
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,750
What if my father's attitude
to magic is wrong?

338
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:11,310
You really think that?

339
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,790
It's not as simple as
he would have us believe.

340
00:29:14,365 --> 00:29:16,670
Morgause is a sorcerer,
she has caused us no harm.

341
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,086
Surely not everyone
who practises magic can be evil?

342
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:24,790
We don't actually know
why she's doing this.

343
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:28,068
It is time.

344
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:40,424
Close your eyes.

345
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:22,070
Mother?

346
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,330
My son.

347
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:30,098
When I last held you,
you were a tiny baby.

348
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,292
I remember your eyes.

349
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:35,270
You were staring up at me.

350
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:38,350
Those few seconds I held you
were the most precious of my life.

351
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:42,030
I'm so sorry.

352
00:30:42,494 --> 00:30:43,950
You have nothing to be sorry for.

353
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:47,430
- My birth caused you to die.
- No. You are not to blame.

354
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,467
I can't bear you died because of me.

355
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:51,046
Do not think that.

356
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,833
It is your father who should carry
the guilt for what happened.

357
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:56,702
What do you mean?

358
00:30:57,271 --> 00:30:59,910
It is not important.
What matters is that you lived.

359
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,110
Why should my father feel guilty?

360
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:04,070
It is better left in the past.

361
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:06,514
You cannot leave me
with more questions.

362
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,610
Please.

363
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:13,691
Your father...

364
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,030
He was desperate for an heir.

365
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,447
Without a son, the Pendragon
dynasty would come to an end.

366
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,150
But I could not conceive.

367
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,550
Then how was I born?

368
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,990
Tell me.

369
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,381
Your father betrayed me.

370
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:39,497
He went to the sorceress Nimueh

371
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,218
and asked for her help
in conceiving a child.

372
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:45,990
You were born of magic.

373
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:50,964
That's not true!

374
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:52,643
I'm sorry, Arthur.

375
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:55,910
Your father has deceived you,
as he deceived me.

376
00:31:56,696 --> 00:32:00,004
To create a life, a life must be taken.
Your father knew that.

377
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:05,830
He sacrificed my life
so the Pendragon dynasty could continue.

378
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:10,710
It makes you no less my son,
nor me any less proud of you.

379
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,678
Now I see you,
I would have given my life willingly.

380
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,430
Do not let
this knowledge change you.

381
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,950
- Bring her back!
- I cannot.

382
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,920
Once the doorway is closed,
it is closed forever.

383
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:44,996
I am truly sorry that you learnt
of your mother's fate in this way.

384
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,310
I can only imagine

385
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,630
how it must feel to discover
he is responsible for her death.

386
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,453
It is an unforgivable betrayal.

387
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,870
Are you all right?

388
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:11,470
Fetch the horses.
We're returning to Camelot.

389
00:33:32,574 --> 00:33:33,710
What are you gonna do?

390
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,630
I'm relieved to see you are safe.
Where's Arthur?

391
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:50,990
Arthur was born of magic.

392
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,670
Wasn't he?

393
00:33:56,965 --> 00:33:58,230
Uther used magic.

394
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,183
All those people he's executed.

395
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:03,692
He's as guilty as they are.

396
00:34:03,862 --> 00:34:05,722
He sacrificed Arthur's mother.

397
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:07,394
He as good as murdered her.

398
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:14,429
People should know the truth
about what he has done.

399
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,677
How could you not tell me?

400
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,069
I feared what Arthur would do
if he ever found out.

401
00:34:24,503 --> 00:34:25,630
He's found out now.

402
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:38,350
Where have you been?
I had search parties out for you.

403
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,419
I know...

404
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,190
what you did to my mother.

405
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:50,470
Leave us.

406
00:34:51,864 --> 00:34:52,910
No-one is to enter.

407
00:34:57,165 --> 00:34:57,968
What?

408
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:02,231
You were so desperate for an heir,
you were prepared to use magic.

409
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,517
Morgause tell you this?
She's lying.

410
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:05,870
My mother is dead

411
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,950
because of your selfishness
and arrogance.

412
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:12,434
- Her blood is on your hands.
- No. That's not true.

413
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:15,270
- Morgause would have you believe that.
- This is what fuels

414
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,233
your hatred
for those who practise magic.

415
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:21,396
Rather than blame yourself
for what you did, you blame them.

416
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,630
You would believe a sorcerer
over the word of your father?

417
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,738
I can only think
Morgause has enchanted you.

418
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,830
You have hunted her kind
like animals!

419
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,030
How many hundreds have you condemned
to death to ease your guilt?

420
00:35:33,535 --> 00:35:37,293
Those who practise magic
will stop at nothing to destroy us.

421
00:35:37,463 --> 00:35:40,324
I have only done what is necessary
to protect this kingdom.

422
00:35:40,494 --> 00:35:42,770
You speak of honour and nobility.

423
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,151
You are nothin
but a hypocrite and a liar!

424
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,664
I am your king and your father,

425
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:50,110
you will show me some respect!

426
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,683
Have you lost your mind?

427
00:36:07,752 --> 00:36:08,766
Pick it up.

428
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,015
I implore you.
Think about what you are doing.

429
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,470
Pick it up!

430
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,188
I will not fight you.

431
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,670
If you choose
not to defend yourself,

432
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,825
I will strike you down
where you stand.

433
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,339
You are my son.

434
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:34,262
You will not strike an unarmed man.

435
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,199
I no longer think of myself

436
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:38,099
as your son.

437
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:41,304
Then strike me down.

438
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:55,257
I do not want to fight you.

439
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,030
Stop this!

440
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:47,273
- The King has forbidden to enter.
- They're going to kill each other!

441
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,790
Arthur! Don't!

442
00:37:58,063 --> 00:38:01,270
- I know you don't want to do this.
- My mother is dead because of him!

443
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,406
Killing your father
won't bring her back.

444
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,013
You've lost one parent,
do you really want to lose another?

445
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,550
- Listen to him, Arthur.
- Arthur. Please.

446
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:13,336
Put the sword down.

447
00:38:13,506 --> 00:38:15,230
You heard what my mother said.

448
00:38:16,175 --> 00:38:19,790
After everything that he has done,
do you believe he deserves to live?

449
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:24,023
He executes those who use magic,
and yet he has used it himself.

450
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,630
You have caused
so much suffering and pain.

451
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,538
I will put an end to that.

452
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,430
Morgause is lying.

453
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:37,990
She's an enchantress.

454
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,860
She tricked you.

455
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,990
That wasn't your mother.
It was an illusion.

456
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:46,762
Everything,

457
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,171
everything your mother said to you,

458
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:53,981
- those were Morgause's words.
- You don't know that!

459
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:56,117
This has been her plan all along,

460
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:58,295
to turn you against your father.

461
00:38:58,465 --> 00:38:59,870
And if you kill him,

462
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:03,575
the kingdom will be destroyed.
This is what she wants.

463
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,870
Listen to him. He speaks the truth.

464
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,070
Swear to me that it isn't true,

465
00:39:12,234 --> 00:39:15,276
you are not responsible for her death.
Give me your word!

466
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,959
I swear on my life.
I loved your mother.

467
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:22,028
There isn't a day that passes
that I don't wish she were alive.

468
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,117
I could never have done anything
to hurt her.

469
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,870
My son.

470
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:46,960
You mean more to me than anything.

471
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,264
I'm sorry.

472
00:39:51,274 --> 00:39:52,737
You are not to blame.

473
00:40:13,992 --> 00:40:15,310
I am indebted to you.

474
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:19,253
I had become... confused.

475
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:23,270
It's once again clear to me
that those who practise magic

476
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,545
are evil and dangerous.

477
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,917
And that is thanks to you.

478
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,723
Glad I could help.

479
00:40:43,715 --> 00:40:44,590
My Lord.

480
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,910
I wanted to thank you

481
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,181
in person for your actions
yesterday.

482
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,027
You are a loyal servant to Arthur.
I am most grateful.

483
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,573
Just doing my duty.

484
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:58,030
You have proven yourself
to be a trusted ally

485
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,798
in the fight against magic.

486
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,270
Me?

487
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,030
Those who practise magic

488
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:09,244
will seek
to exploit Arthur's inexperience.

489
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,710
They will attempt to corrupt him.

490
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,390
- You must be extra vigilant.
- I'll keep my eyes peeled.

491
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:18,150
I know you will.

492
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:22,870
If you ever speak
of what happened between myself

493
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,310
and Arthur to another living soul,
I will have you hanged.

494
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,811
Right. Of course.

495
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:31,406
Yes, my Lord.

496
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:41,270
Is that Uther I saw leaving?

497
00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:44,580
He popped in to say hello.

498
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:46,752
What did he want?

499
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,681
He thanked me for being a trusted ally
in the fight against magic.

500
00:41:56,005 --> 00:41:58,350
How you've managed
to keep that head on your shoulders

501
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,306
is a mystery
beyond our greatest minds.

502
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,695
Uther should be grateful.

503
00:42:04,218 --> 00:42:07,190
Your life would have been easier, safer
if you had let him die.

504
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:12,590
You must have been tempted.

505
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:15,255
Maybe for a moment,

506
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:18,646
Arthur wouldn't forgive himself
if he'd gone through with it.

507
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:20,859
It would've destroyed him.

508
00:42:22,842 --> 00:42:23,910
I'm proud of you.

509
00:42:28,996 --> 00:42:31,685
Arthur's thanking me,
Uther's grateful, you're proud...

510
00:42:31,855 --> 00:42:33,367
I have never been this popular!

511
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:35,710
I'm certain it won't last.

512
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,110
Just let me enjoy

513
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:41,542
the moment.

514
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,630
She's fallen prey
to a bounty hunter.

515
00:43:08,937 --> 00:43:10,590
Do you know how much money
she's worth?

516
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:12,790
- Why did you do that?
- What?

517
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,850
Help me.

518
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,150
I've never known anyone like you.

519
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,310
The girl is dangerous.
An informer told me she was cursed.

520
00:43:22,753 --> 00:43:23,630
Freya!
