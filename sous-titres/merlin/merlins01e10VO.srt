1
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:07,991
'the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

2
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:09,711
'His name...

3
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:11,071
'Merlin.'

4
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,471
VILLAGERS SCREAM, MEN SHOUT

5
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,391
Search the place!

6
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:50,471
Find him!

7
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:01,191
MAN: Found him.

8
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,711
It's harvest time!

9
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:08,791
What's this?
Where's the rest of it?!

10
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,031
I only kept back what
we need to survive.

11
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,471
Survive?

12
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:18,031
I'll be back in one week, farmer,
and I want to see all of it.

13
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,231
You can't take our food!

14
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:23,231
Our children will starve -
I won't let you do this!

15
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:24,791
You're not taking any of it!

16
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:27,191
Hunith!

17
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,151
I will give you a week.

18
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:39,271
Don't you dare disappoint me.

19
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,951
I'll see you later, sweetheart.

20
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,191
Yah!

21
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:12,871
Mother?

22
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:15,951
Merlin!

23
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,871
What happened?

24
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:22,671
Who did this to you?

25
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,471
The winters are harsh in Ealdor,

26
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,791
and there are many children.

27
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,071
Some of them just
won't be strong enough to survive.

28
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:05,591
We barely have enough food
as it is,

29
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,831
and if Kanen takes our harvest,

30
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:10,991
our children won't live
to see another summer.

31
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,631
Please, we need your help.

32
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:17,791
Ealdor's in Cendred's kingdom.

33
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,471
Your safety is his responsibility.

34
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:21,151
We've appealed to our king, but...

35
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:24,031
he cares little
for the outlying regions.

36
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,351
You're our only hope.

37
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:33,991
I have the deepest sympathy for you

38
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:37,511
and would have this barbarian
wiped off the face of the earth.

39
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:40,671
You'll help us? I wish I could.

40
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,791
Surely we can spare a few men?

41
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,751
Resources are not the problem.
Then what is?

42
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:49,431
Ealdor lies beyond
the ridge of Aesctir.

43
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:52,391
For an army of Camelot to enter it
would be an act of war.

44
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,351
I know you're a good king,

45
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,031
a caring man.

46
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:01,911
I'm begging you - help us, please.

47
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:05,231
The accord we've struck with Cendred

48
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,231
was years in the making.

49
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:11,311
I cannot risk hundreds of lives
for the sake of one village.

50
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:13,871
I'm afraid Camelot cannot help.

51
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,511
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:37,071
If it were up to me,
we'd be on our way there now.

53
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:40,591
Well, you tried. And thank you for
getting an audience with the king.

54
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:46,591
I wish that Camelot was able
to help people regardless of how far
away they lived.

55
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,351
I'm going back to Ealdor.

56
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,791
Of course.

57
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,511
It's been an honour serving you.

58
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:01,471
You'll be coming back?

59
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,351
She's my mother.

60
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:06,151
I have got to look after her
before anyone else.

61
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,991
You understand?

62
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,711
I'd do exactly the same.

63
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,751
Well...you've been terrible.

64
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,911
Really, I mean it,
the worst servant I've ever had.

65
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,551
Thank you, sire.

66
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:29,711
Merlin.

67
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:32,231
Good luck.

68
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:41,991
Here.

69
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:45,951
HE WINCES

70
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:47,591
Tell me how it feels.

71
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,071
Yeah.

72
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:53,271
Yeah, that feels really good.
It's very, erm...you know...

73
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:55,591
swordy.

74
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,511
I've packed some armour for you.

75
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,991
I won't be able to carry all that.

76
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:05,151
You won't have to.

77
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,711
We're coming with you.

78
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:14,471
What do you mean? You're going
to need all the help you can get. I
can mend armour and sharpen swords.

79
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:17,991
And I know how to fight.
But you-you can't.

80
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,991
I mean, why would you?

81
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:25,391
If it was the other way round,
you'd help us. You already have,
you saved my life.

82
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:28,191
And you helped me get the druid boy
out of Camelot.

83
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,991
We owe it to you...both of us.

84
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:36,231
You've got the food
I prepared for you? Yes.

85
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:41,351
Careful with the wine.
One whiff of a barmaid's apron
and you're singing like a sailor.

86
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:45,071
I'll be fine. Sure you don't want
an extra blanket? It's OK, really.

87
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,591
I'll be all right.

88
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,391
Well, make sure you are.

89
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:51,271
Do whatever it takes.

90
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:22,271
They shouldn't be here,
especially the Lady Morgana.

91
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:26,111
Isn't she the king's ward?
Not that you'd know it.

92
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,271
She's the only person
who isn't frightened of him.

93
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:34,791
It won't make any difference
to Kanen that they're women.

94
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,351
I know.

95
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,631
But I couldn't talk them out
of coming.

96
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:49,511
I'm going to make him pay
for what he did to you.

97
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,871
Promise me you'll be careful.

98
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,111
No-one can find out about you.

99
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,271
They won't. They never do.

100
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,671
Get some rest.

101
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,751
Draca.

102
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:25,871
I'd ask you for money,
but I know you don't have any.

103
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:28,031
Arthur!

104
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:32,231
Put the sword down, Merlin,
you look ridiculous.

105
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,111
How much further is it?
Maybe a few hours.

106
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,511
How many men does Kanen have?

107
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:50,111
I'm not sure - I think from what my
mother's said, maybe as many as 40.

108
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:56,151
We should get some rest. It's going
to be a long day tomorrow.

109
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:00,871
Thank you.

110
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,111
Um... I know you didn't have to
come.

111
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:05,831
Get some sleep.

112
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,191
If you're hiding anything from me...

113
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:48,591
Kanen!

114
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,191
Please...

115
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:59,791
we have to eat... Oh. And re-sow
the fields for next year.

116
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:02,991
We only kept the bare minimum.

117
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:05,631
Everything else you can take.

118
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,791
That sounds fair.

119
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:15,391
No!

120
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:29,591
Kill them!

121
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:50,191
Ahatian.

122
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:15,391
Remembering when I'd beat you?
That never happened.

123
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,711
You'll pay for this...with
your lives, all of you!

124
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:33,711
You're still up to the magic tricks.
I thought I told you we didn't
want your kind round here.

125
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,671
I missed you too, Will.

126
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:42,991
It's good to see you again.
How have you been?

127
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:46,711
I hear you're skivvying for some
prince. No, I wouldn't say
I'm a skivvy.

128
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:49,791
Merlin! Gather the villagers,
I need to talk to them.

129
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,951
Yeah, in a minute,
I'm just talking... Now, Merlin.
There isn't much time.

130
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,991
Yes, sire.

131
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:10,151
I know Kanen's kind. He'll be back,
and when he is...

132
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:13,231
we must be ready for him.

133
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:17,391
First of all, we have to prepare...
Am I the only one wondering
who the hell this is?

134
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:19,391
I'm Prince Arthur of Camelot.

135
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:23,991
And I'm Prince William of Ealdor(!)
Keep quiet, he's here to help us.
He's made things worse.

136
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:26,151
Kanen will be back, looking for
revenge.

137
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:29,591
You've just signed our death
warrant. He saved Matthew's life.

138
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:33,871
It's all right, Hunith, this is his
village. What would you have us do?

139
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:39,351
We can't fight against Kanen,
he has too many men.
What's the alternative?

140
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:44,991
We give him what he wants. Then
what? Those of you who don't
starve to death

141
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,631
will face him again next harvest and
the harvest after that.

142
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:51,271
We manage, we'll survive.
MAN: How?

143
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:55,271
The only way he can be stopped
is if you to stand up to him.

144
00:13:55,271 --> 00:14:00,031
No, you just want the
honour and glory of battle. That's
what drives men like you.

145
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:03,551
If you want to fight, then risk the
lives of your own people. Not ours.

146
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:06,791
Will.

147
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:11,831
I'll follow you. If I'm to die,
then I want to go out fighting.

148
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,311
That goes for me, too.

149
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,551
VILLAGERS: You can count me in.
Me, too. You can count me in!

150
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,671
He knows what he's doing.
You've got to trust him.

151
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:29,711
Look...when I first met Arthur,
I was exactly like you. I hated him.

152
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:32,871
I thought he was pompous and
arrogant. Nothing's changed there!

153
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:36,671
But in time I came to respect him,

154
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:39,911
for what he stands for, what he
does. I know what he stands for.

155
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:42,751
Princes, kings, all men like him.

156
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:49,791
Will...don't bring what
happened to your father into this.

157
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,591
I'm not.

158
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,631
Why are you defending him
so much? You're just his servant.
He's my friend.

159
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:58,031
Friends don't lord it over one
another. He isn't like that.

160
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:01,911
Really? Wait until the fighting
begins and see who he sends in
to die first.

161
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,991
I guarantee you it won't be him.
I trust Arthur with my life.

162
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,351
Is that so?

163
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,111
So he knows your secret, then?

164
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:15,271
Face it, Merlin, you're living
a lie, just like you were here.

165
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:18,111
You're Arthur's servant,
nothing more.

166
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,151
Otherwise you'd tell him the truth.

167
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:32,111
Have you always slept on the floor?

168
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:37,231
Yeah. The bed I've got in Camelot's
luxury by comparison.

169
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,191
It must have been hard. Hmm.

170
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,751
Like rock..

171
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:46,031
I didn't mean the ground, I meant...
for you, it must've been difficult.

172
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:50,551
Hmm... Not really,
I didn't know any different.

173
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:54,831
Life's simple out here.
You eat what you grow and everyone
pitches in together.

174
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:59,711
As long as you've food on the table
and a roof over your head, you're
happy. Sounds...

175
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,751
nice.

176
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:04,311
You'd hate it. No doubt.

177
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:06,911
Why did you leave?

178
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,351
Things just...changed.

179
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:12,231
How?

180
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:15,871
Come on, stop pretending
to be interesting, tell me.

181
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,311
I wanted to find somewhere
that I did.

182
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:28,031
Had any luck?

183
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:30,111
I'm not sure yet.

184
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:34,151
We'll start training
the men tomorrow.

185
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:36,831
It's gonna be a long day.

186
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,151
Get the candle.

187
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:50,511
Have you still not learned how to
dress yourself? You don't have a dog
and fetch the stick yourself.

188
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,471
No offence, Merlin. None taken.

189
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:57,391
Prince Arthur, you didn't
finish your breakfast. Didn't I?
Come on, eat up.

190
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:03,511
Mmm...

191
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,751
Right, let's get going.
We need wood and lots of it.

192
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:09,311
Of course.

193
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:13,351
Arthur said it was lovely.

194
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:21,351
He must care for you a great deal.

195
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:26,111
Arthur would do the same for any
village, that's just the way he is.
It's more than that.

196
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,391
He's here for you.

197
00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:32,191
I'm just his servant. Give him
more credit than that, he likes you.

198
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:33,991
That's because he doesn't know me.

199
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,951
And if he did, I'd probably be dead
by now.

200
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:39,151
You don't really believe that,
do you?

201
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:47,991
Merlin! Where are you going with
that thing? What does it look like?
We need wood.

202
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:51,951
We both know that you don't need
an axe to fell a tree.

203
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:53,511
And I remember the trouble
it got me into,

204
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,431
I nearly flattened old man Simmons.

205
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,711
Well, he deserved it,
the stupid old crone.

206
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,351
He never did like me anyway.

207
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,911
Well, even less after that.

208
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:07,871
Why are you being like this?

209
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,631
You know why.

210
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,151
Why did you leave?

211
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:26,431
It wasn't what I wanted.
My mother was worried.

212
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,311
When she found out you knew,
she was so angry.

213
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,751
I wouldn't have told anyone.
I know you wouldn't.

214
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:40,111
You'd be able to defeat Kanen
on your own, wouldn't you?

215
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:46,591
Not sure, maybe. So what's stopping
you? So what if Arthur finds out? I
don't expect you to understand.

216
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,471
Try me.

217
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:53,351
One day Arthur will be a great king,
but he needs my help, and if anyone
ever found out about my powers,

218
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:55,591
I'd have to leave Camelot for good.

219
00:18:55,591 --> 00:19:00,991
Are you saying you'd rather keep
your magic secret for Arthur's sake
than protect friends and family?

220
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:12,991
fighting with a sword,

221
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,031
but you can learn the basics -

222
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,551
the stance,

223
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:19,671
how to parry a blow,
how to land your own.

224
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:22,191
On my count - one,

225
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,591
two,

226
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:25,591
three,

227
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:27,111
four.

228
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:30,591
Now you may have to watch
for the feint, so keep your feet

229
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:35,311
moving and only stay in range
long enough to land your blow.

230
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:37,711
Again. One,

231
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:41,871
two, three, four...

232
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:45,871
One, two, three,

233
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,711
four...

234
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:52,151
There's no way they're gonna be
able to hold Kanen off. Men aren't
the only ones who can fight.

235
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:55,431
Again! One, two,

236
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:57,031
three...

237
00:19:57,951 --> 00:20:03,511
Matthew, I want you to organise
sentry duty

238
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,631
to keep an eye out for Kanen and
his men. I'd be glad to.

239
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:10,591
If there's any sign of attack, I
want you to ride straight back here.

240
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:13,111
I don't want you fighting him
all on your own.

241
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,831
It looks like the battle's
already fought and lost.

242
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:26,271
They'll toughen up. They need to.
How are we doing for weapons?

243
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:30,031
There isn't much, but we should be
able to scrape together
what you need.

244
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:33,711
It's not the weapons that worry us,
it's having enough people to use
them.

245
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:36,311
We think the women
should be allowed to fight.

246
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:41,911
You haven't enough men. If they were
trained soldiers, maybe you'd stand
a chance, but they're not.

247
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,031
It's too dangerous.

248
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:49,231
Right,

249
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:51,151
back on your feet! Come on, let's go!

250
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:07,031
We don't stand a chance.
Arthur can't see that.

251
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,831
He's too stubborn.

252
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,831
Why do you think he came here?

253
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,631
The same reason we did.

254
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:17,471
Merlin.

255
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,151
Arthur may act like he doesn't care,
but...

256
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:22,231
he wouldn't be here if he didn't.

257
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:26,471
We're not going to be able to defend
Ealdor with sword and sinew alone.
We're going to need a plan.

258
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:30,111
We need to find some way of limiting
their mobility

259
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:34,791
and drawing them into a trap. If we
fight them on their terms, then...

260
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,871
WOMAN SCREAMS
No!

261
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:41,631
Get him down from there.

262
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,751
What does it say?

263
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:06,631
"Make the most of this day,
it'll be your last."

264
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,471
Matthew!

265
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:09,871
No! No!

266
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:16,311
No! You did this. Look what
you've done, you've killed him.
It wasn't his fault.

267
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:21,031
If he hadn't been strutting around
treating us like his personal army,
this would never have happened!

268
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:26,191
These men are brave enough to fight
for what they believe in,
even if you aren't.

269
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:28,831
You're sending them to their graves!

270
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:30,871
You've killed one man.

271
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:34,991
How many more need to die
before you realise this is a battle
that can't be won?

272
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:37,711
When Kanen comes,
you haven't got a chance.

273
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,511
You're going to be slaughtered.

274
00:22:48,391 --> 00:22:51,231
Don't bother, Merlin, I'm not
interested. You should be,

275
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:56,791
because tomorrow Kanen attacks and
whether you like it or not, we'll
have to fight. Not if I'm not here.

276
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:01,031
That's up to you,
but the rest of us are staying.
Join us, Will.

277
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:06,271
This isn't about Arthur - this is
about your friends, are you going
to abandon them?

278
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:10,071
What, like you did? I'm here now.

279
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:12,711
Yeah. Yeah, you are
and you could end this.

280
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:16,511
If you used your magic, then
no-one else would have to die.
You know I can't.

281
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,191
Can't or won't?

282
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:22,471
I'm not the one abandoning
these people, Merlin.

283
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,631
You are.

284
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:52,871
William's father was killed
fighting for King Cendred,

285
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:56,631
so he doesn't trust
anyone of nobility.

286
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:01,791
Do you think the villagers
believed him? No.

287
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:07,311
He's...always been a trouble-maker.
They're used to ignoring him.

288
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,991
And if he's right?

289
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:12,271
He isn't.

290
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,591
I'm treating these men like soldiers,
and they're not.

291
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:20,071
You've seen them fight, they...

292
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:22,591
they haven't got a clue.

293
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,191
You need to tell them all to leave
the village before Kanen returns.

294
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:34,391
No, we're going to stay,
we're going to fight,

295
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,631
and we're going to win.
Merlin...it can't be done.

296
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:43,591
The odds are too great. It can.
We're going to make Kanen rue the
day he ever came to this village.

297
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:46,231
All you need to do
is get the men ready for battle,

298
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:50,551
and the rest...will
take care of itself. How?

299
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:53,191
You've just got to believe in them.

300
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:57,551
Because if you don't,
they'll sense it,

301
00:24:57,551 --> 00:25:01,351
and the battle will be lost
before it's even begun.

302
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:02,951
Tomorrow morning,

303
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:07,831
the women and children should gather
what belongings they can carry
and go to the woods.

304
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:09,551
We're not going anywhere.

305
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:17,231
I know you want to help, but women
can't stay here, it's too dangerous.
The women have as much right

306
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,991
to fight for their lives
as the men do.

307
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:24,831
But none of you know how to fight.
The more of us there are,
the better chance we stand.

308
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:37,231
This is your home. If you want
to fight to defend it,
that's your choice.

309
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:39,151
I'd be honoured to stand
alongside you.

310
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:44,591
Kanen attacks tomorrow.
Kanen's brutal.

311
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:50,071
He fights only to kill,
which is why he will never defeat us.

312
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:51,551
Look around.

313
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:58,791
In this circle, we're all equals.
You're not fighting because
someone's ordering you to.

314
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:03,031
You're fighting for so much more
than that. You fight for your homes.

315
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:06,991
You fight for your family.

316
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:08,551
You fight for your friends.

317
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:11,751
You fight for the right
to grow crops in peace.

318
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:18,871
And if you fall, you fall fighting
for the noblest of causes,

319
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:21,951
fighting for your
very right to survive.

320
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:25,551
And when you're old and grey, you'll
look back on this day and you'll know

321
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,551
you earned the right
to live every day in between.

322
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,551
For your family!

323
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,431
For your friends!

324
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:37,351
For Ealdor! For Ealdor!

325
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:40,631
Ealdor! Ealdor! Ealdor!

326
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:43,271
Ealdor! Ealdor! Ealdor!

327
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:44,471
Ealdor!

328
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,511
Come here.

329
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:08,551
I do love you, my boy.

330
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,911
What's wrong?

331
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:17,831
I should never have gone to Camelot.

332
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:22,991
I've ruined everything for you. You
haven't. Why would you say that?

333
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,911
I know what you're planning to do.

334
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,311
If it comes to a choice

335
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:37,311
between saving people's lives

336
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:40,751
and revealing who I really am,

337
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:48,111
there is no choice. You can't let
Arthur know about your gift.
Why not?

338
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:51,991
Maybe it's meant to be this way.

339
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:56,311
And if he doesn't accept me
for who I really am,

340
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,631
then...

341
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,231
he's not the friend I hoped he was.

342
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,991
Arthur.

343
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:17,151
Hunith made you some food.

344
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:18,591
Thanks.

345
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:23,911
I think. Food is scarce for these
people, you shouldn't turn your nose
up at it.

346
00:28:26,111 --> 00:28:29,951
Oh, no, I shouldn't have spoken to
you like that. I'm sorry. Gwen...

347
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:32,711
I'm sorry, I don't know
what I was thinking... Guinevere...

348
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:37,111
Thank you.

349
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:43,351
You're right. And you were right
to speak up, I should've listened
to you and Morgana.

350
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:46,911
We're going to need all the help
we can get. We'll be fine.

351
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:48,751
How can you be so sure?

352
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:50,511
Because I have faith in you.

353
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:55,391
I mean...we all do.

354
00:28:57,911 --> 00:28:59,191
Thank you.

355
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:10,951
No, not today. Put on your own.

356
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,111
Are you ready? My throat's dry.

357
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:27,911
Me, too.

358
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,551
It's been an honour.

359
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:43,751
Whatever happens out there today,

360
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:48,471
please don't think
any differently of me. I won't.

361
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,711
It's all right to be scared, Merlin.

362
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:55,071
That's not what I meant.

363
00:29:56,151 --> 00:29:57,951
What is it?

364
00:29:57,951 --> 00:30:02,791
If you've got something to
say...now's the time to say it.

365
00:30:05,911 --> 00:30:07,351
Arthur.

366
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,871
They've crossed the river.

367
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,071
You ready? Ready.

368
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:24,391
Ealdor.

369
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:30,711
Are you frightened? Not in the
slightest.

370
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:50,591
Yah!

371
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:07,551
Hold.

372
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:16,351
No-one moves until I give the signal.

373
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:34,911
Hold.

374
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:40,191
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

375
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,551
Now, pull!

376
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:51,631
Now, Morgana,
what are you waiting for?

377
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:53,271
Something's gone wrong.

378
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,511
Merlin!

379
00:31:57,831 --> 00:31:59,631
There's one, get him!

380
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:05,911
Kill him!

381
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:16,751
Give me the flints.

382
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:21,831
Baerne.

383
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:27,671
HORSES NEIGH

384
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:32,231
Pull back! Go the other way!

385
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,751
Now!

386
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,471
I didn't think you were coming.
Neither did I.

387
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:15,191
There's too many of them.

388
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:17,191
Not for me, there isn't.

389
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,311
Cume theoden.

390
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:34,311
WIND HOWLS

391
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,191
VILLAGERS CHEER

392
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:46,191
Pendragon!

393
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:41,791
Who did that?

394
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:45,391
What? Wind like that doesn't
just appear from nowhere.

395
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:47,631
I know magic when I see it.

396
00:36:47,631 --> 00:36:49,751
One of you made it happen.

397
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:53,951
Arthur...

398
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,351
Look out!

399
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:01,551
Will!

400
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:07,151
You saved my life.

401
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:10,671
Yeah...I don't know
what I was thinking.

402
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,791
Come on, get him inside!

403
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:30,191
That's twice I've saved you.

404
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:31,551
Twice?

405
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:33,591
It was me.

406
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:36,031
I'm the one that used the magic.

407
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:40,791
Will, don't... It's OK, Merlin.
I won't be alive long enough for
anyone to do anything to me.

408
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:43,871
I did it.

409
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:48,191
I saw how desperate things were
becoming, I had to do something.

410
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:50,071
You're a sorcerer?

411
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:53,711
Yeah.

412
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:56,471
What are you going to do? Kill me?

413
00:37:58,671 --> 00:38:00,311
No.

414
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,951
Of course not.

415
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:04,871
Merlin...

416
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:09,591
..do what you can for him.

417
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:28,551
I was right about him.

418
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:32,031
I told you he was going to get me
killed. You're not going to die.

419
00:38:33,671 --> 00:38:37,351
You're a good man, Merlin,
a great man, and one day

420
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:39,711
you're going to be servant
to a great king.

421
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,831
Now you can still make that happen.

422
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:45,231
Thanks to you.

423
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:51,351
This place has been boring
without you.

424
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:53,111
It was good to see you again.

425
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:57,031
You too.

426
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,751
Merlin...

427
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:05,791
Merlin, I'm scared.

428
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:08,111
Don't be, it's going to be
all right.

429
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:11,431
Merlin...

430
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:15,111
Merlin...

431
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:42,111
I'm sorry.

432
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:43,551
I know he was a close friend.

433
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:47,471
He still is.

434
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,511
You knew he was a sorcerer,
didn't you?

435
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:52,591
That's what you were going to
tell me.

436
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:56,431
Yes.

437
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,031
It was.

438
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,351
You know how dangerous magic is.

439
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:05,791
You shouldn't have kept
this from me, Merlin.

440
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:23,151
You'd better be going.

441
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:27,511
I don't have to go.

442
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:29,711
Yes, you do.

443
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:35,191
If anything were to happen to you...

444
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:38,151
I know where to find you.

445
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:40,511
You have to go, Merlin.

446
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,711
You belong at Arthur's side.

447
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,511
I've seen how much he needs you,

448
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:49,791
how much you need him.

449
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:53,471
You're like two sides
of the same coin.

450
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:57,151
I've heard someone say that about
us before.

451
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:00,191
I'm going to miss you.

452
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:05,871
I'm going to miss you, too.

453
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:10,471
When you left...

454
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:13,191
you were just a boy.

455
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:16,551
Now look at you.

456
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,351
I'm so proud of you.

457
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:30,791
'When the time is right...
the truth will be known.

458
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:35,871
'Until then, you must
keep your talents hidden.

459
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,071
'It's better for everyone.'

460
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:48,911
I am Anhora, keeper of the unicorns.

461
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:50,671
Arthur, don't!

462
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:54,151
When you killed the unicorn,
you unleashed a curse.

463
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:56,191
Camelot will suffer greatly.

464
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:57,791
The kingdom is under attack.

465
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,911
Undo the curse.
It is not in my power.

466
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:04,951
He will be tested.

467
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:07,111
One of us has to die.
What have you done?
