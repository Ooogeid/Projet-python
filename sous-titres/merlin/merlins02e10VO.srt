1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:03,554
In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

2
00:00:03,724 --> 00:00:05,566
the destiny of a great kingdom

3
00:00:05,736 --> 00:00:08,327
rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,859
His name...

5
00:00:10,323 --> 00:00:11,150
Merlin.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,710
We're not going into battle.
Don't look so sombre.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,870
Never before

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,631
have the rulers of the five kingdoms
come together in this way.

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:29,470
Never before have we all worked
towards the same aim, towards peace.

10
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,064
If these talks are successful,

11
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,350
Camelot will enter
a new era of prosperity.

12
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,270
If they fail,

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,150
it will almost certainly mean war.

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,910
Boy!

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,430
Is it too much to ask
that you might anticipate my needs?

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,870
Sorry, master. I was...

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,230
- Stop whinging.
- Sorry, master.

18
00:00:58,095 --> 00:00:59,096
Alined!

19
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,670
You are most welcome
on this momentous occasion.

20
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:06,770
Momentous?
Let us hope so.

21
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,495
Uther may think
that we are gathered here for peace,

22
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,070
but that is far from my mind.

23
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,790
Am I to take it
that Lady Vivian is part of our plan?

24
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,833
She is very lovely.

25
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,510
Don't let her father hear you.

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,456
Not if you value your head.

27
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:32,270
Indeed I do!
It is my prettiest feature.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,910
Olaf is the most over-protective buffoon
I've ever met.

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,950
It would surely end the peace talks

30
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,588
if anyone were to lay
a finger on her.

31
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:46,460
But nobody in their right mind
would do that.

32
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:50,597
But Arthur won't be
in his right mind...

33
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:52,894
will he?

34
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,430
<i>Arthur's Knights</i>

35
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,910
Merlin - 2x10
<i>Sweet Dreams</i>

36
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,941
What kind of welcome is this?

37
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:36,041
You have us hanging around
like the last swallows of summer.

38
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,990
You are welcome indeed, Olaf.

39
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,710
May I present my daughter,

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,036
the Lady Vivian.

41
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,935
How like your mother you are.

42
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,640
I hope
everything is to your satisfaction?

43
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,728
It is adequate.

44
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:57,757
Most of our guests
are extremely happy here.

45
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,469
I am sure you will be too.

46
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,550
I am not most of your guests.

47
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,287
In... deed.

48
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,552
Well, may I present Guinevere?

49
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:11,310
She'll be looking after you
for the duration of your stay.

50
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,830
You will want for nothing.
She is truly one of Camelot's finest.

51
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:17,390
Then I fear for Camelot.

52
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,292
Good luck with that one.

53
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,630
I need to prepare for the feast.

54
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,430
What kind of impression this gives?

55
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,270
That we have moths.

56
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,810
Fetch me another.

57
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,590
And who might you be trying
to impress?

58
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,104
Well, let me see...

59
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:01,091
Perhaps the five kings
sitting in the banquet hall below.

60
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,020
Not the king's daughter, then?

61
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:07,110
The Lady Vivian,
she is very beautiful.

62
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,390
Anyone trying to impress the Lady Vivian
does so at extreme peril.

63
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,190
Olaf would have their head
in a vat of hot oil

64
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,048
before they'd said hello.

65
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,870
Besides, she's not my type.

66
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,792
She may be beautiful
but she's incredibly rude.

67
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:22,910
You should've heard
what she said to Gwen.

68
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:25,510
Anyone insulting Gwen
should do so at extreme peril.

69
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,301
What?

70
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,277
Nothing.

71
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:32,220
I just know how you feel about her,
that's all.

72
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:33,350
That is,

73
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,769
if your feelings haven't changed.
I presume they haven't.

74
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,110
I do have my own vat of hot oil,
you know.

75
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,401
You're blushing.

76
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,710
No, I'm not.

77
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,824
- What's wrong with Gwen?
- Nothing.

78
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:45,830
I think
she is very worthy of your love.

79
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,110
Indeed.

80
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,630
Were it so.

81
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,950
Which is.

82
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:54,870
Get out.

83
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:37,510
But it is not enough to please
just the gentlemen of the court.

84
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,750
Now I have a spectacle
for the ladies.

85
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,550
- It is skill indeed.
- We aim to please.

86
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,724
But what is this?

87
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:08,790
It has mistaken you
for a beautiful flower.

88
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:43,463
Sleep well, Prince Arthur,

89
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:47,624
and when you wake,
may your thoughts be only of Vivian.

90
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,093
Sweet dreams.

91
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,070
Good morning.

92
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:17,507
Never have you been more right!

93
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,310
It is the sunniest,

94
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,870
the most fragrant, the most...

95
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,190
beautiful morning
I've ever seen in my life.

96
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,379
You're dressed?

97
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,063
I am the future King of Camelot,
I do have some skills.

98
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:31,190
Indeed. You are very skilled...
at getting people to do things for you.

99
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:32,590
That is your job.

100
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:35,716
But today my job...

101
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,270
is to woo.

102
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,956
- To what?
- To woo.

103
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:43,597
I wish to make
a proclamation of love.

104
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,830
Really? I thought you wanted
to keep your feelings secret.

105
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:49,470
Why would I do that?

106
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,550
By the end of today,
I will have won my lady.

107
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,344
Right.

108
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:59,830
- What will you tell your father?
- What does he matter?

109
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,853
That's one way
of approaching things.

110
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,110
I need your help in expressing

111
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,270
my feelings.

112
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,790
Of course.

113
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,506
- How do I express my feelings?
- Oh, I see.

114
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:17,910
- Feelings...
- Feelings.

115
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,630
- Girls...
- Girls.

116
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,590
- Flowers?
- Excellent.

117
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,380
Find some.

118
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,227
- Perhaps you should also send a note.
- Brilliant idea.

119
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:28,430
Something moving.

120
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,502
Something from the heart.

121
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:32,752
Something...

122
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,485
You'll think of something.

123
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:01,262
"The barriers that keep us apart

124
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:04,544
"are nothing compared
to the power of true love."

125
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,070
"Arthur."

126
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,710
Your demands are noted

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,855
and will be taken
into consideration in due course.

128
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,390
In the meantime,
is there anyone else who has comments

129
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,166
about the Northern Territories?

130
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,030
Maybe I should point out that...

131
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,206
Did you do it?

132
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,962
Left them in her room.
It's better than a public display.

133
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,230
- You sure she got them?
- I'm sure she will.

134
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,670
Good!

135
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,565
Well, all we can do now is wait...

136
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,510
But heaven has blessed me.

137
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,190
She's even more beautiful than before.
Don't you agree?

138
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,532
I'm surprised
to hear you talk so openly.

139
00:09:48,702 --> 00:09:49,710
Nonsense.

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,470
I want to tell the world.

141
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:53,010
I want to...

142
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,728
shout it across the kingdom.

143
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,002
Sure that's a good idea?

144
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:02,230
I understand your feelings
but other people may object.

145
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,507
Object?

146
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,969
- To what?
- You're the future King of Camelot

147
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,790
and she is serving girl,
albeit a very nice serving girl.

148
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:13,150
Lady Vivian is of royal blood,

149
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,468
a future queen.

150
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:17,501
I will have your head
if I hear such insolence again.

151
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:30,390
Merlin, can't you knock?

152
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,350
- Rats.
- What?

153
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,150
Big, hairy, sharp teeth.

154
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:38,863
Yeah, definitely, under here.

155
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,910
- Are you feeling all right?
- Me? Never better.

156
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,461
You?

157
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,390
I'm having a very surprising day.

158
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,450
Really?

159
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,638
You know when you've lost all hope

160
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:57,232
and then out of the blue
something happens to restore your faith.

161
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:58,409
Sort of.

162
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,710
Well, that's what's happened
to me today.

163
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,710
I may have caused a problem.

164
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:07,150
Although
it wasn't entirely my doing.

165
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,910
- What now, Merlin?
- Arthur's in love.

166
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,550
How did you cause that?

167
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,470
That bit isn't my fault.
The other is.

168
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,190
I can't tell you about that bit.

169
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:16,430
Clear as mud.

170
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,350
Arthur is besotted.
He can't concentrate on anything.

171
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,155
All he thinks about,
all he talks about is...

172
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,065
It's the Lady Vivian.

173
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:30,390
The Lady Vivian?
How could that happened so suddenly?

174
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,430
I don't know.

175
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,843
Something doesn't feel right.

176
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,988
Only yesterday,
he dismissed her as rude.

177
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:40,067
If Arthur professes his love for Vivian,
Olaf will be furious.

178
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:41,550
Surely Arthur knows that?

179
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,630
He said it was his job
to woo his lady by the end of the day.

180
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,310
It is your job to stop him.

181
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,702
- Who is it?
- It is destiny, my love.

182
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,213
Destiny and chicken.

183
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:07,590
What a beautiful combination?

184
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,510
The beans are a little cold,
but the meat is very good.

185
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:15,950
Go away.

186
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,310
My love,
what I have done to offend you?

187
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,030
Your love?
Not now, nor ever.

188
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,159
Come now.

189
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,610
My father will kill you
if he finds you here.

190
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:26,560
Your father does not worry me.

191
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,036
You won't say that
when he's running at you with a knife.

192
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,670
- I've seen it before.
- Really?

193
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,472
- Just five minutes?
- My lord.

194
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,830
Your advances are not welcome.

195
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:41,030
Go away,
and take your chicken with you!

196
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,742
I don't know
what gives you that impression.

197
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,431
Damn it!

198
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,231
Every woman in the land
is attracted to this boy.

199
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,350
I'm almost attracted to him myself.

200
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,710
Not Lady Vivian.

201
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:13,657
We have until the end of tomorrow
to scupper these talks.

202
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,030
I need war.

203
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:17,743
Do you understand?

204
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:18,990
Oh, yes, I do.

205
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:21,630
Peace will make me poor.

206
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:25,560
And you know
what happens to poor kings?

207
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,851
They can't afford castles...

208
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,510
or knights,

209
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,430
or jesters.

210
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,550
- But Master...
- Enough.

211
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,366
There will be time for snivelling
when the axe is over your head.

212
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:44,990
Now there is work to be done.

213
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,500
Go on, Merlin, say it.

214
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,670
What?

215
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:58,594
You do not think
I should pursue my love.

216
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:01,676
I think a number of things
stand in the way of a happy union

217
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,350
between you and Lady Vivian.
Her blood-thirsty father for one.

218
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,710
Her complete lack of interest
for another.

219
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,150
Might it be worthwhile
returning to your old love?

220
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,657
I have my reservations
about that as well.

221
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:16,990
What are you talking about?
I don't have an old love.

222
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,782
What on Earth...?

223
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,350
You really need to start
paying attention to the details.

224
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:34,665
I knew something wasn't right.

225
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:36,470
Arthur's enchanted.

226
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,187
I should've realised.

227
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,590
No-one can make butterflies appear
from thin air.

228
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:41,817
Trickler.

229
00:14:41,987 --> 00:14:43,670
Why'd he want Arthur to love her?

230
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,910
An advance by Arthur
would ruin the conference.

231
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:51,230
- Maybe Alined wants war.
- Without creating it himself.

232
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,670
It is the cowardly behaviour
you would expect from him.

233
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,710
Cowardly, but clever.

234
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,630
We need to find a way of
turning Arthur back to normal.

235
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,070
Before it's too late.

236
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,039
My love...

237
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,150
Breakfast.

238
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,875
There are over 636 love spells
in these books,

239
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:52,490
and over 150 of them
involve a lock of hair.

240
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,070
Is there no way
we can narrow them down a bit?

241
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:58,494
I have.

242
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:00,255
Look.

243
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,830
If I choose this one and it's wrong,

244
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,853
Arthur will end up as a toad.

245
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,110
And if this one's wrong,
Vivian will lose all her hair.

246
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,270
Olaf might not declare war for that,
but she certainly would!

247
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:26,910
Gwen has been detained.

248
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,510
I thought you might
appreciate breakfast.

249
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:31,604
Thank you. How kind!

250
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:33,830
I'm so happy this morning
I could forget to eat.

251
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,790
But that looks wonderful.
Really wonderful.

252
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:40,435
Pray, my lady.

253
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:42,270
What has caused such happiness?

254
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,150
I cannot tell, so do not ask.

255
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:46,442
Intriguing...

256
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,910
You know another meaning of jester

257
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:52,350
is "keeper of secrets".

258
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,675
- Really?
- No.

259
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,070
You mustn't tell.
Not a soul.

260
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,350
- Especially not my father.
- Go on...

261
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,310
I am in love.

262
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:06,030
How wonderful. With me?

263
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,545
With a man
more courageous than a lion,

264
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:12,996
stronger than an ox,
and so perfectly formed

265
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,157
it is as if he had been sculpted
by the gods themselves.

266
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,630
But it must be me?

267
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,989
Just to speak his name
brings me pleasure indeed.

268
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,590
Then speak it you should.

269
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,229
There! I've said it.

270
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,150
My heart belongs to Arthur.

271
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,381
Excellent.

272
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,230
In fact, I'm going to tell him now.

273
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,670
A brilliant idea.

274
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,023
Where is Gwen? I must dress.

275
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:40,762
But you look so beautiful, my lady.

276
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:44,290
How could he refuse you like this?

277
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,670
- In my night gown?
- Why not?

278
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,693
What is it, Arthur?

279
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:04,430
You look like
you have something on your mind.

280
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:08,479
You read me like a book.

281
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:12,867
I have made a fool of myself,
that's all.

282
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:15,362
That is... everything.

283
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm sure that is not true.

284
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,492
You have a good heart, Guinevere,
but I'm afraid it is.

285
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,964
I have made... a gesture,

286
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,815
and it was not well received.

287
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:29,017
You're sure?

288
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:30,227
Pretty sure.

289
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,890
Then you are wrong.

290
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:36,270
You are very close to the lady
in question.

291
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,150
Your token was much appreciated.

292
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:43,466
But the situation is delicate and...

293
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:47,590
it is not always easy to express
what is really in one's heart.

294
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,944
There's hope?

295
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,230
There is always hope.

296
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,415
If only I had some way of knowing.

297
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,124
Indeed, my lord.

298
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,830
I wish to see Arthur.
Your master.

299
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,990
- My lord.
- Your what?

300
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,670
My heart's delight.

301
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,516
Where is he?

302
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:21,025
He's not here.
Which is a very good thing, I believe.

303
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,430
- Then I shall wait.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

304
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,027
You're not even dressed.

305
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,479
My love does not care what I wear,
only that I am near.

306
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:30,230
- Now fetch him.
- I cannot.

307
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,750
- You will.
- I shan't.

308
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,630
- As he commands you, I command you.
- I am asking you to leave.

309
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:38,630
I want my love.
I need my love.

310
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:41,136
I want to see him now.

311
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:54,830
And so moving on

312
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,908
to our final point for discussion,

313
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,409
the boundaries
of the Eastern Territories.

314
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:03,110
This is a point
that I am willing to concede.

315
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,682
That is very generous.

316
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:06,599
- Excuse me, sire?
- One moment.

317
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:09,750
What?!

318
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,002
Where is he?

319
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,217
What's that?

320
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,950
Okay, you need to go.

321
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,136
You cannot keep us apart.
It is written in the stars.

322
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,563
Vivian and Arthur,
a love for all time.

323
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,950
A love stronger than time! A love...

324
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,961
Why are you hanging around
like a bad smell?

325
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:47,755
It's me who needs to bathe.

326
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:51,030
I'm not going to win my love
stinking like an old kipper.

327
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,210
No, my lord.

328
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,475
Where is she?

329
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,849
I know she's in here, Arthur!

330
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,590
Hand her over or feel my wrath.

331
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:00,670
What's he talking about?

332
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,386
She wasn't even dressed.

333
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:04,950
If I have dishonoured you in some way,
then by all means,

334
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,430
provide me with proof
and I'll face the consequences.

335
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,910
Trickler here tells me
the Lady Vivian is in your chambers.

336
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,670
If only that were true.

337
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:17,670
If only that were true,
you would not look so foolish.

338
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,802
Search the room.

339
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,793
You'd better hope I don't find her.

340
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:53,790
That hasn't opened in years.

341
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,890
Buffoon!

342
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,070
You've made an idiot of me.

343
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:05,910
I am...

344
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:08,350
so terribly sorry,

345
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,430
to have disturbed you.

346
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:13,590
I do hope that you will forgive me.

347
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:21,390
Check on the Lady Vivian,

348
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,070
and remain outside her room!

349
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,650
If only the Lady Vivian
were in my room.

350
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:32,040
How delightful that would be.

351
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,790
It's that meddlesome Merlin.
He's onto us, my lord.

352
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:58,670
There was nothing I could do.

353
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,310
You do understand, master?

354
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,530
Say you forgive your boy?

355
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,670
You have a matter of hours

356
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,070
before the peace treaty is signed.

357
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,460
That is time enough, master.
Time enough.

358
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:17,175
It's less time than you've had already,
and you haven't managed it so far.

359
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,310
But the enchantment is strong,
my lord.

360
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:24,550
Sooner or later,
the two will be drawn together.

361
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,230
For the sake
of your prettiest feature,

362
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,990
you had better believe
that to be the case.

363
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,747
This is indeed a momentous day
for the five kingdoms.

364
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,323
This peace treaty
has been long in the making.

365
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:56,567
I know you must be keen
to return to your families,

366
00:23:56,737 --> 00:24:00,179
so we will make preparations
for the signing ceremony immediately.

367
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:01,850
I am pleased, friends.

368
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:03,712
Very pleased.

369
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,891
As are we all.

370
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,210
- That's it. I've got it.
- You sure?

371
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,661
You're not going to turn Arthur into
a hunchback camel or a horny eyed toad?

372
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,550
I'll save that for another day.

373
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,421
"A second chance?

374
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:29,796
"Sunset.

375
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:33,500
"I'll await your presence."

376
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,321
At last.

377
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,605
I'll find out.

378
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,630
Is there a problem, Uther?

379
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,977
No, not at all.

380
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:16,929
Arthur's just running
a little late, that's all.

381
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:19,390
As is the Lady Vivian.

382
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:29,814
My love.

383
00:26:29,984 --> 00:26:30,986
Always.

384
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:33,108
For ever.

385
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,670
- I knew it.
- I don't believe it.

386
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,765
Father!
We've got something to tell you.

387
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,825
Father?

388
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:05,632
You once said
that if you truly offended my honour,

389
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:07,390
then you would
happily pay the price.

390
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:09,091
What say you now?

391
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:12,430
How have I offended your honour?
Surely not with my love alone.

392
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,586
Love?!

393
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:15,590
You don't know
the first thing about love.

394
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,288
You're taking advantage of an
innocent girl.

395
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,910
I assure you,

396
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,630
my feelings for your daughter
are as real as they are strong.

397
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,790
Unhand her
or suffer the consequences.

398
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,150
Is this really worth
risking your life for?

399
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,150
Indeed it is.

400
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:32,470
I would rather die
than deny my feelings.

401
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,750
I love your daughter...

402
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:38,073
with all my heart.

403
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,340
It's no good. I have spoken to Olaf.
He will not rescind the challenge.

404
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,139
He says his honour has been tainted.

405
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,807
He demands recompense.

406
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:20,473
You didn't have to do that.

407
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,190
The fight is to the death.

408
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,171
What did you think you were doing?

409
00:28:24,341 --> 00:28:26,474
You cannot help
who you fall in love with.

410
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,699
You do you realise your actions
threaten the peace talks,

411
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:31,990
and it may yet bring war to Camelot?

412
00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:34,310
I'm happy to fight
for what I believe in.

413
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,364
What's happened to him?

414
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:39,990
Nothing more.

415
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:43,270
And yet, who could wish for more?

416
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,134
I don't understand it.

417
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,630
Trickler's magic is strong,
but not stronger than mine?

418
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:00,550
Love potions are strange.

419
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:03,352
You need to go to Uther.

420
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,350
It's a fight to the death.

421
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,236
If Uther realises
that one of the kings is using magic,

422
00:29:08,406 --> 00:29:10,019
there will certainly be a war.

423
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,430
The only way out of this situation

424
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,682
is to unenchant Arthur.

425
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:18,510
And unenchant him fast!

426
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,150
- Anything interesting?
- Haven't you heard?

427
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,370
Arthur was discovered
in Lady Vivian's chambers.

428
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:31,746
What?

429
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:34,830
King Olaf has demanded recompense.
They are to fight to the death.

430
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,070
All for the love of a woman.

431
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,271
And Lady Vivian at that.

432
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,757
You look more shocked than I did.

433
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:45,592
It is very surprising.

434
00:29:46,258 --> 00:29:48,411
I don't know
why he couldn't control his feelings.

435
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:49,589
Indeed.

436
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,830
I'll miss the tourney if you don't mind.
There's so much to organise here.

437
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,555
But of course.

438
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,468
- You will wish me luck?
- Will I?

439
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:03,956
Haven't you heard?

440
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,510
Oh, yes, I've heard.

441
00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:08,870
Though sadly not from your lips.

442
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,895
I wish you could have been
more honest with me.

443
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,634
What's she talking about?

444
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,265
No idea.

445
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,515
You are pleased, my lord?

446
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:24,390
Do I get to keep my fingers?

447
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:30,110
I shall cast your fingers in gold.

448
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,856
I could not have wished for more.

449
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:37,310
I told you I would not fail you.

450
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,870
If Olaf kills Arthur,
then Uther will start a war.

451
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:43,790
If Arthur kills Olaf,
then his men will start a war.

452
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:48,550
We cannot lose!

453
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:56,070
King Olaf has demanded recompense

454
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:59,790
and by the ancient laws of Camelot,
the matter will be settled

455
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,710
by a tourney in three stages.

456
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,699
The weapons chosen
are quarter staff,

457
00:31:07,063 --> 00:31:08,550
mace and sword.

458
00:31:09,354 --> 00:31:11,830
The fight will be by the Knight's Rules
and to the death.

459
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,590
Are we all clear?

460
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,876
One of your ribs is broken, sire.

461
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,470
Nothing can hurt me today.
I'm invincible.

462
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,870
Love really can conquer all, Gaius.

463
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,471
It's true.

464
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,510
This can't go on.

465
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,470
The fight's not fair.
Arthur's head is in the clouds.

466
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,710
I don't know what to do.

467
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:01,550
Then find someone who does.

468
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,110
This is magic indeed.

469
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,750
Everything I have tried has failed.

470
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,310
From what you tell me,
the spell has captured his heart.

471
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:14,550
And his heart
is controlling his brain.

472
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,550
There is no magic
that can break this enchantment.

473
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:21,110
- There must be.
- It has too great a hold...

474
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,790
I cannot let Arthur die!

475
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:24,510
Patience, young warlock.

476
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:27,470
The solution lies

477
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,630
in a force greater
than you or I can understand.

478
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:35,107
A force that has puzzled many minds.

479
00:33:35,277 --> 00:33:37,025
Please, I have very little time.

480
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:38,755
- A force...
- Just tell me.

481
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,350
Why,
it is the greatest force of all...

482
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,721
love.

483
00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:51,519
Love?

484
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:54,590
You must find the person
Arthur truly loves.

485
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:56,346
And then?

486
00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:57,870
One kiss from her

487
00:33:58,357 --> 00:34:00,310
will break the enchantment

488
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,833
and he will desire Vivian no more.

489
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:11,190
Are you sure you can carry on, sire?

490
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,681
As long as I have Vivian to gaze at,
I can conquer the world.

491
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:17,831
Besides, the mace is my forte.

492
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:19,390
You'll see.

493
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,069
Rats again?

494
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:43,910
What? No.

495
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,750
I need your help.
Arthur needs your help.

496
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,770
I do not think that Arthur needs me.

497
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,029
Gwen, don't worry, I know.

498
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:56,752
- You know what?
- Everything.

499
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:59,207
Anyone can see
how you feel about each other.

500
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,350
I do not have time to explain

501
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,270
so you have to trust me.
Arthur does love you.

502
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,571
No, he doesn't.

503
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:07,510
If you can't trust me,
trust your feelings.

504
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,870
- I'm never trusting my feelings again.
- He's enchanted.

505
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,559
Yes, with Lady Vivian,
I can see that.

506
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:17,310
I mean literally enchanted with magic,
potions, love juice.

507
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,830
- None of his feelings are genuine.
- How can you be sure?

508
00:35:21,863 --> 00:35:23,895
When I saw him,
his feelings seemed real enough.

509
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,950
None of his feelings
for her are real.

510
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,470
But if we do not break the spell,
his death will be.

511
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:32,590
Search your heart...
You know who he loves.

512
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,230
Have you come to wish me good luck?
I don't think I need it any more.

513
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,990
No, Arthur,
I have not come to wish you luck.

514
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,830
Well, honestly, that's rather rude.

515
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:55,470
Let me make amends.

516
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:28,430
What am I doing?

517
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:31,630
You're in a fight.
To the death.

518
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,350
You're losing.

519
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,670
- But...
- There is no time to explain.

520
00:37:39,613 --> 00:37:40,623
Just...

521
00:37:41,204 --> 00:37:42,470
Live for me, Arthur.

522
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,933
That's all I ask right now.

523
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:02,390
If anything should happen to me,
look after Gwen.

524
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,011
The world may think
she is just a servant, dispensable,

525
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,110
but she's not dispensable to me.

526
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,625
This is no way to achieve peace.

527
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:55,830
I thought I better deliver
it myself this time.

528
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,259
I'm sorry...

529
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,430
for what I put you through.

530
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,558
You have nothing to apologise for.

531
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,430
I, too, have caused
my fair share of hurt.

532
00:40:13,253 --> 00:40:15,633
You must believe
that my feelings for...

533
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,071
Vivian...

534
00:40:19,914 --> 00:40:21,070
were not real.

535
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:25,590
I've never loved another.

536
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,311
But one day you will.

537
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:33,122
One day,
you will find your real princess.

538
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,870
One day,
you will be King of Camelot.

539
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,698
And I cannot be your Queen.

540
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:46,710
- You don't know that.
- I am as sure of that as you are.

541
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:51,390
Things may change.

542
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,662
Well, until they do...

543
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,979
my lord.

544
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,267
Your boy has a very wise head
on his shoulders.

545
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,688
No doubt he gets that from you.

546
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,290
I hope that these events
will not harm our peace treaty.

547
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,710
I believe that Vivian
was as much to blame as Arthur.

548
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,883
I'll take her away from temptation.

549
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,981
She is far too young
to encounter such things.

550
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:34,634
I go in peace.

551
00:41:35,397 --> 00:41:37,110
I am very pleased to hear that.

552
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:39,665
That is more than you deserve, boy.

553
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,245
You will run all the way home.

554
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:44,590
- That's not possible, master.
- Make it possible.

555
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,110
Why so cross?

556
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:49,550
Anyone would think
you didn't want peace?

557
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,710
I do.

558
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:53,830
Peace...
love it.

559
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,310
Well, you may return any time
to view the treaty.

560
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,068
You're very kind.

561
00:42:06,878 --> 00:42:07,950
We may return, too?

562
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:10,470
You are welcome.

563
00:42:11,315 --> 00:42:14,470
My heart will remain,
and I hope to join it soon.

564
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:20,670
Not too soon.

565
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:24,495
It might conflict
with your one true love.

566
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:26,900
- My what?
- You heard me. I have proof.

567
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,417
- Proof?
- You kissed her in the tent.

568
00:42:34,314 --> 00:42:35,984
What happened in the tent?

569
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,967
Speak of it again and I'll kill you.

570
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,990
The ancient prophecies
speak of an alliance

571
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,950
of Mordred and Morgana

572
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,870
united in evil.

573
00:42:54,718 --> 00:42:56,949
This crystal cannot fall
into enemy hands.

574
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,327
Is it some kind of weapon?

575
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,990
Mordred will master the crystal
and we will strike Uther down.

576
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,670
This union must be stopped...

577
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:08,430
whatever the cost.
