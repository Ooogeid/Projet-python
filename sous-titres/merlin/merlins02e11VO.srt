1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,008
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:05,013
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:07,785
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,145 --> 00:00:09,213
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:10,630
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,175
Halt.

7
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,270
What are you saying?

8
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,150
Bandits.

9
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:01,550
Always watch your back.

10
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:05,350
Didn't they teach you that?

11
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:14,190
Won't you beg for your life?

12
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,910
A Knight of Camelot does not beg.

13
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:23,110
Indulge me.

14
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,310
I'd rather die.

15
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:27,293
Who am I to deny a man
his last request?

16
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:38,590
We must go
if we are to make Camelot by nightfall.

17
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,029
<i>Arthur's Knights</i>

18
00:02:10,873 --> 00:02:13,110
Merlin - 2x11
<i>The Witch's Quickening</i>

19
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:36,424
All clear.

20
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,660
Carry on.

21
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,553
<i>Take the north door.</i>

22
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,390
<i>Straight ahead.
Keep going.</i>

23
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:16,642
<i>Keep going.
Come on...</i>

24
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:26,413
<i>Keep going.
Hurry!</i>

25
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:30,999
Halt!

26
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,913
<i>Keep going. It's not much further.
It's not much further now.</i>

27
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,750
Wait in the forest of Brechffa
by the fork on the north ridge.

28
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,030
Ready?

29
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,136
<i>We're nearly there.</i>

30
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,164
<i>At the end of the corridor.</i>

31
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,510
<i>Morgana's chamber is next.</i>

32
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,202
What do mean, you lost him?
He could be dangerous.

33
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:03,350
Morgana's...
You are...

34
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:05,881
Sorry.

35
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,360
Morgana's...

36
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:10,565
They're in Morgana's chambers.

37
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,552
- I thought I'd never see you again.
- I found him wandering in the woods.

38
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:20,270
Lost and alone.
Hunted by Uther's men.

39
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:23,078
- Who are you?
- My name is Alvarr.

40
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:27,350
I too have been hunted by Uther
since I was a child.

41
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,030
- You have magic?
- Yes, my lady.

42
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,393
As did my parents.

43
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,510
And their parents before them.

44
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,190
They were fortunate
to live in a time of peace.

45
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,030
Before your king declared war
on sorcery.

46
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:44,910
I too have known Uther's cruelty.

47
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,288
Magic...

48
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:54,630
is not a crime.

49
00:05:58,462 --> 00:05:59,310
It's a gift.

50
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,350
I wish to walk free
and without fear.

51
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,910
The boy said you would understand.

52
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:11,590
What are you doing in Camelot?
You take a great risk in coming here.

53
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:13,950
We came to see you.

54
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,681
Are you sure about this?

55
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,870
Definitely.
I saw them with my own eyes.

56
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,230
- What were you doing there?
- I heard voices in my...

57
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,967
- In your?
- In my chambers.

58
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,724
I thought I should investigate.

59
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,757
Frankly, it's hard to believe.

60
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,112
For once, you've shown
some real initiative.

61
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,008
I will not stand by
and watch innocent people destroyed.

62
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,639
And I am not alone.

63
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:44,409
Many have already joined me.
Many more join every day.

64
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,990
This is a war you cannot win.

65
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,589
- Uther has an army at his disposal.
- It does not matter how many you are

66
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:51,870
if you wield
a weapon powerful enough.

67
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:54,722
When I was a child,

68
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:57,175
my parents told me of a crystal.

69
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:02,340
It was taken from the sorcerers
in the last days of the Great Purge.

70
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,510
Taken?

71
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:04,550
By Uther?

72
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,889
It is here...

73
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:07,510
in Camelot.

74
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:09,685
Locked in the vaults beneath us.

75
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:11,336
The vaults are impregnable.

76
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:12,670
You'd never get it out.

77
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,408
No, I could not.

78
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,052
But you could.

79
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,150
- Me?
- You are the king's ward.

80
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,479
No-one would suspect you.

81
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,430
You are our only hope.

82
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:48,110
What are you doing?

83
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,850
I'd reason to believe
there was an intruder in here.

84
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,636
Right now, the only intruder is you.

85
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:58,070
Camelot has been infiltrated.
Did you hear the warning bell?

86
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,070
Of course I did.
I was hoping I'd be safe in my chambers.

87
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,054
- Permit me to search the room?
- You'll do no such thing!

88
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,390
Did you really think that if someone
was in my room I wouldn't know?

89
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,310
Please accept my apologies.

90
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:26,568
I don't understand.

91
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:30,030
I'm sorry, Merlin.
Which bit didn't you understand?

92
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,750
The making a fool out of me
or making a fool out of yourself?

93
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,000
There was someone in there.

94
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,070
- I know there was.
- Word of advice, Merlin.

95
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,270
In the future,
stick to what you do best.

96
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:42,841
Nothing!

97
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,019
We owe you our lives, my lady.

98
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,731
You are safe for now.
Uther won't rest 'til he has killed you.

99
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:09,950
You will help us?

100
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:12,390
Please, Morgana.
We need you.

101
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:16,390
Yes. I will.
Of course I will.

102
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,670
- Late night?
- You could say that.

103
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,110
I hear there was a disturbance,
an intruder in the city.

104
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,936
Yeah, I heard talking...

105
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:37,830
in my head.

106
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,190
They had magic?

107
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,790
I recognised the voice.
It was Mordred.

108
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:46,430
The druid boy?
What's he doing here?

109
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:49,173
He was guiding someone
to Morgana's chamber.

110
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,750
You're sure?

111
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,605
- She and the boy had a kind of bond.
- Yeah, but this...

112
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,310
- is more than that.
- What do you mean?

113
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:01,430
What if they'd been caught?

114
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,313
Whatever they were doing,

115
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,974
they were prepared to die for it.

116
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,950
Merlin, I was looking for Arthur.

117
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,310
He's out training.

118
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,230
- Of course.
- He trains every day.

119
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,390
Same time, same place.

120
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:35,910
I just wanted to apologise
for last night.

121
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,286
Another time, perhaps?

122
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:45,830
I'm starving.

123
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:49,070
You know what they say.
Good food takes time to prepare.

124
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:54,190
And this taste sensation
took exactly how long?

125
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,150
Nearly five minutes.

126
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,168
Really? Five minutes.

127
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,350
You need that long, you see,
to let it thicken.

128
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,060
Thicken?

129
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:25,501
The Crystal of Neahtid.

130
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,292
The locks... are not damaged.

131
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,672
What does that tell you?

132
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,790
It tells me
that somebody stole my keys.

133
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:41,335
Was it precious this crystal?

134
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:43,740
Of course it was!
It wouldn't been down here otherwise.

135
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,710
Right.

136
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,498
Whoever it was they knew exactly
what they were looking for.

137
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:49,019
Apparently.

138
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,390
Apparently?
Is that all you've got to say?

139
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:54,070
Tell me, Merlin,

140
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,350
whose job is it to ensure
my chambers are locked at all times?

141
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,790
Whose job is it to ensure
that something like this never happens?

142
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:06,797
Sorry!

143
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,510
You're sorry?!

144
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:15,152
That's not good enough.

145
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,710
- Did they force their way in?
- No, Sire.

146
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,902
How did they gain
access to the vault?

147
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,350
- They stole the keys.
- How is that possible?!

148
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,350
Someone broke into my chambers.

149
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,030
This is a grievous loss.

150
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,910
The Crystal of Neahtid
was locked away for good reason.

151
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:39,030
- Why is it so important?
- It is an instrument of magic.

152
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:43,710
In the days of the Purge,
sorcerers died trying to protect it.

153
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,110
Whatever it is,
it's important to them.

154
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,175
I'll search the town.

155
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:51,878
Find out what I can.

156
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,612
This crystal cannot fall
into enemy hands.

157
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:58,265
Yes, Sire.

158
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,843
- Thank you.
- For what exactly?

159
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:13,051
Lying to my father
to save your worthless hide?

160
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:17,310
If you put me in that position again,
I'll clap you in irons myself.

161
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,670
You'd better hope
we find that crystal.

162
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,310
- Morgana stole the crystal?
- I'm certain of it.

163
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,390
I caught her in Arthur's chambers.

164
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,098
She must have taken his keys.

165
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,310
- Can you prove any of this?
- Not exactly, but...

166
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,630
But she did it.
I'd bet my life on it.

167
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,750
You go accusing the King's ward
without proof, that's you'd be doing.

168
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,230
I know. You're right.

169
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,470
It doesn't make sense.

170
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:52,310
Why would Morgana
steal such a thing?

171
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,230
Uther said
it's an instrument of magic.

172
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:57,390
There are many legends
about the crystal.

173
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,983
Is it some kind of weapon?

174
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:01,350
That I don't know.

175
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,070
- You've heard of it?
- Indeed.

176
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,270
The sorcerers of the past believed
it held the secret of time.

177
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,630
- What did they mean by that?
- I'm not sure.

178
00:15:09,144 --> 00:15:11,987
The crystal is an artefact
of the Old Religion.

179
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,856
There is only one
that could tell you more.

180
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,710
I need your help.

181
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:24,240
I am sure you do, young warlock.

182
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,981
But first you must honour
your promise.

183
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,310
I said I would set you free
and I will.

184
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,430
When?

185
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:34,417
When I know that Camelot is safe.

186
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:36,590
Please, trust me.

187
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,670
Why?

188
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:40,950
Because you don't have a choice.

189
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:43,768
What is it...

190
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,670
that you wish to know?

191
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:49,310
What is the Crystal of Neahtid?

192
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,658
To those who know how to use it,

193
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,990
the crystal holds great knowledge.

194
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,578
What kind of knowledge?

195
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,049
The knowledge of what is,
what has been

196
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,809
and what is yet to come.

197
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,110
Do you mean
it can show you the future?

198
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,470
Amongst other things, yes.

199
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:11,522
The crystal has been stolen.

200
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:12,712
By whom?

201
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:16,126
The Lady Morgana.

202
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,910
That witch does not have the power
to wield the crystal.

203
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:26,830
- Does the druid boy?
- Mordred?

204
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,624
It is possible. Why do you ask?

205
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:33,004
I believe that they are involved
in this together.

206
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:35,880
Once before I warned you
of the druid boy.

207
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,790
It is his destiny
to bring about Arthur's doom.

208
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:43,310
It may be that time is upon you.

209
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:44,715
What?

210
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:48,104
The ancient prophecies
speak of an alliance...

211
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,610
of Mordred and Morgana

212
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:54,030
united in evil.

213
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,132
But this union must be stopped...

214
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:01,815
whatever the cost.

215
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,010
- Thank you, Gwen. That'll be all.
- Nearly done.

216
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,310
- It's fine, Gwen. You can go.
- It won't take a moment.

217
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,902
I said you can go!

218
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,831
... My lady.

219
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,511
It is my hope,

220
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,514
that with time,

221
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,590
Mordred will master the crystal.

222
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,350
When he does,
we will strike Uther down.

223
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,990
Uther and all who serve him.

224
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,076
All who serve him?

225
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,470
If we are to win this war,
there can be no half measures.

226
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,258
I can see this troubles you.

227
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,026
Yes, it does.

228
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,750
We fight for our very survival.

229
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:25,916
As do you.

230
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:29,670
The boy, he told me you have magic.

231
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:35,510
You need not be afraid.

232
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:37,830
I know.

233
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:39,353
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:42,969
I have become so used
to concealing the truth.

235
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,070
Believe me,

236
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:47,710
I understand what that feels like.

237
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:51,178
Every day I must look Uther
in the eye knowing...

238
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:55,030
that if he were to discover
who I really am, he'd have me killed.

239
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,510
You have been very brave.

240
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:06,153
I don't want to be brave.

241
00:20:06,864 --> 00:20:08,190
I just want to be myself.

242
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:12,070
I don't want to be alone any more.

243
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,430
You are not alone.

244
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,098
You are here with us.

245
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,974
You need never be alone again.

246
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,662
I must be heading back.

247
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:37,399
The castle will be waking soon.

248
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:44,796
Farewell then...

249
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:47,990
my lady Morgana.

250
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,990
Where's Morgana?

251
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,755
She could not stay.

252
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:11,950
- Will we be seeing her again?
- Yes, Mordred.

253
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,451
You can be sure of that.

254
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:18,134
Nicely done.

255
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:22,902
- You played her well.
- It was not hard.

256
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,537
She is very beautiful, after all.

257
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,030
Alvarr has a fearsome reputation.

258
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,070
- You know of him?
- He is a sorcerer.

259
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,110
And he and his band of renegades
have threatened to overthrow the King.

260
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,670
- He sounded pretty determined.
- He is a fanatic.

261
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,190
And his supporters
follow him unthinkingly,

262
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:45,590
- blinded by his charisma.
- Well, it worked on Morgana.

263
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:47,804
So it would seem.

264
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,270
And the druid boy.

265
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:53,110
Alvarrthinks the boy can harness
the power of the crystal.

266
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,390
We can't let this happen, Merlin.

267
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,710
What can we do?

268
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:01,950
We can bend the truth a little.

269
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,830
You know the whereabouts of it?

270
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,990
I believe so.

271
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,110
I see.

272
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,110
How did you come
by this information?

273
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:14,173
In my capacity as physician
I have dealings with many people.

274
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:15,630
They hear things, Sire,

275
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:17,717
and they see things.

276
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,470
Last night,
I was confronted by one such man

277
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,750
who told me that the crystal
had been stolen by a band of renegades,

278
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:26,790
led by a man called Alvarr.

279
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:30,310
- Who exactly was this informant?
- I think...

280
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,984
it would be only fair
to protect their identity, Sire.

281
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:35,310
If news of their betrayal
reached the renegades,

282
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:37,390
it could indeed endanger their life.

283
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,723
Very well.

284
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:40,070
Where is Alvarr hiding?

285
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,910
He was last seen
in the Valley of Chemary, Sire.

286
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,649
Summon the guards, Arthur.
I want this investigated without delay.

287
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:48,790
Thank you, Gaius.

288
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:50,510
Once again, I'm in your debt.

289
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,797
You're not seriously thinking
of going on this mission?

290
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:00,103
No, I'm not thinking about it,
I am going on this mission.

291
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:01,911
But you're chasing a rumour.

292
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,002
True. But for now it's the only lead
we have to go on.

293
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:09,136
You'll be wasting your time,
I assure you.

294
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,950
- I never knew you cared.
- What?

295
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,030
I can look after myself, you know.

296
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,198
It's the combination of raw talent

297
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,950
and hard training makes me...

298
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:23,630
Yes, I know.
That makes you so utterly obnoxious.

299
00:23:57,544 --> 00:23:59,486
Gaius had better be right
about this.

300
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:11,625
What brings you here?

301
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:13,900
Arthur's been sent to capture
the crystal.

302
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:16,354
The Knights of Camelot
are almost upon us.

303
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,884
- How has this happened?
- I don't know.

304
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:21,967
I only know
that we've been betrayed.

305
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,887
- How much time do we have?
- An hour. Maybe two.

306
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,511
I cannot say for sure.

307
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:29,523
- Then we must be prepared for them.
- What can I do to help?

308
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:31,939
You can flee
while you still have the chance.

309
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,767
I am grateful
for all that you have done

310
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:37,135
but a battlefield
is no place for you.

311
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:51,364
I don't know why I bring you.

312
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:53,298
You spend the whole time terrified.

313
00:24:53,468 --> 00:24:55,154
- I am not terrified.
- Yes, you are.

314
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:57,310
- I can tell you are.
- No, you can't.

315
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,270
If not, you'd be talking rubbish.

316
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,270
Well, I am talking rubbish as usual!

317
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:02,870
I mean,

318
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,110
I am talking as usual.
So, clearly, I'm not scared.

319
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:19,990
- Where now?
- No idea.

320
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:22,930
I thought Gaius gave you directions.

321
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
He did.

322
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:27,485
He just didn't tell me
about this part.

323
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:35,080
Merlin, this is your fault.

324
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,212
<i>They're coming.</i>

325
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:44,431
<i>Warn the others.</i>

326
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,716
<i>Warn the others.</i>

327
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:51,150
<i>The crystal.
Warn the others.</i>

328
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,390
<i>They're coming.</i>

329
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,750
- The renegade camp...
- <i>They're coming! Hurry!</i>

330
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,870
That way.

331
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,852
- And you know this because?
- I know it because...

332
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:00,510
Because of...

333
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:03,545
I give up.

334
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,555
Because of this!

335
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,470
It's a footprint.
Who says it belongs to a renegade?

336
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:20,110
There's more.

337
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:34,361
Follow me.

338
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,910
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?

339
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,090
What are you doing?

340
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,954
Well, whoever was here,

341
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:27,750
they're not here any more.

342
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,350
Yes, they are.

343
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:35,110
Take cover!

344
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,269
Run, Mordred!

345
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,894
<i>I shall never forgive this, Emrys,</i>

346
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,910
<i>and I shall never forget.</i>

347
00:29:50,862 --> 00:29:52,270
- Give me the crystal.
- Why?

348
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,900
What use is it to you?

349
00:29:56,787 --> 00:30:00,070
You are a fool! How many lives
have been lost this day...

350
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,332
for what?

351
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:06,202
You cannot wield the crystal.

352
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:08,705
You do not have the power.

353
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,070
None of you do!

354
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:33,390
Check the horses
are fed and watered.

355
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:38,470
Sorry?

356
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:41,537
- Not the right answer.
- What?

357
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,359
Something on your mind, is there?

358
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:46,750
When we entered the camp,

359
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,870
it was a trap.
They knew we were coming.

360
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,030
- Yeah, so?
- How did they know?

361
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:54,910
Well, they're sorcerers,
aren't they?

362
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,950
Probably used magic or something.
I need you to guard this with your life.

363
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:00,510
Why me?

364
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:04,230
- I can't guard it while I'm asleep.
- Neither can I.

365
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,398
Who said anything
about you sleeping?

366
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,912
So you admit to stealing
the Crystal of Neahtid?

367
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:12,862
I do.

368
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,353
You admit to plotting
against your King?

369
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:20,030
I do.

370
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,670
And you acted alone?

371
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:27,230
You were not aided or abetted

372
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,151
by any citizen of Camelot?

373
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:33,344
I acted...

374
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:38,190
alone.

375
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,270
I find you guilty of treason.

376
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,598
You are an enemy of Camelot, Alvarr.

377
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:48,870
You are sentenced to death.

378
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,353
Then I die with honour.

379
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,390
To be an enemy of Camelot
is no crime.

380
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,466
Take him.

381
00:32:59,317 --> 00:33:00,771
You are the criminal.

382
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:40,350
How many more must you kill
before you are satisfied?

383
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,870
He was guilty.
He confessed his crimes.

384
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,910
- You heard him as well as I.
- His only crime was to defy you.

385
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,668
Why are you defending this man?

386
00:33:51,838 --> 00:33:53,390
He was a sworn foe of Camelot.

387
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,741
You know this.

388
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,470
Is it any wonder he wanted you dead?

389
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,732
You who have persecuted his kind,
day after day, year after year.

390
00:34:00,902 --> 00:34:02,710
I will hear no more of this,
Morgana.

391
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,786
Because you are an arrogant fool!

392
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,509
You are deaf and blind to the people
you profess to serve and protect.

393
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:11,350
- They will tolerate it no longer.
- I said "enough"!

394
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,301
They are rising up against you.

395
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,820
From this day forward,
I do not know you.

396
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,630
From this day forward, I disown you.

397
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,982
You will go to your chambers!

398
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:30,780
And you, Uther...

399
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,943
You will go to hell.

400
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,305
Is something interesting in there?

401
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,750
Sorry.

402
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:58,670
- What's the matter?
- It's the crystal.

403
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,811
It harbours a terrible power, Gaius.

404
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:04,506
But it's locked away now.
It can do no harm.

405
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:09,488
Unless the damage
has already been done.

406
00:35:10,613 --> 00:35:11,630
I held it.

407
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,397
I knew I shouldn't.
I knew no good would come of it but...

408
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,926
it compelled me to look.

409
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,799
I couldn't resist it.

410
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:25,741
I saw things.

411
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,073
Terrible things.

412
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:30,241
Then you've already paid the price.

413
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,921
What I saw has not yet come to pass.
And I am scared, Gaius. I am...

414
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,390
really scared

415
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,594
of what the future may hold.

416
00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:40,929
There is nothing on this Earth

417
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,421
that can know all possible futures.

418
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:47,230
- Even the crystal.
- But what I saw...

419
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:50,489
- It was so real.
- And it was real.

420
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,390
But it wasone reality.

421
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:57,990
The future is as yet unshaped.

422
00:36:01,104 --> 00:36:02,889
It is we that shape it.

423
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,749
It is you....

424
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,687
the decisions you make,

425
00:36:09,174 --> 00:36:10,602
the actions you take.

426
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:14,189
Remember that.

427
00:36:17,663 --> 00:36:19,746
Eat your soup before it gets cold.

428
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:40,070
Could I have my sleeping draught?

429
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:43,990
- I didn't think you needed it any more.
- Last night the nightmares returned.

430
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:53,058
Sleep well.

431
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,070
Please,
this is not an official visit.

432
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,676
I'd like to see the prisoner.

433
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:20,630
Sorry, my lady,
the prisoner is to see no-one.

434
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,310
- The King's orders.
- That doesn't apply to the King's ward!

435
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,670
Thank you.

436
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,483
This might help to ease
the long night ahead.

437
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:44,470
My lady.

438
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:46,310
I was not expecting you.

439
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:52,552
I have come to say goodbye.

440
00:37:52,722 --> 00:37:54,916
It was gracious of you
to think of me.

441
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,674
It will not be easy...

442
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,874
but you must prepare yourself
for what lies ahead.

443
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,537
I am prepared.

444
00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:09,762
I have done what I can
to ease your passage.

445
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:14,670
I could not ask for more.

446
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:20,110
Good luck.

447
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,349
My thoughts will be with you.

448
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,994
Thank you...

449
00:38:28,614 --> 00:38:29,622
my lady.

450
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:49,248
We've searched the citadel,
the town and every corner of Camelot.

451
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,418
- But he's gone.
- Yes, father.

452
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:52,390
How?

453
00:39:53,368 --> 00:39:55,070
How has he escaped?

454
00:39:56,057 --> 00:39:58,670
It appears
that the guards were drugged.

455
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,230
That means he had help.

456
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:01,550
Someone...

457
00:40:03,972 --> 00:40:05,270
here in Camelot.

458
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,573
I'm afraid it looks that way.

459
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:12,387
Let this be understood...

460
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:15,893
whoever has done this,

461
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,438
they have betrayed me.

462
00:40:19,891 --> 00:40:21,759
They have betrayed the Kingdom.

463
00:40:24,824 --> 00:40:27,055
If I ever discover who it was,

464
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:30,070
they will rue the day
they were born.

465
00:40:56,945 --> 00:40:58,944
<i>I'm waiting, Merlin!</i>

466
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,630
<i>You gave your word!</i>

467
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:05,710
<i>Now set me free!</i>

468
00:41:13,197 --> 00:41:15,070
When the fires of Idirsholas burn,

469
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,150
the Knights of Medhir
will ride again.

470
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:25,310
It must be the work of magic.

471
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:31,790
Camelot's end is nigh

472
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,550
and there's nothing
you can do about it.
