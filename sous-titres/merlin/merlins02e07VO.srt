00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:03,595
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:05,585
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,535
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:09,980
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,150
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:24,190
Did you see it?
The smoke, did you see it?!

7
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:27,590
- I saw nothing.
- Are you blind? You were right here!

8
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,950
It was magic!

9
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:32,255
There's sorcery here!

10
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:34,070
We must tell the king!

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,595
Wait!

12
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,910
<i>Arthur's Knights</i>

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,310
Merlin - 2x07
<i>The Witchfinder</i>

14
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:12,790
It was sorcery you saw,
you're certain?

15
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,190
Yes, Sire.

16
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,230
- And you swear this before your king?
- I swear it.

17
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:20,470
Perhaps your eyes deceived you.
A trick of the light.

18
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,350
The smoke was alive, I tell you.

19
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,590
I feared for my life.

20
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,350
I thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

21
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:29,470
Your loyalty will not go unrewarded.

22
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,215
Thank you, Sire.

23
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,555
It cannot continue.

24
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,655
I will hunt down
those responsible, Father.

25
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,630
I promise
they will not escape unpunished.

26
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,715
Stronger methods are called for.

27
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,710
Send for the witchfinder.

28
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:49,945
Sire,

29
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,950
is it necessary
to resort to such measures?

30
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,750
The witchfinder is a trusted ally.

31
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,270
His help will be invaluable.

32
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,630
Of course.

33
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,295
How many times, Merlin?

34
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:07,230
How many times must I drive it
into that thick skull of yours?

35
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:10,555
Your magic is a secret
to be guarded with your life.

36
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,875
- What were you thinking?
- I...

37
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:16,470
- I wasn't thinking.
- Well, think, boy, think!

38
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,750
- It was just a bit of fun.
- It was magic and it was seen.

39
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:22,835
- You're right... I'm sorry.
- You must hide the book.

40
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:25,630
Anything that can connect you
to sorcery in any way.

41
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:31,470
- What, now?
- Yes, now, Merlin.

42
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:34,255
The man that Uther has sent for...
I know him.

43
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:37,145
- The witchfinder?
- Some know him by that name.

44
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,275
I know him as Aredian.

45
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,750
He is a force to be reckoned with.

46
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,060
But I'm not a witch.
Look, no dress or anything...

47
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,835
I'll get the book.

48
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,165
I am expected.

49
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,055
Is that him?

50
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:38,475
What's that cage for?

51
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:40,910
It hardly bears thinking about.

52
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:50,305
- So where has he been all this time?
- In foreign lands.

53
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:52,305
Wherever the pursuit of sorcery
takes him.

54
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:56,035
- He does all this in your name?
- The witchfinder serves no-one.

55
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,710
- He is a law unto himself.
- Do you smell it?

56
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:06,390
Do you smell it, Uther?

57
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:07,755
Aredian...

58
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,825
It's all around us.
The foul stench of sorcery.

59
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,550
It's infected your great city
like a contagion.

60
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,465
I welcome you to Camelot, Aredian.

61
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,550
Thank you for making such haste
to be here.

62
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:22,150
Well, let's hope I am not too late.

63
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:25,915
For every hour counts
in the war against sorcery.

64
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:29,755
Unchecked,
it spreads like a disease.

65
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:31,950
It seeks out the young and the old,

66
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:34,550
the weak and the able,

67
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:36,785
the fair

68
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:39,030
and the foul of heart alike.

69
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,990
You have grown lazy, Uther.

70
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,735
You have grown idle.

71
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:47,390
Your once noble Camelot
is rotten to the core.

72
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:51,590
You stand on the brink
of dark oblivion.

73
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,270
I am at your disposal, Aredian.

74
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,530
The knights will aid you
in any way they can.

75
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,190
You must be Arthur.

76
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,110
I must be.

77
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,675
You are a great warrior.

78
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:08,345
The finest this kingdom
has ever known.

79
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,575
- Thank you.
- You won't be offended

80
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,510
when I say
that I shall have no need of you

81
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:14,185
or your knights.

82
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,535
The subtle craft of sorcery can only
be fought by yet subtler means.

83
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:21,455
Methods honed over decades of study.

84
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,025
Methods known only to myself.

85
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,070
We are grateful for your help.

86
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:29,155
Gratitude alone
can't keep a man alive.

87
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,345
You must put food in his belly.

88
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:33,830
I will pay your price, Aredian,
whatever it may be.

89
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:39,310
- I will bid you good night.
- Aredian?

90
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:42,115
When do you begin?

91
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:44,505
I have already begun.

92
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,095
Gaius, isn't it?

93
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:54,550
I never forget a face.

94
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,190
Nor I, Aredian.

95
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,815
A physician now, I hear.

96
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:03,070
You always did have
a thirst for knowledge.

97
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,670
- Scientific knowledge.
- Of course.

98
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:10,670
My assistant, Merlin.

99
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:15,030
May your investigations
prove fruitful, Aredian.

100
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,910
However, you'll have to excuse us,
we have work to do.

101
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,170
Naturally.

102
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:26,705
I have a few questions
I would like you to answer.

103
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,430
Please be at my chambers in an hour.

104
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,495
You are aware, then,

105
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,590
that sorcery has been practised
in the vicinity of Camelot?

106
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:52,605
Yes. I mean...

107
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:54,335
Apparently.

108
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:57,230
No, it cannot be denied.
There was a witness.

109
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,975
Yes, I know.

110
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,310
Did you also know that the woman
has named you as a witness?

111
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:04,035
But...

112
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,095
I have spoken to her.
She was quite clear on the matter.

113
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:11,430
But I wasn't a witness.

114
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,995
Sorry, perhaps I misheard.

115
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,470
Do you deny that you were present
at the time of the incident?

116
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:19,025
- No. I was there.
- So you saw it?

117
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:20,670
The horse conjured from the smoke?

118
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,535
I saw the smoke,

119
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:25,355
but it was only smoke.

120
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:29,070
- I saw nothing else.
- Are you saying that she lies?

121
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:32,029
No, I didn't say that.
I said I didn't see what she saw.

122
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:37,975
How can that be, I wonder? How can one
person see something and the other not?

123
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,390
I can't explain it.

124
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,105
I am at a loss
as to explain it myself.

125
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:50,950
Unless it was you
who performed the magic.

126
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,790
- It wasn't.
- Can you prove that it wasn't?

127
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,575
That will be all.

128
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:19,185
For now.

129
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:33,190
Speak. Do not be afraid.

130
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,270
I...

131
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,750
I was drawing water
from the well, Sire,

132
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,395
when I saw them.

133
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:43,235
Faces...

134
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,110
In the water, Sire.
Terrible faces...

135
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,990
Like

136
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,030
people who were drowned...

137
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,390
Screaming...

138
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,125
Screaming...

139
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,605
I haven't done anything, I promise.

140
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,270
Tell them what you saw.

141
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:01,995
A goblin.

142
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:05,985
Dancing on the coals,
it was dancing in the flames.

143
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:08,595
And it spoke, Sire...

144
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:11,405
My heart near stopped
for fear of it.

145
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:17,415
As you have heard, my Lord, the incident
in the woods was only the beginning.

146
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,755
There was a sorcerer, Sire,

147
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,410
in the square.

148
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,510
There were creatures
jumping right out of his mouth.

149
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:28,079
What manner of creature?

150
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:31,333
Toads, sire.

151
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:35,630
Great, green, slimy things
as big as your fist!

152
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:37,950
The sorcerer laughs in your face.

153
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:39,790
Even now, magic

154
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,070
flourishes
on the streets of Camelot.

155
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,470
I scarcely believe it.

156
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,670
Yet it is the truth, my Lord.

157
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,405
Fortunately, I have utilised
every facet of my craft

158
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:50,510
to bring this matter
to a swift resolution.

159
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:53,775
The sorcerer...

160
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:57,255
- You have a suspect?
- I do, my Lord.

161
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:01,025
I regret to say they stand among us
in this very room.

162
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,875
My methods are infallible.

163
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:09,510
My findings incontestable.

164
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,755
The facts point to one person
and one person alone.

165
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:20,430
The boy, Merlin.

166
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,950
You can't be serious.

167
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,185
This is outrageous!
You have no evidence!

168
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:34,488
The tools of magic
cannot be hidden from me.

169
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:39,155
I am certain that a search of the boy's
chamber will deliver us all we need.

170
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:47,390
I have nothing to hide from him.

171
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:50,150
Very well.
Guards, restrain the boy.

172
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,825
Let the search begin.

173
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:00,765
Careful, please!

174
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,230
That's my life's work!

175
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,190
Comb every inch.

176
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,270
The sorcerer
is a master of concealment.

177
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,310
There's nothing here, Aredian.

178
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:12,085
I'll be the judge of that.

179
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,910
Over there, behind this tapestry.

180
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,870
And there, upend that stool.

181
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,950
Be sure to check for hollow legs.

182
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,830
There, within those powder jars.

183
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,600
Here!

184
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,485
An amulet of enchantment.

185
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,955
Were you aware, physician,

186
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,550
that your assistant
kept instruments of sorcery?

187
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,215
Well, our work is done.

188
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,695
I must inform the king.

189
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:58,150
I know for certain

190
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,190
that that amulet
does not belong to Merlin.

191
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,775
Who does it belong to, then?

192
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,430
It belongs to me.

193
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:19,150
You're free to go.

194
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:28,670
- What's going on?
- Say nothing. Do nothing.

195
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:30,190
Promise me!

196
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:02,845
Gaius has served me
with unfailing dedication.

197
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,125
Without his knowledge,

198
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:07,470
his wisdom,
I would not be sitting here today.

199
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,335
You have shown
great faith in him, Sire.

200
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:13,085
Great faith indeed...

201
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:16,310
considering that he was known
to practise sorcery.

202
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:24,550
- You're mistaken.
- No, Arthur. He speaks the truth.

203
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,990
I am well aware of his past,

204
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,070
but I have every reason to believe
he has turned his back on sorcery.

205
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,825
- Until now.
- We don't know that.

206
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,365
This amulet you found

207
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:38,255
could just be a stupid mistake.

208
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:40,465
Or maybe he has fallen back
into old habits.

209
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,430
We must give him
the benefit of the doubt?

210
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:44,325
Why?

211
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:52,465
Anyway, there is a sure way
to establish his guilt.

212
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:55,590
I know your methods are effective,

213
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:59,550
but Gaius is an old man,
he could not withstand such...

214
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:02,305
treatment.

215
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:06,075
It is the only way
to rid your mind of doubt.

216
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:20,710
What time is it?

217
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:23,725
Time for you to confess.

218
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:35,190
The amulet was a relic
from the past,

219
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,735
a keepsake.

220
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:40,125
But such artefacts are banned on pain
of death, surely you must know this?

221
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:41,710
I was wrong to have kept it.

222
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,710
I am grievously sorry for it.

223
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:46,945
Well, that's a good start.

224
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:48,790
It's an excellent start.

225
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,055
But not nearly enough, I'm afraid.

226
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:54,390
- Aredian...
- Guards!

227
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:06,435
Was your conscience clear when you used
magic in the days of the Great Purge?

228
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:09,715
- I have not used magic for many years.
- Your assistant kept items of sorcery.

229
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,645
- It belongs to me.
- If someone else were to use magic...

230
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:15,615
If you're an enemy of this kingdom,
you're an enemy of your king.

231
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:17,350
My conscience is clear.

232
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:22,110
I'd like a drink of water, please.

233
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:24,295
And you shall have one.

234
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:26,145
When you have confessed.

235
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,030
Then I shall die of thirst, Aredian.

236
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:04,270
What is wrong, young warlock?
You look so pale.

237
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,115
I did a stupid thing.

238
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:08,935
A stupid, stupid thing!

239
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,229
And now Gaius
is going to die for it!

240
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,030
Gaius means nothing to me.

241
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:17,989
But he means a great deal to me!

242
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:22,675
Very well,
tell me what has happened.

243
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:27,105
A witchfinder has come.

244
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:31,785
He's arrested Gaius for sorcery,
but I am the sorcerer.

245
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,070
Yes, I suppose you are.

246
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:37,630
Well, I'm going to confess.
It's the only way to save him.

247
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,950
Then your stupidity continues.

248
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,215
I won't sacrifice a friend
to save myself!

249
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,230
Bravely spoken.

250
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,390
But Gaius is already doomed.

251
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:51,230
If you confess, the witchfinder
will just burn you both.

252
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:54,415
But it's my fault!
Don't you understand?

253
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,155
All too well, young warlock,

254
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:59,230
but understand this:

255
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:01,585
if you were to die,

256
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:05,670
you would endanger the lives
of all those that rely upon you.

257
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,493
There must be something I can do.

258
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,055
There must be.

259
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,975
Please, help me.

260
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:17,230
I see you are distressed by this.

261
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,885
But I cannot help you,

262
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,365
because

263
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,430
I do not know how to.

264
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:27,855
I can't just stand by

265
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:30,045
and watch Gaius die.

266
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:32,865
I can't!

267
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,545
I am sorry.

268
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:55,731
You're a traitor,
you're an imposter.

269
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,350
Sorcery is your only master.

270
00:18:57,978 --> 00:19:01,350
- I serve only my king.
- In what way have you served him?

271
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,571
You have lied to him,
broken his laws,

272
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,110
betrayed his trust.

273
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,319
I have saved his life,
I have treated his ward,

274
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:09,489
I have protected his only son!

275
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:12,310
You have treated his ward?

276
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,270
I have striven to help
all those in need.

277
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,550
It is a physician's duty to do so.

278
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,070
- The Lady Morgana?
- Among others.

279
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,430
For what malady
does she receive this treatment?

280
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,146
She suffers from nightmares.

281
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:35,190
I see.

282
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,254
But as I said, I feel it is my duty
to attend to the needs of...

283
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,750
You seem very keen
to change the subject, Gaius.

284
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,270
Perhaps
I should question her myself.

285
00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:23,950
There's no need to be concerned,
my lady, I won't detain you long.

286
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,235
There's just a small...

287
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:29,115
detail I wish to clarify.

288
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:33,637
Now, it is true, is it not,

289
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:36,670
that you have received treatment
for nightmares?

290
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,689
And it was Gaius,

291
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:43,310
the court physician,

292
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,090
who administered these treatments,
these potions?

293
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:52,274
I'm sorry, could you speak up?

294
00:20:58,626 --> 00:20:59,626
Thank you.

295
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,110
Now, you may go.

296
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,359
You don't happen to know
what was in these potions, I suppose?

297
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:15,535
Of course not.
You are not a physician, after all.

298
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,480
So, for all you know, these potions
could have been magical,

299
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:26,070
your dreams, the product
of an enchanted elixir?

300
00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:28,967
I had these dreams
before Gaius started treating me.

301
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:32,937
But have they got better or worse
since Gaius began treating you?

302
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:40,830
Worse.

303
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:43,407
As I thought.

304
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,601
Thank you.
You have been most helpful.

305
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,350
Are you prepared to confess?

306
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,110
I'd rather die first.

307
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:11,965
Good. And die you shall.

308
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:15,870
But not alone, I'm pleased to say
you shall have company.

309
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:18,816
What?

310
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:22,511
Merlin and the Lady Morgana
are to join you in the flames.

311
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:27,494
This is a trick.

312
00:22:28,403 --> 00:22:31,201
You have corrupted them, Gaius,
and they must answer to their king.

313
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:33,573
Unless...

314
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,310
Unless what?

315
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:40,110
Confess!

316
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:42,670
Confess!

317
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:56,870
I am a sorcerer, sire.

318
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:01,030
I am responsible
for conjuring the smoke.

319
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:05,190
I am guilty of practising magic
in Camelot.

320
00:23:05,965 --> 00:23:08,350
The goblin,
the faces in the well...

321
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,750
I am the sorcerer who conjured
the toad from his mouth.

322
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,150
You have betrayed me.

323
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:25,249
You have betrayed your friends.

324
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,540
But above all,
you have betrayed yourself.

325
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:34,750
By the laws of Camelot,
I must sentence you...

326
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:41,102
to death.

327
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:46,645
The sorcerer will be purged
of his magic by means of fire!

328
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,549
He shall be burned at the stake
tomorrow at dawn!

329
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,299
Bear witness and heed this lesson!

330
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:02,745
You are a liar!

331
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,144
- Guards!
- You are a liar!

332
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:08,089
I'll deal with this.

333
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:18,011
I know you're upset,
I know you're angry.

334
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:19,950
I'm not throwing you in jail.

335
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,640
Then what are you doing?

336
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:24,761
I'm breaking the law.

337
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:28,468
I give you a few minutes.

338
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:30,432
There was nothing I could do...

339
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,456
I know... I understand.

340
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:35,030
I can't believe it.

341
00:24:35,545 --> 00:24:38,064
- That Uther could do this to you.
- He had no choice.

342
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:39,829
Once Aredian had found the amulet...

343
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:43,069
- Didn't know you had such a thing.
- It isn't mine.

344
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:46,630
- Why did you say it was?
- I was trying to protect you.

345
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:55,270
- I don't know what to say.
- It's all right,

346
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,701
you don't have to say anything.

347
00:24:57,966 --> 00:24:58,966
Yeah, I do.

348
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,589
- The amulet isn't mine either.
- Then how did it get there?

349
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,470
Aredian.
There's no other explanation.

350
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,320
- But why?
- All that matters is

351
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,190
if I prove he planted it,
you're saved!

352
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,430
You must let this go.

353
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,029
You are falsely accused.
I have a chance to prove that.

354
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,149
- I must take that chance.
- No, you must not.

355
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:21,789
I don't understand.

356
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:24,728
Do you want to die?

357
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,389
But neither do I want you to die.

358
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,589
And die you surely will
if you get too close to Aredian.

359
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,709
He will trap you, Merlin,
he will manipulate you,

360
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,190
and without meaning to,
you will incriminate yourself...

361
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:39,910
You must let this go.

362
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:50,037
I must let you go?

363
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:58,390
To do otherwise would be
an act of suicide.

364
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:24,389
I hope you have found some relief,
now that your ordeal is over.

365
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,070
Your concern is touching, Aredian.

366
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,149
- Will you please get out of my sight?
- Of course.

367
00:26:33,198 --> 00:26:35,395
I just thought you'd want to hear
the news, that's all...

368
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:37,081
What news?

369
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,749
My investigations have begun.

370
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,391
Begun?

371
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,829
- You already extracted my confession.
- Indeed.

372
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,940
Which just leaves Merlin
and the Lady Morgana.

373
00:26:50,196 --> 00:26:51,896
But we struck a bargain!

374
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:55,845
I don't bargain with sorcerers.

375
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:23,549
He won't let go!

376
00:27:23,994 --> 00:27:26,189
- What happened?
- He's questioning Morgana again.

377
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:29,149
I'm worried, Merlin.
She's close to breaking point.

378
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:30,643
That's what he does.

379
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:33,558
Breaks you down. In the end,
you confess, guilty or not.

380
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:35,509
- What do you mean?
- Gaius was set up.

381
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:38,629
- Aredian planted that amulet.
- But why would he do such a thing?

382
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:42,509
Aredian is paid to catch sorcerers.
He doesn't care if someone is guilty.

383
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:45,389
Maybe he gets confessions by lying,
by planting evidence.

384
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,070
As long as he gets a confession,
he gets his money.

385
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:51,029
Even if this is true,
what can we do without proof?

386
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
Get some.

387
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:08,481
- This is hopeless.
- Keep looking.

388
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:10,550
We dunno
whether this flower means anything.

389
00:30:10,861 --> 00:30:13,360
No, we don't but it's all we've got.

390
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:19,436
Here.

391
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:20,909
Belladonna.

392
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:25,174
"For the alleviation of ulcers,
allergies, muscular inflammation..."

393
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,642
- This is hopeless.
- Wait, listen.

394
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:31,140
"Under certain conditions, a tincture
can produce hallucinations."

395
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:32,722
So?

396
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:38,869
Aredian's witnesses. It wasn't magic
they were seeing, it was visions.

397
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:41,270
It makes sense.

398
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,949
If he's faking the evidence...
But how can we prove it?

399
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,182
Aredian's too clever to have given
the tincture to them directly.

400
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:48,519
The witnesses.

401
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:52,589
- They must've got it from someone else.
- Could've been getting it from anyone.

402
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,878
Is there anything, anything at all
that these people had in common?

403
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,709
- They were all women.
- But that doesn't tell us anything.

404
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:01,605
Yes, it does!

405
00:31:01,788 --> 00:31:03,590
What's the one thing
only women would buy?

406
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,886
Things to make them look beautiful.

407
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:31,684
- Do you sell a tincture of belladonna?
- What's this all about?

408
00:31:31,854 --> 00:31:33,110
Please, it's important.

409
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,910
Well, I think
I've got some somewhere.

410
00:31:36,544 --> 00:31:39,256
But what you'd be wanting with eye drops
in the middle of the night,

411
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:41,171
I really don't want to know.

412
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:42,150
Eye drops?

413
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,909
Women use them to make their eyes
more beautiful.

414
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,749
- Where did you get this?
- Well, my usual suppliers.

415
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,814
- You didn't get it from someone else?
- Of course I'm sure.

416
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:55,390
Now, if it's all the same to you,
I'd like to get some sleep.

417
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,404
Aredian gave you the belladonna.

418
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:00,066
I don't know
what you're talking about.

419
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,229
But you know
Gaius will be executed tomorrow.

420
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:06,075
- That has nothing to do with me.
- That has everything to do with you.

421
00:32:06,245 --> 00:32:07,873
Aredian's witnesses saw visions.

422
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:10,190
Visions produced by
the belladonna in these eye drops.

423
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:14,418
If we can prove this,

424
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,290
we have a chance of saving Gaius.

425
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:25,028
He...

426
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:28,055
forced me to sell it.

427
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,591
He said he'd kill me
if I said anything to anyone.

428
00:32:31,912 --> 00:32:33,990
But it was him?
It was Aredian?

429
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,230
- It was him.
- Thank you.

430
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:48,784
- We've got everything we need.
- But is it enough?

431
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:51,110
We've got a witness as well,
surely that's enough.

432
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,990
- It's our word against Aredian's.
- We don't have a choice!

433
00:32:55,117 --> 00:32:57,469
By dawn tomorrow,
Gaius will be dead!

434
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,761
We got one chance.

435
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:00,869
We've got to give Uther
something he cannot deny,

436
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:04,178
something not even Aredian
can talk his way out of.

437
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,888
I'll be as quick as I can!

438
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:41,944
Come on, Merlin, come on...

439
00:35:09,897 --> 00:35:10,990
Good morning, Gaius.

440
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,102
Where have you been?

441
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:25,189
- Everything's in place.
- Gaius has already left the dungeons!

442
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,870
- Then we have to delay the execution!
- How?!

443
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:33,039
I'll speak to Arthur.

444
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,980
Leave Arthur to me.

445
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:10,038
Easy there!
Show him some respect!

446
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:28,586
You've got to stop this.

447
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:31,749
- You know I can't.
- Merlin has proof Gaius is innocent!

448
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,269
My father has passed sentence.
Nothing I can do.

449
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,029
You can do the right thing,
Arthur Pendragon!

450
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:41,109
You can show some faith in a friend,
or stand by and watch an innocent die.

451
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:43,509
You did it to my father.

452
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:46,498
Are you really willing
to let it happen again?

453
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,477
You can stop looking at me like that.
I know I'm only a servant.

454
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:53,466
I thought you were a prince.
So start behaving like one.

455
00:37:10,955 --> 00:37:12,230
Wait!

456
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:19,670
Sire, the witnesses saw
nothing but hallucinations...

457
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:26,704
induced by the belladonna
in these eye-drops.

458
00:37:30,825 --> 00:37:33,750
And you bought this belladonna
from this man?

459
00:37:35,845 --> 00:37:37,318
Where did you get it from?

460
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:41,811
Don't be afraid.
No harm will come to you here.

461
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,514
The witchfinder...

462
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,820
He gave them to me.

463
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,470
He tell you what it was for?

464
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,630
Only that if I did not sell it,
he'd have me burnt at the stake.

465
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,150
How do you answer?

466
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,207
They are absurd.

467
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:08,389
The boy has clearly concocted these lies
in the hope of saving his master.

468
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,438
You won't mind
if we search your chambers?

469
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:12,189
Silence! You have no authority.

470
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:13,159
Father?

471
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,700
Let's settle this once and for all.

472
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:22,189
If what Merlin says is wrong,

473
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:24,771
then he must bear the consequences.

474
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,970
But if there is some truth
in what he says...

475
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:36,555
I have nothing to hide.

476
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:44,613
- You're wasting your time.
- The cupboard over there.

477
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:01,384
These things don't belong to me!

478
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:05,025
This is a trick!

479
00:39:08,331 --> 00:39:11,087
That boy plots against me!

480
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:33,968
Sorcerer!

481
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,029
Think carefully.

482
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,509
You'll never escape
from Camelot alive.

483
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:47,012
I will if you value the life
of your ward.

484
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:27,203
I'm glad I found you here.

485
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:30,608
As am I, my lord.

486
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:33,589
I thought I would never see
these chambers again.

487
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,725
If anything was damaged
in the search,

488
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:42,789
- I will be only too glad to replace it.
- You're very kind, my lord.

489
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:47,629
I can still scarcely believe
that he was a sorcerer.

490
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:49,588
Indeed.

491
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,434
Was there some reason
you wished to see me?

492
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,468
I wanted to say,

493
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:06,109
I'm sorry if you suffered
at his hands.

494
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:09,507
But I did not suffer
at his hands, Uther.

495
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:12,522
I suffered at yours.
He worked for you, my lord.

496
00:41:12,692 --> 00:41:16,349
- He was merely following your orders.
- But I was deceived...

497
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,030
You were deceived long before Aredian,
for you deceived yourself.

498
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:24,469
You see foes where there are friends,
sorcerers where there are servants.

499
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:28,189
I am not the first to be wrongly accused
in your war against magic.

500
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,486
And not all have been as lucky as I.

501
00:41:33,806 --> 00:41:34,790
I assure you,

502
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:37,669
every measure will be taken

503
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,069
to ensure that nothing like this
will happen again.

504
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,180
I hope that is true.

505
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:46,282
For all our sakes.

506
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,670
Now, if you'll excuse me,

507
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,454
I have work to do.

508
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:17,898
What I don't understand
is how you knew

509
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,909
he'd concealed evidence
in his chamber.

510
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:21,869
Just a hunch.

511
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:24,126
And the toad?

512
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:28,990
I can't explain.

513
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,069
I can hardly explain it myself.
Unless, of course...

514
00:42:33,903 --> 00:42:35,253
you put it there.

515
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:40,004
Fair enough,

516
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:42,549
I'll never save your life again.

517
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,790
- Promise?
- Absolutely.

518
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:52,436
Honestly, Merlin,

519
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:54,309
the toad was a step too far.

520
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,140
I know, I know,

521
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:58,950
but you should have seen
the look on his face!

522
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,310
I'm Morgause.

523
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,268
You think Morgause knows the truth
about Arthur's birth?

524
00:43:15,438 --> 00:43:16,950
