1
00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:03,815
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:05,835
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,455
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:10,180
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,350
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:15,230
Quick, my potion.

7
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,990
Lady Catrina is not
all that she seems to be.

8
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:20,990
- She's a troll.
- She's not that bad!

9
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,550
Trolls are greedy, and Lady Catrina
is like the rest of her kind.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,630
- She lusts after wealth and power.
- Uther's wealth and power.

11
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:31,310
There's more than one way
to enchant a man.

12
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:33,150
I want you to have it.

13
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,310
I shall wear it always.

14
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:38,485
You may possess some magic, wretch,

15
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,790
but you are no match for me.

16
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,110
I now pronounce you to be

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,870
husband and wife.

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,310
<i>Arthur's Knights</i>

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,790
Merlin - 2x06
<i>Beauty and the Beast (2/2)</i>

20
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:24,275
You look positively

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,990
foul.

22
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:28,710
Does the enchantment hold?

23
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:30,535
It works a treat.

24
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:32,990
Uther is like a puppet on a string.

25
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:35,710
What about the boy?

26
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:37,915
He knows your secret.

27
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:39,110
Leave him to me.

28
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:45,275
My Lord.

29
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:49,005
Darling.

30
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,825
We are alone at last.

31
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,345
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

32
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,685
It's not you.
I want this more than anything.

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,270
This has been the happiest day
of my life.

34
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,830
Then what is it?

35
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:07,270
When I was forced to flee my home,

36
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:11,350
the one thing I was able to take with me
was my family seal.

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,350
You showed it to me
when you first arrived.

38
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,385
It's the only surviving link
I have to my father.

39
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:19,045
And now it's gone.

40
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,670
Stolen from my chambers.

41
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,095
Who could have done such a thing?
Oh, no, please.

42
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:27,955
I don't want to cause any trouble.

43
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,805
Not on a day
that should be filled with such joy.

44
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,190
Who took your seal?

45
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,155
It was Arthur's servant.

46
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:45,405
Search the stables.

47
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:46,975
You, check the kitchens.

48
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,030
Alert the guard on the South gate.

49
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,510
- What's in there?
- This way. Hurry up.

50
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:02,705
- Where's Merlin?
- Where he always is at this time.

51
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,125
Working for Arthur.

52
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:06,475
What's this about?

53
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,375
We've come to arrest him,

54
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:09,670
by order of the King.

55
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:15,510
You need to get out of here.
The King's ordered me to arrest you.

56
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,510
Catrina's accused you
of taking her seal.

57
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:20,110
- But I didn't.
- I don't want to know

58
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,055
and you haven't got time to explain.

59
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:24,190
If you value your life,
you'll leave Camelot now.

60
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:26,350
But she is a troll.

61
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,185
She's trying to set me up.

62
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:31,470
- We've been through this.
- I'm telling the truth.

63
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:34,735
I saw her.

64
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,670
I don't care. You need to leave.

65
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,030
- Sire?
- Go.

66
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,950
Go!

67
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:03,785
I fear he may have slipped
through our net.

68
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:05,710
You're very quick
to give up the chase.

69
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:09,190
That is because I know
my quarry is long gone.

70
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,585
- How can you be so certain?
- Well, despite appearances,

71
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,565
He isn't stupid. He must have got wind
that we were looking for him and left.

72
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:18,949
Outwitting your army in the process.

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,550
It appears so.

74
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,390
I thought your men aspired
to the same high standards

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,975
that my father instilled in you.

76
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,270
When I led the army, they did.

77
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,505
We don't even know if he's still
in Camelot. He could be anywhere.

78
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:35,225
And that's a good enough reason
to give up?

79
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:36,795
I'm not.

80
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:40,150
- I believe our resources would...
- I've heard enough of your excuses.

81
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:42,675
We both have.

82
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:45,190
I want the boy found.

83
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:46,955
Sire.

84
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:49,115
My Lady.

85
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:57,790
My plan to undermine Arthur
is under way.

86
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,880
Soon Uther will detest
the sight of his own son.

87
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,910
What's that, then?

88
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,230
What is that smell?

89
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:19,355
A treat.

90
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,430
To celebrate.

91
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,390
Fresh from the stables.

92
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,350
You do know how to treat a lady.

93
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,185
Alert the rest of the guard.
Come with me.

94
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:13,230
They've found Merlin's trail. They say
he's heading for the Northern Borders.

95
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:15,230
I'm sure he'll outrun them.

96
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:17,105
What if he can't?

97
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,745
- Uther won't show him any mercy.
- Try not to worry, Gwen.

98
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,430
That was comfortable.

99
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,430
A necessary evil, I'm afraid.

100
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:43,390
They've picked up the trail that we left
but it won't fool them for long.

101
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,590
- Then I'd better get busy.
- Be careful.

102
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:48,430
The guards are still
searching for you.

103
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,795
Mistress, it is time.

104
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,030
- Do I have to?
- You must keep up the pretence.

105
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,275
I hate being like this.

106
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,670
So clean. It's revolting.

107
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:21,435
I can't keep it up.

108
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:22,790
This skin,

109
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:24,270
this face.

110
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,350
I just want to claw it off.

111
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:29,430
Think of all the money
and the power.

112
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,875
Soon it will all be yours.

113
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:09,495
There is something important
that I...

114
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,110
We... wish you to address.

115
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:15,710
For too long,
the people have had it easy.

116
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,830
They've grown fat
off our indulgence of them.

117
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:18,925
How so?

118
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:23,030
We provide peace, protection, food.
They give us very little in return.

119
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,470
Our people are poor. They survive
on the few crops they're able to grow.

120
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,230
That's what they want us to think.

121
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:31,670
- It's what I see every day.
- We're introducing a new tax.

122
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,470
The people must pay for the sanctuary
that Camelot provides.

123
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,805
You can't.

124
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,990
The majority are barely able
to get by as it is.

125
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,190
Those who refuse to pay it will
be arrested and publicly flogged.

126
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,085
We've lived this way for years.

127
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:49,190
You've never suggested
anything like this before.

128
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,590
Maybe not to you,
but the King confided in me

129
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,750
that he has been considering this
for some time, haven't you?

130
00:08:58,885 --> 00:08:59,790
I have.

131
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:03,550
You are to begin the collections
at once.

132
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,355
I saw her drink some of this potion

133
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,805
and a patch of troll skin
on her arm disappeared.

134
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:14,008
It must be pretty powerful magic
to physically change her like that.

135
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:15,825
Could you make a potion

136
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:17,910
that looks and tastes
the same as this?

137
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,705
I don't know.
Yes, I suppose so.

138
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:24,275
But without the troll magic,
it wouldn't have the same effect.

139
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,555
Exactly.

140
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,550
If I can replace this potion
with one that isn't magical...

141
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,885
So Catrina will keep taking it,

142
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:35,870
- but it will no longer work.
- And she'll turn into a troll.

143
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:38,710
- Think you can do it?
- I don't know.

144
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,990
We have to make the switch
before morning or Jonas will notice.

145
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:43,805
Then it's going to be a long night.

146
00:10:58,585 --> 00:10:59,785
My Lady.

147
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,475
My Liege.

148
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:04,245
I brought you flowers.

149
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:06,435
Picked from the royal garden.

150
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:08,505
They're...

151
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,865
They're lovely.

152
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,395
Not as lovely as you.

153
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:15,950
Are you all right?

154
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,035
No. I'm sorry.

155
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,070
I can't keep this up any longer.

156
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,560
- Keep what up?
- The lie.

157
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,590
I can't keep pretending like this.

158
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,470
I'm beginning to wonder if you're really
the man I thought you were,

159
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,230
the man I fell in love with.

160
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,455
The man I married was firm,

161
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:38,015
strong,

162
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:39,910
in both mind and body.

163
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:43,510
Trust me, I am all of that,
and more.

164
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:47,150
I fear for Camelot.

165
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,945
Arthur has not taken
after his father.

166
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:53,475
He is too weak
to make the hard decisions.

167
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:58,355
Then it's lucky
I'm in such rude health.

168
00:11:58,525 --> 00:11:59,430
Lucky indeed.

169
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,950
But what if some tragedy
were to befall you?

170
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,470
Let me worry about Arthur.

171
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,830
No, I can't.

172
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:08,915
Your love for him
has made you blind to his faults.

173
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:11,015
I judge Arthur
the same as the rest of my men.

174
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:14,585
If he excels he is rewarded.
If he fails, he is punished.

175
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,250
Well...

176
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,955
as long as you're sure of that.

177
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:23,830
I am.

178
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:27,605
Now let me take your mind off this.

179
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,150
I promise our first night

180
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,470
as husband and wife

181
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:34,905
will be one to remember.

182
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,310
- What's in it?
- Nothing too potent.

183
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:03,150
- Rat's guts.
- Nice.

184
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,460
Toad paste.

185
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,070
- You take two toads, grind them up...
- I get the picture.

186
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,145
Horse dung,

187
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:12,110
- crushed sheep's eyeball.
- Lovely.

188
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,670
Pond scum, three wolf spiders,
and what potion isn't complete

189
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,270
without a dash of sheep's brain?

190
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,990
Sounds... delicious.

191
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,910
Good.
Because you're going to taste it.

192
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,750
No way.

193
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,550
It's completely harmless.

194
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,190
That is disgusting.

195
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,590
To you, but not to a troll.

196
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,015
I can't even believe
you let me put that in my mouth.

197
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:01,725
Now...

198
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:03,445
Try the original.

199
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,430
Just a small amount,
and be sure to spit it out.

200
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:18,630
- Does it taste roughly the same?
- Yes, it's horrible!

201
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,550
You sure? Because if there's too big
a difference, Catrina will notice.

202
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,390
It tastes exactly the same.

203
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,830
Let's hope she thinks so too.

204
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,755
- What do you think you're doing?
- He's refusing to pay the King's tax.

205
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,230
You ask for too much.

206
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,830
- I've given all I can.
- It's not enough.

207
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:17,950
Let me see.

208
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,430
- Release him.
- The King said...

209
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,750
Release him!

210
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,190
Give them back their money.
All of it.

211
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,675
- I gave you a direct order.
- People cannot afford to pay the tax.

212
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,430
Don't tell me you're naive enough
to take them at their word?

213
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,710
We have their loyalty,
their goodwill.

214
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,470
Do not forsake that
by making unreasonable demands.

215
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,390
Is it so unreasonable
for a king to expect

216
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,710
- his subjects to obey him?
- They'll starve.

217
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,310
Nonsense.

218
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:06,709
You've grown too soft.

219
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,110
Remember, these are your subjects,
not your friends.

220
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,550
Why can't they be both?

221
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,830
Because we rule the people,
not the other way round.

222
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:15,709
I think you're wrong.

223
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:18,670
I beg your pardon?

224
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,279
I said you're wrong.

225
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:22,125
Without the people,
there is no Camelot.

226
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,118
We're as much their servant
as they are ours.

227
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,830
You allow him to address you
in this manner?

228
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,090
I do not.

229
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:32,135
It will not be tolerated.
You will take your men

230
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:33,950
down into the town, and go

231
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,560
to every house
collecting the payments I demand!

232
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:40,910
I will not.

233
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,710
Get out of my sight.

234
00:17:58,485 --> 00:17:59,955
How can he do this to me?

235
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,175
My own son!

236
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:04,365
After all the sacrifices
I've made for him.

237
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:07,415
- You're tense.
- Is it any surprise?

238
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,190
The lack of respect he shows... me!

239
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,165
- I'm sorry. Did that hurt?
- No, of course not.

240
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:17,635
Your hands are surprisingly strong
for one so delicate.

241
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,615
Arthur carries a heavy burden.

242
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:24,645
It can't be easy holding all that
responsibility at such

243
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,135
a tender age.

244
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:28,795
I'm afraid
that's the way it has to be.

245
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:32,065
After all,
I cannot rule Camelot alone.

246
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:33,655
You don't have to.

247
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:35,795
You married me, remember?

248
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,335
How could I forget?

249
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,305
I'm sorry, I can't.

250
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,065
I'm too worried about you.

251
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:49,870
With Arthur letting you down
the way he has. How will you cope?

252
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:53,395
Like you said,
you can't rule Camelot alone.

253
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:55,585
I have you by my side.

254
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:59,190
I may be your Queen,
but I have no power.

255
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:00,435
Why not?

256
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,105
The people wouldn't respect me
as they do Arthur.

257
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:05,665
I'm not heir to the throne.

258
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:07,750
Would it put your mind at rest
if you were?

259
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:09,265
It would.

260
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:13,595
- It most definitely would.
- Then you shall be.

261
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:17,335
The ceremony will take place
this afternoon.

262
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:32,845
It's time for my potion.

263
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:39,670
Are your plans progressing
as you'd hoped?

264
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,750
And not a moment too soon.

265
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,375
I must admit, though,

266
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:07,075
that crown

267
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:09,135
will look rather fetching.

268
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:11,605
All that gold

269
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,765
and them lovely jewels.

270
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,590
Now, would you care
to accompany your Queen?

271
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,950
Come in.

272
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,270
I saw what you did earlier.

273
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:53,615
The people owe you
a debt of gratitude.

274
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,225
The people owe me nothing.

275
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:57,670
My father is still going
to impose the tax.

276
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:59,719
- Will he not be persuaded?
- Not by me.

277
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:02,070
- He can't stand the sight of me.
- That's not true.

278
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,415
- The King loves you.
- Have you heard how he spoke to me?

279
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:08,765
I'm sure he was angry
but you're still his son.

280
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,230
Everyone appreciates what you did.

281
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:14,185
They know you tried
and they won't forget that.

282
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:15,350
Maybe he's right.

283
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,790
One day I will be
the King of Camelot.

284
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:22,790
I cannot be a friend to the people
as well as their ruler.

285
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,270
That's not true and you'll prove it
when you become King.

286
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:28,270
You've a kind heart, Arthur.

287
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:30,430
Don't ever change.

288
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,255
Not for anyone.

289
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:36,710
The King has sent for you.

290
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,299
Father.

291
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,910
I'm relaxing your duties,
revoking your title.

292
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,894
- What?
- We live in dangerous times.

293
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:50,070
I cannot allow you
to undermine my authority.

294
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,030
You've always welcomed my counsel.

295
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,510
You stood against me
for all the people to see.

296
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:58,550
I'm sorry. Any future grievance
I have will be held in private.

297
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,710
Too late.

298
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,270
You are to be disinherited
with immediate effect.

299
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,750
You are no longer
Crown Prince of Camelot.

300
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,990
Sire, Arthur is your son,
you natural heir.

301
00:22:23,195 --> 00:22:26,670
You've taught me to be true to my heart
and that's all I've ever tried to do.

302
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:31,070
To be the man you wanted me to be,
someone you were proud to call your son.

303
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:39,710
My decision is final.

304
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:56,510
Queen Catrina will be named
as rightful heir to the throne.

305
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,173
Ceremony will begin forthwith.

306
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:17,510
We've done it.
Catrina's drank the fake potion.

307
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:22,470
What's wrong? What's happened?

308
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:27,270
Uther has disinherited Arthur...
and made Catrina his heir.

309
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:29,435
So if Uther dies,

310
00:23:30,183 --> 00:23:31,470
she will rule Camelot.

311
00:23:33,268 --> 00:23:35,390
We are gathered here to bear witness

312
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,861
to the naming of Queen Catrina

313
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:40,489
as the rightful heir to Camelot.

314
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,470
Are you willing to take the oath?

315
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,190
I am.

316
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,390
Do you solemnly swear to govern
the people of Camelot,

317
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,510
to uphold the laws and customs
of the land?

318
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:59,262
I... do.

319
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,630
Will you, to your power,

320
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,230
cause Law and Justice in Mercy,

321
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,510
to be executed
in all your judgements?

322
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:09,470
I will.

323
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:12,470
Will you,
to the utmost of your powers,

324
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,270
- maintain the laws...?
Yes.

325
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:17,990
I'm sorry, you must let me finish.

326
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:20,925
The wording must be
exactly right to be binding.

327
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,270
Well, get on with it then!
I mean really,

328
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,710
where did you dig up this old crone
from?

329
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,110
Right, get on with it.

330
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,190
Will you,
to the utmost of your powers...

331
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:37,190
- ... maintain the laws and customs...
- I will.

332
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,230
... of the land and serve
the people of Camelot?

333
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,630
Just shut up and give me the crown!

334
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,541
Will you just hurry up!

335
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:30,532
- Whatever's the matter?
- I'm sorry.

336
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:34,252
I don't know what came over me.
I just suddenly felt so hot.

337
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,430
I think I need to be on my own.

338
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:39,270
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

339
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,080
Really. Thank you.

340
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:47,710
Come on!

341
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,770
Open!

342
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:53,808
Let me.

343
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:58,350
What's that!?

344
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:04,990
What's up?

345
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:08,350
Somebody help her!

346
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,100
You're a troll!

347
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:27,350
How dare you speak
about her like that?

348
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,550
What is wrong with you?
Look at the state of her!

349
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,940
I don't believe it.

350
00:26:45,324 --> 00:26:47,206
She just ripped a door
off its hinges...

351
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:49,390
- Doesn't that tell you something?
- Enough!

352
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,850
She's a troll!

353
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:53,950
A giant, grey...

354
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,030
- Stinking.
- ... stinking troll.

355
00:26:57,005 --> 00:26:59,390
Stop it!
Haven't you hurt her feelings enough?

356
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,190
Insult my wife again,
it'll be the last thing you ever do.

357
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:18,508
I'm so sorry that you had to hear
those terrible things.

358
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,673
He's just taking time to adjust.

359
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:25,401
He'll soon get used
to having his stepmother around.

360
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,590
How could he compare
such beauty with a troll?

361
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,430
Search me.
I washed my face and everything.

362
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,200
What is it?

363
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:48,277
It's just your scent...
It's so...

364
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:51,470
fragrant.

365
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,270
It's mostly... dung.

366
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,390
Such a sense of humour.

367
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:03,668
I was so blessed
it was my castle you came to...

368
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:06,270
That I may look
upon this vision every day.

369
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,950
Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

370
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:12,950
I shall behold it.

371
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:43,950
I wasn't aware
we were due to convene the council.

372
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,390
What's this about?

373
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:50,464
Come on. Someone speak up.

374
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:55,929
I'm afraid it's your wife, Sire.

375
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:57,630
What about her?

376
00:29:00,992 --> 00:29:02,790
It's a rather delicate matter, Sire.

377
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,750
Gaius, you've been my trusted adviser
for many years.

378
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,963
You can speak as you will.

379
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,350
I don't suppose it's escaped your notice
but we just...

380
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,806
Just wanted to make
absolutely certain.

381
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:23,750
You do realise your wife
is a troll, Sire?

382
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:26,070
I beg your pardon.

383
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:29,270
At least that's the way she looks to us,
what with the...

384
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,070
warts, and the...

385
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:34,739
- nose...
- And the smell.

386
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:35,870
Smell?!

387
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,130
What...?

388
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,650
She also has what appears to be...

389
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,070
- a set of fangs.
- What?!

390
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:46,470
I wouldn't really say they were fangs...
More like tusks.

391
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:49,350
Yes, they are more like tusks.

392
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,110
Not that we're saying
that's a bad thing.

393
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,390
Thought I ought to point it out to you,
in case it had passed you by.

394
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:04,590
The next person to insult
Queen Catrina...

395
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,030
... will be charged with treason

396
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,590
and beheaded
according to the laws of the land.

397
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,990
Uther must be enchanted.
It's the only explanation.

398
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,250
- Which is why we must find a way.
- You won't find anything in your books.

399
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,682
Troll enchantments are too strong.

400
00:30:27,448 --> 00:30:29,398
Then what are we going to do?

401
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:32,004
You must speak to the Dragon.

402
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:34,552
If there's a way to break Catrina's
hold on Uther,

403
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:36,392
he will know it.

404
00:30:36,688 --> 00:30:37,856
But be careful.

405
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:41,276
Dragons and trolls
have been close allies in the past.

406
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,150
Is everything to your satisfaction?

407
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:04,510
This thing's got to go for a start.

408
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:08,099
It's made for midgets!

409
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:10,870
Too hard, too clean!
Not my taste at all.

410
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,110
What can I get you instead?

411
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:17,787
I was walking
through the grounds this morning

412
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:19,539
and I couldn't help but notice

413
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:22,459
that your stables
have just been mucked out.

414
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:27,201
It seems such a waste to throw away
all that lovely dung.

415
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:36,350
This isn't funny.

416
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,603
It is!

417
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:41,750
The thought of Uther
marrying a troll!

418
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:45,870
- Was it a very public affair?
- Public enough.

419
00:31:47,612 --> 00:31:48,710
Don't laugh.

420
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:52,095
If she can't be stopped,
Arthur won't become King.

421
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:54,065
Albion will never be born.

422
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,070
I'm sorry.

423
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:58,151
You are right, of course.

424
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:01,150
How can we break the enchantment?

425
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,150
These are not trifling tricks...

426
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:06,656
Troll magic is very powerful.

427
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:10,057
- There has to be a way.
- The only way you could break this

428
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:13,670
is if Uther were to cry
tears of true remorse.

429
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:18,830
- How do we make him do that?
- That I can't answer.

430
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,889
Uther's heart is cold as stone.

431
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:24,630
He's never been sorry for anything.

432
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:26,710
Thanks. I think.

433
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:29,390
Young warlock!

434
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:36,150
It was some time ago
you promised to set me free.

435
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,790
The help I give
is not unconditional.

436
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:03,070
That is for you.

437
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:06,590
Now, tell them about our plan,
beloved.

438
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,990
- Plan...
- We are introducing further taxes.

439
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:12,550
Sire, we can't.
The people have given all they can.

440
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,014
You told me that before.

441
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:17,030
And yet our coffer is full.

442
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,350
Your people
are already going hungry.

443
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:23,144
- Are you questioning my orders?
- It's just...

444
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,070
If we take more, they'll starve.

445
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,464
Who are you to tell me
what's best for my people?

446
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:32,270
You will collect more taxes
or you will lose your head.

447
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:37,190
Lose your head! Lose your head!

448
00:33:37,631 --> 00:33:41,350
I understand Bayard of Mercia wishes
to honour our marriage with a visit.

449
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:47,175
Good! Now, tell this Bayard
we expect gifts.

450
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:49,550
Lots of lovely shiny gold.

451
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,150
I think at this time,
it might be wise to...

452
00:33:55,156 --> 00:33:58,270
- to respectfully decline his visit.
- Whatever for?

453
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,487
I'm still not sure
that we can trust Bayard.

454
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:07,084
Nonsense he is a friend of Camelot.
You will send our reply.

455
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,190
- It'll be an honour to feast with him.
- Honour.

456
00:34:11,395 --> 00:34:14,029
The Dragon said he had to cry
tears of true remorse

457
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:17,424
- to break the enchantment.
- That's not going to be easy.

458
00:34:17,594 --> 00:34:19,190
Uther's heart is closed to everyone.

459
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:21,237
Not everyone.

460
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:29,150
Then there's only
one course of action we can take.

461
00:34:30,286 --> 00:34:32,488
Uther must see his son die.

462
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:50,126
Who's there?

463
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:56,029
- You're back.
- I never left.

464
00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:58,008
You mean to say...?

465
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:01,070
You've been under there
this whole time?

466
00:35:02,256 --> 00:35:04,288
- Course not. No.
- Because if you were...

467
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,910
I wasn't, I swear.

468
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,258
Your stepmother is a troll, then.

469
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:18,230
- If you say, "I told you so..."
- I wasn't going to. I wouldn't.

470
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:20,910
But if you had listened to me
earlier...

471
00:35:22,712 --> 00:35:23,590
Sorry.

472
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,533
Gaius and I believe
your father's been enchanted.

473
00:35:26,703 --> 00:35:29,653
Now we've found a way to break
the spell, but...

474
00:35:30,581 --> 00:35:31,830
we need your help.

475
00:35:33,946 --> 00:35:37,110
So your great plan is to kill me?

476
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,325
Not exactly.

477
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,568
Gaius has made a potion

478
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:49,488
that gives the appearance of death
without the actual dying bit.

479
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,682
It's fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

480
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,670
It'll only bring you
to the brink of death.

481
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:00,110
- Only to the brink.
- We haven't got a choice.

482
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,670
- We have to make your father cry.
- He doesn't care about me any more.

483
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,750
Nonsense.
That's Catrina's influence.

484
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:09,150
I've known your father
for many, many years.

485
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:13,125
There's never been anyone or anything
he's treasured more than you.

486
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:14,761
It's perfectly safe -

487
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:18,752
a single drop of the antidote
will reverse the effects immediately.

488
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:20,622
Antidote. What antidote?

489
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,790
- You didn't say anything about it.
- I didn't think it was important.

490
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:28,713
The potion will lower
your heart rate and breathing.

491
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,910
To all intents and purposes,
you will be dead.

492
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:34,070
The antidote reverses the effects?

493
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,640
If it's administered in time.

494
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:41,012
If it isn't?

495
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:43,590
You will be dead.

496
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:47,086
You just said it wasn't important!

497
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,550
I suppose it is a bit important.

498
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:52,068
Merlin will have the antidote.

499
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,310
Once I've administered the poison...
The potion...

500
00:36:55,837 --> 00:36:58,070
he'll have half an hour
to get it to you.

501
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:04,870
Don't be late.

502
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:06,358
Am I ever?

503
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:12,950
You sure you wanna go through this?

504
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:15,390
It's the only way to save Camelot.

505
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:57,593
Time to break the bad news to Uther.

506
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:47,310
My boy...

507
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,280
It was my fault.

508
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:08,307
I pushed you away.

509
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,050
My son.

510
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:26,176
Come away, there's nothing
you can do for him now.

511
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:29,110
I killed him.
I killed my only son.

512
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,070
What kind of trickery is this?

513
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:49,310
How I've suffered these last weeks.

514
00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:52,310
Allowing you to touch me,

515
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,780
having to share a bed with you.

516
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,190
- It's repulsive.
- I know the feeling.

517
00:40:00,991 --> 00:40:03,510
- I've been looking forward to this.
- Guards!

518
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,390
Seize... it!

519
00:40:36,038 --> 00:40:39,310
Is that any way to treat
your dear old stepmother?

520
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:41,526
I'd like to thank you

521
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:44,528
for exposing this attack
on our state.

522
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:47,830
Once again, magic was used
to strike at the heart of Camelot.

523
00:41:48,554 --> 00:41:50,104
You mean, your heart.

524
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,110
How many nights did you
share a bed with a troll?

525
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,350
Obviously, I was under its spell.

526
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,807
I did many things that I...

527
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,059
- regret.
- Father,

528
00:42:01,411 --> 00:42:02,870
I don't want to know the details.

529
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:16,030
I want you to know
that I never doubted you.

530
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,812
All right, maybe I did,
but it's your own fault.

531
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:22,710
You've got a suspicious look
about you. Shifty.

532
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,910
Like you've got something to hide.

533
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,353
- I'm an open book.
- Don't believe that for a second.

534
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:31,430
However, I know that without your help,
I'd still have a troll for a stepmother.

535
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,830
Thanks.

536
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,510
- What?
- Thought you were going for a hug.

537
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,790
It was sorcery you saw. You certain?

538
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,790
- Send for the witchfinder.
- Your once noble Camelot is rotten.

539
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,630
Can you prove that it wasn't you?

540
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,630
My methods are infallible,

541
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,910
my findings incontestable!

542
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,190
The facts point
to one person alone...

543
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,169
The boy!

544
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:26,150
- You're a liar!
- You've got to stop this.
