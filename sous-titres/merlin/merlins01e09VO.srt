00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,796
'In a land of myth and a time of magic,

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,890
the destiny of a great kingdom 

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,812
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,210
'His name...Merlin.'

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,420
Yehairamay wan knicht awak.

00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,910
Uther Pendragon!

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,463
Do you solemnly swear

10
00:00:57,463 --> 00:01:00,540
to govern the people of this kingdom and its dominions

11
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,236
according to the statutes, customs 

12
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:05,699
and laws laid down by your forebears?

13
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,333
I do, Sire.

14
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,760
Do you promise to exercise mercy

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,090
and justice in your deeds and judgments?

16
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,010
I do, Sire.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,770
And do you swear allegiance to Camelot now,

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,720
and for as long as you shall live?

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,370
I, Arthur Pendragon, do pledge life and limb to your service

20
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,630
and to the protection of this kingdom and its peoples.

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:40,450
Now being of age and heir apparent, from henceforth,

22
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,120
you shall be Crown Prince of Camelot.

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,470
So how does it feel to be servant to the Crown Prince of Camelot

24
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,670
Washing his royal socks will be even more of a privilege.

25
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,450
You're proud of him, really!Even if you???

26
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,169
I am not.        

27
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:05,889
You are. I can see it in your face.

28
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,410
Those socks are clean! Of course I'm proud of them.

29
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,260
What in the devil's name?

30
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:08,590
I, Sir Owain, accept your challenge.

31
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,500
Single combat. Noon tomorrow. To the death.

32
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:37,697


33
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:45,673


34
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:52,367


35
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,289


36
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,930
Have you ever seen this Black Knight before?

37
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,160
I don't believe so.

38
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,540
You didn't recognise his crest?        Crest?

39
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,810
Which house is it?        I'm not sure.

40
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,850
I didn't see it clearly.

41
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,790
But he's not someone you'd forget in a hurry.isn't it

42
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,930
no

43
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,270
So you don't think he's from around here?

44
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,280
That would seem likely.        Then what's he doing here?

45
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,852
Your faith in my all-seeing-knowledge is both touching 

46
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:32,878
and wholly misplaced.Maybe if you've finished your work,

47
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,430
you could go to bed and leave me to finish mine.

48
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,430
OK, I'm going.

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,539
Gaius?

50
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,890
Merlin.

51
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,100
Do you think Owain can beat him?

52
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,160
We will find out soon enough.

53
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,000
He shouldn't have picked it up!        So put an end to it.

54
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,710
The challenge has been taken up. It cannot be stopped.

55
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,710
Then fight in his place.        I can't!

56
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,490
Why not?        Owain picked up the gauntlet.

57
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,020
Owain is the one who must fight. That is the Knight's Code.

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,740
He knew that.

59
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,320
But it's a fight to the death.

60
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,840
I know.

61
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,850
Gaius. Thank God.

62
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,570
You know why I'm here?        The Black Knight.

63
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,540
So it is he?

64
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,180
You saw his crest?        Have you confirmed it?

65
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,190
It is the crest of Tristan de Bois.

66
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,660
And he's the only knight ever to have carried such a crest?

67
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,550
Yes. According to the records.

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,710
Yes?

69
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,730
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sire.

70
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,280
What is it?

71
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,630
The knight,

72
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,390
the stranger.

73
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
He bears the crest of Tristan de Bois.

74
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,877
Yes.

75
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,180
But he's been dead for 20 years.

76
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,650
I know.

77
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,380
I killed him.

78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,190
Then how do you explain...?        Dead men do not return.

79
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,020
You've never fought in mortal combat before. It's different.

80
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,340
It's not like the training.        Yeah, I know.

81
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,570
Listen to me. The problem is, we've never seen him fight.

82
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,334
You have to get the measure of him.        

83
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:53,731
But I have the same advantage.

84
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:55,570
He's never seen me fight.

85
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,160
True.

86
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,930
You've watched me.        Yes.

87
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,620
And        I know no-one braver.

88
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,380
Remember, all it takes to kill a man is one well-aimed blow.

89
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,230
The Lady Morgana asked me to give you this token.

90
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,710
She wishes you to wear it for luck.

91
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,170
You can thank her,

92
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,930
and tell her I shall wear it with pride,

93
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,670
but I won't need luck.

94
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,041
Now remember, 

95
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,960
find the flow of the fight and try to control it.

96
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,450
The fight shall be to the knight's rules.

97
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,310
To the death.

98
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,280
Let battle commence.

99
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,240
Come on, Owain!

100
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,760
One well-aimed blow!

101
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,290
Yes!

102
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,960
Who will take up my challenge?

103
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,120
I, Sir Pellinor, take up the challenge.

104
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,500
So be it.

105
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,170
Should we tend to his wounds?

106
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,630
He took a hit.

107
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,080
Owain didn't land a blow.

108
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,470
The sword definitely pierced him.        Are you sure?

109
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,300
My eyes are quicker than yours.

110
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,830
He should be dead.

111
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,810
Perhaps he already is.

112
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,009
Why did you stop me?        

113
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,042
I have to give our knights to prove themselves.

114
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,450
Have you seen how this stranger fights?!

115
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,138
And Sir Pellinor is more than a match for him.

116
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:06,702
He's not recovered from the wounds he suffered at Othanden.

117
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,800
I can't help that.        So you send him to his death?

118
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,150
It was his choice to take up the gauntlet.

119
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,780
I am not to blame.

120
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,730
Are you sure we should be doing this?

121
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,970
You're not scared, are you?

122
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,070
No, I love old crypts. I wouldn't be seen dead anywhere else.

123
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,790
Must've been a gust of wind.

124
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,170
We should've brought a torch.

125
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,930
Leoc morla.

126
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,630
Huh? Handy!

127
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,730
Yes.

128
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,410
What are we looking for?

129
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,750
Bring your torch over here.

130
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,810
We're breaking into someone's grave?

131
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,720
We're too late.

132
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,630
I think someone has already broken out.

133
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,260
Tristan de Bois was the brother of Ygraine. Uther's wife.

134
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,440
Arthur's mother?

135
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,440
Ygraine died in childbirth.

136
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,386
He blamed Uther 

137
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:11,510
and came to the gates of Camelot and challenged him.

138
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,660
To single combat?

139
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,607
Uther won. But in his dying breath,

140
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:19,320
Tristan cursed Camelot to one day suffer his return.

141
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,620
I thought it was the ramblings of a dying man.

142
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,288
Men don't just rise up from the dead though, 

143
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:25,566
no matter how angry they are.

144
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,240
It's my guess we're dealing with a wraith.

145
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,810
A wraith?

146
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
The spirit of a dead man conjured from the grave.

147
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,400
So this is the work of a sorcerer?

148
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,448
Powerful magic can harness a grieving, rage and demented soul 

149
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:41,482
and make it live again.

150
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,050
How do we stop it?

151
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,782
We can't. Because it's not alive, 

152
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:46,332
no mortal weapon can kill it.

153
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,620
There must be something.

154
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,030
Nothing can stop it until it has achieved what it came for.

155
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,090
What's that?

156
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,720
Revenge.

157
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,970
On Camelot?

158
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,910
What does that mean for Sir Pellinor?

159
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,280
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.

160
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,190
Maybe you were wrong.

161
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,470
I hope so.

162
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,200
The sword went in, I'm sure.        I saw too.

163
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,730
I, Arthur Pendragon, challenge you.

164
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,040
So be it.

165
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,700
Single combat.

166
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,590
Noon tomorrow.

167
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,970
How could you be so stupid? I will revoke the challenge.

168
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,150
The Knight's Code must be upheld. That's what you told me.

169
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,950
This is different.

170
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,305
Once the challenge is laid down...        

171
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,052
You are Crown Prince.

172
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,640
There cannot be one rule for me and one for all the rest.

173
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,740
I forbid you to fight.

174
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,550
You want me to prove I'm worthy of the throne.

175
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,270
I cannot do that by being a coward.

176
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,710
No, Arthur, this will be your death!

177
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,200
I'm sorry you have so little faith in me, Father.

178
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,860
Arthur!

179
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,070
You were right.

180
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,170
I wish I wasn't.

181
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,990
Arthur will die.

182
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,708
He is Camelot's strongest warrior. 

183
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,470
If anyone can defeat it, he can.

184
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,000
You said yourself, no mortal weapon can kill it.

185
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,670
We have to find a way to defeat the wraith ourselves.

186
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,917
How do you propose to do that?        

187
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,466
If no mortal sword will kill it...

188
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,540
..then I will.

189
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,010
With mortal magic.

190
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,640
It's too dangerous.        We don't have a choice.

191
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,420
Good evening, Sire.        Gaius.

192
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,860
There is a matter of great urgency which I must discuss with you

193
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,460
Then spit it out.

194
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,370
Tristan's tomb is empty.

195
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,630
I believe he has been conjured from the dead.

196
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,840
How is this possible?

197
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,390
I believe he's a wraith. 

198
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,352
A spirit?

199
00:15:57,352 --> 00:16:00,466
He's come to take Revenge for Ygraine's death

200
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:02,740
It was magic that killed her, not I.

201
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,220
Nevertheless, it was you he blamed.

202
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,270
You cannot allow Arthur to fight.

203
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,550
No weapon forged by man can kill a wraith.

204
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,685
It will stop at nothing 

205
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,882
until it has accomplished what it came for.

206
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:18,480
Arthur cannot win, he will die.

207
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,970
He will not listen to me.

208
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,310
Then you must tell him who the knight is.

209
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,006
No.        

210
00:16:24,353 --> 00:16:25,987
You cannot hide the truth forever.

211
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,650
I am the King!

212
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,110
You will not tell me what I can and cannot do!

213
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,120
That is your choice, Sire. You tell him,

214
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,770
or let him go to his death.

215
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,313
No-one but you or I 

216
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:42,922
will ever know the secret of Arthur's birth.

217
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,620
The boy is of age, he should know.

218
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,830
Never!

219
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,110
You made an oath.

220
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,960
I warn you not to break it.

221
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,580
Very well, Sire.

222
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,890
Leave me.

223
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,820
Cume hay forbearnar.

224
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,920
Merlin, you know that conversation we had about knocking...

225
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,240
You have to pull out.        And why's that?

226
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,320
Because he'll kill you.

227
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,820
Why does everybody think that?        Because they're right.

228
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,550
Just pull out. You're the crown prince.

229
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,760
No-one wants to see you die over some stupid challenge.

230
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,470
I am not a coward.        I know that.

231
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,180
I've watched you overcome every fear you've ever faced.

232
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,352
That's what's required.        

233
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:39,616
You are more than that,you're not nearly a mere warrior.

234
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:43,150
You're a prince, a future king. You've proved your courage,

235
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,740
but you must prove your wisdom.        I'm not backing down.

236
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,290
Arthur, listen to me. This is no ordinary knight.

237
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,910
Look at him. He doesn't eat, he doesn't sleep.

238
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,740
He just stands there in complete silence.

239
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,510
Doesn't that tell you something?

240
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,830
No-one is unbeatable.

241
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,646
If you fight him, you will die.        

242
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:04,005
I'm not listening to this.

243
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:05,380
I'm trying to warn you, Arthur.        

244
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,335
And I'm trying to warn you, Merlin!

245
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,940
I should've known.

246
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,110
It is more than I had hoped for, Uther.

247
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,782
Soon Arthur will be slain. 

248
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:37,487
You will have sent him to his death.

249
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:40,780
Haven't you tired of revenge?        Haven't you?

250
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,318
You began this war when you threw me from the court

251
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,086
and slaughter all of my kind

252
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:48,790
You brought it on yourselves. You practised evil.

253
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,630
I was your friend, Uther! You welcomed me here.

254
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,110
You betrayed that friendship.        I did as you asked!

255
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,360
I used the magic you so despise

256
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,850
to give your barren wife the son you craved.

257
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,760
Don't ever speak of her in that way!

258
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,190
She was my heart,

259
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,030
my soul.

260
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,700
And you took her from me.

261
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,190
She died giving birth to your son.

262
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,050
It was not my choice.

263
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,470
That is the law of magic.

264
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,550
To create a life, there was a death.

265
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,260
The balance of the world had to be repaid.

266
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,090
You knew it would kill her!        No, you're wrong.

267
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,150
If I had foreseen her death,

268
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,940
and the terrible retribution you would seek...

269
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,150
..I would never have granted your wish.

270
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,840
I wish you hadn't.

271
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,150
You wish you didn't have a son?

272
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,270
Well, your wish will come true tomorrow.

273
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,420
I will not let you take him.

274
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,802
I have watched so many people I love die at your hands, 

275
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,329
Uther Pendragon

276
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,610
Now it is your turn.

277
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,770
How did you get in here?

278
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,030
The door was open.        No, I locked it.

279
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,260
Someone else must've opened it.

280
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,230
And you thought you'd come in and help yourself?

281
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,040
I was looking for a book.

282
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,010
For Gaius. He thinks the Black Knight is a wraith.

283
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,080
Then Arthur is in grave peril.

284
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,910
Which is why I'm here. I need to find a weapon

285
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,740
that will kill something that's already dead.

286
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,460
I have read of such things in the ancient chronicles.

287
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,690
Really? What did they say?

288
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,280
Several fables speak of ancient swords...

289
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,620
That can kill the dead?

290
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,957
The swords the fables speak could destroy anything, 

291
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:53,102
alive or dead.

292
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:54,900
Can you show me one of these fables?

293
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,290
Well, let me think. Yes.

294
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,480
i'm sort if hurry

295
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,930
Yes, you young people always are.

296
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,630
This is the Chronicle of Beltain.

297
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,600
Now then... Ah, here we are.

298
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,500
Sir Marhaus looked upon the great sword,

299
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,250
begotten in the dragon's breath and found it passing good.

300
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,390
What did you say?        Sir Marhaus...

301
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,770
No, no, no. Not about him. The dragon.

302
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,330
The great sword begotten in the dragon's breath

303
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,250
and found it passing good.

304
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,349
Merlin. What're you doing here?

305
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:48,228
I come to ask a favor        Yes?

306
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:50,300
I'm not sure how to ask it.

307
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,610
Ask, Merlin. You know I'd grant you anything.

308
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,020
I mean, not anything.

309
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,100
Obviously, not anything.

310
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,920
What is it you want?

311
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,170
I...I've come to ask for a sword.

312
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,540
The strongest your father's ever made.

313
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,690
What for?

314
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,780
To save Arthur.

315
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,040
I don't want you to fight tomorrow.

316
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,260
You're worried about me?

317
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,800
I don't know what it is.

318
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,570
Please, I'm begging you.

319
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,570
I have to do this.

320
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,820
It's my duty.

321
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:46,490
I understand.

322
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,970
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:08,520
You knew that this business would come back to haunt me.

324
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,733
Not quite so literally.

325
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:12,170
I should've listened to you.

326
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:15,024
You said that no good would come of 

327
00:24:15,024 --> 00:24:17,448
using witchcraft at Arthur's birth.

328
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,210
You wanted an heir. You thought it was the only way.

329
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,260
Nimueh told me there would be a price.

330
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,580
You weren't to know that that price would be Ygraine's life.

331
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,826
I cannot let Arthur die.        

332
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:32,410
Then you must stop the fight.

333
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:34,360
No, I will take his place.

334
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,180
Do you know what you're saying?

335
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,500
Ygraine gave up her life for him.

336
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,440
So must I.        Uther...

337
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,120
I have no other choice.

338
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,820
There must be another way.

339
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,580
My death will stop the wraith and Arthur will live.

340
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:53,282
and it means you're the only person left 

341
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:56,299
who knows the truth about Arthur's birth.

342
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,900
I want you to swear to me that you will keep your oath.

343
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,925
i'll take it to my grave

344
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,580
You've always been a good friend,despite my temper.

345
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,810
I always thought that would be the death of you.

346
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,690
I have one other favour to ask.

347
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,270
My father's been saving this.

348
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,370
He's always said it was the best sword he's ever made.

349
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,030
It's perfect.

350
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,060
He'll kill me if he finds I've taken it.

351
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,370
He'll understand.

352
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,740
You did it for Arthur.

353
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,220
I knew you were proud of him really.

354
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,660
Merlin!

355
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,990
Do you know why I'm here?

356
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,540
It may surprise you, Merlin,

357
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,370
but my knowledge of your life is not universal.

358
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,390
It's to do with Arthur. His life's in danger.

359
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,270
He will die, 

360
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,993
unless I can make a weapon that will kill the dead.

361
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,500
So what do you come to ask of me?

362
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,680
Will you burnish it, to save Arthur?

363
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,470
The dead do not return without reason.

364
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,830
Who has he come for?        Uther.

365
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,060
Then let him take his vengeance 

366
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,638
and the wraith will die without my aid.

367
00:26:59,638 --> 00:27:03,030
But it's Arthur who's going to fight him. You have to save him.

368
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,990
That is your destiny, young warlock, not mine.

369
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,480
But if Arthur fights the wraith and dies, 

370
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:10,541
Camelot will have no heir.

371
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,580
I will have no destiny.

372
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:19,314
A weapon forged with my assistance will have great power.

373
00:27:19,314 --> 00:27:20,294
I know.

374
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:23,770
You do not know. You can only guess.

375
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,990
You have not seen what I have seen.

376
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,950
If you had, perhaps you would not ask this of me.

377
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,330
What do you mean?

378
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,140
In the wrong hands, this sword could do great evil.

379
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,498
It must be wielded by Arthur and him alone.

380
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:41,510
I understand.

381
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,910
You must do more than understand.

382
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,920
You must promise.

383
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,680
I promise.

384
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,310
Heed my words.

385
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,070
The sword was forged for Arthur,

386
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,180
and him alone.

387
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,250
I've brought you something to help you sleep.

388
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,920
I'm fine. I don't need it.

389
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,070
Here.

390
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,370
It'll relax you,

391
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,970
take the edge off your nerves.

392
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,880
I wouldn't drink it for pleasure.

393
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,010
Why don't you sit down for a moment?

394
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:26,840
Mind you, if you...

395
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,130
forget about the taste, the after effect is...

396
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,640
quite pleasurable.

397
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,840
Just lie back.

398
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,240
That's a fine blade.

399
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,800
It's for Arthur.        He won't be needing it today.

400
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,170
I will be taking Arthur's place.

401
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,580
But Sire...

402
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,350
Prepare me for battle.

403
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,090
Arthur should fight.

404
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,850
The grievance was with me, the fight is mine.

405
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,740
I don't have your armour.        That will do.

406
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,140
It's likely to make little difference.

407
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,400
I'll get you your sword.        This one will be fine.

408
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,790
No, Sire. You don't understand.

409
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,830
That one was made specifically for Arthur.

410
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,500
Who made it?

411
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,790
Um, er, Tom, the blacksmith.

412
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,070
It's worthy of a King.

413
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,870
You would be better off with a sword you trusted.

414
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,730
No. It has almost perfect balance.

415
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,367
Tom is not the Royal Swordsmith. 

416
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:39,025
I'm surprised Arthur went to him.

417
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,690
That was me.

418
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,100
I felt he needed a better sword.

419
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,870
You show him the most extraordinary loyalty.

420
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,670
That is my job, Sire.

421
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,590
But beyond the line of duty.

422
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,140
Well...

423
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,320
You could say...

424
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,770
..there is a bond between us.

425
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,520
I'm glad.

426
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,430
Look after him.

427
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,500
You can have what you came for.

428
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,700
The father, not the son.

429
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,610
I thought you said a wraith couldn't be killed.

430
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,450
Yes, it was remarkable.

431
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,050
Is that a new sword, Sire?

432
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,530
It's the best I've ever fought with.

433
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,060
May I have a look?

434
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,050
I was intrigued by those markings.

435
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,180
On one side it says, "Take me up,"

436
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,180
and on the other, "Cast me away."

437
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,350
What does that mean?        

438
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:01,367
May I ask who made it, Sire?

439
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:04,261
Merlin gave it me. It was forged for Arthur.

440
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,030
That should heal pretty quickly. I'll re-dress it tomorrow.

441
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,150
Thank you, Gaius. Thank you for everything.

442
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,390
You had Gaius drug me.

443
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,820
I was meant to fight him!        No, you weren't.

444
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,030
But the Knight's Code...        Be damned!

445
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:28,082
I believed you would die. 

446
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:31,400
And that was a risk I could not take.You are too precious to me

447
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,880
You mean more to me than anything I know,

448
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,802
more than this entire kingdom, 

449
00:37:36,802 --> 00:37:38,898
and certainly more than my own life.

450
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:44,100
I've always thought that...        What?

451
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,670
That...I was a big disappointment to you.

452
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,490
Well, that is my fault, and not yours.

453
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,150
You are my only son.

454
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,810
And I wouldn't wish for another.

455
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,750
I heard you fought pretty well.        Thanks.

456
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,790
You should join us for training.

457
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,940
Sort out your footwork.

458
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,560
I'll show you footwork.

459
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,660
You know why I'm looking at you.        No.

460
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,970
Uther told me you provided him with his sword today.

461
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,080
It must have been a very powerful blade to slay the dead.

462
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,400
Did you enchant it?        No...I didn't.

463
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,170
Who did then?

464
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,360
Wasn't me.

465
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,590
Shame.

466
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,530
It saved the King's life, I'd have been very proud of you.

467
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,930
Well...        Never mind.

468
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,400
'Merlin!

469
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,950
'Merlin...

470
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,680
'Merlin!'

471
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,330
So, does Arthur live?

472
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,950
Yes, the sword worked. It was incredible, amazing.

473
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,540
As I promised.        But...

474
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,720
Yes?

475
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,910
Things didn't quite go according to plan.

476
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,847
I mean they did, except...

477
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:08,128
it wasn't Arthur who wielded the sword.

478
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,760
It was Uther.

479
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,960
I tried, but he just took it.

480
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,900
Uther's the King. I couldn't stop him!

481
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,012
The sword was born of the old magic. 

482
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:26,565
You have no idea of its power.

483
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,800
In the hands of Uther, it will bring only evil.

484
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,050
I'll get it back.

485
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,860
You have betrayed me. You are not ready to be trusted.

486
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,390
I'll bring it to you.

487
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,870
You can destroy it.

488
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,240
What is made cannot be unmade.

489
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,130
So what do you want me to do?

490
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,250
Take the sword far from here

491
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:55,010
and place it where no mortal man can ever find it.

492
00:42:25,505 --> 00:42:27,921


493
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,440
I'm going back to Ealdor.

494
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,880
If you used your magic, no-one else would die.

495
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,234
There's too many!        

496
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:42,646
If it comes to a choice between saving people's lives

497
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:45,746
and revealing who I really am, there is no choice.

498
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:48,141
You can't let Arthur know about you gift!

499
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:56,833
