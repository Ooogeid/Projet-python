1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:03,355
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:05,425
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:08,375
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:09,775
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,990
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:43,885 --> 00:00:44,985
Mistress?

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,270
Is it done?

8
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,835
Yes, mistress.

9
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:52,590
The potion

10
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,710
is prepared.

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,270
Then Camelot and all its riches

12
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:00,830
will soon be mine.

13
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,210
Camelot.

14
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,830
<i>Arthur's Knights</i>

15
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,310
Merlin - 2x05
<i>Beauty and the Beast (1/2)</i>

16
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,995
Keep up, Merlin.
We've got a busy day ahead.

17
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,315
It's a busy day every day.

18
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:27,715
You and Arthur,
you work me to the bone.

19
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:30,110
Do stop moaning.
At least the work's interesting.

20
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,785
We're collecting pots.

21
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,375
We do the same thing
each and every Thursday

22
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:39,355
at exactly the same time
and nothing interesting ever happens.

23
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,310
Please.
We seek Uther Pendragon.

24
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,750
Where can he be found?

25
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,950
We have urgent business
with the King.

26
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,845
Any business you have with the King

27
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,445
will have to be pursued
through the usual channels.

28
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:56,750
But this is the seal
of the House of Tregor.

29
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:01,545
- Where did you get this?
- It does not belong to me.

30
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:03,510
It belongs to me.

31
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:09,875
My lady.

32
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:22,950
Lady Catrina. Is it really you?

33
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:25,350
I can hardly believe it myself.

34
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,875
We had tidings from the North
that the House of Tregor

35
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:30,510
had fallen to invaders.

36
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,310
All that you heard was true,
my Lord, and worse.

37
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:36,150
- But your father... the King...
- Gone, Sire.

38
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:39,470
The enemy attacked without warning.
We were outnumbered five to one.

39
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:42,395
He could not endure.

40
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:45,150
I would never have survived
had it not been for

41
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,910
my faithful servant, Jonas.

42
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,590
But we did survive.

43
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:52,870
And we have made it this far.

44
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,305
Forgive me, my lord.

45
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,270
I fear my trials
have taken their toll.

46
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:05,830
Your sufferings are beyond...
imagining, my lady.

47
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,510
It would be an honour
to help you in any way we can.

48
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:12,935
A bed for the night would be

49
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:14,390
most welcome.

50
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,955
Then consider yourselves
as our esteemed guests.

51
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,975
- It is the least that we can do.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,910
<i>She's very brave.</i>

53
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,505
Sounds terrible,
what she's been through.

54
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,025
Terrible, indeed.

55
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:30,425
What's wrong?

56
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:31,595
Nothing.

57
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,190
Job for you!

58
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:37,795
Work, work, work...

59
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:48,285
I'm sorry it's not quite
what you're used to.

60
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,704
Forgive me
but I didn't get your name?

61
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:53,785
Well, Merlin,

62
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,990
considering we spent last night
in a cave,

63
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:58,830
this will do very nicely.
Thank you.

64
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:01,536
If you need anything, just ask.

65
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,905
My master's chambers
are only upstairs.

66
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,265
My mistress and I
could not be more grateful

67
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:08,515
for the kindness you have shown us.

68
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:11,915
You're welcome.

69
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,630
I can't sleep here.

70
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:26,905
This whole place
stinks of cleanliness.

71
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:29,990
Do not worry, mistress.
I will find you somewhere more...

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,030
suitable.

73
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,795
This is wonderful. Thank you.

74
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,270
It's an honour.

75
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,230
The Houses of Tregor and Pendragon
have been allies

76
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:56,535
as long anyone can remember.

77
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,550
My father often spoke of you,
my lord.

78
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,150
And I will remember him always.

79
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,750
I'm sorry we didn't met.

80
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,210
I'm sorry too.

81
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,710
For the House of Tregor is no more.

82
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,150
No, Catrina. It lives on in you.

83
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,310
I only wish that were true.

84
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:13,865
It is, my lady,

85
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,165
your courage, your modesty

86
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,235
and you are as you always were.

87
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,255
Ever since you were a child.

88
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:23,225
I fear I am much changed
since then, my lord.

89
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:24,845
Yes, it's true.

90
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:27,150
You are far more beautiful now.

91
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:35,605
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,595
Hard day's training.

93
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,905
- If you'll excuse me.
- Of course.

94
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:44,710
I should retire myself.

95
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,945
Can I get you anything else?
You've hardly touched your food.

96
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:53,945
I'm sorry. I find
I have little appetite,

97
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,005
ever since that day.

98
00:06:57,405 --> 00:07:00,510
- I wish I had been there for you.
- But you are helping me now.

99
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:02,150
Your kindness,

100
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,860
your companionship.

101
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:11,605
I must also bid you good night, my lord.
It's been a long day.

102
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,870
Of course.

103
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:15,585
Good night, my lady.

104
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:27,085
There's something really
different about the Lady Catrina.

105
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,775
Most of Uther's guests treat me
like the dirt on their shoes.

106
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:32,430
But she was really nice,

107
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:34,405
even after all she's been through.

108
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:36,510
She was always very gracious.

109
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,985
- You've met her before?
- It was many years ago.

110
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:40,910
I doubt if she would remember.

111
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,630
- I have a job for you.
- Does it ever end?

112
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:47,150
Give this to the Lady Catrina.

113
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,295
- With my compliments.
- What is it?

114
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:51,230
- She'll know what it is.
- But what is it?

115
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,070
What's that?

116
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:09,550
Compliments of the King.

117
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,590
Revolting.

118
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:24,445
Uther's so stupid.

119
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:29,830
So blinded by pretty things.

120
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:33,525
Already he falls for me.

121
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,895
I can see it in his eyes.

122
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,925
It is only a matter of time
before he is completely

123
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,789
under my control.

124
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,270
Excellent.

125
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,510
Jonas, you must take these back to
the kitchens. It's perfectly rotten.

126
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,835
I'm sorry,
I did not mean to intrude.

127
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:57,030
That's quite all right.

128
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:59,626
At least I wasn't undressing.

129
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:03,955
The court physician
asked me to give you this.

130
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,430
What is it?

131
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:08,110
Gaius prepared it for you.

132
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,870
I'm terribly sorry. There must be
some mistake. I requested no medicine.

133
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,830
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, thank you.

134
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:22,630
I am in perfect health.

135
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:36,030
She didn't ask for it, she didn't
need it, she didn't even want it.

136
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:38,455
Interesting.

137
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,625
If you say so.

138
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:45,125
When I treated her as a child
it was for an incurable disease.

139
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:48,685
Catrina had a rare bone
disorder afflicting her joints.

140
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,205
She often had difficulty walking,
especially after a long ride.

141
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:55,190
My tonic was the only thing
that brought her relief.

142
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,185
She walks as well as you or I.

143
00:09:58,355 --> 00:09:59,505
So I noticed.

144
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:01,005
So,

145
00:10:01,295 --> 00:10:03,115
the tonic was some kind of test?

146
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:04,285
Indeed.

147
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,685
And I'm starting to wonder

148
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,800
if the Lady Catrina

149
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,870
is really the Lady Catrina at all.

150
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:19,950
What a charming idea this is, Uther.

151
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:23,065
A ride before breakfast

152
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,870
always gives me a healthy appetite.

153
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,015
I've had the kitchens
prepare us something special.

154
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,765
How sweet of you.

155
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,030
Can I help you?

156
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,855
I was just changing the sheets.

157
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,830
Please, go ahead.
Don't let me get in your way.

158
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:23,755
All done,

159
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:25,135
thank you.

160
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:30,675
Aren't you forgetting something?

161
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:42,495
Right.

162
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,950
- What did you find?
- Something wasn't right in there.

163
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:58,785
There was this strange smell

164
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,510
and I could have sworn the Lady
Catrina's bed hadn't been slept in.

165
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:06,035
And there was something else.

166
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:12,550
As I was leaving,
I thought I saw something.

167
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,485
This is going to sound mad,
but it looked like Jonas had a tail.

168
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:18,245
A tail?

169
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,855
- Are you sure?
- Well, I only glimpsed it for a moment.

170
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:24,185
- I could be wrong.
- No, I believe you.

171
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,295
We must keep an eye on her.

172
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:28,950
A very close eye.

173
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:34,415
How wonderful it is
to sit here with you, Uther.

174
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:40,265
It is a terrible thing
to find oneself alone in the world.

175
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:43,625
Suddenly, cruelly alone.

176
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,215
When Ygraine died,

177
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:50,830
I feared I would never recover...

178
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:54,935
But then as time passed,

179
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:58,345
I have become used to being alone.

180
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:02,315
But you have Morgana and Arthur.
Surely they are a comfort to you?

181
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:03,990
They are. Of course.
Both of them.

182
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,485
It must be hard
to be King and father both.

183
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:14,470
To shoulder all that responsibility
by yourself.

184
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:19,195
But I feel sure, my lord,

185
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:22,445
that you and I
shall not remain alone forever.

186
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:26,115
We will find love anew,

187
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:27,710
a kindred spirit

188
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,830
to share the burden of this life.

189
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,505
I believe we will.

190
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:43,415
Honestly.

191
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,355
- Look at them.
- Are you all right?

192
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,725
Don't you think it's odd
how quickly they've become close.

193
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,405
There's nothing odd about that.

194
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,595
My father is a wealthy
and powerful man.

195
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,715
- Good evening, Sire.
- A very good evening to you, Gaius.

196
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,575
- You seem in high spirits.
- I am, I am.

197
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:04,310
The Lady Catrina
has struck a chord with you.

198
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:06,750
Catrina is a remarkable woman.

199
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:10,538
That she is, Sire. You may remember
I treated her as a child.

200
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,110
Such courage in the face
of her condition.

201
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:16,275
Condition?
What are you talking about?

202
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,365
I thought you knew, Sire.

203
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:21,870
I diagnosed Catrina
with an incurable bone disease.

204
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:25,565
Evidently you were wrong. There's
nothing the matter with her now.

205
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:28,430
It has been a miraculous recovery,
I must say.

206
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,345
I'm sorry, Gaius,
what are you suggesting?

207
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:34,790
I'm not suggesting anything, Sire.

208
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:37,805
It's just, a little strange,
that's all.

209
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:40,595
The only strange thing I see is that
you won't admit that you were wrong.

210
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:42,550
Sire, this is not about me.

211
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,110
It's about the Lady Catrina.

212
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,315
The Lady Catrina
is our honoured guest

213
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:50,590
and you will show her the respect
that she deserves.

214
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,235
Is there something
on your mind, my lord?

215
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:02,095
It's nothing.

216
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:04,990
Speak, my lord.

217
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:07,995
Is it true

218
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:11,110
that as a child you suffered
from a terrible illness?

219
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,670
- Who told you that?
- Gaius, the court physician.

220
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,870
He said he treated you for it.

221
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:19,670
Yes, my lord.

222
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,675
What he says is true.

223
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:24,590
But as you can see,
I suffer no more.

224
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:28,310
And for that you must
be eternally grateful.

225
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:31,745
After all,

226
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,310
Gaius thought your condition
was incurable, did he not?

227
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:39,630
Well, fortunately for us,
physicians are often mistaken.

228
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,405
Even your famous Gaius.

229
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:47,575
It is unusual, though, for such
a serious illness to cure itself.

230
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:50,245
Almost

231
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:51,475
a miracle.

232
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:55,985
I can neither deny it,
nor explain it.

233
00:15:57,985 --> 00:15:59,230
But miracles do happen.

234
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,550
After all,

235
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:05,830
is it not a miracle that we should find
each other again after all this time?

236
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:11,775
And my good fortune continues.

237
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:14,685
For you are

238
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,595
a remarkable man, Uther Pendragon.

239
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,665
You are brave,

240
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:21,715
but compassionate.

241
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,000
You are powerful,

242
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,870
but modest.

243
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:28,505
Most of all...

244
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:30,395
you are very,

245
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,870
very...

246
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:35,605
handsome.

247
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:39,190
- I'm sorry.
- No, my lord,

248
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,150
- it is I who must apologise.
- It's a long time since Ygraine,

249
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:44,695
since anyone.

250
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:47,065
I understand completely.
There's no hurry.

251
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:49,355
We have all the time in the world.

252
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,265
And that time will come.

253
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:21,110
I have no doubt, that you have prepared
a very good explanation for this.

254
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,270
Apparently I'm wrong.

255
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,990
Please tell me you weren't spying
on Lady Catrina.

256
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:38,505
- It's not what it seems.
- Yes, it's exactly what it seems.

257
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:42,750
You've led a sheltered life.
You have no social skills whatsoever

258
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,705
and Catrina is, I admit,
an attractive woman.

259
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,270
I understand completely.

260
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,575
If I ever find you doing it again

261
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:53,545
I'll feed you to the dogs,

262
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,645
- do I make myself clear?
- Yes. Absolutely, Sire.

263
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,515
What you saw is seldom seen.

264
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:24,030
Trolls despise all other
living things, especially humans.

265
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,030
They prefer to lurk in the darkness of
their nests, feasting on rot and filth.

266
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:33,110
- And Jonas? Is he a troll too?
- Who can tell what creature he is.

267
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:36,375
It makes no sense.

268
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,655
If trolls like to lurk
in their caves so much,

269
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,245
- what's this one doing in Camelot?
- Trolls are greedy.

270
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:43,155
Lady Catrina
is like the rest of her kind.

271
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,475
She lusts after wealth and power.

272
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:48,555
Uther's wealth and power.

273
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,625
We have reached
the point of no return.

274
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:54,995
Uther has to be told.

275
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,465
You're going to tell Uther
that his new lady friend's a troll?

276
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,470
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

277
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:05,670
Good luck.

278
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:10,390
Thank you, Merlin.

279
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,730
- My lord.
- Yes, Gaius.

280
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:28,592
I have served you
for many years now.

281
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:31,668
I like to think
that in my humble capacity,

282
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:34,292
I have advised you
to the best of my ability,

283
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:37,978
and that my advice has proven
to be of value to you.

284
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,072
This is true.

285
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,830
And so I must advise you that

286
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,105
the Lady Catrina

287
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:49,195
is not all that she seems to be.

288
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:54,158
Then tell me, Gaius. Who is she?

289
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,630
I believe her to be...

290
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
She's...

291
00:22:03,882 --> 00:22:05,229
Come on. Out with it.

292
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,590
She is a troll, Sire.

293
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,182
Excuse me?

294
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:14,830
Some trolls have the power
to take any shape they please.

295
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,018
This one has taken a shape
that pleases you.

296
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:19,070
You are besotted, my lord.

297
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,590
- The creature has you in its power.
- Gaius, this is utterly ludicrous.

298
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,390
Please, Sire. Her entire family
is wiped out but she alone escapes!?

299
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,318
She has an incurable disease
but makes a miraculous recovery!?

300
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:32,430
And that is nothing but idle gossip.

301
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,350
Is it gossip she does not eat her food!?
Of course she doesn't.

302
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,030
She feasts on rotten fruit
like any other troll!

303
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,070
Enough! This attack
is unwarranted and malicious.

304
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,214
Sire, her servant is not human,
he has a tail.

305
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:45,584
I said enough!

306
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:48,994
Sire, please,

307
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:52,150
I just advise you
not to do anything rash.

308
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,022
And I advise you to hold
your tongue, physician,

309
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:57,630
or I will indeed do something rash.

310
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:09,704
Did you sleep well last night,
mistress?

311
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:12,710
- Very well, thank you.
- We have a problem.

312
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,718
Last night. You were followed.

313
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:18,346
Who?

314
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:20,230
The boy, Merlin.

315
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:25,233
Shall I dispose of him, mistress?

316
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,770
That may arouse suspicion.

317
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:32,750
But it is time
that Uther bent to my wishes.

318
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:35,817
- And if he does not?
- Well, he'll have no choice.

319
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:39,720
There's more than one way
to enchant a man.

320
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:50,064
Please,

321
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:51,910
don't say anything.

322
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,270
- I wasn't going to say anything.
- You were going to say I told you so.

323
00:23:57,993 --> 00:24:00,470
I was. But I'm not going to now.

324
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,670
- Uther didn't take it well.
- You see, I told you.

325
00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:07,332
Sorry.

326
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:11,249
But I know him, Merlin.
He's a proud man but he's not stupid.

327
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:13,830
He will reflect on what I said.
I'm sure he will.

328
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,070
Let's hope you're right.

329
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,380
Dinner time.

330
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:09,691
Isn't this perfect?

331
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:12,053
You and me together.

332
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:16,929
A toast,

333
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,390
to us.

334
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,470
I'm not sure everyone
sees it that way.

335
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:25,430
Well, there will always be
those who resist change.

336
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,230
- That's to be expected.
- We must be mindful of public opinion.

337
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:30,243
What are you trying to say, my lord?

338
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:33,790
Perhaps if you were to visit
your cousins for a while.

339
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:37,189
To show people
that we're not rushing into anything.

340
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,086
You would let yourself be bullied

341
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:41,610
by some petty-minded fools?

342
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:48,450
But of course, of course, my lord.

343
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,950
If that is what you wish,
then that is what I shall do.

344
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,628
It is as you said,
we have all the time in the world.

345
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,110
Before I go, my lord,
there's something I want to give you.

346
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:05,978
It belonged to my father.

347
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:09,670
- And his father before him.
- Catrina, I couldn't possibly.

348
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:13,247
I want you to have it.

349
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,910
Perhaps when you look at it,

350
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:17,870
it will remind you of me...

351
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:24,350
... and the times
that we have spent together.

352
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,863
I shall wear it always.

353
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:31,350
That is as well.

354
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,440
For while others doubt me,
you must not.

355
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:37,950
You cannot doubt me.

356
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:40,855
For am I not beautiful, my lord?

357
00:26:41,472 --> 00:26:42,550
You are beautiful.

358
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:45,670
Am I not your heart's desire?

359
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,350
You are my heart's desire.

360
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:51,598
Then seal it, my lord.

361
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,076
Seal it,

362
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,130
with a kiss.

363
00:26:57,898 --> 00:26:58,898
A kiss.

364
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:18,550
- Good morning, mistress.
- It is indeed, Jonas.

365
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:22,670
The King was receptive
to your advances?

366
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,800
How could he resist such beauty?

367
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:29,790
The enchantment
proved effective then.

368
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,030
He is but a puppet in my hands.

369
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:44,526
You called for me, Sire?

370
00:27:49,107 --> 00:27:50,453
You will be delighted to hear

371
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:52,781
that none of the worries
you brought to my attention

372
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:54,470
have any truth to them whatsoever.

373
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:56,881
Sire?

374
00:27:57,448 --> 00:27:58,851
I hope, over time,

375
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,125
you will come to see Catrina
as she really is.

376
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,030
Over time?

377
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:09,698
I've asked Catrina
to extend her stay indefinitely.

378
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,327
I consider the matter closed,

379
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:16,099
and I hope you show me
the courtesy of doing the same.

380
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:20,645
It's no good.
I can tell him she's a troll

381
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:22,997
till I'm blue in the face.
He won't listen.

382
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,078
He sees only a charming,
beautiful woman.

383
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,070
With a body like a tree trunk.

384
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,964
But we only know that
because you saw her in troll form.

385
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:31,670
What do we do?

386
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:34,230
We must open Uther's eyes.

387
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:37,066
Show her for what she really is.

388
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:43,310
- Using magic?
- The only way to reveal her true form.

389
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,470
But she never leaves his side.

390
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,059
I know.

391
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:57,986
You want me to use magic
in front of the king?

392
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,230
I do.

393
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:03,887
- I'd never get away with it.
- I'm sorry.

394
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:05,830
I know how dangerous this is.

395
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,670
But we cannot allow her to gain
any further control over the King.

396
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,310
Who knows the consequences?

397
00:29:14,243 --> 00:29:15,310
Just one problem.

398
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:17,750
I know nothing about troll magic.

399
00:29:23,176 --> 00:29:24,590
Then we have work to do.

400
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:31,815
A beautiful day.

401
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:34,646
The first of many, I hope.

402
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:39,857
How fine it must be to have
all this at your command.

403
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:42,150
Can be a burden sometimes.

404
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:45,710
Let me share your burden, my lord.

405
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:48,436
Together we could achieve so much.

406
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:50,350
There is nothing I'd like more.

407
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:57,879
Would it not be a good idea to send
a message to those who doubt us?

408
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,551
To show all of Camelot
the strength of our love,

409
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:03,070
our commitment.

410
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:10,547
- What did you have in mind?
- I was thinking of something

411
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:12,402
traditional,

412
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:14,902
something permanent.

413
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,103
Here!

414
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,350
The Spell of Revelation,

415
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,910
with which the true nature of a thing
may be revealed.

416
00:30:35,477 --> 00:30:38,935
But this applies only to objects,
things, not living creatures.

417
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:40,105
I know.

418
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:42,030
Principle's the same, isn't it?

419
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:45,459
I have to try it.
What other choice do we have?

420
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,390
Very well.
But choose your moment carefully.

421
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,950
Trolls are vicious creatures.

422
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:52,492
Come in.

423
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,110
The King requests you
in the council chambers.

424
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:09,662
Thank you all for coming.

425
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,270
You are no doubt wondering
why I have gathered you here today.

426
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:16,425
Though we live in dark times,

427
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:18,401
today

428
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,710
I bring you light...

429
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:22,276
and love.

430
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,030
It gives me the greatest pleasure

431
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,490
to inform you that the Houses
of Tregor and Pendragon

432
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:33,627
are to be united
in the closest bond of all.

433
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:37,014
I am to marry

434
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:39,590
Lady Catrina of Tregor.

435
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:51,482
I am to marry Lady Catrina

436
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:53,470
tomorrow.

437
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,510
This union

438
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,167
heralds a new dawn for the Kingdom.

439
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,850
A new beginning...

440
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,710
... and a new queen for all

441
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,508
here in Camelot.

442
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:20,021
I could not hope
to have made a better match.

443
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,375
I hope you shall
all share in our joy.

444
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:35,088
Thank you.

445
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:43,587
- What happened?
- I'm sorry, mistress.

446
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,510
- I was not prepared.
- Quick. My potion.

447
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:50,590
It was the boy, Merlin.
It seems he has magic.

448
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:54,190
Do not concern yourself.
I resisted him easily enough.

449
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,270
There's no telling what he'll do next.
He could ruin everything.

450
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,030
That cannot be allowed to happen.

451
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,750
What would you have me do, mistress?

452
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,830
I think it's time we set a trap.

453
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,110
I'm sorry. I tried.

454
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:21,910
- I gave it everything I had.
- Not your fault. You did your best.

455
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,136
The Spell of Revelation
is powerful magic.

456
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:27,793
I could see she could feel it.

457
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:31,149
Her magic must be strong indeed
to be able to resist you.

458
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,990
- Where are you going!?
- To see Arthur, he's our only hope.

459
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:51,250
I'm going to tell you something.

460
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,546
It's not going to be easy.

461
00:33:55,588 --> 00:33:56,588
Right.

462
00:33:57,032 --> 00:33:58,677
It concerns the Lady Catrina.

463
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:01,098
You're not using my chambers
to spy on her again.

464
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,870
Trust me.
I saw everything I needed to see.

465
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm sure you did.

466
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:11,531
She's a troll.

467
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:18,310
- She's not that bad.
- I'm serious, she's an actual troll.

468
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,511
I know what you're trying to do.
I appreciate it, you're a true friend.

469
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:25,509
But it's not about whether I like her.
It's what makes my father happy.

470
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,161
And when they announced the wedding,
I realised Lady Catrina does just that.

471
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:31,593
- She makes him happy.
- He won't be so damn happy

472
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:33,607
when he discovers
his wife's a monster!!

473
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:34,670
Enough.

474
00:34:35,046 --> 00:34:38,696
She's the future Queen of Camelot,
whether you like it or not.

475
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,654
So you better get used to it.

476
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,110
- I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

477
00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:06,630
I'm a slave, a prisoner.

478
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,885
- What are you talking about?
- My mistress, she is not as she seems.

479
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,510
But you know as much.

480
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,073
Go on. I'm listening.

481
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:18,343
She is a cruel, wicked creature.

482
00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:20,510
She keeps me in chains.

483
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:23,508
She hurts me.

484
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:25,983
Her magic. I can't escape it.

485
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,070
She twists my mind,
as she is twisting your King's.

486
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,348
Why are you telling me this?

487
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,510
- I can help you.
- How?

488
00:35:37,592 --> 00:35:39,680
Below the castle, where she sleeps.

489
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,390
She keeps her potions there.
Every night she must take these potions.

490
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,014
It is the magic that transforms her
from beast to beauty.

491
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:49,350
If you were to take these from her.

492
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:51,304
She must remain as a beast

493
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,550
and then your King
would not be so keen, I think.

494
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:58,156
Tell me, Jonas.

495
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:01,094
Why should I believe any of this?

496
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:03,214
You must do as you think fit.

497
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:06,069
But if my mistress is not stopped,

498
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:07,630
by morning,

499
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:10,552
she will be Queen.

500
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:36,826
You won't find anything in there.

501
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,300
You may possess some magic, wretch,

502
00:36:41,924 --> 00:36:44,630
but you are no match for me.

503
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:01,430
Have I ever looked more revolting?

504
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:04,510
No, mistress.

505
00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:09,156
You always say the right thing.

506
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,950
My lords, ladies,
and gentleman of Camelot,

507
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,550
we are gathered
here today to celebrate,

508
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,397
by the ancient rite of handfasting,

509
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,670
the union of Uther Pendragon

510
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,210
and Lady Catrina of Tregor.

511
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,999
Is it your wish, Uther,

512
00:39:54,546 --> 00:39:56,546
to become one with this woman?

513
00:39:56,872 --> 00:39:57,750
It is.

514
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:01,482
Is it your wish, Catrina,
to become one with this man?

515
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:02,870
It is.

516
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:04,670
Do any say nay?

517
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,433
Can I help you?

518
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,299
- Are you lost?
- Step aside, Jonas.

519
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,710
The King's wedding
is by invitation only.

520
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,950
I said get out of my way.

521
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:32,177
I'm so sorry, but I regret to say

522
00:40:32,986 --> 00:40:34,670
that you are not invited.

523
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:50,479
With this garland I do tie a knot,

524
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:52,629
and by doing so,

525
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:57,110
bind your hands and your hearts
for all eternity.

526
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,110
Leave my mistress alone.

527
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,190
I, Uther Pendragon, King of Camelot.

528
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:13,950
I shall not seek
to change thee in any way.

529
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,790
I shall respect thee,

530
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:17,590
as I respect myself.

531
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:28,463
I now pronounce you to be

532
00:41:29,402 --> 00:41:30,630
Husband and Wife.

533
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,910
Queen Catrina will be named
as rightful heir to the throne.

534
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,590
If Uther dies,
she will rule Camelot?

535
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,320
Shut up and give me the crown.

536
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:13,670
My plan to undermine
Arthur is underway.

537
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,950
If she can't be stopped
Arthur won't become king.

538
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,990
Albion will never be born.
