0
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
 

1
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:13,697
No young man, no matter
how great, can know his destiny.

2
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:21,080
He cannot glimpse his part in the
great story that is about to unfold.

3
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:26,422
Like everyone,
he must live and learn.

4
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:31,736
And so it will be
for the young warlock

5
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,416
arriving at the gates of Camelot.

6
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:40,216
A boy that will, in time,
father a legend.

7
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:44,976
His name...

8
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:48,416
.. Merlin

9
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,700
Merlin 2008
1x01 The call of the Dragon

10
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:20,783
www. ragbear. com

11
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:08,176
Let this serve as a lesson to all.

12
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:12,581
This man, Thomas James Collins,

13
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:17,896
is adjudged guilty of conspiring
to use enchantments and magic.

14
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:21,981
And pursuant to the laws of Camelot,

15
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:27,616
I, Uther Pendragon, have decreed
that such practices are banned

16
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:30,821
on penalty of death.

17
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:34,896
I pride myself
as a fair and just king.

18
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,541
But for the crime of sorcery,

19
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:41,056
there is but one sentence I can pass.

20
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:09,016
When I came to this land,
this kingdom was mired in chaos.

21
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:14,296
With the people's help,
magic was driven from the realm.

22
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:16,341
So I declare a festival

23
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:20,456
to celebrate 20 years
since the great dragon was captured

24
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,416
and Camelot freed
from the evil of sorcery.

25
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:27,976
Let the celebrations begin.

26
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:39,496
There is only one evil in this land
and it is not magic.

27
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:41,136
It is you...

28
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,856
...with your hatred
and your ignorance.

29
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:51,256
You took my son!

30
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:58,296
And I promise you,
before these celebrations are over,

31
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:00,176
you will share my tears.

32
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:06,936
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

33
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,976
A son for a son.

34
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,256
Seize her.

35
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:42,376
Where would I find Gaius,
the court physician?

36
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,256
Hello?

37
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:17,536
Hello?

38
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:25,276
Gaius?

39
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,536
Whoa!

40
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:43,336
What the... What did you just do?

41
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:45,541
Um... Tell me.

42
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:48,421
Well, uh... I have no idea
what happened.

43
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:52,536
If anyone had seen that...
No, that was nothing to do with me.

44
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:55,336
I know what it was. I want to know
where you learnt it.

45
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,581
Nowhere.

46
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:58,816
How do you know magic? I don't.

47
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,776
Where did you study?

48
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:05,336
Answer me! I've never studied magic
or been taught.

49
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:07,656
Are you lying?
What do you want me to say?

50
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:09,616
The truth.
I was born like this.

51
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,976
That's impossible.

52
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:13,781
Who are you?

53
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:17,496
Oh, uh... I have this letter.

54
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:22,216
I... I don't have my glasses.

55
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:26,016
I'm Merlin Hunith's son?

56
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,301
Yes.

57
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:30,296
You're not meant to be here
till Wednesday.

58
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:31,856
It is Wednesday.

59
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:36,421
Ah. Right, then.

60
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:38,656
You better put your bag in there.

61
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:45,096
Look, you won't say anything
about...

62
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:47,056
No.

63
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:51,621
Though, Merlin..

64
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:53,656
I should say thank you.

65
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:42,616
My dear, Gaius, I turn to you
for I feel lost and alone

66
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:44,421
and don't know who to trust.

67
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:48,056
It is every mother's fate
to think her child is special.

68
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:50,781
Yet I would give my life
that Merlin were not.

69
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:55,696
Ours is a small village and he is so
clearly at odds with people here

70
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:59,496
that if he were to remain,
I fear what will become of him.

71
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:04,021
He needs a hand to hold,
a voice to guide.

72
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:07,976
Someone that might help him
find a purpose for his gifts.

73
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,421
I beg you,

74
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,696
if you understand
a mother's love for her son,

75
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,141
keep him safe.

76
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:17,256
And may God save you both.

77
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:40,033
Morgana Yes?

78
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,172
What is this?
Why are you not joining us?

79
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,262
I don't think
chopping someone's head off

80
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:48,976
is cause for a celebration.

81
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,501
That poor mother.

82
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:53,636
Simple justice for what he'd done.
To whom?

83
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:56,701
He practised magic.
He didn't hurt anyone.

84
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,104
You were not around 20 years ago.
You have no idea what it was like.

85
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:01,691
How long are you going to keep punishing
people for what happened then?

86
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,981
Until they realize there is no room for magic in my kingdom.

87
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:07,976
You will be with me
when I greet Lady Helen.

88
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,133
I told you - I want no part of this.

89
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:12,221
I am your guardian.

90
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:14,021
I expect you to do as I ask.

91
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:18,216
If you show me no respect,
at least respect our finest singer.

92
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:22,696
You know the more brutal you are,
the more enemies you create.

93
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:54,616
Hello?

94
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,656
Gregory?

95
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:00,416
Lady Helen.

96
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:02,621
Is all well?

97
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:05,856
Yes. With luck,
we should reach Camelot late tomorrow.

98
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,776
That's good.
I'll be outside if you need me.

99
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:29,400
Who's there?

100
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,292
Who's there?

101
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:40,170
Merlin

102
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:44,696
Merlin

103
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,301
I got you water.

104
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:10,936
You didn't wash last night.
Sorry.

105
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:12,856
Help yourself to breakfast.

106
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:29,936
How did you do that?
Did you incant a spell in your mind?

107
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,661
I don't know any spells.

108
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:34,936
So what did you do?
There must be something.

109
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,496
It just happened.

110
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,600
Well, we better keep you
out of trouble.

111
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:47,106
You can help me until I find
some paid work for you. Here.

112
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:50,026
Hollyhock and feverfew
for Lady Percival

113
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,293
and this is for Sir Olwen.

114
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:54,866
He's blind as a weevil, so warn him
not to take it all at once.

115
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:58,376
- Ok
- And here.

116
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:03,951
Off you go.

117
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,382
And Merlin,

118
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,662
I need hardly tell you,

119
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:14,057
that the practice of any form of
enchantments will get you killed.

120
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:33,366
Um... I brought you your medicine.

121
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:41,744
Oh, Gaius said
don't drink it all...

122
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:48,084
I'm sure it's fine.

123
00:13:53,644 --> 00:13:55,489
Where's the target?

124
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:58,409
There, sir?
That's into the sun.

125
00:13:58,444 --> 00:14:01,249
It's not that bright.
A bit like you, then.

126
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:05,364
Put the target down the
other end, shall I, sir?

127
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,501
Teach him a lesson.

128
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,050
This'll teach him.

129
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:12,564
Teach him a lesson.

130
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,465
Hey, hang on.

131
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:17,975
Don't stop.

132
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:21,680
Here?

133
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:23,655
I told you to keep moving.

134
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:29,395
Come on! Run.

135
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:34,220
We want some moving target practice.

136
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:49,720
Hey. Come on, that's enough.

137
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,875
- What?
- You've had your fun, my friend.

138
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,280
Do I know you?

139
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,655
I'm Merlin
So I don't know you.

140
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,915
- No.
- Yet you called me friend.

141
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,672
That was my mistake.

142
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:03,360
- I think so.
- Yeah.

143
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:07,595
I'd never have a friend
who could be such an ass.

144
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,800
Or I one who could be so stupid.

145
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:12,995
Tell me Merlin, do you know
how to walk on your knees?

146
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,920
No. Would you like me to help you?

147
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,595
I wouldn't if I were you.
Why? What are you gonna do to me?

148
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,635
You have no idea.
Be my guest. Come on. Come on!

149
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,835
Come on.

150
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:30,760
I'll throw you in jail for that.

151
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:35,475
Do you think you're the king?
No, I'm his son - Arthur.

152
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,880
Lady Helen.

153
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:38,675
Thank you so much for coming
to sing at our celebrations.

154
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,552
Pleasure's all mine.
How was your journey?

155
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:44,995
The time it took.
Well, it was worth the wait.

156
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,755
It will be.

157
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,795
Merlin

158
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,435
Merlin

159
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,315
Merlin

160
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:16,755
Merlin

161
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,360
G... Uh.

162
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:22,440
You never cease to amaze me.

163
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:26,955
The one thing that someone like you
should do is keep your head down.

164
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,275
What do you do? You bahave like an idiot.

165
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,880
I'm sorry.

166
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:34,755
You're lucky. I managed to pull
a few strings to get you released.

167
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,555
Oh, thank you, thank you!

168
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,440
I won't forget this.

169
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,915
Well, there is a small price to pay.

170
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:44,475
Oh, God!

171
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,795
Thanks.

172
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,635
I'm Guinevere,
but most people call me Gwen.

173
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,955
I'm the Lady Morgana's maid.

174
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,600
Right. I'm Merlin

175
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:21,195
Although most people
just call me "idiot".

176
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,035
No, no. I saw what you did.

177
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,995
You were so brave.

178
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,720
Or stupid.

179
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,599
I'm glad you walked away.
You weren't going to beat him.

180
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:33,200
- All right, i can beat him
- You think?

181
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:37,795
Because you don't look like
one of these big muscly fellows.

182
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,840
Thanks.

183
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,640
I'm sure you're
stronger than you look.

184
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:45,075
It's just Arthur's one of these
real rough, tough,

185
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,355
save-the-world kind of men.

186
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,960
And... well... What?

187
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,715
You don't look like that.

188
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:56,155
I'm in disguise.

189
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:00,800
It's great you stood up to him.
You think so?

190
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:05,595
Arthur's a bully and everyone
thought you were a real hero.

191
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,235
Really? Mm-hm.

192
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:11,675
Oh, excuse me, Guinevere.

193
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,235
My fans are waiting.

194
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:23,655
Want some vegetables with that?

195
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,320
I know you're
still angry with me.

196
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:28,955
Your mother asked me
to look after you.

197
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes.

198
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,355
What did your mother say to you
about your gifts?

199
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:37,275
That I was special.

200
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,000
You are special,

201
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,955
the likes of which
I have never seen before.

202
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,200
What do you mean?

203
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:48,355
Well, magic requires incantations,
spells, it takes years to study.

204
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,315
What I saw you do was...
elemental, instinctive.

205
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,695
What's the point if it can't be used?

206
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,480
That I do not know.

207
00:19:57,515 --> 00:20:01,595
You are a question that
has never been posed before, Merlin

208
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:06,200
Did you ever study magic?

209
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:10,755
Uther banned all such work 20 years ago.

210
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,000
Why?

211
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:14,795
People used magic for the wrong end at that time.

212
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,520
It threw the natural order
into chaos.

213
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:21,395
Uther made it his mission to destroy
every things from back then.

214
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,920
Even the dragons.
All of them?

215
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:27,395
There was one dragon
he chose not to kill.

216
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,200
Kept it as an example.

217
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:33,715
He imprisoned it in a cave
deep beneath the castle

218
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,035
where no one can free it.

219
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,650
Now eat up.

220
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,435
When you finish, you'll take
a preparation to Lady Helen.

221
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,435
She needs it for her voice.

222
00:21:44,155 --> 00:21:45,920
What are you doing in here?

223
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:49,635
Um... I was... I was asked
to deliver this.

224
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:19,555
How's your knee-walking coming along?

225
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,955
Oh, don't run away!

226
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:25,560
From you?
Ah, thank God.

227
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,115
Thought you were deaf
as well as dumb.

228
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,360
Look, I've told you you're an ass.

229
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:33,440
I just didn't realise
you're a royal one.

230
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:38,115
Oh. What are you going to do? You
got your daddy's men to protect you?

231
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,475
I could take you apart
with one blow.

232
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,715
I could take you apart with less than that.

233
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,355
- You sure?
- Come on.

234
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:52,275
Here you go, big man.

235
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,435
Come on, then.

236
00:22:58,435 --> 00:23:01,875
I warn you. I've been
trained to kill since birth.

237
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,015
Wow. And how long have you
been training to be a prat?

238
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,720
You can't address me like that.

239
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:12,275
Sorry. How long have you been
training to be a prat... My Lord?

240
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,595
Come on, then, Merlin!

241
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,075
Come on!

242
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,075
You're in trouble now.
Oh, God.

243
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:23,520
Want to give up? Do you?

244
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:25,475
Do you? Do you want to give up?

245
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:41,920
Wait. Let him go.

246
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:45,120
He may be an idiot,
but he's a brave one.

247
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:51,035
There's something about you, Merlin
I can't quite put my finger on it.

248
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:56,720
How could you be so foolish?!
He needed to be told a lesson.

249
00:24:56,755 --> 00:25:01,275
Magic must be studied, mastered
and used for good. Not for idiotic pranks!

250
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,315
What is it to master? I could move objects
like that before I could talk!

251
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,640
You should control yourself.

252
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:10,595
I don't want to! If I can't
use magic, what have I got?

253
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,635
I'm just a nobody.
And who always will be.

254
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,972
If I can't use magic,

255
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:18,275
I might as well die.

256
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:31,920
Merlin?

257
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:33,915
Sit up. Take your shirt off.

258
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:51,515
You don't know why
I was born like this, do you?

259
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,235
No.

260
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:56,235
I'm not a monster, am I?

261
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:00,520
Don't ever think that.

262
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:04,435
Then why am I like this?
Please. I need to know why.

263
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:10,755
Maybe there's someone
with more knowledge than me.

264
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,115
If you can't tell me, no-one can.

265
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,035
Take this.

266
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:28,875
It will help with the pain.

267
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:52,215
Will you sing for me tonight?
You will have to wait.

268
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,195
You will not deny me.
I'm saving myself for my performance tomorrow.

269
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,612
Will everyone be there?

270
00:26:58,647 --> 00:27:00,995
Who would dare to miss it?

271
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,440
How about your son?

272
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:05,795
It seems a shame not to have
met him.

273
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,995
That's Arthur.

274
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:09,160
Poor child.

275
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,440
Hmm?
Poor child.

276
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:14,875
It can't have been easy
to grow up without a mother.

277
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,400
No. Hmm.

278
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,435
That bond between mother and son -

279
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,072
it's so hard to replace.

280
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:25,675
Hasn't been easy.
I'm sure.

281
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,995
Perhaps if you found someone.

282
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,200
If you remarried.

283
00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:38,995
I'm sure you'd have the pick
of any maiden in the kingdom.

284
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,440
Well, perhaps I'll find love again.

285
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:46,795
But I'm afraid it's too late
to replace Arthur's mother.

286
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,595
Yes.
It's certainly too late for Arthur.

287
00:27:57,555 --> 00:28:00,035
Merlin

288
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,595
Merlin

289
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:56,075
Merlin

290
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:47,675
Merlin

291
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:58,035
Merlin

292
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:13,435
Merlin

293
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,475
Where are you?

294
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,795
I'm here.

295
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:54,635
How small you are
for such a great destiny.

296
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,755
Why? What do you mean?

297
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,600
What destiny?

298
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:06,035
Your gift, Merlin,
was given to you for a reason.

299
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,760
So there is a reason.

300
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:12,455
Arthur is the once and future king

301
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,115
who will unite the land of Albion.

302
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,000
Right...

303
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:23,035
But he faces many threats
from friend and foe alike.

304
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,546
I don't see what this has to do with me?

305
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:26,640
Everything!

306
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:30,015
Without you,
Arthur will never succeed.

307
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,355
Without you, there will be no Albion.

308
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,152
No. No, you've got this wrong.

309
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:37,751
There is no right or wrong.

310
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:41,210
Only what is and what isn't.

311
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:45,635
I serious. If anyone wants to go and kill him,
then go ahead. In fact I give them a hand.

312
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:52,275
None of us can choose our destiny,
Merlin

313
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:56,995
And none of us can escape it.

314
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,640
No. No way, no.

315
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:03,675
There must be another Arthur
because this one's an idiot.

316
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,435
Perhaps it's your destiny
to change that.

317
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:18,335
Wa... Wait. Wait. Stop.

318
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:20,955
I need to know more!

319
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,480
Hoy!

320
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:37,955
Have you seen the state of this room?

321
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,440
I...

322
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:41,995
It just happens.
By magic?

323
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,600
Yeah. Yes.

324
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:45,961
Well, you can clear it up
without magic.

325
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:48,167
Then I want you toget me some herbs.

326
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,482
Henbane, wormwood and sorrel.

327
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,727
And deliver this to Morgana.

328
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,322
Poor girl's suffering from nightmares.

329
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:00,562
I know the feeling.

330
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,042
You know,
I've been thinking about Arthur.

331
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:24,962
I wouldn't touch him
with a lance pole.

332
00:33:24,997 --> 00:33:27,362
Pass me that dress, will you, Gwen?

333
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,402
I mean, the man's a total jouster.

334
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,927
Just because I'm the King's ward,

335
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:38,802
that doesn't mean I have to accompany
him to the feast, does it?

336
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:42,007
Well, does it?
Mm-mm.

337
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:45,082
If he wants me to go,
then he should invite me.

338
00:33:45,117 --> 00:33:49,002
He hasn't. Know what that means?
Mm-mm.

339
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:51,487
Where are you?
Here.

340
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:54,362
It means I'm going by myself.

341
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,882
I need some help with this fastening.

342
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:03,682
Gwen? I'm here.

343
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:17,282
So, it's whether I wear
this little tease...

344
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,602
...or give them a night
they'll really remember.

345
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:37,362
Lady Helen,
the compliments of the king.

346
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:38,842
Come in.

347
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,367
So sweet.

348
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:46,567
How will I ever repay him?

349
00:34:46,602 --> 00:34:50,682
Whe  he hears you sing that will be
more than enough, won't it?

350
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:53,922
I'm really looking forward
to the performance.

351
00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:55,767
So am I.

352
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,167
I love singing. I sing all the time.

353
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:01,682
My betrothed says I have
the voice of a fallen angel.

354
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,122
God have mercy.

355
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:16,202
Merlin! Remember you're here to work.

356
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:26,007
She looks great, doesn't she?

357
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:30,242
Some people are born to be queen.
No.

358
00:36:30,277 --> 00:36:32,927
I hope so, one day.

359
00:36:32,962 --> 00:36:36,642
Not that I'd want to be her.
Who'd want to marry Arthur?

360
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:40,282
I thought you liked
tough, save-the-world men.

361
00:36:40,317 --> 00:36:43,099
No, I like ordinary men like you.

362
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,882
Gwen, believe me, I'm not ordinary.

363
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,419
No, I didn't mean you!

364
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:50,887
Obviously. Not YOU.

365
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:55,242
But just... you know, I like
much more ordinary men.

366
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:57,242
Like you.

367
00:36:58,322 --> 00:36:59,562
Thanks.

368
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:44,882
We have enjoyed 20 years
of peace and prosperity.

369
00:37:45,242 --> 00:37:49,142
It has brought the kingdom
and myself many pleasures.

370
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:53,433
But few can compare with
the honour of introducing

371
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:56,233
Lady Helen of Mora.

372
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,326
You saved my boy's life.

373
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:47,486
- A debt must be repaid.
- Oh... well...

374
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:50,041
Don't be modest.
You'll be rewarded.

375
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:51,846
You don't have to.

376
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:55,761
No, absolutely. This merits
something quite special.

377
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:00,281
You'll get a post
in the royal household.

378
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:03,281
You shall be Prince Arthur's
manservant.

379
00:41:03,316 --> 00:41:04,921
Father?!

380
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,086
Seems you're a hero.

381
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:28,361
Hard to believe, isn't it?
No.

382
00:41:28,396 --> 00:41:30,601
I knew from the moment I met you.

383
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:32,601
You saved my life, remember?

384
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:35,246
But... that was magic.

385
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:38,521
And now it seems we've finally
found a use for it.

386
00:41:38,556 --> 00:41:41,321
- What do you mean?
- I saw how you saved Arthur's life.

387
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,900
Perhaps that's its purpose.

388
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:48,295
My destiny.

389
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:49,935
Indeed.

390
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:56,275
This book was given to me
when I was your age.

391
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,615
But I have a feeling it will be
of more use to you

392
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,055
than it was to me.

393
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:26,220
But this is a book of magic.

394
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,255
Which is why you must keep it hidden.

395
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,935
I will study every word.

396
00:42:36,215 --> 00:42:39,380
Merlin, Prince Arthur
wants you right away.

397
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:42,735
Your destiny's calling.
You better find out what he wants.
