1
00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:03,805
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:05,885
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:08,505
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:10,260
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,430
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:33,325
My Lord.

7
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,155
He is here.

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,550
You are Myror.

9
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:48,830
Legend has it you are the most
feared assassin in all the known lands.

10
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:50,775
Tell me,

11
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,420
are you as ruthless
as they say you are?

12
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,475
You would kill anyone.

13
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:58,390
I have killed many people,
they are all the same to me.

14
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:02,135
You are prepared to kill royalty?

15
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:05,510
My Lord, you would already be dead
had someone placed a bounty on you.

16
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:28,125
I want you to kill the man

17
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:30,590
who murdered my son.

18
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:33,475
I want you to kill

19
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:35,745
Arthur Pendragon.

20
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,590
Arthur's Knights

21
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,990
Merlin - 2x02
<i>The Once and Future Queen</i>

22
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,550
That has got to hurt.

23
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:33,670
That's the point,
Merlin, it's not a pillow fight.

24
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,390
Fetch me another lance, will you?

25
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,545
Why did you pull out?
You could have unhorsed me.

26
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,430
- I was fearful I might injure you.
- You had the advantage,

27
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,185
you can't hesitate.

28
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:10,085
I wouldn't have done
if I were facing a different opponent.

29
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,815
You are the future King, my Lord.

30
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,870
You jousted against me in the tournament
last year. You're saying you let me win?

31
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,365
No, my Lord.

32
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,515
It doesn't matter who I am.

33
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:30,230
I do not expect any special treatment
from you, from any of you.

34
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,310
Is that understood?

35
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,830
How can I prove myself if my opponents
aren't trying their hardest?

36
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:47,094
I'm sure it's not happening
all the time.

37
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:50,430
- So it's happening some of the time?
- No. I'm certain it isn't.

38
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:52,270
Now you're doing it!

39
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,310
You're telling me exactly
what you think I want to hear.

40
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:59,630
What was the question?

41
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,310
That just proves it.

42
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:06,235
All my life

43
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:09,830
I've been treated as if I'm special.
I want to be treated like everyone else.

44
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,295
Really?

45
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,350
You've no idea how lucky you are.

46
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,055
Any time you want to swap places,
just let me know.

47
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:21,155
That's not a totally stupid idea.

48
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:23,755
You're Prince Arthur.

49
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,375
You can't change who you are.

50
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:30,335
Yes, I can.

51
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,285
We've received reports
that a beast has been sighted

52
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,705
roaming the forests
near the Northern Borders.

53
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,375
What's its nature?

54
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:45,259
It is said to have the body of a lion,
the wings of an eagle

55
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,750
and the...

56
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,325
face of a bear.

57
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,310
I believe it has been conjured
by sorcery.

58
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,510
- Then we must destroy it.
- I leave for the Northern Borders.

59
00:04:58,305 --> 00:04:59,845
You'll miss the tournament.

60
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,590
As much as I want to compete,

61
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,550
my duty to Camelot comes first.

62
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:04,935
You're right.

63
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,790
I'll meet you here in four days.
Tell no-one I have returned to Camelot.

64
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,065
- You're late.
- Sorry.

65
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:35,045
The floors...

66
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,030
- Whose clothes are these?
- They're mine. I washed them specially.

67
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,225
Are you sure this is a good idea?

68
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:48,991
Pretending to be somebody else

69
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:51,395
is the only way to get people
to be honest with me.

70
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,435
Grab my bag, will you.

71
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:55,910
To pass as a peasant,
carry your own bag.

72
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,835
You're forgetting something, Merlin.

73
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,150
No-one will know it's my bag.

74
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,125
There must be easier ways
to prove yourself.

75
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:06,430
Shut up, Merlin.

76
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,545
I was there in person.

77
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,775
Odin has put a price
on Prince Arthur's head.

78
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,245
Surely he wouldn't dare.

79
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,910
He is blinded by grief.

80
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,270
The assassin Myror
has accepted the bounty.

81
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:19,695
I've heard of this Myror.

82
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:22,465
I believe he's heading for Camelot
as we speak.

83
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:27,750
I bring you this information
at great risk to myself.

84
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:36,325
Double the guards. I want this assassin
intercepted before he reaches Camelot.

85
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:10,665
My Lord.

86
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,710
It's good of you
to let me stay in your home.

87
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,430
I'm happy to help.

88
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:19,455
Food.

89
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:21,775
I'll prepare some food for you.

90
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,875
I can't believe
you took me into this.

91
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:33,595
You can't really expect me to stay.

92
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,932
You need to stay here. We can trust her
not to tell anyone.

93
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:38,426
Does anyone believe it?

94
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:42,385
If you really can't cope without
your big bed and your soft pillows...

95
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:44,705
This will be fine.

96
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:50,150
How are the preparations coming along?
You found someone for the tournament?

97
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,465
Absolutely. He's a farmer

98
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,830
from one of the outlying villages

99
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:57,255
and no-one will recognise him.

100
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:59,885
But does he look the part?

101
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,590
Great.

102
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,655
From now on,
you are Sir William of Deira.

103
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:38,830
Imagine you're really... arrogant.

104
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:41,230
Knights think they're the best.

105
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,655
It's not arrogance.
Ignore him, he's an idiot.

106
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,990
A knight must behave with honour

107
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,400
and nobility.

108
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,550
That's... better.

109
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,230
You must convince everyone

110
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:57,390
that you were born
into a noble family.

111
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:04,390
Polish my armour, boy.

112
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,145
Now you're getting the hang of it.

113
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,390
Good point.
You do need to polish our armour.

114
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:24,990
Glad to see you're resting.

115
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,815
I take it that means you've got
the energy to clean my leech tank.

116
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:38,665
It's been a long day.

117
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:40,345
I think I'll...

118
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,870
turn in for the night.

119
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:43,825
Is this my bed?

120
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:47,905
Of course.

121
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,800
I hope you'll be comfortable.

122
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:52,870
I'm sure I will be.

123
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,075
Good night, Guinevere.

124
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,725
Good night, my Lord.

125
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,875
Halt.

126
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:09,835
Show yourself.

127
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:16,025
What do you do in the palace?

128
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:19,045
I came to seek an audience
with Prince Arthur.

129
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:23,270
- What's your name?
- My name is Myror.

130
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:32,495
Why are you here?

131
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:34,475
Your information was wrong.

132
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:37,575
Prince Arthur is not among the party
travelling to the Northern Borders.

133
00:11:37,745 --> 00:11:40,335
- The Prince left yesterday.
- They must have separated.

134
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:43,065
- Perhaps he has returned to Camelot.
- Not that I've heard.

135
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,085
His return would have been announced
at Court.

136
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:50,055
It would seem the Prince
does not want to be found.

137
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,630
Remember the plan.

138
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:12,750
I'm competing in the tournament,
but no-one will know that it's me.

139
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,615
All you have to do is acknowledge
the crowd at the end of the match.

140
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,025
Act like you belong there...

141
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,510
and people will believe you do.

142
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:32,445
Knights of the realm,

143
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:34,270
welcome to Camelot.

144
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:38,205
You've trained for this day
for many years...

145
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,670
He hasn't fallen off his horse!

146
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:42,990
I suppose that's something.

147
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,070
... and your skill to the test.

148
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:48,625
Today, you will fight
for glory and for honour.

149
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,110
For this is the ultimate
test of courage.

150
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:53,985
It will be the measure of you
as men.

151
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:55,990
Only the most skilful,

152
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,430
the most fearless among you,
will emerge

153
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,310
as a worthy champion.

154
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:13,815
They're ready for you, sire.

155
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:57,875
- You must go and acknowledge the crowd.
- How do you do that?

156
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,150
You wave, they cheer,
it's not difficult.

157
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,464
I do all the work,
someone else gets all the praise.

158
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,425
Know the feeling.

159
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:11,175
When I win this tournament,
I will reveal my true identity,

160
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,605
- get the credit I deserve.
- Of course you will.

161
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:17,345
Don't just stand there,

162
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:18,928
help me off with my armour.

163
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:21,590
Remember to polish it
before tomorrow,

164
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,015
the horse needs grooming and don't
forget to repair the broken lances.

165
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,115
Do you have news on the whereabouts
of Prince Arthur?

166
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:35,925
Everyone believes he is travelling
to the Northern Borders.

167
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:39,037
But I have discovered
Arthur's servant remains in Camelot.

168
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:40,935
Who is this servant?

169
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:42,105
That's him.

170
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:47,675
Why is he working
for another knight?

171
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:08,470
- Is this about the leech tank?
- How very perceptive of you, Merlin.

172
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,169
I'll clean it tomorrow.

173
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,550
Will that be before or after you scrub
the floors and done the laundry?

174
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:36,470
I heard the ladies of the Court
are quite impressed with Sir William.

175
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,070
- They think he's handsome.
- Typical.

176
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:44,710
They wouldn't know a real knight if he
whacked him round his head with a lance.

177
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:49,935
Why are you doing this?

178
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:57,430
I fear that people respect me
just because of my title.

179
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,790
- I don't think that's true of everyone.
- Would you tell me if it were?

180
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:09,085
When I'm competing as William,

181
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,708
my title doesn't matter,
nobody gives me any special treatment.

182
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:14,125
So, when I win this tournament,

183
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:18,415
If I win this tournament,
it will be because

184
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:19,995
I deserve it.

185
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,315
Not because I am

186
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,635
Prince Arthur.

187
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:33,295
I think I'll take a bath.

188
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:36,884
That might be difficult,
seeing as I don't have a bath tub.

189
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,155
Really?

190
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:41,346
Perhaps you could

191
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:45,030
prepare me a bowl of hot water.
I take it you have a bowl.

192
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,590
I think I can manage a bowl.

193
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:56,110
I'll walk all the way down to the well
and fetch some water, then, shall I?

194
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:14,885
Merlin, on your feet.
Arthur may be away, but I'm not.

195
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,350
Why is my leech tank still dirty?

196
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:20,989
Where do you get the idea you can
sit around all day doing nothing?

197
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:24,990
Do you think I sit around
doing nothing?

198
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:30,670
I haven't had a chance to sit around and
do nothing since I arrived in Camelot.

199
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:33,205
I'm too busy running around
after Arthur. "Do this, do that."

200
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,430
When it's not Arthur, I'm doing chores
for you, and if I'm not doing that

201
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,990
I'm fulfilling my destiny. Do you know
how many times I've saved Arthur's life?

202
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,055
I've lost count.

203
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:45,630
Do I get any thanks? No. I have
fought griffins, witches, bandits,

204
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,670
I have been punched, poisoned,
pelted with fruit, and all the while,

205
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,035
I have to hide who I really am because
if anyone finds out, I will be executed.

206
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:54,515
Sometimes I feel like I'm being pulled
in so many directions,

207
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:56,189
I don't know which way to turn.

208
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,290
Sir Alynor
has advanced to the final.

209
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:20,785
You are not impressed
by this Sir William of Deira?

210
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:23,415
I believe he's an arrogant pig.

211
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:27,350
Congratulations,
you are in the final.

212
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:34,245
Go on, then, your people await you.

213
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,690
No-one can say
Sir Leon let me win this time.

214
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:43,105
Sounds like the crowd
have really taken to William.

215
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,189
That will change
when I reveal my identity.

216
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:48,670
You really miss getting
all the attention, don't you?

217
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:51,445
Just go and water the horse,
will you?

218
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:02,985
He's a fine horse.

219
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:08,310
I see your master will be in the final.
He's extremely skilled with a lance.

220
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:10,845
He's doing well.

221
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:12,585
Just one more match to go.

222
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:15,830
- Tell me, what is he like to work for?
- Between you and me,

223
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:18,069
he can be a prat.

224
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:22,357
So you are no longer
working for Prince Arthur.

225
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:26,765
Not right now. Arthur is away.

226
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,230
I'm just...

227
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:29,750
helping out.

228
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,990
Well, I wish your master luck

229
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,470
in the final.

230
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:37,995
Thanks.

231
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:44,715
Just a minute.

232
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,150
Have you got a needle and thread?

233
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:52,175
My shirt needs mending.

234
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:58,950
Is this where you sleep?
Where's your bed?

235
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,435
You're sleeping in it.

236
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,349
Why didn't you say something?

237
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:06,365
How could I?

238
00:22:06,945 --> 00:22:08,495
You're Prince Arthur.

239
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:12,589
you didn't give me the chance.
You just assumed the bed was yours.

240
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,670
How can I know if you don't tell me?

241
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,730
You shouldn't need to be told
to think of someone other than yourself.

242
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:27,349
Is there anything else
you'd like to say?

243
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,196
Please...

244
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,829
I'd like to hear it.

245
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:33,915
If there's something
you want to say to me,

246
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:35,629
don't let me stop you.

247
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,749
You don't have any idea, do you?

248
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:41,589
- About what?
- How rude and arrogant you can be.

249
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:46,150
This is my home
and you are my guest in it.

250
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,310
You are used
to more luxurious quarters,

251
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,840
but that is not an excuse
to be so rude.

252
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,590
Titles don't matter to you,
but you behave like a prince

253
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,645
and expect me to wait on you
like a servant.

254
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:58,155
Saying it means nothing
if your actions betray you.

255
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:01,549
Would it kill you to say please
and thank you once in a while?

256
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:05,818
My Lord.

257
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:13,029
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

258
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,827
No, I think that's it.

259
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:26,709
You're right.

260
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,829
You have invited me into your home

261
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:35,187
and I have behaved appallingly.

262
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,789
- I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
- Really?

263
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:41,229
Perhaps a little.

264
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:44,280
There's no excuse.

265
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,109
I'll make it up to you.

266
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:49,429
Tonight I will make dinner for you.

267
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,055
- You're going to cook me dinner?
- I am.

268
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,475
Now, go for a walk
or do what whatever it is girls do

269
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,725
- at this time of the evening.
- A walk would be nice.

270
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,789
Your dinner will be ready
when you return.

271
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:12,850
Where's Arthur?

272
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,989
He's cooking me dinner.

273
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:17,744
Arthur's cooking?

274
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,549
Merlin, thank God.

275
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,430
Gwen says you're cooking.

276
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,823
Fetch me two dinners
from the palace kitchens.

277
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:36,789
So, you're not cooking?

278
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:39,962
Gwen doesn't need to know that.
As far as she's concerned,

279
00:24:40,132 --> 00:24:43,509
dinner will have been prepared
and cooked by me.

280
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:45,261
You trying to impress her?

281
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:48,629
Don't be ridiculous, Merlin.
And get me a decent shirt, will you?

282
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,309
Your clothes are making me itch
all over. It's like having fleas.

283
00:25:42,635 --> 00:25:44,429
She's coming.
Quick - out the back way.

284
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:47,582
Do something with this.

285
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:52,187
I hope Gwen's impressed
with your cooking.

286
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,989
Perfect timing.

287
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,928
Thank you.

288
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:31,219
This is delicious.

289
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,765
I'm glad you like it.

290
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:22,269
Dinner's ready.

291
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:26,366
What I said this morning...

292
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:28,910
It is I
who should be apologising to you.

293
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:32,909
I have failed to appreciate
just how heavy your burden must be.

294
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,549
- I shouldn't have lost my temper.
- It's no wonder you're upset.

295
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,989
So much resting
on your young shoulders.

296
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:42,349
Now that Arthur's away,
you must take time to enjoy yourself.

297
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,650
What about the leech tank?

298
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,549
Don't even think
about the leech tank.

299
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,230
Really?

300
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:52,349
All this talk of leeches
will put us off our dinner.

301
00:27:55,504 --> 00:27:57,478
Where did that chicken come from?

302
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Come in.

303
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,909
The King commands your presence.

304
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:07,847
Can you determine a cause of death?

305
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:10,750
His neck's been broken.
There's scarcely a mark on the flesh.

306
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,056
Whoever killed him
knew exactly what he was doing.

307
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:15,928
Earlier this evening, an intruder
was spotted in the lower town.

308
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:18,909
Then I fear it's true.
Odin sent an assassin to kill Arthur.

309
00:28:19,268 --> 00:28:20,368
An assassin?

310
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,740
Have you any word from Arthur
since he left for the Northern Borders?

311
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,910
No. None.

312
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,841
With this assassin in Camelot,
we must be thankful Arthur isn't here.

313
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:29,399
Search the entire town.

314
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,550
I want the assassin found
before Arthur returns.

315
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:38,390
So, do I have any more annoying habits
you wish to tell me about?

316
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:41,310
No. None.

317
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:44,550
There's something else, isn't there?

318
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,340
What is it?

319
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:50,349
The truth is, you snore.

320
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:54,349
- I do not snore.
- You do.

321
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:57,979
The first night,
I thought a pig got into the house.

322
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:01,549
- So now I'm a pig. Thank you.
- I just meant you sound like a pig.

323
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:04,949
I think I'd better stop talking!

324
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,840
I'll do that.

325
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,349
Where did you get those plates?

326
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:13,371
From the cupboard.

327
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,611
They have the royal seal.

328
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:19,905
They're from the palace kitchens.
I've washed enough of them to know.

329
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:22,030
That's where our food
also came from.

330
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,421
I can kill a chicken

331
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:25,829
just don't ask me to cook it.
That's what servants are for.

332
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:33,179
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I'm not ashamed to be a servant.

333
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:34,349
I'm not a liar.

334
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,921
We had a nice meal together.
What does it matter where it came from?

335
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:41,029
Because I thought
you'd shown some humility.

336
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:44,909
You had done something kind for me
even though I'm just a servant.

337
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:48,589
A good king should respect
his people no matter who they are.

338
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,920
I know I have much to learn.

339
00:29:58,783 --> 00:30:01,012
There are some things
that I'm terrible at,

340
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:02,982
cooking being one of them,

341
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:06,413
but also,

342
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:10,844
knowing what to say
to someone I care about...

343
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:22,389
There's an assassin in Camelot.
He's here to kill you.

344
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,840
The assassin killed a guard.

345
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,334
Your father said Odin sent him.

346
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:31,949
Why would he want you dead?

347
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:37,069
Because I killed his son.

348
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:41,630
Odin's son challenged me to a fight.

349
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,349
I had no quarrel with him.
I asked him to withdraw.

350
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:47,728
Perhaps he felt
he had to prove himself.

351
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:50,634
I still see his face.

352
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:55,777
He looked so scared.

353
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:58,949
You cannot blame yourself.

354
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:02,255
No-one but us knows where you are.

355
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:05,549
If the assassin can't find you,
he can't kill you.

356
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:11,469
- May I continue to stay here?
- Of course. For as long as you need.

357
00:31:12,326 --> 00:31:13,326
Thank you.

358
00:31:14,424 --> 00:31:16,760
- I'll sleep on the floor tonight.
- Have my bed.

359
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,709
- Need to be rested for the tournament.
- I'll not hear of it. Good night.

360
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:22,734
Good night.

361
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,489
Fetch a mattress from my quarters
and bring it up here.

362
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:34,659
- How can I carry a mattress on my own?
- I don't know. Strap it to your back.

363
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,989
One more match,
tournament will be over.

364
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:54,281
You can go back
to being Prince Arthur.

365
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:05,109
I thought you might wear it...
for luck.

366
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:57,493
I must go.

367
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,725
They're nearly ready for you, sire.

368
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,010
Sir Alynor.

369
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:53,069
Good luck in the final.

370
00:35:42,424 --> 00:35:44,270
His lance pierced my armour.

371
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:47,658
- You're losing too much blood.
- Do what you can.

372
00:35:47,828 --> 00:35:49,893
Have to be back on the course
within five minutes

373
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:52,705
- or I forfeit the match.
- You can't joust. You're too injured.

374
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,114
I have never withdrawn from a match.

375
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,790
I do not intend to start now.

376
00:35:57,209 --> 00:35:59,430
You would risk your life
to protect your pride?

377
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,035
You have nothing to prove,
least of all to me.

378
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:08,669
I have everything to prove...

379
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:10,738
to myself.

380
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,069
You'll have to pass me my lance.

381
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:46,060
This is madness.

382
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:54,177
- Where's Arthur?
- He's about to joust.

383
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,597
He's jousting against the assassin.

384
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,086
You were jousting
against the assassin.

385
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:53,806
He killed Sir Alynor
and took his place.

386
00:38:57,393 --> 00:39:00,043
The people are waiting
for their champion.

387
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:02,989
It's time to reveal yourself.

388
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:09,469
You must go and collect the trophy.

389
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:14,309
This was going to be
your moment of glory.

390
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:21,011
Perhaps this...

391
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:23,056
is a time for humility.

392
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,509
Merlin, who is this man?
Where's Sir Alynor?

393
00:40:17,026 --> 00:40:20,829
The assassin attacked us.
I was injured while killing him.

394
00:40:21,608 --> 00:40:24,823
Odin must pay for his actions.
We must strike back at him.

395
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:28,029
Surely you understand the grief
he feels for the loss of his son.

396
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,694
We should try
to make peace with him.

397
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:34,549
There's been enough bloodshed.

398
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:38,749
Perhaps you're right.

399
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:41,629
How was rest of your trip? Fruitful?

400
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:43,776
Very.

401
00:40:47,502 --> 00:40:48,829
I learnt a great deal.

402
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:54,229
- How was the tournament?
- Excellent.

403
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:56,509
We have a new champion,
Sir William of Deira.

404
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:02,109
I'm sorry
I missed all the excitement.

405
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:36,149
What happened
while I was staying with you...

406
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:41,749
I'm afraid my father
would never understand.

407
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,789
You don't have to explain.

408
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:50,898
Perhaps when you are King...

409
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:54,296
things will be different.

410
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,281
This is horrible.

411
00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:43,190
So disgusting.

412
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,960
Well, perhaps you'll think twice
about lying to me in future.

413
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:51,954
- There's something on your face.
- Where?

414
00:43:09,201 --> 00:43:11,309
- It's magic.
- What about the druids?

415
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:13,189
They help people like you.

416
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:15,509
Uther thinks
that Morgana's been kidnapped.

417
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:19,549
This way!

418
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,950
It would be better
if the witch never knew

419
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,109
the true extent of her powers.
