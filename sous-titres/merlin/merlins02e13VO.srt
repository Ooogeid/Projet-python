00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:03,285
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:05,261
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,022
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:09,541
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,950
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:20,870
I know you're tired,
but make one last effort for me.

7
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,990
Every shot must count.

8
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:36,110
- They can't suffer a 3rd night of this.
- We must trust in Arthur.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,910
I do.
But even he has little chance.

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,254
I'm sorry you're having to do this.

11
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:46,950
Why? You're not to blame.

12
00:00:58,901 --> 00:00:59,830
Flame up!

13
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,430
Stay strong,

14
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,790
for tonight is not your night to die,
I will make sure of that.

15
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,430
Hold firm!

16
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:25,430
Hold...

17
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,750
Now!

18
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,710
<i>Arthur's Knights</i>

19
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,110
Merlin - 2x13
<i>The Last Dragonlord</i>

20
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:15,630
We've no clean water.

21
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,910
I know, but it's too dangerous
to go out there.

22
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:22,372
Gwen, don't!

23
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,027
Clear the square!

24
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:39,990
Do not imagine

25
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,771
that your petty magic can harm me!

26
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,258
Why are you doing this?

27
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:50,070
You're killing innocent people!

28
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,628
You shouldn't have risked your life.

29
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:06,270
I wasn't going
to let anything happen to you.

30
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:29,110
- Are you hurt?
- There's nothing I can do.

31
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,638
My magic is no good.

32
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,510
- It doesn't work.
- Dragons aren't monsters.

33
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,714
They're creatures
of wonder and magic.

34
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:40,390
You must realise
that they are immune to your powers.

35
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:48,590
The dead number 49 men,

36
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:52,670
27 women, a further 18 women
and children are unaccounted for.

37
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,990
Most of last night's fires are now out.
The castle walls,

38
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,077
in particular the Western section,
are near to collapse. I could go on.

39
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:02,510
Do we have any further idea
on how the beast escaped?

40
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,790
I regret to say, Sire, we don't.

41
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,990
There must be some way
to rid ourselves of this...

42
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,315
aberration.

43
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:23,270
We need a Dragonlord.

44
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,146
You know well that's not an option.

45
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:27,470
Sire, what if...

46
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:30,350
there was indeed
one last Dragonlord left?

47
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:32,990
- That's not possible.
- But if there was?

48
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:43,230
- What are you saying?
- It may be just rumour...

49
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,490
Go on.

50
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,344
I'm not exactly sure, but...

51
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,910
I think his name is Balinor.

52
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:52,550
- Balinor?
- Where does he live?

53
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,110
He was last seen
in Cenred's kingdom,

54
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,150
in the border town of Engerd,
but that was many years ago.

55
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,670
If this man still exists,
then it is our duty to find him.

56
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,950
Our treaty with Cenred no longer holds,
we are at war.

57
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,931
If they discover you beyond our border,
they will kill you.

58
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,350
I will go alone.
I'll not be detected.

59
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,190
- No, it is too dangerous.
- More dangerous than staying here?

60
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,830
I will not stand by and watch my men die
when I had the chance to save them.

61
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,190
They're my orders.

62
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,070
Do not make this a test of wills.

63
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,590
I am not talking to you as a father,
but as a King!

64
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,630
I will ride immediately.

65
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:35,270
- My concern is for you.
- Mine is for Camelot.

66
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:39,419
I will send word
when I have found him.

67
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,997
Prepare the horses.

68
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,442
Who were the Dragonlords?

69
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,030
There were men who could

70
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:02,310
talk to the dragons, tame them.

71
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,058
What happened to them?

72
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,590
Uther believed the art of the Dragonlord
was too close to magic,

73
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,150
so he had them all rounded up...

74
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:12,942
and slaughtered.

75
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,247
But one survived.

76
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,710
- How did you know?
- I helped him escape.

77
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:32,070
You've never heard the name Balinor?

78
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,390
Your mother never mentioned him?

79
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:37,923
My mother?

80
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,356
She took him in.

81
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,830
- She stood up against Uther?
- Yes.

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,470
- She was brave.
- Yes.

83
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:48,434
When Uther discovered
where Balinor was,

84
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:51,296
he sent knights to Ealdor
to hunt him down.

85
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,990
- He was forced to flee.
- Why didn't my mother tell me this?

86
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:02,137
I promised her
I would never speak of these things.

87
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:03,110
Of what?

88
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:06,070
I've always treated you as my son.

89
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:10,503
But that is not what you are.

90
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:13,945
The man you are going to look for...

91
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,870
is your father.

92
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,510
My father...?

93
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:35,789
He was a Dragonlord?

94
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:41,750
Why did no-one ever tell me?

95
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:44,390
I wanted to. Your mother feared
it'd be too dangerous.

96
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,070
I had a right to know.

97
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:49,270
She wanted to protect you.

98
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,840
I had a right to know.

99
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,674
Have you got everything you need?

100
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,992
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

101
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:09,550
I know that.

102
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:11,623
Come on, Merlin.

103
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,390
- You're ready?
- No thanks to you.

104
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,710
- Are you okay?
- It's just a scratch.

105
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,030
Whatever happens,
do not let Arthur know who this man is.

106
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:34,950
Uther would view the son of a Dragonlord
with the deepest suspicion.

107
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:57,820
This is it.

108
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,550
One more step
and we're in Cenred's kingdom.

109
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,470
This Balinor better be worth it.

110
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,750
Greetings!

111
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,110
We're looking for a man
named Balinor.

112
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,195
I'm willing to pay...

113
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,550
handsomely.

114
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,120
Never heard of him.

115
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,830
- You think one of these men is Balinor?
- I hope not.

116
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,770
So do I.

117
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,984
- What is wrong with you today?
- What?

118
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,694
It pains me to admit it,
but I do enjoy your surly retorts.

119
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:20,008
In fact, it is probably
your only redeemable feature.

120
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:21,824
Thanks.

121
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:24,110
There are loads of servants
who can serve,

122
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:28,445
but so few are capable
of making a complete prat of themselves.

123
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:32,270
- What?
- Nothing.

124
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:34,430
It's something. Tell me.

125
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,470
All right,

126
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,215
I know I'm a prince...

127
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:44,246
so we can't be friends.

128
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,950
- But if I wasn't a prince...
- What?

129
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,284
Well, then...

130
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:51,172
I think we'd probably get on.

131
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
So?

132
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:55,590
So that means you can tell me.

133
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,110
That's true. If you weren't a prince,
I'd tell you to mind your own business.

134
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,608
Are you missing Gaius?

135
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:06,190
Something like that.

136
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,750
What is it?

137
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,510
I'll tell you.

138
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,190
I'm worried about everyone in Camelot.
I hope they're all right.

139
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,957
So do I.

140
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,440
Hold...

141
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:45,430
Now!

142
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:43,783
What's...

143
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,910
- Do you know the punishment for theft?
- I've got children to feed...

144
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:48,790
Tell me where to find Balinor.

145
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,185
- I don't know.
- What do you know of him?

146
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,505
Nothing, I...

147
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,030
Do you value your life?

148
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,830
- It's been many years since I saw him.
- But you know where he lives?

149
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,390
You must travel
through the forest of Merendra,

150
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:06,750
to the foot of Feorre mountain.

151
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:10,230
There, you will find the cave
where Balinor dwells.

152
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,345
- But don't get your hopes up.
- Why?

153
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:21,540
He will not welcome you.

154
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:23,910
Balinor's hates
everyone and everything.

155
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,380
A cave's the best place for him.

156
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,510
It's all right.

157
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,070
No, it's the wound.
Let me have look.

158
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,621
- What d'you want here, boy?
- My friend, he's sick. He needs help.

159
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,630
Show me, boy.

160
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:31,070
What are you waiting for?
Fetch him!

161
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,008
He needs rest.

162
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,332
Will he be all right?

163
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,527
By morning.

164
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,286
Thank you.

165
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:30,910
Looks good.

166
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,790
- How long have you lived here?
- A few winters.

167
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,070
- Must be hard.
- Why are you here?

168
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:44,310
Just travelling.

169
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:51,543
We're looking for someone.

170
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:58,154
I was told... Well, they said
that he lived somewhere hereabouts.

171
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:02,030
A man named... Balinor.

172
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:10,739
You've never heard of him?

173
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:16,790
- He was a dragonlord.
- He's passed on.

174
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,630
- You knew him?
- Who are you?

175
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:22,237
I'm...

176
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,830
Merlin.

177
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:28,790
And him?

178
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,350
- He's my master.
- His name?

179
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,468
His name is... Lancelot.

180
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:40,190
He's a Knight, you know,
but a nice one.

181
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:42,252
His name...

182
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,670
is Arthur Pendragon.

183
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:47,366
He is Uther's son.

184
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:50,030
- Yes.
- This is Cenred's kingdom.

185
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,188
He's asking for trouble.

186
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,230
What do you want from me?

187
00:18:56,472 --> 00:18:57,430
Are you Balinor?

188
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,899
The Great Dragon
is attacking Camelot.

189
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:09,990
His name is Kilgharrah.

190
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,110
We can't stop him.
Only you, a Dragonlord, can.

191
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:16,079
He does not act blindly.

192
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,830
He kills for a reason, vengeance.
This is of Uther's making.

193
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,350
He's killing innocent people.

194
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,710
Uther pursued me.

195
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,350
He hunted me like an animal.

196
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:28,070
I know.

197
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,491
What d'you know
about anybody's life, boy?

198
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:36,390
Uther asked me to use my power
to bring the last dragon to Camelot.

199
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,400
He said he wanted
to make peace with it,

200
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,779
but he did not.

201
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:42,037
He lied to me. He betrayed me.

202
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:46,070
- And you want me to protect this man?
- I want you to protect Camelot.

203
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,512
He killed every one of my kind,

204
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:50,230
I alone escaped.

205
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,270
Where did you go?

206
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:57,758
There is a place called Ealdor.

207
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,339
I had a life there.

208
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,444
A woman...

209
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:10,590
A good woman.

210
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,150
Ealdor is beyond Uther's realm,

211
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,975
but still he pursued me.

212
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,310
Why would he not let me be?

213
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,470
What was it that I had done,

214
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,715
that he wanted
to destroy the life I'd built,

215
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,619
abandon the woman I loved?

216
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,893
He sent Knights to kill me.

217
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:30,350
I was forced to come here...
to this.

218
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:36,590
I understand how Kilgharrah feels.

219
00:20:38,523 --> 00:20:41,494
He's lost every one of his kind,
every one of his kin.

220
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,471
You want to know how that feels?

221
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,160
Look around, boy.

222
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:53,310
Let Uther die.

223
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,923
Let Camelot fall.

224
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,270
- You want everyone in Camelot to die?
- Why should I care?

225
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,510
- What if one of them was your son?
- I don't have a son.

226
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:12,183
And if I told you...

227
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,164
I feel great!

228
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,390
What the hell did you give me?

229
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,510
It was all down to Balinor.

230
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:49,750
So we've found him, then.
Thank heaven for that.

231
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:54,070
- It doesn't mean he's willing to help.
- What?

232
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:56,659
You won't persuade him.

233
00:21:57,336 --> 00:21:59,119
Does he know what's at stake?

234
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:03,376
What kind of a man is he?

235
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,910
I don't know.

236
00:22:06,582 --> 00:22:08,315
I thought he'd be something more.

237
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:43,670
Are you missing Morgana?

238
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,006
She's stronger than people think.

239
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,670
I believe that, wherever she is,
she'll be all right.

240
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:54,550
And Arthur?

241
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:57,510
You care a lot for him, don't you?

242
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:00,070
Everyone does.

243
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,750
I think he cares the same way
about you.

244
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:10,439
It's all right,

245
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,550
I won't tell anyone.

246
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:15,750
I know it can never be.

247
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,733
Well, the world is a strange place,
Guinevere.

248
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:24,870
Never underestimate
the power of love.

249
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:28,550
I've seen it change many things.

250
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:38,227
What did he say?

251
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,988
He will change his mind.

252
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:43,110
- He said that?
- Just... give him a moment.

253
00:23:55,396 --> 00:23:56,230
Farewell.

254
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,990
It's your decision?

255
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:05,414
I will not help Uther.

256
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,230
Then the people of Camelot
are damned!

257
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,350
So be it.

258
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:13,799
Have you no conscience?

259
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,704
You should ask that question...

260
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:19,230
of your father.

261
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,566
And you are no better than him.

262
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,870
Don't waste your time, Merlin.

263
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,222
Gaius spoke
of the nobility of Dragonlords.

264
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,950
He was wrong.

265
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:46,270
A good man.

266
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:53,564
I was hoping you'd be like him.

267
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,218
I wanted...

268
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:06,429
Well, there's no point.

269
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,150
I always thought that silence
would be a blessing with you,

270
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,910
but I find it just as irritating.

271
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,630
You're a riddle.

272
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:32,750
- A riddle?
- Yes.

273
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:35,222
But I've got to quite like you.

274
00:25:36,323 --> 00:25:38,310
Now I realise you're not
as big a fool as you look.

275
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,619
I feel the same.

276
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:46,060
Now that I realize
you're not as arrogant as you sound.

277
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,190
You still think I'm arrogant?

278
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,333
More...

279
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:52,390
supercilious.

280
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:56,470
That's a big word, Merlin.
You sure you know what it means?

281
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,452
- Condescending.
- Very good.

282
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,150
- Patronising.
- Not exactly.

283
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,946
- No, you're these as well.
- Hang on.

284
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:04,150
Overbearing.

285
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,230
Very overbearing.

286
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,790
But you wanted me to talk.

287
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,790
Careful, boy.

288
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:27,060
I thought you might need some help.

289
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:29,288
This is dangerous country.

290
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,590
Will you return to Camelot with us?

291
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,858
You were right, Merlin.

292
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:38,190
There are some in Camelot
who risked their lives for me.

293
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,070
I owe a debt that must be repaid.

294
00:26:42,357 --> 00:26:44,750
If you succeed in killing the dragon,
you will not go unrewarded.

295
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,310
I seek no reward.

296
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,081
Great.

297
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:52,905
Let's eat.

298
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,470
- This wood is too wet.
- Don't worry.

299
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,630
We'll find a way to make it light.

300
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,979
When you healed Arthur,

301
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,693
I heard you mumble some words.

302
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,470
An ancient prayer.

303
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,556
I thought it might have been
more than that.

304
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:23,630
The Old Religion
can teach us many things.

305
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,357
The Old Religion is that something
you were taught?

306
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,174
It is not something you can learn.

307
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,789
Either it's a part
of you or it isn't.

308
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:36,390
My father knew that
and his father before him.

309
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:39,536
Were they also Dragonlords?

310
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,990
We'll need some kindling.

311
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,488
You mentioned...

312
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:50,710
You spoke of Ealdor.

313
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,110
You took refuge with a woman.

314
00:27:55,486 --> 00:27:57,590
- That was a long time ago.
- I grew up there.

315
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:04,230
I know the woman.

316
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:06,787
Hunith?

317
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,590
She is alive?

318
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:14,030
She's my mother.

319
00:28:16,421 --> 00:28:17,725
Then she married.

320
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:21,550
That's good.

321
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:24,101
She never married.

322
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:29,990
I'm your son.

323
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:45,270
I don't know
what it is to have a son.

324
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:49,779
Or I a father.

325
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,746
You must not tell Arthur.

326
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:49,530
Why did you never return?

327
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:53,910
I thought her life would be better
without me.

328
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,470
Why?

329
00:29:58,225 --> 00:29:59,678
Uther wanted me dead.

330
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:03,259
If he'd found me,
he'd have killed me

331
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:05,279
and your mother.

332
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,670
I wanted her to be safe.

333
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,360
We could've come with you.

334
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:19,489
And what kind of life
would you have had here?

335
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:23,003
We'd have been...

336
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,539
happy.

337
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:40,357
When we have finished in Camelot...

338
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,510
I will to take you to Ealdor.

339
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:49,110
She won't recognise me.

340
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,416
I see her in you.

341
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:05,470
You have her kindness.

342
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,510
How did you become a Dragonlord?

343
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:17,150
You don't choose
to become a Dragonlord,

344
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,145
it's not something you're taught.

345
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:21,110
It's a sacred gift.

346
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,830
For thousands of years, it's been
handed down from father to son.

347
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,430
And that is
what you must now become.

348
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,670
I'd like that.

349
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:40,550
Like all Dragonlords,

350
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,230
you won't know for sure
that you have that power

351
00:31:44,254 --> 00:31:46,790
until you face your first dragon.

352
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,390
You should sleep.

353
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,906
We've a big day ahead of us.

354
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:08,963
Good night, son.

355
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:20,150
Sleep well, Father.

356
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,910
Cenred's men!

357
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,870
I see you have your father's talent.

358
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:03,565
Please! No. Please.

359
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,252
- I can save you.
- Listen to me.

360
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:08,029
When you face the Dragon...

361
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:10,169
remember be strong.

362
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:13,430
A dragon's heart
is on its right side,

363
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,470
- not its left.
- I can't do it alone.

364
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,752
Listen to me.

365
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:19,966
You are my son.

366
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:25,270
I've seen enough in you
to know you will make me proud.

367
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,950
Camelot is doomed.

368
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:53,470
I'm sorry, I have failed you.

369
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,895
The last Dragonlord is dead.

370
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,310
There were many years
when I might've wished for that news.

371
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,830
All is not lost.

372
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,628
We have to fight
the monster ourselves,

373
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:20,300
so let us ride out
and fight on our own terms...

374
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,470
on open ground,

375
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,390
on horseback,
where we can manoeuvre better.

376
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,790
- There is no point.
- So what?

377
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,764
We stand here...

378
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:31,830
watch Camelot fall?

379
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:42,830
You have my blessing.

380
00:36:50,223 --> 00:36:51,470
I need a dozen Knights.

381
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,590
Those who do not wish to fight can do so
without stain on their character,

382
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:59,723
for those brave enough to volunteer
should know...

383
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:03,270
the chances of returning are slim.

384
00:38:04,437 --> 00:38:05,350
What happened?

385
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:07,788
I couldn't save him.

386
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,711
He said the Dragonlord's gift
is passed from father to son.

387
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,310
That is true.

388
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:25,155
When I faced the Great Dragon...

389
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,150
my magic was useless.

390
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,731
Your father wasn't dead.

391
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,190
It's only then
you can inherit his powers.

392
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:45,470
You think I am strong enough
to stand up to him?

393
00:38:48,304 --> 00:38:50,030
Only time will tell.

394
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,272
Look on the bright side.

395
00:39:00,442 --> 00:39:02,661
Chances are you're not going to have
to clean this again.

396
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:04,475
You must be careful today.

397
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:07,595
- Do not force the battle.
- Yes, Sire.

398
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:10,535
- I'm serious.
- I can hear that.

399
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:16,297
- Let matters take their course...
- If I die... please...

400
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:17,698
What?

401
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:26,791
The Dragonlord today.

402
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:31,243
I saw you.

403
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,796
One thing
I tell all my young Knights...

404
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:40,990
no man is worth your tears.

405
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,950
You're certainly not.

406
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,030
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

407
00:39:55,215 --> 00:39:57,390
The chances are I'm going to die.

408
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,510
Yeah, you probably would
if I wasn't there.

409
00:40:00,455 --> 00:40:01,259
Right!

410
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:04,070
Do you know how many times
I had to save your Royal backside?

411
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,586
Well, at least you've got
your sense of humour back.

412
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,310
Are you going to face this dragon?

413
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:18,750
I'm not going to sit here and watch.

414
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:25,170
I know it's hard for you
to understand how I feel, but...

415
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:30,070
I care a lot about that armour.
I'm not going to let you mess it up.

416
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,109
Hold firm.

417
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,790
Hold!

418
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:01,695
Now!

419
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,643
Stop... Stop!

420
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:13,354
<i>You are the last Dragonlord now.</i>

421
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:16,880
<i>You alone carry the ancient gift.</i>

422
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:19,861
<i>Deep within yourself,</i>

423
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:23,411
<i>you must find the voice
that you and Kilgharrah share,</i>

424
00:43:24,408 --> 00:43:28,171
<i>for your soul and his are brothers.</i>

425
00:43:29,437 --> 00:43:31,351
<i>When you speak to him as kin,</i>

426
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,831
<i>he must obey your will.</i>

427
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:25,630
I am the last of my kind, Merlin.

428
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,067
Whatever wrongs I have done,

429
00:44:29,942 --> 00:44:32,430
do not make me responsible

430
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:35,307
for the death of my noble breed.

431
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:49,234
Go!

432
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:50,710
Leave!

433
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:55,397
If you ever attack Camelot again,

434
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:57,590
I will kill you.

435
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,665
I have shown you mercy.

436
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,713
Now you must do the same to others.

437
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:12,948
Young warlock,

438
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:17,332
what you have shown
is what you will be.

439
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:21,393
I will not forget your clemency.

440
00:45:22,822 --> 00:45:26,206
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

441
00:45:46,155 --> 00:45:47,272
What happened?

442
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,550
You dealt him a mortal blow.

443
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:55,350
He's gone?

444
00:45:59,614 --> 00:46:00,470
You did it.

445
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,122
You did it.

446
00:46:56,164 --> 00:46:57,666
I thought I'd lost you.

447
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:05,708
My boy!

448
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:11,670
I felt him there with me.

449
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:13,990
He'll always be with you.

450
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:16,151
I hope so.

451
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,270
Merlin, I know I can never compare
with your father,

452
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,104
but for what it's worth...

453
00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:24,230
you've still got me.

454
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,350
Well, I suppose
I'll just have to make do.

455
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:43,215
<i>Arthur's Knights</i> will return...
