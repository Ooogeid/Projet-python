1
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:07,143
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

2
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:10,063
His name...Merlin.

3
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:47,783
(Merlin.)

4
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,568
What is it?

5
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:55,927
I don't know.

6
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:58,167
We'll surround it.

7
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:02,647
I want you
to go in there and flush it out.

8
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,328
You want me to go in there?

9
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:07,287
You said you don't know what it is.
It could be dangerous.

10
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:09,847
Let's hope so. Now go.

11
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,488
They're gonna kill you. Please, go!

12
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:24,368
Arthur, no!

13
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:45,128
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,968
Sorry.

15
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,927
Ha-ha! It's a unicorn.

16
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:52,168
What have you done?

17
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:55,008
Don't be such a girl, Merlin.

18
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,088
What ARE you looking at?

19
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:45,528
Father! A unicorn's horn
to grace the walls of Camelot.

20
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,328
Magnificent.

21
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:53,688
It is the first one I have seen.
Gaius.

22
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:56,727
Look at this.

23
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:59,728
It is very impressive, my lord.

24
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:03,768
What is it, Gaius? Speak your mind.

25
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:06,608
Unicorns are rare
and mystical creatures.

26
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:10,808
There is a legend that bad fortune
comes to anyone who slays one.

27
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:14,448
Nonsense. We will be the envy
of every kingdom.

28
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,768
I am pleased you like it.

29
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:25,368
I don't understand how Arthur
can have

30
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:27,447
taken pleasure
from killing the unicorn.

31
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,928
Arthur is a hunter.
It's in his blood.

32
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:32,648
Whereas you are something
entirely different.

33
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,688
It was the most beautiful creature
I have ever seen.

34
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:38,728
I wish you had been there.

35
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:42,048
It's a rare privilege. Alas,
there are few unicorns still alive.

36
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,568
You try telling that to Arthur.

37
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:46,848
I can imagine
it would be difficult.

38
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:51,525
My horse threw a shoe.
Take it to the blacksmith.

39
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,245
Make sure he does a good job.

40
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:59,046
And when you've done that,
you can polish my...saddle. Merlin?

41
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:04,246
Have you listened to a word I said?
You've got a face like a wounded bear

42
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,966
ever since we got back from
that hunting trip.

43
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:10,846
Don't tell me you're still upset
about the unicorn?

44
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:13,125
I don't think you
should have killed it.

45
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,805
Oh, really? And why is that?

46
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,485
It was... It was doing no harm.

47
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,446
What purpose did you serve
by killing it?

48
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,206
We were hunting.
That's what you do.

49
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,405
Would you have me bring it home
as a pet?

50
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:31,486
- Look at this.
- What?

51
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:34,285
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

52
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:38,285
Rat droppings.
My chambers are infested.

53
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:41,005
You need to spend less time
worrying about unicorns

54
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:42,885
and more time worrying about rats.

55
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:46,977
My lord, the king requests your
service as a matter of urgency.

56
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:48,977
Find that rat.

57
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,336
Every single ear has died.

58
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:05,017
We have received reports that it is
the same throughout the kingdom.

59
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:08,537
I rode through this valley yesterday.
The crop looked healthy then.

60
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:10,577
It happened overnight.

61
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,817
Is it a disease of some kind?

62
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:16,537
Perhaps. I have asked the court
physician to conduct some tests.

63
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:19,817
We must ration what little food
we have left.

64
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:25,857
Any ideas what caused
the crops to die?

65
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:30,577
No disease I know of could spread
through the kingdom in one night.

66
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:34,697
- What could kill all the plants?
- It is not killing ALL the plants.

67
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:37,056
The trees and hedges are unharmed.

68
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:39,577
Unfortunately, you can't eat
trees and hedges.

69
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:41,576
It's only killing plants we can eat?

70
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:43,417
It appears so.

71
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:47,097
If it's not a disease,
it must be magic.

72
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:48,857
We can't assume that, Merlin.

73
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:52,576
Perhaps there is something in the
soil or water that can explain it.

74
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:55,496
I can't tell the king it's caused
by sorcery until I am certain.

75
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:04,856
Next!

76
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:08,696
The livestock is either dying or has
been eaten. Food and water is scarce.

77
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:11,297
We are distributing rations,
but they are meagre.

78
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:15,816
This is all the grain we have?

79
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:24,736
We must maintain order at all costs.
Panic will make the situation worse.

80
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,616
I will issue a decree
that looters will be executed.

81
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:30,416
From tonight,
Camelot will be under curfew.

82
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,856
I will see to it.

83
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,377
Give it back. It's mine.

84
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:34,736
It's not yours...

85
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:38,096
Merlin. Is it true about the crops?
They're all dead?

86
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:42,216
I think we may have to start
tightening our belts.

87
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:44,497
I'm sure Arthur will
think of something.

88
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,617
And if he doesn't, I will.

89
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:55,897
Merlin!

90
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,936
Sand? And you say the well
is full of it?

91
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,417
I sent men down to the
underground reservoir.

92
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:13,136
There is no trace of water
to be found.

93
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:15,136
First the crops, and now this.

94
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:18,496
It is the same
throughout the kingdom.

95
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:20,497
There is precious
little water anywhere.

96
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,737
Gaius. Can you offer
any explanation for this?

97
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,737
I cannot think of
a scientific explanation.

98
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:30,216
I can only conclude
it is the result of sorcery.

99
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:33,216
I believe you are right.
It is the work of magic.

100
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:36,776
The kingdom is under attack.

101
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:40,096
Greot gecuman leccan.

102
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:46,217
Gecuman gedryc waeter.

103
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,136
I was... I was just...

104
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:52,496
I was hoping you may have been
trying to turn it back into water.

105
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:56,497
I know I have cautioned
against using magic,

106
00:08:56,497 --> 00:09:00,817
but if ever there was a time
to use your talents, it's now.

107
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:02,417
I wish I knew how.

108
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,217
I've tried everything.

109
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:06,696
If it is magic,

110
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:09,096
it is more powerful magic
than I possess.

111
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:23,776
Patrol the market and the lower town.
No-one is to leave their homes.

112
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,256
Dismissed.

113
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,577
Merlin.

114
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:36,736
You do realise there's a curfew?

115
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:40,136
Yeah, I was in your chambers,
hunting for the rat.

116
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:41,417
Did you find it?

117
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,896
No.

118
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:46,097
So you have been outwitted by a rat?

119
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:48,296
They do say rats
are very intelligent.

120
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,697
More intelligent than you,
it would seem. Go home.

121
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:55,656
It'd be embarrassing to lock up my
own servant for breaking the curfew!

122
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,977
What was that?

123
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:01,097
What?

124
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:35,737
That means you go the other way
and cut him off.

125
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:57,774
- Where is he?
- I didn't seen anyone.

126
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:00,774
He was right here. Don't tell me
you let him get past you?

127
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:04,375
- Arthur, no-one passed me.
- Are you blind?!

128
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,655
Are you looking for me?
I am Anhora,

129
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:10,094
keeper of the unicorns.

130
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,615
Camelot is under curfew.
What is your business here?

131
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:17,615
I have come to deliver a message.

132
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:20,374
And who is this message for?

133
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:24,014
It is for you, Arthur Pendragon.

134
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:26,815
Is it you who is responsible
for killing our crops,

135
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:28,654
turning our water into sand?

136
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,495
You alone are responsible

137
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:32,935
for the misfortune
that has befallen Camelot.

138
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:36,535
Me?! You think I'd bring drought
and famine upon my own people?

139
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:39,535
When you killed the unicorn,
you unleashed a curse.

140
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:42,054
For this,
Camelot will suffer greatly.

141
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,535
If you have put a curse on Camelot,

142
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:48,895
you will lift it,
or you will pay with your life.

143
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:51,814
Undo the curse or face execution.

144
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,014
Only you can do that.

145
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,614
You will be tested.

146
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:59,094
You're under arrest.

147
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:07,135
Until you have proven yourself, and
made amends for killing the unicorn,

148
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:09,775
the curse will not be lifted.

149
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:12,615
If you fail any of these tests,

150
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:17,014
Camelot will be
damned for all eternity.

151
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:25,574
And you believe what this Anhora
said about the curse to be true?

152
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:27,495
You said there's a legend

153
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:31,654
that misfortune comes to anyone
who slays a unicorn. It makes sense.

154
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:33,495
Not much for breakfast, I'm afraid.

155
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:35,974
We're down to our
last few scraps of food.

156
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:38,574
Where did you get the water
to make the tea?

157
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:42,215
Fortunately, for both of us, you
forgot to empty your bath yesterday.

158
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:45,735
You're making tea from my bath water?

159
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,975
It's not so bad.

160
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,974
Perhaps a little...soapy.

161
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,655
What does Arthur
think about the curse?

162
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:58,135
He doesn't believe it's his fault.

163
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:00,694
He's convinced Anhora
is responsible for it.

164
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:04,334
If you do not wish to drink bath
water, make sure Arthur sees sense.

165
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:25,215
I guess the rat must be
as hungry as the rest of us(!)

166
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:26,815
You think this is funny?

167
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:28,135
Moderately.

168
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:32,055
Get it mended, and find that rat.

169
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:36,575
Have you given any more thought
to what Anhora said last night?

170
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:38,694
Well, he may have escaped last night,

171
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,294
but at least we now
know who we're looking for.

172
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:43,974
I have told my father that I will
find this Anhora

173
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:45,295
and put an end to it.

174
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:49,135
What if he's telling
the truth about the curse?

175
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:52,054
You think I'm responsible for
bringing suffering

176
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:55,135
- upon my own people?
- No, not deliberately.

177
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:02,854
When you killed the unicorn,
I saw Anhora in the forest.

178
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:06,094
Why didn't you say anything?

179
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:09,055
It was just for a second,
and then he disappeared.

180
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:11,775
I thought I was seeing things.
But he was there.

181
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:15,335
- That doesn't prove anything.
- He might be telling the truth.

182
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:17,895
Because he was skulking about
in the forest?

183
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:20,335
Why would Anhora appear in Camelot,
then lie?

184
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:24,375
We had him cornered. He was trying to
talk his way out of it by blaming me.

185
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,495
He can disappear. He didn't have to
talk his way out of anything.

186
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:30,254
My father has warned me
about sorcerers like him.

187
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:32,695
They will not rest until
our kingdom is destroyed.

188
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:36,375
- I believe he's telling the truth.
- Then you are a fool.

189
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,334
You cannot trust a single word
a sorcerer says.

190
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:41,294
You'd do well to remember that.

191
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:45,334
Now, I think I've figured out

192
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:49,975
what Anhora's next move is
going to be, and when he makes it,

193
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,454
we're going to be waiting.

194
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:07,255
Don't you worry about keeping watch,
Merlin(!)

195
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:10,734
You just make yourself comfortable.
MERLIN SIGHS

196
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:14,214
- And stop smacking your lips.
- I'm thirsty.

197
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,495
We're all thirsty, Merlin.

198
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,135
HE SIGHS

199
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:30,254
Psst! Someone's coming.

200
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:19,654
Show yourself,
before I run you through.

201
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,254
Who are you?

202
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,534
My name is... My name is...

203
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:32,694
Speak up!

204
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:35,054
My name is Evan, my lord.

205
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:42,094
I see you think you can help yourself
to our grain reserves?

206
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:45,134
Please, my lord.
I do not steal for myself.

207
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,695
My children have
not eaten for two days.

208
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,815
It is the same for everyone.

209
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:51,654
I know that it is wrong to steal.

210
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,174
I could not bear to see them starve.

211
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:59,535
And could you bear for your children
to see you be executed?

212
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,815
Then you should go home.

213
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:15,214
If you are caught stealing again,
I will not spare you.

214
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:17,655
Yes, my lord. Thank you.

215
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,935
Wait.

216
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:37,254
Use it sparingly.

217
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:41,614
It might be the last food you
and your family get for some time.

218
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:45,134
You have shown yourself
to be merciful and kind, my lord.

219
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:49,734
This will bring its own reward.

220
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,455
- Stop him!
- Come back here!

221
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:59,054
Stop that man!
He's been looting!

222
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,374
I never knew water
could taste so good.

223
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:37,855
My throat was so dry,
I thought I couldn't talk.

224
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:41,374
At least some good would have
come from the drought, then(!)

225
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:42,454
More?

226
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:48,694
The sand has disappeared
and water returned to the well.

227
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,894
It doesn't make any sense.

228
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:57,934
I suppose you have some
explanation for this, Merlin?

229
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,575
Let's hear it.

230
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,774
Anhora said you would be tested.

231
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,215
And last night, in the grain store,
you let that villager go.

232
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:07,175
it would bring its own reward.

233
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:09,175
He was merely grateful,

234
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:12,655
- and so he should have been.
- Maybe that was your first test?

235
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:15,495
You passed it,
so the curse has begun to lift.

236
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:17,815
Perhaps THIS is your reward?

237
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,774
I know you don't have to
listen to me.

238
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:24,334
I'm glad we agree on something.

239
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:28,014
If you're tested again, you have
a chance to end the suffering.

240
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:30,015
I know you want
that more than anything.

241
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:35,015
Perhaps we should seek Anhora out.

242
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:41,255
I cannot negotiate with sorcerers.
My father wouldn't hear of it.

243
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:44,014
Then it's probably best
you don't tell him.

244
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:50,095
I must go check on the guard.

245
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:52,534
See if you can find me some food.

246
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:55,174
Find some food(!)

247
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:09,055
Swelt deor.

248
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:24,655
Who are they?

249
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:28,414
They have come from the outlying
villages in search of food.

250
00:20:28,414 --> 00:20:32,415
We don't have enough rations to feed
the people who are already here.

251
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,774
You shouldn't blame yourself.

252
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:37,294
I'm sure you're doing
everything you can.

253
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:39,255
It is not enough.

254
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:43,655
Did you manage to find any food?

255
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:48,174
Where did you get that?

256
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:51,015
I was able to smuggle it
out of the palace kitchens.

257
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:54,175
Share it out amongst the children
and the old people.

258
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:55,815
Make it go as far as you can.

259
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:02,295
- I have lost my appetite.
- You have to eat something.

260
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,695
I can't.

261
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:06,375
Not while my people are starving.

262
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:13,254
Do you really believe
I am responsible for the curse?

263
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:14,935
I'm afraid so.

264
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:20,494
We're going to the forest
first thing in the morning.

265
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:22,975
Maybe we can pick up Anhora's trail.

266
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:25,415
Whatever it takes.

267
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:26,734
OK, but you have to eat.

268
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:30,574
You won't be able to help anyone
if you're too weak to pass the test.

269
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:45,454
What kind of meat is this?

270
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:48,895
- It has a very strange texture.
- It's pork.

271
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:50,974
This isn't pork.

272
00:21:50,974 --> 00:21:54,334
It's far too stringy. What is it?
It's...

273
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:00,655
It's rat, isn't it?

274
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:02,974
Try not to think about it.

275
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:11,374
Look at me. I'm being rude.
Here I am,

276
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:17,535
stuffing my face with this delicious
stew when you're hungry, too.

277
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:21,495
Come on.

278
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:23,534
Take a seat.

279
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,335
Eat!

280
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,934
Mmmm.

281
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:47,295
It's actually pretty tasty.

282
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:49,534
Well, I'm glad you like it,

283
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,894
because...

284
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:55,335
..there's plenty more.

285
00:22:57,055 --> 00:22:58,574
Enter.

286
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:01,934
Morgana?

287
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:05,494
I hate to ask, but I was wondering
if you had anything to eat...

288
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:16,174
I'm not entirely sure
what I'm looking for.

289
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:20,934
You're looking for footprints
or broken branches.

290
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:24,935
Anything that would indicate
someone passed that... Merlin!

291
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:30,295
Merlin! He's here!

292
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,494
Arthur?

293
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:01,015
You?

294
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:07,894
You're a thief!

295
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:11,734
Wasn't that obvious when you
caught me stealing your grain?

296
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:14,055
I have more important things
to deal with...

297
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:15,935
You didn't believe my story?

298
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:21,334
What kind of man lies about starving
children to save his own skin?

299
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,774
Your people starve because
you let thieves steal their grain.

300
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:28,015
- That is why they doubt you.
- You do not speak for my people.

301
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:31,294
Your father would never have been
fooled like that.

302
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:34,935
You hold your tongue, or I will
make time to teach you some manners.

303
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:36,934
Your father would have had me
executed,

304
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,814
but you didn't have the
stomach for it, did you, Arthur?

305
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:44,415
And that's why he doubts
you'll make a good king.

306
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:47,935
You know nothing of
what my father thinks.

307
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:50,775
I think he wishes he had
another son,

308
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:52,695
one worthy of taking his place.

309
00:24:52,695 --> 00:24:55,335
You shame him.

310
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:57,735
Pick up your sword.

311
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:03,135
The king must fear the day when you
will take the throne.

312
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:11,734
He fears you do not have enough
strength to defeat his enemies.

313
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:42,254
The king must wonder
if you are even his son.

314
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:58,335
This is your doing?

315
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:01,654
It was a test to see what
is truly in your heart.

316
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,694
Your tricks prove nothing.

317
00:26:03,694 --> 00:26:05,895
Why did you kill this man?

318
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:08,974
He insulted my honour.

319
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:13,495
You could have chosen to ignore his
taunts. What harm would they do you?

320
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:16,935
- You will lift the curse, Sorcerer.
- It is not in my power.

321
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:18,655
Then you will die.

322
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,854
Killing me will not help you.

323
00:26:27,895 --> 00:26:29,695
Agh!

324
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:34,135
You have shown that you would
kill a man to defend your pride.

325
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,334
You have failed the test.

326
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:39,415
For this, Camelot will pay dearly.

327
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:41,854
My people have done nothing!

328
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:45,134
Your people's suffering
is not my doing.

329
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,894
It is yours.

330
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,855
Arthur?

331
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:58,094
Arthur?

332
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:05,695
What is it? What has happened?

333
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:11,374
All our remaining supplies
have rotted. Every last grain.

334
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,894
I know Arthur's stubborn
and pig-headed

335
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:21,855
and annoying,
but he cares about his people...

336
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:24,055
more than he cares about himself.

337
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,014
He will not forgive himself
for making his people suffer.

338
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:34,135
You must make sure
he doesn't do anything rash.

339
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:37,614
The mood he's in,

340
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:42,895
Ready?

341
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:47,214
- You're sure they're not poisonous?
- Quite certain.

342
00:27:47,214 --> 00:27:49,135
They say they taste like chicken.

343
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:54,655
Unless we are to starve,

344
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:09,694
This tastes nothing like chicken.

345
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:20,854
There are some supplies left
in the palace stores.

346
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:26,935
We are distributing them,
but there is not enough to live on.

347
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:28,894
They will not survive for long.

348
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:32,654
Then you must stop
distributing food to the people.

349
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:34,015
They will starve.

350
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:38,935
We must conserve the food we have
for our army.

351
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:40,894
We cannot let our people
go without food.

352
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:43,414
We must defend the kingdom

353
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:46,735
- What is the point defending a...?
- What would you have me do?!

354
00:28:47,814 --> 00:28:49,934
Ask the neighbouring kingdoms
for help.

355
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:52,894
They may be able to spare some food.

356
00:28:52,894 --> 00:28:55,494
No. As soon as they realise
how we weak we are,

357
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:59,015
- our enemies will strike against us.
- You don't know that...

358
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:01,654
I would rather starve
than beg my enemies for help.

359
00:29:01,654 --> 00:29:04,614
What of our kingdom's reputation?
Have you no pride?

360
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:12,135
I cannot think of my pride
when our people go hungry.

361
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:15,574
They are all I can think of.

362
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:20,254
Give the order to stop
distributing food to the people.

363
00:29:20,254 --> 00:29:22,254
Is that understood?

364
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:31,815
You will have to give
that order yourself.

365
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:35,935
Very well.

366
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:39,174
But if you had caught the sorcerer,
I would not have to.

367
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:41,455
That's your responsibility.

368
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:47,015
One day you will understand
what it takes to be king.

369
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:56,655
They don't yet know that
there is worse to come.

370
00:29:56,655 --> 00:29:58,614
What do you mean?

371
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:03,574
My father is going to stop
distributing food to the people.

372
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:08,095
They are to be left to starve.

373
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:10,495
I had a chance to lift the curse.

374
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:13,415
And I have failed them.

375
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,615
You weren't to know
you were being tested.

376
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:20,775
My people are starving.

377
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:25,375
Camelot is on the verge of collapse.

378
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:29,574
It is all my doing.

379
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,495
Anhora!
SOUND ECHOES

380
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:45,814
Show yourself.

381
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:49,215
Anhora!

382
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:57,454
You wanted to talk with me?

383
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:59,814
I have come to seek your help.

384
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:02,214
The people are starving.

385
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:03,535
They will soon be dead.

386
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:06,015
You must believe me when I say

387
00:31:06,015 --> 00:31:09,214
it gives me no pleasure
to see your people suffering.

388
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:10,854
If it pains you, put an end to it.

389
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:14,175
It is not in my power
to lift the curse.

390
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:16,334
Then give Arthur another chance.

391
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,655
He has accepted
it is his responsibility.

392
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:22,374
He will prove himself worthy and lift
the curse if you give him a chance.

393
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,375
You have faith in Arthur?

394
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:29,374
I trust him with my life.

395
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:36,214
Arthur must go
to the Labyrinth of Gedref.

396
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:38,974
There, he will face a final test.

397
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:42,175
If he fails, there is no hope.

398
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:44,494
The curse will destroy Camelot.

399
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:50,655
Wait!

400
00:31:51,854 --> 00:31:53,814
What kind of test will he face?

401
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:57,255
ANHORA: That is for Arthur alone
to discover.

402
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:04,054
Let me come with you.
I might be able to help.

403
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:06,895
You're not coming.
I brought this curse upon Camelot.

404
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:09,655
I'm gonna be the one to lift it,
or die trying.

405
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:11,374
How does you dying help anyone?

406
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:14,534
I will die knowing
I did everything I can.

407
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:16,255
I'm coming with you.

408
00:32:16,255 --> 00:32:19,894
Merlin, you are to stay here,
and help the people as best you can.

409
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,375
Is that understood?

410
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,694
You said Arthur would face a test.

411
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:55,855
- You're preparing a trap for him.
- The trap isn't for Arthur.

412
00:34:55,855 --> 00:34:59,015
It is for you. Gehaeftan.

413
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,374
Merlin?

414
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:45,814
I'm sorry.

415
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,775
Let him go.

416
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,815
I will take your test,
but not till he's released.

417
00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:55,375
That is not possible.

418
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,934
Merlin is part of the test.

419
00:35:57,934 --> 00:35:59,695
Please sit.

420
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:05,255
If you refuse the test,
you will have failed

421
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:08,694
and Camelot will be destroyed.

422
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:13,895
I thought I told you to stay at home.

423
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:18,495
Let's get on with it.

424
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:21,334
There are two goblets before you.

425
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:25,375
One of the goblets contains
a deadly poison,

426
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:29,894
the other goblet, a harmless liquid.

427
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:33,334
All the liquid in both goblets
must be drunk,

428
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:37,094
but each of you may only drink
from a single goblet.

429
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:42,215
What kind of ridiculous test is that?
What does that prove?

430
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:44,494
What it proves is for you to decide.

431
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:49,454
If you pass the test,
the curse will be lifted.

432
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:56,295
Let's think about this.

433
00:36:56,295 --> 00:36:58,615
What if I drink from my goblet first?

434
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:00,654
If it's poisoned, you'll die.

435
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:04,255
And if it's not, then you will have
to drink from yours, and you die.

436
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:08,295
There must be a way round it.

437
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:11,295
It is perfectly simple.
One of us has to die.

438
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:15,655
We have to find a way to determine
which goblet has the poison.

439
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:17,134
Then I'll drink it.

440
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,774
I will be the one to drink it.

441
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:22,534
This is my doing. I'm drinking it.

442
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:26,134
It is more important you live. You're
the future king. I'm a servant.

443
00:37:26,134 --> 00:37:29,854
This is no time to be a hero, Merlin.
It really doesn't suit you.

444
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:33,134
What if I drink from mine first,

445
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:38,175
and if that's not poisoned,
I will then drink yours.

446
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,415
He said each of us is only allowed
to drink from a single goblet.

447
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:50,775
I had no idea
you were so keen to die for me.

448
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:53,134
Trust me,
I can hardly believe it myself.

449
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,495
I'm glad you are here, Merlin.

450
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,375
I've got it!

451
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:09,814
We pour all the liquid
into one goblet

452
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:11,814
and then we can
be sure it is poisoned.

453
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:15,175
Then all the liquid can be drunk,
and from a single goblet.

454
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:22,654
You never cease to surprise me.
You are a lot smarter than you look.

455
00:38:22,654 --> 00:38:24,255
Is that actually a compliment?

456
00:38:26,295 --> 00:38:28,215
Look out!

457
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:31,135
- No! I will drink it.
- As if I'd let you.

458
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:33,055
You can't die.
This isn't your destiny.

459
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:35,095
- It seems you're wrong again.
- Listen to me!

460
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:38,535
You know me, Merlin.

461
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:40,855
Arthur!

462
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,774
No!

463
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:49,095
What have you done?

464
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,735
Arthur!

465
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:57,775
No!

466
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:02,295
Arthur.

467
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:05,735
Arthur. Come on!

468
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:09,894
Arthur, come on. Come on. Come on!

469
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:16,255
No...

470
00:39:17,415 --> 00:39:19,815
Come on.

471
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,615
Please.

472
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:28,015
Please! Let me take his place!

473
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:31,254
This was Arthur's test, not yours.

474
00:39:33,134 --> 00:39:35,054
You have killed him.

475
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:37,174
I was meant to protect him.

476
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:40,815
He is not dead. He has
merely consumed a sleeping draft.

477
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:42,335
He will come round shortly.

478
00:39:44,494 --> 00:39:46,015
What?

479
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:49,094
A unicorn is pure of heart.

480
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:52,095
If you kill one,
you must make amends

481
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:56,494
by proving that you also
are pure of heart.

482
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:00,134
Arthur was willing to
sacrifice his life to save yours.

483
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:06,335
He has proven what is truly
in his heart.

484
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:10,815
The curse will be lifted.

485
00:40:20,494 --> 00:40:25,294
Merlin, Arthur, there is good news.
The crops are growing once again.

486
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:28,615
- They are bringing in the harvest.
- You did it.

487
00:40:28,615 --> 00:40:30,695
Is this your doing?

488
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,014
Is the sorcerer dead?

489
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,535
He won't be troubling us any more.

490
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:36,615
Good.

491
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:39,255
Make sure the grain reserves
are re-stocked.

492
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,295
I will see to it.

493
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:48,655
There is something we must do first.

494
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:58,215
I should never have ended your life.
I'm sorry.

495
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:18,415
(Arthur...)

496
00:41:31,295 --> 00:41:37,174
ANHORA: When he who kills a unicorn
proves himself to be pure of heart...

497
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:48,055
You didn't say anything about magic.

498
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:49,855
- Find him.
- You're under arrest.

499
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:52,614
You execute Gwen's father
and I will never forgive you.

500
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:55,815
Take care, child,
or I'll have you restrained.

501
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:59,254
- More than ever, I want Uther dead.
- Then the deed is as good as done.

502
00:41:59,254 --> 00:42:01,975
Only if Uther dies will you be free,
Merlin.

503
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:06,375
Wait! Where does it say
my destiny includes murder?

504
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,654
If you had the power
of life and death over Uther,

505
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,014
would you kill him?

506
