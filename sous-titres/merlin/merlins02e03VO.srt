1
00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:04,195
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:06,195
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:09,135
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:10,405
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,750
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:40,080
Here is some extra blankets,
you might be cold...

7
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,070
Arthur's Knights

8
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,310
Merlin - 2x03
<i>The Nightmare Begins</i>

9
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,105
I came back in with some blankets.

10
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,790
- There was a candle, but I put it out.
- Are you sure?

11
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,485
I blew it out, I swear.

12
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:27,155
Gwen's been Morgana's servant for years.
If she says she did it, I believe her.

13
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:32,265
She could've been burnt alive.

14
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:36,845
Lightning that struck the castle roof
last night, could've started the fire.

15
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,015
Perhaps.

16
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,835
What other explanation is there?

17
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,990
Someone started the fire
deliberately.

18
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,875
- How did they reach Morgana's chambers?
- I don't know. There are many guards,

19
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:56,385
- it shouldn't be possible.
- Yet they managed to do so.

20
00:02:56,555 --> 00:02:58,405
- I can't explain it.
- Well, I can.

21
00:02:58,575 --> 00:02:59,600
They used magic.

22
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,880
Arrest all those under suspicion.

23
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,415
That's gonna take time.

24
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:07,270
My ward has been attacked.

25
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,390
Time is something we do not have!

26
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,395
What I don't understand, Morgana,

27
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:17,635
is how the fire started
in the first place.

28
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:19,205
It happened so quickly.

29
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,670
- It was terrifying.
- It's all right.

30
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,145
You're safe now.

31
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:28,590
You're the only person
I've told about my dreams.

32
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:31,750
I know I can trust you.

33
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,660
Yes, of course you can.

34
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:36,165
It was me.

35
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:39,270
I set the room alight,
I started the fire.

36
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:43,350
I don't understand.
Did you knock a candle over?

37
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,110
No. That's not what happened.

38
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:48,155
I did it just...

39
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,630
by looking at it.
The flame leapt higher.

40
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,865
It could've been a gust of wind.

41
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:54,350
It wasn't. It was me.

42
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,845
It was magic.

43
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,725
- My child...
- I'm not a child!

44
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,675
Last night was an accident.

45
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,910
It had nothing to do with you.
How could it have?

46
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,275
I am going to draw you up

47
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:13,430
a fresh remedy that will
make you feel better. I promise.

48
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,750
You must trust me.

49
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:30,565
I was helping clear up
Morgana's chambers earlier.

50
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:34,445
The window was blown out
into the courtyard below.

51
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,295
That's odd, isn't it?

52
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:43,785
If lightning struck the window, glass
would have fallen inside of the window.

53
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,230
It was magic. You know it was.

54
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,830
And, more importantly, so does she.

55
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:54,710
- Morgana knows nothing for certain.
- It's even worse.

56
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:57,550
She isn't sure what happens to her
and it's tearing her apart.

57
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,350
What would you have me do?

58
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:01,515
Talk to her.

59
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,695
Tell her she'll be OK,

60
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:07,815
tell her that her powers aren't
something to be afraid of.

61
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:09,945
I can't.

62
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:16,110
- Maybe I could speak to her.
- No, Merlin, you can't!

63
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,910
I know what she's going through.

64
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,070
You must never tell your secret,

65
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:21,735
not to anyone.

66
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,670
- If not me, then someone else.
- Who?

67
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,150
This is against the way.
Magic is outlawed.

68
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,505
- You forgot it?
- Some still practise it.

69
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:30,830
What about the druids?
They help people like this.

70
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,750
Uther's vowed to destroy them.
The druids cannot help her,

71
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,870
it would be suicide.

72
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,280
Then who can?

73
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:41,575
I will,

74
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:43,275
as I've always done.

75
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,510
You need to be honest with her.

76
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,350
Are you so certain
that you know better than me?

77
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:51,110
Because I went through
the same thing!

78
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,310
I know exactly how
she's feeling right now.

79
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,350
You cannot get involved in this.

80
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:02,405
No good can come of it.

81
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,310
I mean it, Merlin.

82
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,070
Stay out of it!

83
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,510
I need you... to...

84
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,870
- What are you hiding behind your back?
- Nothing. See?

85
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:22,710
What are you up to?

86
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,030
Nothing, honestly.

87
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,790
I would never lie to you.

88
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,880
I respect you too much for that.

89
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:33,870
- You wanted me to do something?
- My chainmail needs cleaning.

90
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,550
Well... I'll see to it right away.

91
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:55,825
How is she?

92
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:58,950
I've never seen her
like this before.

93
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,270
- I'm scared to leave her on her own.
- Is there anything I can do to help?

94
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,575
I'd better get back to her.

95
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:14,955
I'll make sure
she knows who they're from.

96
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,145
I can stay, if that would
make you feel better.

97
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,355
You've done so much already.

98
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,125
I don't mind.

99
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:29,115
I'll be fine.

100
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,950
Really.

101
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:42,735
Take the candle.

102
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:25,405
Is Gaius here?

103
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:27,670
He's not here,

104
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,345
- he should be back soon.
- I must speak to him! Where is he?

105
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:31,880
He's gone to see the King.

106
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:34,925
What's wrong?

107
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,315
You can trust me, Morgana.

108
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:44,785
You know you can.

109
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:49,555
I'm scared.

110
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,630
I don't understand anything
any more.

111
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:56,150
I need to know what's happening.

112
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:00,445
Please...

113
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:03,555
Gaius will be back soon.
He'll help you.

114
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:06,365
He won't. I don't want any more
remedies! They won't do any good.

115
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:11,195
It's magic.

116
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:16,270
- What?
- I'm your friend, I don't make this up.

117
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:18,115
Of course.

118
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:19,655
Then you believe me?

119
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:23,355
You think it's magic too?

120
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,830
Please,

121
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:29,150
I just need to hear someone say it,
so I don't feel like I'm imagining it!

122
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,750
I really wish
I could say something...

123
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:50,695
Wait!

124
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:28,755
I need your help.

125
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:31,735
Do you know where the druids are?

126
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:36,670
First you must tell me
why you seek them.

127
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,485
- That doesn't matter.
- It does to me.

128
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:43,275
I need to ask them something.

129
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:47,725
I've lived
more than a thousand years,

130
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:50,925
seen civilisations rise and fall.

131
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,830
Do not believe
that you can lie to me.

132
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,310
I need their help.

133
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:05,120
Someone I care about
needs their help.

134
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:09,190
You speak of the witch,
the Lady Morgana.

135
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:11,065
She's not a witch!

136
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,270
She's my friend.

137
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,790
She cannot be trusted.

138
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:15,615
What makes you say that?

139
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:17,390
It would be better if the witch...

140
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,830
Stop calling her that!

141
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,185
It would be better if the witch
never knew

142
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:24,150
- the true extent of her powers.
- You're wrong.

143
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:26,675
I know her. She has a good heart.

144
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:28,870
You failed to heed my advice in
the past

145
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:31,335
and it brought grave consequences.

146
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:32,670
I won't abandon her!

147
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,310
I will not give you
the help you seek.

148
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:39,750
If you pursue this course of action,

149
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,515
you do so alone.

150
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:09,550
- Are you sure this is all of them?
- Names and last known dwelling places.

151
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,965
My father suspects the fire
was started by sorcery.

152
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,095
Indeed, Sire.

153
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:18,070
I included details of everyone suspected
of consorting with sorcerers, witches

154
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,330
or druids.

155
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:22,865
Gather the men.
We'll arrest them immediately.

156
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,390
I told you to do that yesterday.

157
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,990
I didn't have time,
I was cleaning the stables.

158
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:31,575
That's strange.

159
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,750
Cos a little bird told me
you were somewhere else.

160
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:39,390
Mucking out the stables is strange
and a talking bird isn't?

161
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,755
- What we said about you being funny?
- I shouldn't.

162
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,505
So where are my flowers?

163
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,920
Your flowers?

164
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:50,470
I heard Morgana got some.

165
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:54,195
I assumed you'd be putting them
in all the rooms.

166
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:58,150
Or is she the only one to receive
a token of your affections?

167
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,390
What? It's not a...

168
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,560
token of anything,
affection or otherwise.

169
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,630
I see.

170
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,235
Why trying to hide them
from me yesterday?

171
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,870
I wasn't. I was just... I didn't want
you to get the wrong impression.

172
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:15,365
What's the right impression?

173
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,870
That... I was trying
to cheer her up after the fire.

174
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:19,670
Pick them yourself?

175
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,590
Maybe.

176
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,255
I was only trying to be nice.

177
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:28,955
Sword.

178
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,670
That'll be all.

179
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:30,995
- Move and I kill you.
- Forridel?

180
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,115
Who are you?

181
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,935
There is no time to explain,
we have to get out of here.

182
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:39,065
- The King's men are coming for you!
- Check in there!

183
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:49,510
- How did you know this was for me?
- I'm Prince Arthur's servant.

184
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,510
You took a great risk. Thank you.

185
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,390
I'm just sorry
I couldn't help them all.

186
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:59,070
- We'd better go.
- Wait. I need your help.

187
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,720
I want to contact the druids.

188
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:03,095
- I know nothing about them.
- Don't lie to me.

189
00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:05,640
- I'm not lying.
- I need it, else you'd be under arrest.

190
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:10,125
You know I'm not a spy for Uther.

191
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:14,030
I'm a friend of the druids.
I need their help.

192
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,205
What do you want to know?

193
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:30,225
Gaius asked me to deliver this.

194
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,550
I don't need any potion, thank you.

195
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,375
Ignore what I said last night.

196
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,990
I had a nightmare. I was upset.

197
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,625
I know.

198
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,285
I haven't said anything to anyone.

199
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:55,415
I'm sorry. It's usually Gwen that has
to deal with me when I'm like this.

200
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:56,735
I don't mind.

201
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,785
Maybe I could help.

202
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:01,645
I doubt that.

203
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:05,165
You'd be surprised.

204
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,435
I understand.

205
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:16,670
I realise... how frightening all this
must be for you. Especially for you.

206
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,240
Why especially for me?

207
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:24,190
You're the King's ward. You know
his hatred of magic better than anyone.

208
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,035
That's what you think
has been happening to me?

209
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,190
The dreams, the fire.
You think it was magic!

210
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,635
- I'm not saying that.
- But it could be, couldn't it?

211
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:35,225
I really wouldn't know.

212
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,470
- But there are people who do.
- Who?

213
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,475
What about the druids?

214
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,670
They help people like you.

215
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,670
None of their kind would dare
show their face in Camelot.

216
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,605
But I know where you can find them.

217
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:02,550
The guards have completed
their search. No trace of her.

218
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,675
Encircle the city.
No-one gets in or out.

219
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:07,830
- You sent for me, Sire.
- Yes.

220
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:11,065
What time did you deliver
this sleeping draught to Morgana?

221
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:14,670
The guards said that Merlin delivered it
after she retired to her chambers.

222
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:16,830
So she was safe, then?

223
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,205
I suppose she must have been.

224
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,310
I didn't ask you to take
this to Morgana last night.

225
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:32,590
I used some initiative.

226
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:35,390
Those warning bells are ringing

227
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,070
because Uther thinks
that Morgana's been kidnapped.

228
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:43,990
- You don't seem overly concerned.
- She can look after herself.

229
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,270
- What have you done?
- What you refused to.

230
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:49,764
I helped her.

231
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,990
This ends now.

232
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:55,550
People's lives are at risk,
Morgana's included.

233
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,270
Where is she?

234
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,460
She's gone to the Forest of Ascetir
to find the druids.

235
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:05,950
I told you not to get involved!

236
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,865
I had to. You wouldn't even acknowledge
she had magic!

237
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:11,496
- For good reason!
- No, you don't understand.

238
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,626
You don't understand what it's like.

239
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:17,272
The years before I came here
were the loneliest of my life.

240
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,190
Morgana is the king's ward.

241
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:21,550
Her situation
is completely different.

242
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,310
I've got you, she hasn't.

243
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:27,630
I've always taken good care
of Morgana.

244
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:30,599
It's not the same.

245
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:36,470
Everything that's good and right
about magic,

246
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,364
I've learnt from you.

247
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:41,270
I'd be lost without you.

248
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,627
Like she is now.

249
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,670
Do you understand why I did it?

250
00:18:58,542 --> 00:18:59,542
I do.

251
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:04,361
But that doesn't mean
I don't fear the consequences.

252
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:39,750
- Have the suspects been arrested?
- Nearly. A few have gone to ground.

253
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:44,030
Issue a proclamation.
"All the prisoners will be executed

254
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,190
"unless the Lady Morgana
is returned to Camelot."

255
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:49,950
I'll see to it, sire.

256
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,950
Come on, Merlin!
Out of your bed.

257
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,205
You'll be late for work.

258
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,193
I'm not going to hurt you.

259
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:10,194
You've hurt your leg.

260
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,178
Try not to move it.

261
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,190
- What happened?
- You were stung by a Serket.

262
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,497
I came to help.

263
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:20,150
My name's Aglain.

264
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,434
Relax, Morgana.

265
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:24,190
You're safe now.

266
00:24:24,787 --> 00:24:26,337
Who told you my name?

267
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:27,704
I did.

268
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:38,484
You.

269
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:41,657
When the Serket attacked last night,

270
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:44,310
Mordred was able
to sense your distress...

271
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,070
with his mind.

272
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:50,595
Hello, Morgana.

273
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:53,520
Did you hear that?

274
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,270
- How did you do?
- We don't always need words

275
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,230
to speak to one another.

276
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,804
Now I can take care of you...

277
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:05,646
like you did me.

278
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:12,950
There's some confusion
as to how it was broken.

279
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,390
- By the looks of these...
- There is no confusion.

280
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:17,195
It was magic.

281
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,910
The same one that was used
to start the fire in Morgana's chambers.

282
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,750
- Where does the trail lead?
- The Forest of Ascetir.

283
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,670
We've long suspected
that the druids have hidden there.

284
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:31,270
The trail will lead us
straight to them.

285
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,175
Take no prisoners.

286
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:39,150
It's time we rid ourselves
of these druids once and for all.

287
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,327
Where's Merlin?

288
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:47,950
He's not well.

289
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:52,074
- He's still upset about Morgana.
- We all are.

290
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:53,805
Tell him to stop pining,

291
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:56,675
pull himself together
and get back to work.

292
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:34,962
Is anybody there?

293
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,990
<i>... aren't something to be
afraid of...</i>

294
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:43,310
<i>... now I can take care of you...</i>

295
00:26:49,114 --> 00:26:50,514
<i>... a great risk...</i>

296
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,262
- <i>... like you did me...</i>
- <i>... in time you will learn...</i>

297
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,430
<i>What would you like to know?</i>

298
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:04,110
Any word from Arthur?

299
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,270
No, sire, not yet.
But they haven't been gone long.

300
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:09,851
Yes. Of course.

301
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,030
Why are you so certain
that she's been kidnapped?

302
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,550
What other possibility?

303
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:19,590
She was upset after the fire,
she could have gone of her own accord.

304
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,510
That's not her.

305
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:26,494
In all her years, I've never known her
run from anything.

306
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:29,430
Takes after her father too much
for that.

307
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,870
You haven't let Gorlois down.

308
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,800
You've looked after that girl
as if she were your own.

309
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,630
That is what she's become.

310
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:44,228
If she were to die,
a huge part of me would die with her.

311
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,830
- I trust you slept well?
- Better than I've done in days.

312
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:23,790
Here, this might make you feel
more at home.

313
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:56,275
They're surprised to see you here,
if not a little afraid.

314
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:58,565
Your King would have us killed.

315
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,710
They have nothing to fear from me.

316
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:04,051
I do not share
Uther's hatred of magic.

317
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,980
I imagine you wouldn't.

318
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:12,002
These forests are dangerous.
What brings you so far from Camelot?

319
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,590
I'm searching for answers.

320
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:21,527
I hoped the druids
might be able to give them to me.

321
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:23,754
Come.

322
00:29:36,077 --> 00:29:37,177
Keep moving!

323
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,175
This way.

324
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,212
What would you like to know?

325
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:01,403
Why I can see the future
in my dreams.

326
00:30:03,163 --> 00:30:05,763
Why I'm able to start fires
with my mind.

327
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,110
People who are able to do this
are few and far between.

328
00:30:10,203 --> 00:30:11,503
You have a gift.

329
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,720
Is it magic?

330
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:15,790
Of a kind, yes.

331
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,305
But it will be many years
before you're able to understand it,

332
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:21,955
let alone use it.

333
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:25,230
Isn't something to be afraid of.

334
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:28,750
It is if you have Uther
as your guardian.

335
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:31,470
- If he found out he'd have me killed.
- He won't.

336
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,918
But if he did...

337
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:35,150
We won't let that happen.
You're safe here.

338
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:39,630
You shouldn't be scared of Uther.
You should pity him.

339
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,830
Pity? Why?

340
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:45,261
Because he's a broken man,
consumed by fear.

341
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,830
His hatred of magic
has driven goodness from his heart.

342
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,110
I've always been taught
that magic is evil.

343
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:57,950
That it corrupts your soul.

344
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,417
Uther told you this.

345
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:04,990
Just because he decrees it,
doesn't make it so.

346
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:08,137
In time you will learn

347
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:13,033
that magic isn't a dark art
that must be shrouded in secrecy.

348
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,505
It can be a force for good.

349
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,730
Remember the King's orders.

350
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,560
No prisoners.

351
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:59,230
- What are you doing here?!
- I've come to take you back.

352
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:02,218
I'm afraid
you've had a wasted journey.

353
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,700
- I'm never going back.
- You have to.

354
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:09,310
Why? You're the one
who said I should seek out the druids.

355
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:12,302
I never realised
what the repercussions would be.

356
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,181
What repercussions?

357
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:17,136
The King thinks
you've been kidnapped.

358
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,806
He won't stop.
He's arrested dozens of people.

359
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:35,910
He's gonna execute them all.

360
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:40,630
If I return,
the same fate awaits me.

361
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:43,710
Uther doesn't need to know about this.
I won't tell a soul.

362
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:01,204
I'm sorry.

363
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:04,790
I'm never going back.
These are my people.

364
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,705
They're like me.

365
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,660
I don't feel so alone here.

366
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:14,626
Do you understand?

367
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:17,630
Better than anyone.

368
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:22,510
We must go.
Who are you?

369
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:25,270
It's all right, he's a friend.
What's wrong?

370
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:27,389
Arthur is coming.

371
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,175
Your friend has led him
straight to us.

372
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,384
<i>Hello, Emrys.</i>

373
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
This way!

374
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,069
- Keep moving.
- My leg, it's too painful!

375
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,790
- I'll try to create a diversion.
- No, you can't!

376
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,757
You carry on,
it's my fault they're here. Go.

377
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,754
- Go!
- I'll never forget this.

378
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
There!

379
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,438
Over there!

380
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:29,870
- I can't go on!
- We're not leaving you behind.

381
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:31,954
Please...

382
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,060
They're coming!

383
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,270
We have her!
We have the Lady Morgana!

384
00:38:10,295 --> 00:38:12,345
I was so, so worried about you.

385
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,265
You were right.

386
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,270
The druids kidnapped her.

387
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:39,494
My lady.

388
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:55,470
I wanted to check you were OK.

389
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,590
I'm fine.

390
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:10,187
- What was said at the woods...
- You can trust me, I won't tell anyone.

391
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:15,115
Thank you, Merlin.

392
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:19,418
I know now who I really am.

393
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,230
And it isn't something
to be scared of.

394
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,350
Maybe one day people will come
to see magic as a force for good.

395
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:46,887
It's good to have you back.

396
00:39:51,705 --> 00:39:53,105
Thank you, Merlin.

397
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:02,653
Sleep well.

398
00:40:11,657 --> 00:40:12,830
This has to stop.

399
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:19,119
The King would have your head
if he found out,

400
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,665
and there's no point denying it.

401
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,469
Denying what?

402
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,470
Your affections
for the Lady Morgana.

403
00:40:34,405 --> 00:40:35,305
Right...

404
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,390
Take a bit of advice from someone
who knows about women.

405
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:41,601
If such a person existed, I would.

406
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:44,070
Stick to girls who are more...

407
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,070
How can I put it?

408
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:49,386
- ... on your level.
- Thanks.

409
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,142
She can't be your friend...

410
00:40:54,594 --> 00:40:56,030
let alone anything else.

411
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
I know.

412
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,616
You can't hide anything from me.

413
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:12,418
Wouldn't dream of it.

414
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:30,932
I'm sorry, Gaius.

415
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,296
- I thought you'd be angry with me.
- I was.

416
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:51,230
Right up to the moment
you walked in.

417
00:41:52,147 --> 00:41:55,190
Then I was just grateful
that you're back safe and sound.

418
00:41:59,093 --> 00:42:00,390
Morgana knows the truth.

419
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:03,754
The druids told her she has magic.

420
00:42:04,637 --> 00:42:05,637
Sorry.

421
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:09,211
It's not your fault.

422
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:12,037
You were only doing
what you thought was right.

423
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,070
We both were.

424
00:42:18,823 --> 00:42:20,910
- What happens now?
- You must take care of her,

425
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,750
and hope Uther never discovers the truth
about her powers.

426
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:32,830
Morgana's party hasn't returned.
There's no sign of her.

427
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,714
Where's Guinevere?

428
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:38,310
How can I admit that
I think about her all the time?

429
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,150
Lancelot!

430
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:44,670
I would die for you 100 times over.

431
00:42:49,553 --> 00:42:51,429
Release the wildereon!
