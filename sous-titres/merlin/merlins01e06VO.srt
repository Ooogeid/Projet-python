1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,260
In a land of myth and time of magic,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,500
the destiny of a great kingdom

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,310
rests of shoulders on a young boy.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,480
His name...Merlin.

5
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,990
(Incantation)

6
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,690
Look what's just arrived for you.

7
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,320
Who are them from?

8
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,420
I don't know.

9
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,100
Maybe Arthur.

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,090
How disappointing.

11
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,670
Why? Who would you like them to be from?

12
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,050
I don't know.

13
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,380
Tall dark stranger.

14
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,280
See you in the morning.

15
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:21,143


20
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,060
The body seems to have closed down.

21
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,720
Why?

22
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,810
You don't have an answer, do you?

23
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,240
Nothing you've tried so far has worked.

24
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,300
It's been nearly two days.

25
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,590
What do you know?

26
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,190
I fear she may have some form of inflammation of the brain.

27
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,950
What could cause such a thing?

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,860
Infection, possibly.

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,660
Rest assured, I will do everything in my power to cure her, sire.

30
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,100
Is she any better?

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
She's all but dead, Merlin.

32
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,480
No, you're going to cure her, you have to.

33
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,260
Don't you start? I've tried everything.

34
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,660
I was wondering...

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,760
What?

36
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,100
Maybe I could

37
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,610
help

38
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,690
If you're suggesting magic,

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,710
Have you forgotten what happened with Gwen's father?

40
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,500
This is not a magical illness.

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,370
It must be cured in conventional means.

42
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,180
We keep trying.

43
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,030
See if you can find me some fresh rosemary?

44
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,610
There must be something more I can do.

45
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,760
And yarrow.

46
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,970
What's your business here?

47
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,860
My name is Edwin Muirden, and I have a remedy to cure all ills.

48
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,220
Is that so?

49
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,130
I beg an audience with the king.

50
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,090
The Court has a physician.

51
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,220
I hear the Lady Morgana was gravely ill.

52
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,590
That is no concern of yours.

53
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,670
I might be able to help her.

54
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,120
Our physician has the matter in hand.

55
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,590
I will be at the inn

56
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,680
in case you change your mind.

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,360
It's going to be all right.

58
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,280
It is, I know it is.

59
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,810
She's going to be absolutely...

60
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,500
Merlin!

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,290
What?

62
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,110
You're making me anxious.

63
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,180
But I'm not worried.

64
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,480
Then stop pacing.

65
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,080
I can't preserve her life for much longer.

66
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,970
She has hours, maybe less.

67
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,760
We can not let her die.

68
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,460
Arthur...please.

69
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,147
There's a man. He came to the castle yesterday.

70
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:38,252
He claims he can cure her.

71
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,310
That's ridiculous, he doesn't know what's wrong with her.

72
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,190
He says he has a remedy to cure all ills.

73
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,180
Impossible.

74
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,520
For Morganna's sake, we should at least hear him out. I mean...

75
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,200
What have we got to lose?

76
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,940
Please, Father.

77
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,510
Probably some charlatan hoping for a quick shilling.

78
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,430
I don't care.

79
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,900
If she's about to die, what harm can it do? Give him his shilling.

80
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,860
If there's one chance in a million he can save her, then why not?

81
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,700
Sent for him.

82
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,930
Edwin Muirden, Sire. Physician and loyal servant.

83
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,270
Welcome to Camelot.

84
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,770
Have we met before?

85
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,460
I doubt you would forget a face like mine, sir.

86
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,620
Do you really believe you have a remedy?

87
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,590
There are not many ills that I have not seen and successfully treated, Sire.

88
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,570
So when I heard of the Lady Morgana's sickness,

89
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,070
I felt honour bound to offer my services.

90
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,850
You say you have a cure for all? An antidote for everything?

91
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,670
Yes.

92
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,360
Although it is not quite as simple as that.

93
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,620
Gaius is the court physician.

94
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,380
You are indeed a legend, sir. I am delighted to meet you.

95
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,390
I am curious to know what it is that has affected her.

96
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,910
An infection of the brain.

97
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,590
And your treatment?

98
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,630
Yarrow.

99
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,120
Yes, yes.

100
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Rosemary to stimulate cerebral circulation.

101
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,240
Interesting.

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,430
Why? What would you suggest?

103
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,100
No, no, no, that is all fine.

104
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,440
All good.

105
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,800
If that is... the right diagnosis.

106
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,090
What would your diagnosis be?

107
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,830
without examining the patient...

108
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,270
He should examine her.

109
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,040
I would need my equipment.

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,810
Of course.

111
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,600
You'll have use of one of the guest chambers.

112
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,950
Consider my manservant at your disposal.

113
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,440
I will start work immediately.

114
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,110
Yes...it was all originally designed for alchemy.

115
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,210
Making gold?

116
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,610
You have an interest in science?

117
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,030
Well, science is knowledge.

118
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,980
It has the answers to everything.

119
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,060
Maybe.

120
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,570
It can't explain love.

121
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,840
So you are in love?

122
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,900
No.

123
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,810
I mean... feelings, emotions.

124
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,790
You seem too bright to be just a servant.

125
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,980
Oh, don't be fooled, I'm not that bright.

126
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,880
Yes, we will need that.

127
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,340
Now, we must hurry to the Lady Morgana.before it is too late.

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,730
Put my equipment over there.

129
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,680
Sire, I would be grateful if you could have everyone leave the room.

130
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,620
I require peace and privacy.

131
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,760
Certainly.

132
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,470
That includes you, Gaius.

133
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,580
But I am eager to learn form your methods.

134
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,430
Now is not the time for giving instruction.

135
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,490
I will need all my concentration.

136
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,650
Gaius...

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,010
Why are you spying on me?

138
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,400
I wasnt. Im her maidservant.

139
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,510
Then bring me some water.

140
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,720
Someone should be with her.

141
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,280
Do you want to be responsible for her death?

142
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,260
No.

143
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,710
Then you will bring me some water.

144
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,040
Now.

145
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,950
Or she may die.

146
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:42,890


148
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,600
You will be glad to hear it is not an inflammation of the brain.

149
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,990
What is it then?

150
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,840
It is cerebral haemorrhage.

151
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,880
Haemorrhage? I don't think so.

152
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,430
I found this trace of blood in her ear.

153
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,680
God in heaven.

154
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,880
The severity depends upon the site and volume of the bleed.

155
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,370
If not treated, it can lead to coma...and eventually death.

156
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,100
How could you have missed this?

157
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,990
I didn't see any blood.

158
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,500
Please.

159
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,363
Just thank the fates that you did not administer

160
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:43,340
more rosemary to stimulate the circulation.

161
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,780
Can you imagine what that might have done?

162
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,110
It may have increased the bleed.

163
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,880
Is there a cure?

164
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,280
See for yourself.

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,820
Morgana, this is truly a miracle.

166
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,700
I thought... I really thought...

167
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,770
Oh, you won't get rid of me that easily.

168
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,800
What exactly did he give you?

169
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,200
I've no idea.

170
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,750
But thank heaven he did.

171
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,700
Edwin.

172
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,780
I want to offer you my congratulations.

173
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,790
Thank you. She was all but dead and you brought her back to life.

174
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,960
How exactly did you do that?

175
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,750
I have developed an elixir for the treatment of just such an ailment.

176
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,300
I'd love to know the ingredients.

177
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,380
It is not yet perfected.

178
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,430
You must give me more time before I make it public.

179
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,770
The injury to your face?

180
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,050
It happened when I was very young.

181
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,490
Perhaps it was I that treated you for it.

182
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,260
I told you before, we've never met.

183
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,080
Yes, of course.

184
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,210
Well, I'll leave you to your work.

185
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,600
Name your reward.

186
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,080
I desire nothing more than the good health of my patient, Sire.

187
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,220
There must be something I can do for you.

188
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,830
No.

189
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,108
I will wait until the Lady Morgana is fully recovered,

190
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:19,416
and then I will be on my way.

191
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,640
Why don't you stay a while?

192
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,770
You could live here at the palace.

193
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,740
No. I - I feel I would be trespassing.

194
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,360
And you already have a court physician.

195
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,670
I'm sure Gaius would be glad of your help.

196
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,860
It is a kind offer, but...

197
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,740
Think about it.

198
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,550
Dine with me later. Give me your decision.

199
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,990
To dine with Your Majesty would be reward in itself.

200
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,040
Gaius!

201
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,170
Geoffrey. I'm here to ask a favour of you.

202
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,710
Anything for an old friend.

203
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,740
I wish to see the court records from the time of the great purge.

204
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,540
What possible need can you have for those?

205
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,770
I fear that the past may have come back to haunt us.

206
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,240
All the more reason to keep the records hidden.

207
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,398
I know that neither of us want to remember that time,

208
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:16,800
but this is a matter of great urgency.

209
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,210
The records are sealed, they cannot be opened.

210
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,800
Uther has forbidden.

211
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,610
Geoffrey, I beg of you.

212
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,050
I'm sorry, Gaius.

213
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,810
This time you ask too much.

214
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,460
Even for me.

215
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,940
Edwin.

216
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,160
Berbay odothay arisan yeldo

217
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,850
Very good.

218
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,240
Unsfeffin.

219
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,590
You have magic.

220
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,410
It wasn't me, I didnt do anything.

221
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,392
Then how else did you bring them to life?

222
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:08,950
Only magic can do such a thing.

223
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,940
These little angels are how I cured Lady Morgana.

224
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,470
They repaired the damage to her brain.

225
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,550
They saved her life.

226
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,610
Magic can be a force for good.

227
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,540
I know.

228
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,240
Then why do you fear it?

229
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,270
Uther has banned it, it's not permitted.

230
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,900
Should I have let Morgana die?

231
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,700
No.

232
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,990
People like us, we have a gift.

233
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,430
Do you not think it should be used to make this a better world?

234
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,970
Perhaps.

235
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,840
Dont waste your time picking that up.

236
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,690
Formien doost ronane.

237
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,270
Why waste a talent like that?

238
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,600
And I can teach you.

239
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,020
Readan ax giotan.

240
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,250
What do you use this for?

241
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,470
Gaius doesn't like me to.

242
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:45,050
A gift like yours should be nurtured, practised, enjoyed.

243
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,550
You need someone to help you, to encourage you.

244
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,850
Perhaps.

245
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,160
Imagine what we could achieve, if we shared our knowledge.

246
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,820
I should be getting back.

247
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,530
Of course.

248
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,810
You must promise to keep our secret safe.

249
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,340
Of course.

250
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,040
People like you and I, we must look after each other.

251
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,290
Come in.

252
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,960
Gaius, you've been a good friend to me over the years,

253
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,310
you've done me many kindnesses.

254
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,780
I cant deny you this one request.

255
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,290
The records?

256
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,350
I know you wouldnt ask unless it was important.

257
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,800
You must believe me, there's a great deal at stake.

258
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,110
If Uther were to discover this, he would kill us both.

259
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,160
It is for Uther's sake that I make the request.

260
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,800
Trust me, please.

261
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,800
Thank you, old friend.

262
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,470
It's unlike Gaius to miss something like this.

263
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,190
We all make mistakes.

264
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,370
Gaius is a great physician.

265
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,640
The very best.

266
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,110
Which is what I dont understand.

267
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,610
What?

268
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,540
It's not for me to speak out of turn.

269
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,800
You saved the life of my ward, you may speak as you wish.

270
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,640
He has been prescribing sleeping drafts for Morgana.

271
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,370
She suffers from bad dreams.

272
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,090
Yes.

273
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,160
But the dreams should have been a warning.

274
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,720
You think the two may be connected?

275
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,030
Oh, yes.

276
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,820
A symptom of the illness?

277
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,360
I'm certain of it, yes.

278
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,569
And those potions, they masked the problem

279
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,260
And allowed it to develop to the point where...

280
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,740
...She nearly died.

281
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,680
If you hadn't come along when you did...

282
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,530
but I did and that is all that matters.

283
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,710
Her life was saved... in the nick of time.

284
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,520
Will you undertake a review of his work?

285
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,900
Just to be on the safe side.

286
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,380
If it would put your mind at rest, Sire.

287
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,590
Have you been up all night?

288
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,110
Yes, but it was worth it.

289
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,740
Where are you going?

290
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,160
Er, I told Edwin I'd be up at dawn to collect some supplies.

291
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,770
Well, you'd better get a move on then.

292
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,540
Edwin.

293
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,660
Your scar has healed well.

294
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,770
I often wondered what happened to that poor young boy.

295
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,440
I told you we've never met before.

296
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,960
You used your mother's maiden name.

297
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,390
You are Gregor and Jaden's son.

298
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,750
They were friends of yours.

299
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,260
They were sorcerers.

300
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,670
They practised magic.

301
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,310
And so did a lot of people back then, Gaius.

302
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,280
Uther will be furious when he finds out who you are.

303
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,970
Fine.

304
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,670
Fine. Shall we tell him? Let's go and tell him.

305
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,030
Let's tell him everything.

306
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,220
Ooh, I know...

307
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,840
We could also tell him about Merlin.

308
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,830
Merlin?

309
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,520
You didn't know he was a sorcerer?

310
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,100
I wonder what Uther will do.

311
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,470
Probably have him burnt.

312
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,540
You would betray another sorcerer?

313
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,330
You did.

314
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,550
When you turned a blind eye and let my parents die at the hands of Uther.

315
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,750
At least Merlin doesn't have a son who will try to rescue him from the flames.

316
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,760
You're here to take revenge.

317
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,620
And I have waited a long time.

318
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,280
You think I will sacrifice the King to save Merlin?

319
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,460
Think about it, Gaius.

320
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,750
But if I find out that you told one other person, including the boy.

321
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,010
I will go straight to Uther.

322
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,380
I got your provisions.

323
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,700
Oh, thank you. Merlin.

324
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,230
Gaius was just reminiscing about old times, weren't you, Gaius?

325
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,010
Yes.

326
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,300
Now, I must get back to work.

327
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,340
I'd better get on with my errands.

328
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,800
Yes, of course, you must.

329
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,170
Do you want me to get you anything?

330
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,160
No, I'm fine.

331
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,460
Just do what Edwin asks.

332
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,390
I have been through the court medical records with a fine-tooth comb, sir.

333
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,320
And were your findings satisfactory?

334
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,260
With regret, I would have to say they were not.

335
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,660
How so?

336
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:58,710
Gaius is a great man, thorough and dedicated.

337
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,950
But?

338
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,720
His methods are outdated.

339
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,020
He has failed to keep up with the latest developments.

340
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,610
This has led to a number of errors.

341
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,170
Gaius has served me well for 25 years.

342
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,730
And one cannot blame him for the infirmity those years have brought.

343
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,590
Age can be a terrible curse.

344
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,000
Perhaps it is time to lighten his burdens.

345
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,970
Have you given any more thought to my offer?

346
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,530
Yes.

347
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,720
I have considered it very carefully.

348
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,870
Allow me some time to do the same.

349
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,830
Uther, you can't do this.

350
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,760
You heard what he said. Gaius is old, he makes mistakes.

351
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,910
Gaius has treated me since before I can remember.

352
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,420
You cant cast him out.

353
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,600
You would have died if you care had been left to him.

354
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,300
That's something I could not bear.

355
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,350
I know, but...

356
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,990
I cannot risk something like this happening again.

357
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,300
Hello?

358
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,280
It is me, Gaius.

359
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,960
How old a man can become and yet change so little.

360
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,810
You have not changed either.

361
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:30,680
20 years, almost a lifetime to make the short journey back to where you began.

362
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,750
I'm not here for myself.

363
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,560
The boy?

364
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,590
You know about Merlin?

365
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:44,260
You have struggled against his destiny, but you can no more prevent it than he can.

366
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,740
So, it is true then?

367
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,460
Oh yes.

368
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,270
He and the young Pendragon one day will unite the land of Albion.

369
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,330
But he is in danger.

370
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,130
No. It is my gaoler who stands in peril.

371
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,260
Must Uther be sacrificed for the boy?

372
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,670
Their time cannot come until his is past.

373
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,480
But is that time now?

374
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,510
That is of your choosing.

375
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,450
I will not choose between them.

376
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,830
Then turn a blind eye.

377
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,740
That is, after all, your talent.

378
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,730
Gaius.

379
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,880
My father need to speak to you.

380
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,150
When?

381
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,350
Immediately.

382
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,090
Sire. Is there a problem? Are you unwell?

383
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,220
This is not an ailment you can treat me for.

384
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,870
You've been a loyal servant for many years.

385
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,930
I look on you as a friend.

386
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,040
I regard you in the same way, Sire.

387
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,310
You've been here since Arthur's birth.

388
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,810
And all that entailed.

389
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,330
What I'm trying to do, I think is best for you.

390
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,670
I'm confused, Sire.

391
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,990
I'll give you a generous allowance to make sure you're looked after.

392
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,490
You're retiring me?

393
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,760
I dont want you to worry.

394
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,480
I'll allow you to continue living in your chambers,

395
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,360
until more suitable accommodation can be found.

396
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,230
Because I made one mistake.

397
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,210
Although in truth, Sire, it was not a mistake.

398
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,080
It was...

399
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,100
Yes Gaius?

400
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,210
It was unfortunate, I accept that.

401
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,970
May I ask who is to be the next court physician?

402
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,740
None of this was Edwin's idea.

403
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,450
Initially, he turned down the offer.

404
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,690
I'm sure.

405
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,040
It's not been an easy decision, but...

406
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,660
The younger man, new ideas.

407
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,220
Yes.

408
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,090
You're hesitant.

409
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,020
Is there a reason you oppose his appointment?

410
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,060
Sire...

411
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,740
If you have anything to say, then say it now, Gaius.

412
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,130
This is difficult for both of us.

413
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,400
I thank you for your patronage.

414
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,070
It has been an honour and a pleasure to serve your family,

415
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,370
for all these years.

416
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,410
Gaius! Uther cannot do this to you.

417
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,100
You tried to save Morgana.

418
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,450
Uther's not to blame.

419
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,060
I'll speak to Edwin, you can work together.

420
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,750
No, you mustn't do anything.

421
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,260
I cant stand by and do nothing.

422
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,590
Uther's right. It's time I stepped down.

423
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,380
What are you doing?

424
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,130
I cannot stay when there's no longer a use of me.

425
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,950
You're not leaving?

426
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,400
I believe it's for the best.

427
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,800
Then I will come with you.

428
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,590
Merlin, you're like a son to me.

429
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,110
I never expected such a blessing so late in life.

430
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,360
And you are more than a father to me.

431
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,800
Then, as a father, I must tell you, you must remain here.

432
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,180
Camelot is where you belong.

433
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,420
But you belong here, too.

434
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,140
Not any more.

435
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,590
Merlin, you must promise me you will not waste your gifts.

436
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,860
My gifts mean nothing without you to guide me.

437
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,870
You have a great destiny.

438
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,550
If I have a smally part to play in that, then I am please.

439
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,200
There's so much I've yet to learn.

440
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,360
I need you to teach me.

441
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,300
I'm afraid I'm leaving here tonight, Merlin.

442
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,830
And there's nothing you can do or say that can persuade me otherwise.

443
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,920
I will not let this happen.

444
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,210
Goodbye, Merlin.

445
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,810
I can't understand why Uther would sack him over one mistake.

446
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,840
A mistake that nearly killed Morgana.

447
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,250
Besides, it wasn't the only one.

448
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,240
What do you mean?

449
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,230
Edwin said his work was riddled with errors.

450
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,210
It's nonsense.

451
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,300
No-one wants Gaius to go, but my father's made his decision.

452
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,860
There's nothing anyone can do.

453
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,290
I think you'll be very happy here.

454
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,950
I'm sure I will.

455
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,970
When I reviewed Gaius's work,

456
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,890
I noticed he's been prescribing you arnica.

457
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,960
It's for my shoulder, it's an old battle wound.

458
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,110
It gives me a lot of pain.

459
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,020
May I take the liberty of providing a new prescription?

460
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,400
It should prove far more effective.

461
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,440
Really?

462
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,200
Oh, yes.

463
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,430
It is a remedy to cure all ills.

464
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,160
Gaius?

465
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,420
You're leaving?

466
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,910
Yes, I'm sorry I didn't come and say goodbye.

467
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,210
I dont want you to go.

468
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,300
I dont trust Edwin.

469
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,380
There was no blood in Morgana's ear.

470
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,280
He put it there.

471
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,390
He did something to her, I know he did.

472
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,070
You need to be careful who you say that to.

473
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,780
Im saying it to you, because you can do something about it.

474
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,630
I cant.

475
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,100
But you think the same, dont you?

476
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,410
He's evil.

477
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,800
It's not that simple.

478
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,550
So you're going to turn your back on us.

479
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,420
I have no choice. I'm sorry, Gwen.

480
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,690
In life you always have a choice.

481
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,490
Sometimes it's easier to think that you dont.

482
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,020
Well then, my choice is to leave.

483
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,340
Then I'll miss you.

484
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,660
Goodbye, Gaius.

485
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,100
My lord!

486
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,370
My lord.

487
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,890
It seems the drugs I gave you have taken hold.

488
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,310
Your body is now paralysed.

489
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,770
Now, open your eyes, my Lord.

490
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,540
I want my face to be the last face you ever see.

491
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,210
You took my childhood from me.

492
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:47,280
And now finally, I take my parents' revenge.

493
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,680
Within a few hours, the beetle will eat into your brain.

494
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,380
And you will suffer. as they suffered.

495
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,610
And I long to hear you scream, as they screamed.

496
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,150
The night you gave the order for the fires to be lit.

497
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,930
With your death, magic will return to Camelot.

498
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:32,280


500
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,760
I will not allow you to kill Uther.

501
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,550
You've never had a problem letting people die before.

502
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:11,080
Your parents were practising dark magic, just like you.

503
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,830
And how do you propose to stop me?

504
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,820


508
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,700
You're getting too old.

509
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,620
I have a cure though.

510
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,610


512
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,800
What are you doing?

513
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,350
He was trying to kill the King. I couldnt let him.

514
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,860
I can rule the kingdom now, with you at my side.

515
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,970
We can be all-powerful.

516
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,060
Release him!

517
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,810
Your loss, Merlin.

518
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,760
Svelt Merlin.

519
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,780
Are you all right?

520
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,130
Yes.

521
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,680
Thank you Merlin.

522
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,680
What are you doing?

523
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,640
Uther's ill. It's the same thing Morgana had.

524
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,620
Edwin said he used these to cure Morgana. Maybe we can too.

525
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,170
Elanthia beetles.

526
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,350
Are they magical?

527
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,510
Yes.

528
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,140
They can be enchanted to enter the brain,

529
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,610
feed on it until the devour the person's very soul.

530
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,150
We must going to him.

531
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,560
How do we get the beetle out before it kills him?

532
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,050
It can only be magic.

533
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,880
You cant use magic on Uther. He'd kill us.

534
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,460
We dont have a choice.

535
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,360
Gaius!

536
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,950
There are times when it is necessary.

537
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,220
It is your right.

538
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,050
I dont know how.

539
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,980
If you dont, he's going to die.

540
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:39,310
(spell)

541
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,530
What's happening?

542
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,070
Has anyone ever told you, you're a genius.

543
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,950
You certainly haven't.

544
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,420
Drink this. It'll help regain your strength.

545
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,360
There's nothing wrong with my strength.

546
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,510
Do you remember them?

547
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,280
His parents?

548
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,210
I remember them all, Sire.

549
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,890
Gaius.

550
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,180
Once again, you saved my life.

551
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,580
You've always served me well.

552
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,470
And I know there are things that I've asked you to do,

553
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,040
which you found difficult.

554
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,860
You've always done what you believe to be right.

555
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,880
I was not right to betray you.

556
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,170
I'm sorry.

557
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,250
From now on, I will remember that in the fight against magic,

558
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,730
you are the one person I can trust.

559
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:40,680
I, my family, and my kingdom are deeply indebted to you.

560
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,010
And in honour of this, I not only reinstate you as court physician,

561
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:50,320
but henceforth, you are a free man of Camelot.

562
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,790
It's all ridiculous. I didn't save Uther, you did.

563
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,730
No, no. For once, I'm happy for someone else to take the credit.

564
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,960
You were prepared to sacrifice your life to save me.

565
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,450
Where do you get that from?

566
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,060
I thought...

567
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,120
No.

568
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,460
I didn't do anything.

569
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,070
You saved me and you saved Uther.

570
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,560
Maybe you are a genius.

571
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,340
You think so?

572
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,580
Well, almost.

573
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,340
One day.

574
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,160
Arthur!

575
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,270
I saw Arthur lying underwater drowning,

576
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,550
and there was a woman standing over him, watching him die.

577
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,490
We're dealing with she.

578
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,740
That does not sound like a good thing.
