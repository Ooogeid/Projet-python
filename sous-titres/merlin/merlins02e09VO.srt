1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:03,761
In a land of myth
and a time of magic

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:05,830
the destiny of a great kingdom

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,647
rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.

4
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:10,005
His name...

5
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:11,430
Merlin.

6
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:55,423
If he's not better in the morning,
let me know.

7
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,350
She's a prey to a bounty hunter.

8
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:12,150
She's only a girl!

9
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,070
She'll still fetch
a good price though.

10
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:16,175
Someone'll pay for her?

11
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,527
Uther offers a handsome reward
for anyone with magic.

12
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,876
There must be something we can do?

13
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:26,380
Bounty hunters are dangerous men,
they are not to be meddled with.

14
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,639
You of all people
should understand that.

15
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,190
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

16
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:57,070
He won't find you here.

17
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,830
Here. Sorry...

18
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,510
Sorry,
I didn't mean to frighten you.

19
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,350
I just thought you might be cold.

20
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:13,230
- Why did you do that?
- What?

21
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,430
Help me.

22
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,431
I saw you and...

23
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:25,689
It could have been me in that cage.

24
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,108
You'll be safe down here.

25
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:33,607
I'll come back in the morning
with some food and candles.

26
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:37,939
Will you be all right till then?

27
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,007
I'm Merlin, by the way.

28
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,870
I'm Freya.

29
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,694
I'll see you in the morning.

30
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:07,670
Thank you.

31
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,910
Breakfast!

32
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,110
Where's the meat, cheese?

33
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,994
That's the new breakfast menu.

34
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,110
- This isn't enough.
- We've got to get you in shape.

35
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:23,270
- I'm fighting fit.
- And we want to keep you that way.

36
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,055
- Is there somewhere you have to be?
- Of course not.

37
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:31,310
Good!
Because I've some chores for you to do.

38
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:39,667
Make sure it's hot enough.

39
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,510
- Is it ready?
- Yeah. Freshly heated.

40
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,030
- You bumpkin! It's boiling!
- Boiling?

41
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,710
- You're half asleep today.
- Sorry, Sire. I'll get you some cold.

42
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:10,510
No, I'll get you some.

43
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:14,430
That woken you up?

44
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,179
Raring to go, Sire.

45
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,800
Halig. You come bearing gifts?

46
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,078
Yes, Sire.

47
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,550
A druid girl...

48
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,186
But she escaped last night,
here in Camelot.

49
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:35,258
Don't worry, we'll soon find her.

50
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,410
Have some guards
help with the search.

51
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:42,310
You need to warn them, Sire.
The girl is dangerous.

52
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,590
My informer told me she was cursed.

53
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,870
- How so?
- He didn't know.

54
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,180
He said even the druids
were frightened of her.

55
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:52,179
They cast her out of their camp.

56
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,030
It is against all the druids believe
to reject those in need of care.

57
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,870
Why would they do such a thing?

58
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:58,990
I dread to think.

59
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:01,190
Set up sentries on all the gates.

60
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,590
We should search
the lower town, Sire.

61
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:06,230
Someone may harbour her.

62
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:09,990
- She had help?
- I saw two figures running away.

63
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,390
Give Halig all the help he needs.

64
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,582
I want this girl
and her accomplice found.

65
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,036
Get in line!

66
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,168
Move along.

67
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:38,669
Hurry up.

68
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,554
It's all right. It's OK.
It's me. It's Merlin.

69
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,601
And look...

70
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:28,470
It's good.

71
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,436
Believe me, it's fit for a prince.

72
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:42,550
Is that a druid symbol?

73
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:47,950
- Were you born a druid?
- Why are you asking me these questions?

74
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,312
I didn't mean to.

75
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,550
- I'm sorry.
- I understand.

76
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:57,818
You could never understand.

77
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,630
I know what it's like
to keep secrets.

78
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,590
- Does anyone know you have magic?
- Only you.

79
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,521
And one other person.

80
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,190
He knows
but I'm not sure he understands.

81
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,834
I wish I was like everyone else.
But...

82
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,929
You always know
deep down you're not.

83
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,270
- Because I'm cursed.
- Freya, don't say that.

84
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,635
Magic doesn't have to be a curse.

85
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,150
It can be a gift.

86
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:35,030
Look.

87
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:56,298
Beautiful.

88
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:11,630
I have to go,

89
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,710
someone might notice I'm missing.

90
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,350
But I'll come back.

91
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,510
I'll bring you some more food.

92
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,616
I promise.

93
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,790
- Do you know anything about the girl?
- What girl?

94
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,195
The girl from the cage.
She escaped last night.

95
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,110
- Good. I'm pleased.
- They're out hunting for her.

96
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,550
- Why can't they just let her be?
- Did you help her escape?

97
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,747
You told me not to get involved.

98
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,720
Promise me
you had nothing to do with this?

99
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:57,912
Good.

100
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:00,870
Because when Halig finds out
who helped her,

101
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,459
I wouldn't want to
be in their shoes.

102
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,990
Would you like some water with that?

103
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,830
- I had two drumsticks.
- No, you didn't.

104
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,950
- Merlin, I had two drumsticks.
- Maybe it fell on the floor.

105
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:46,710
I had sausages.

106
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,985
You sure?

107
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,950
They must've fallen.

108
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,414
- Merlin!
- What?

109
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,110
- You can search me, I haven't them.
- Where have they gone?

110
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:56,190
- Strange.
- Very!

111
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,630
- Sure you didn't eat them?
- I haven't had the chance!

112
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:21,830
It's just the Prince's leftovers.

113
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,590
- Does he know you steal his food?
- Not exactly.

114
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,870
- Where were you taking it?
- Home. For my dinner.

115
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:29,150
Really?

116
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:33,950
The druid girl I'm looking for.
Have you seen her?

117
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,630
You know how much she's worth?

118
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,281
More than your life.

119
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,310
So I'm asking you again.

120
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,549
Have you seen the druid girl?

121
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:51,829
Hold him.

122
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,150
- You're lying to me.
- No.

123
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:56,670
I don't believe you.

124
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,319
What do you think you're doing?

125
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,388
We caught the boy
behaving suspiciously, Sire.

126
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,990
He could be harbouring the girl.
And he's going to tell us where.

127
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,901
Leave him alone!

128
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,030
Merlin is my servant.
He has my absolute trust.

129
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:17,790
If you've a problem with him,
you come to me. Do you understand?

130
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,370
Goodnight, Merlin.

131
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,532
Don't forget your dinner.

132
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,310
Thank you.

133
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,430
Are those my sausages?

134
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,750
- You took them?
- To keep you in shape.

135
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:39,750
You say I'm fat?

136
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:42,470
Not yet.

137
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,550
I am not fat!

138
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,230
See, it's working.

139
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:59,936
I'm sorry I took so long.

140
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,879
You must be hungry.

141
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,430
- What?
- Nothing.

142
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,152
- But you're upset.
- No.

143
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:12,750
Did you think I wasn't coming?
I promised you I would.

144
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,630
I scare most people away.

145
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,070
I'm not most people.

146
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,750
- How long had you been in that cage?
- A few days.

147
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,566
- The bounty hunter.
- Halig.

148
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:33,124
How did he find you?

149
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,470
- You can't always trust people.
- I know.

150
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:40,907
That's why I left home.

151
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:44,270
- Where is home?
- Ealdor.

152
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,787
It's a small village.

153
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,560
A few fields, a couple of cows.
Nothing special.

154
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,812
My home was next to a lake,

155
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:58,430
surrounded by the tallest mountains.

156
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,844
In winter the storms
whipped up the water into waves.

157
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:05,366
And you thought they were going to
crash down and take all the houses away.

158
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,341
But in the summer,

159
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:15,270
wild flowers, and the light...

160
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,630
- It was like heaven.
- Sounds perfect.

161
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:19,910
It was.

162
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Was?

163
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,148
My family died.

164
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,564
Have you been on your own
ever since?

165
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,431
You're not on your own any more.

166
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,790
I'm going to look after you,

167
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,230
- I promise.
- You can't look after me. No-one can.

168
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:42,985
You don't understand.

169
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:46,350
I've never known anyone like you.

170
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:55,710
- I wish I could stay.
- You're going?

171
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,339
We need to be careful.

172
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,550
I'll come back in the morning.

173
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,310
You know I will be back?

174
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:16,910
I've never known anyone
like you either.

175
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,790
They've been killed
by some kind of wild animal.

176
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:18,270
Have your men been able
to track the creature?

177
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,039
That's the strange thing.

178
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:23,950
Because the ground is soft.
A bear or a wolf would leave some mark.

179
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,390
- But no tracks.
- What are these?

180
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:28,670
Human footprints.

181
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,830
Did somebody escape the attack?

182
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,350
- No-one has come forward.
- Could the person who made these...

183
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,081
- be responsible?
- I don't believe so.

184
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,230
These wounds could have been inflicted
by a beast of considerable size.

185
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:45,067
And if this was done
by neither a man nor a beast,

186
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:47,110
there is only one explanation.

187
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,030
It must be the work
of a magical creature.

188
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,110
I know... I'm late again.

189
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,550
I'm sorry, but...

190
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:20,310
This is going to be the best bread

191
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,980
you have ever tasted.

192
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,470
What do you want with it?

193
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,830
Come on, you can have anything.

194
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:27,710
Ham, cheese...

195
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,470
Strawberries.

196
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,829
Strawberries it is.

197
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:53,750
- That's not a strawberry.
- It's the right colour.

198
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:06,470
Why are you so good to me?

199
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,442
Because...

200
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,190
I can't help it.
Wasn't I?

201
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:16,510
I like you.

202
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:20,030
With you, I can just be who I am.

203
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,950
We don't have to hide anything.
We don't have to worry.

204
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,458
Merlin, please. Listen to me.

205
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:29,750
I'm not like you.

206
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,801
They must've followed me.

207
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:19,230
They're going to find me.

208
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:21,851
I can't go back in that cage,
I can't.

209
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:23,750
I won't let that happen.

210
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,274
I promised you I'd look after you

211
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:27,990
and I will.

212
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,722
No matter what.

213
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:35,030
You really don't realize
how special you are, do you?

214
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:39,916
You're not scared of me?

215
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,684
Being different
is nothing to be scared of.

216
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:15,750
Stop that!

217
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,110
- What?
- Sit down and eat your soup.

218
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:29,350
- Sorry.
- What is wrong with you?

219
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:30,722
Nothing.

220
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,238
- I feel great.
- Good.

221
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:35,179
You can get on with some chores.

222
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:36,550
Chores?

223
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,582
Unless you've got
something better to do?

224
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:41,270
Sorry, I'm going out.

225
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,729
What time will you be back?

226
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:47,470
Don't wait up for me,
I might be late.

227
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,910
- What're you doing here?
- I couldn't help it.

228
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,030
- It's dangerous.
- I don't care.

229
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:58,590
You have to be careful.

230
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,150
I'm fed up with being careful.
I'm fed up with all of these.

231
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,830
So I've decided
I'm going to get you out of here.

232
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,310
- Out of Camelot.
- How?

233
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:08,133
I'll get you some clothes.
Disguise you.

234
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,866
What's wrong?

235
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:15,710
It's just...

236
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:18,270
I'll miss you.

237
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:22,590
No, you won't.

238
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:25,750
- Because I'll come with you.
- What? 

239
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,990
I told you,
I'm going to look after you.

240
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,361
You can't. Don't say that.

241
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:34,656
- It's not what you want?
- Merlin, you have a good life here

242
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,596
My life is...

243
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,869
I have to keep moving.
Always looking over my shoulder.

244
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,256
People chasing me.

245
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:44,227
Then we'll go somewhere no-one knows us.
Somewhere far away.

246
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,590
You haven't given me your answer.

247
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,670
I want that more than anything.

248
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:58,729
Where will we go?

249
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,590
- Somewhere with mountains.
- A few fields.

250
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:05,670
- Wild flowers.
- And a couple of cows.

251
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:08,863
And a lake.

252
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,143
And a lake.

253
00:24:47,668 --> 00:24:49,110
I'm sure there's an explanation.

254
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,230
- There is.
- Which is?

255
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,631
- Moths.
- Moths?

256
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,979
The castle's overrun with them.

257
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:00,390
Really?

258
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,270
I was checking
if they'd got in here.

259
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:03,670
Have they?

260
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:06,150
Totally infested.
I'll have to burn it.

261
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:07,776
Burn it?

262
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,710
If we don't stop them,

263
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,556
we'll all be walking around naked.

264
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:36,590
- What're you doing?
- Running an errand for Gaius.

265
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,435
For Gaius?

266
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:40,990
Strange.

267
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:44,190
It's not for him.

268
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:46,990
It's only you do a decent day's work.
That's what i care about.

269
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,545
No, it's not for me.

270
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,350
What a man does in his spare time
is completely up to him.

271
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,270
- No, you've got this wrong.
- Colour suits you, Merlin.

272
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,328
- The beast has struck again?
- I'm afraid so.

273
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:02,230
Their wounds match those
of the previous victims.

274
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,707
The men who saw it
spoke of a huge black cat with wings.

275
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:07,870
I was right.
This is not a natural creature.

276
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:11,018
- Are there any tracks?
- Human footprints again.

277
00:27:11,324 --> 00:27:12,830
Can you identify this monster?

278
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,452
I will need more
time to investigate.

279
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:17,270
You always have a theory.

280
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,070
This time, Sire,
I prefer to wait until I'm certain.

281
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:22,350
There is no time to waste.

282
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:24,830
I will report back to you
before the day is out.

283
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,510
Believe me, it was not easy...

284
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:36,565
getting this.

285
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,710
It's beautiful.

286
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,310
You look like a princess.

287
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:50,790
I'm not.

288
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:53,550
I can't take this.

289
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:01,874
I don't understand.

290
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:03,550
You keep doing all this for me.

291
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:05,990
I don't deserve it.

292
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,710
- I want to. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

293
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,821
Here...
Please.

294
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,047
You'll look wonderful in it.

295
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,430
We can leave tonight.
And we'll be together.

296
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,190
We'll need supplies.

297
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,870
Food, water.

298
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:30,230
All right.

299
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:34,830
I'll try to get horses
and we'll need blankets,

300
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,256
but...

301
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,031
that's all we'll need.

302
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:45,390
- Go on, go.
- I won't be long.

303
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,513
Goodbye, Merlin.

304
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,750
- Gaius, I was just...
- Merlin, sit down.

305
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,336
I want to talk to you.

306
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:05,270
Is everything all right?
You look worried.

307
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,067
The beast struck again last night.

308
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:10,870
- There have been two more deaths.
- Do you know what it is?

309
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:13,306
There were no tracks
around the bodies,

310
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:15,953
but human footprints lead
away from them.

311
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,972
It doesn't seem to add up.

312
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,680
The footprints indicate
a human is responsible.

313
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,589
Yet the wounds inflicted
are definitely the work of a beast.

314
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:27,974
Strange.

315
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:31,190
Until I remembered
what Halig said about the druid girl.

316
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,725
That she's cursed.

317
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,990
What's that got to do?

318
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,962
Ancient chronicles
speak of a heinous curse.

319
00:29:40,852 --> 00:29:43,998
It dooms its victim to turn
at the stroke of midnight,

320
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,524
into a vicious
and bloodthirsty beast.

321
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,150
The writers of old
called this creature

322
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,510
a bastet,

323
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,366
a monster of nightmare

324
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:58,476
that inhabits the twilight world
between the living and the dead

325
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,526
I want the truth,

326
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:06,708
Did you release
the druid girl from the cage?

327
00:30:06,878 --> 00:30:07,990
Of course not!

328
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,870
There was a time
when you thought twice before lying.

329
00:30:14,683 --> 00:30:15,790
I did what was right.

330
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:18,950
You know the creature and the girl
are one and the same.

331
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,284
You're wrong.

332
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:23,190
Freya is just a girl.

333
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,430
Please, think about what I'm saying.

334
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:28,907
You know it is the truth.

335
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,725
Where is she now?

336
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:35,350
She's already killed
and she'll kill again.

337
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,790
- She can't stop herself.
- Please, Gaius.

338
00:30:39,268 --> 00:30:41,110
- Where are you going?
- To Uther.

339
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,175
I beg you.

340
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:44,540
Just give me some time
to get her out of the city. Please.

341
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,641
I'm sorry.

342
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,270
I can't let more
innocent people die.

343
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:18,870
I had no choice.

344
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:20,960
Uther had to be told.

345
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,906
They won't find her.

346
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,070
She's gone.

347
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,070
I'm sorry.

348
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,804
I do understand how you must feel.

349
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:43,586
You could never understand.

350
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:48,519
Do you know how it feels...

351
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:50,750
to be a monster?

352
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,941
To be afraid of who you are?

353
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,241
Freya is very different from you.
She's dangerous.

354
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:02,350
Whatever she is and has done,
she doesn't deserve to die.

355
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:09,736
I just hope she's safe.

356
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,403
Somewhere far away.

357
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,515
There she is!.

358
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:41,310
Stop!

359
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,786
Please, let me go.

360
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:04,183
No-one escapes from me.

361
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,470
You're all right,

362
00:35:42,615 --> 00:35:43,813
you're safe now.

363
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:28,910
You must hate me.

364
00:36:30,677 --> 00:36:32,070
I'm a monster.

365
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,137
I tried to tell you.

366
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:35,971
 I know.

367
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:38,830
I wasn't always like this.

368
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,880
You shouldn't try to talk.

369
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,285
There was a man.

370
00:36:42,888 --> 00:36:44,069
He attacked me.

371
00:36:45,492 --> 00:36:48,230
I didn't mean to hurt him,
but I thought he was going to kill me.

372
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,350
- It was an accident.
- But his mother was a sorceress.

373
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:53,133
When she found out,

374
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:56,210
said I'd killed her son,

375
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:59,346
she cursed me to kill forever more.

376
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,202
I'm going to make you better.

377
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:07,790
The wound is too deep.

378
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,327
Please go.

379
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,354
I'm not leaving you here.

380
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,188
You remembered.

381
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
Of course.

382
00:37:48,337 --> 00:37:50,510
I'm so sorry for what
that sorcerer did to you.

383
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:52,710
You have nothing to be sorry for.

384
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,390
There must be something I can do.
Some way to save you.

385
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,110
You've already saved me.

386
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:02,110
You made me feel loved.

387
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,779
I don't want you to go.

388
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:14,793
One day, Merlin,

389
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,110
I will repay you.

390
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:20,255
I promise.

391
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:01,910
I was so worried.

392
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,975
I'm sorry, Gaius.

393
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:13,673
Where's the girl?

394
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,085
She's gone.

395
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:19,470
She's dead.

396
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:28,605
I'm sorry, Merlin.

397
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,935
Truly I am.

398
00:40:58,608 --> 00:40:59,870
I've been looking for you.

399
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,310
You're going to
ask me to polish your armour

400
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,461
and to wash your clothes
and clean your room.

401
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,404
Something's been upsetting you,
hasn't it?

402
00:41:18,514 --> 00:41:19,515
Maybe.

403
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:24,189
Was it when I threw water over you?

404
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,990
That wasn't very nice.
It was a bit unfair.

405
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:34,830
Like you calling me fat.

406
00:41:36,674 --> 00:41:38,790
- Why was that unfair?
- Because I'm not...

407
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:48,008
Still think I need to get in shape?

408
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:59,070
- That's better.
- Thanks.

409
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:03,906
You are right, though.

410
00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:08,590
You need to polish my armour,
wash my clothes and clean my room.

411
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,110
Sleep well, Prince Arthur.

412
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,630
When you'll wake,

413
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,910
may your thoughts be only of Vivian.

414
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,910
My job is to woo.

415
00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:35,830
- He's enchanted.
- Yes, with Lady Vivian. I can see that.

416
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,070
Unhand her
or suffer the consequences.

417
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,710
Your actions may yet
bring war to Camelot.
