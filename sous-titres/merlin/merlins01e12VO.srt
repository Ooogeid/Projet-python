1
00:00:00,558 --> 00:00:03,976
In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,905
the destiny of a great kingdom 

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,800
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

4
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:10,139
His name...Merlin.

5
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,000
Did I surprise you?


6
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,561
You certainly did!

7
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,349
I've got another
surprise for you, too.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,931
It's...lovely.


9
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:40,467
Well, in case you ever need a spare.

10
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:42,560
You know...for this...

11
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:47,001
It's beautiful!

12
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,328
You're a beautiful girl, Gwen.
You deserve beautiful things.

13
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:53,282
But how...I mean...it
must have been expensive?

14
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:56,212
Oh, very. But we're on the up now.

15
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:58,360
Things are going to be different.

16
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,630
What's going on?


17
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:02,143
It'll be all right. Trust me.

18
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:06,761
I won't be back for supper.

19
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:22,800
Hello?

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Is it prepared?

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,866
Yes. 

22
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,308
Look.

23
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:45,321
Very good.

24
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,801
What is that?

25
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm not paying you to ask questions.

26
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,121
The lead, please.

27
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:20,939
Ferian aet gylden.

28
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:23,680
You didn't say anything about magic.
I don't want any trouble.

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,281
Ic bugan peos...

30
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:34,000
Ferian aet gylden.

31
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:39,201
Gold?

32
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:41,961
Pure, priceless gold.

33
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:50,197
Yours, blacksmith.


34
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,961
If you keep your mouth shut.

35
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,733
- Seize them!
- yes sir

36
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:57,680
Quickly, after him!

37
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,761
Stop! He must be caught.

38
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:03,561
Stop that man.

39
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:08,105
Sire, please... 

40
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,548
You're under arrest.

44
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:46,441
Can't sleep?

45
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,040
Something woke me.

46
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,640
What?

47
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,240
I don't know.

48
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:54,241
A feeling.

49
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,280
What kind of feeling?

50
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,925
Powerful magic, here, in Camelot.

51
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,018
Gwen! What's wrong?

52
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,528
My father's been arrested.


53
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:06,925
Arrested? What for?

54
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,250
They say he was making
weapons for a sorcerer!

55
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:10,761
They're charging him with treason!

56
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:11,808
Treason!? 

57
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:13,321
Yes, Morgana, treason.

58
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:16,298
The blacksmith was
consorting with a known enemy.

59
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:17,669
Enemy? What enemy? 

60
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,414
Tauren.

61
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:23,344
The leader of a band of
renegade sorcerers sworn
to bring down the King.

62
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:25,856
And where is this Tauren now?

63
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:29,206
- He escaped.
- Well, then how can you be sure...

64
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,040
Because Arthur saw him
with his own eyes.

65
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,763
Well, even if the man is who you say
he is, 

66
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:36,160
you can't sentence Tom to
death for just being seen with him!?

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,135
We have reason to believe he was
forging weapons for Tauren. 

68
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:41,509
Rubbish!He would never do such a thing.

69
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,440
Every man has a price.

70
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:48,121
Found this on the blacksmith.

71
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:50,510
So he was paid!? 

72
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,950
He's a blacksmith.He could've been paid for
shoeing Tauren's horse! 

73
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:54,040
In gold?

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,882
This is madness.
You condemn a man with no proof!

75
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:58,464
I have enough proof.

76
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,696
Arthur! Have you nothing to say?

77
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,022
Father, the blacksmith committed a
crime, 

78
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,395
but we don't know for certain
he meant treason?

79
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,720
No. You are right.

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,022
Nothing's certain. 

81
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,860
Save one thing.

82
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:23,931
The law stands
or this Kingdom falls.

83
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:25,561
But the law must
give him a fair trial!

84
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:27,186
He'll get a fair trial,


85
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,520
and he'll be found guilty,
because that is what he is.

86
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:34,629
You execute Gwen's father,
and I will never forgive you.

87
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:39,240
Never.

88
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,466
Maybe we should investigate further.


89
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,880
Tauren slept somewhere,
he fed somewhere.

90
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:51,538
Find anyone who
helped him in any way.

91
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,515
They must be punished.

92
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,081
The people must see the laws of
Camelot are not to be trifled with.

93
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,329
Yes, Father.

94
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:05,121
I didn't know Tauren was a sorcerer.

95
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,401
I meant no harm, I swear.

96
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,865
Why didn't you tell me
what was going on?

97
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,026
I knew you wouldn't like it, Gwen.


98
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,881
You're cautious.

99
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,748
I didn't want to let
an opportunity pass. 

100
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,400
Opportunity?

101
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,360
You call this an opportunity?

102
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,160
I know.

103
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,098
I've been a fool.

104
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:27,448
I just wanted to make
a better life for us.

105
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,285
For you.

106
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,099
I wanted to make you happy.

107
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:34,145
But I am happy!


108
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:37,216
I don't need anything else.
I have everything I want.

109
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,216
And I've thrown it all away!

110
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:42,241
It's all right,

111
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:45,561
??? I promise.

112
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,634
What did he say? 

113
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,310
He said Tauren came to him at the forge,

114
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,100
offered to pay him a fortune
for his help, 

115
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:58,566
not to make weapons,
for an experiment or something.

116
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:01,161
- What kind of experiment?
- Tauren didn't say.

117
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,683
But he used some kind of stone...

118
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:05,985
some kind of magic...

119
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,800
She's sleeping now.

120
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,566
I don't understand it.

121
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,561
What would a sorcerer want with Tom?

122
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,637
His forge, Merlin.
It's the finest in the Kingdom.

123
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,800
You think Tom was lying? You
think he really was making weapons?

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,940
- No, I don't.
- Then what?

125
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:24,125
When Tom was arrested,
they found gold on him. 

126
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:25,009
So?

127
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,941
From what Gwen was saying,

128
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:28,591
Tauren's experiment


129
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:31,917
bears all the hallmarks of alchemy.

130
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:33,615
But alchemy's impossible, isn't it?

131
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,405
To change the very nature
of one thing to another has


132
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,057
defeated all who have tried.

133
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:41,267
But if you used magic...

134
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,198
Do you think that's what woke me?

135
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:48,151
It is possible, I suppose.

136
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,681
Gwen?

137
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:00,760
Gwen?

138
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,456
Gwen?

139
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:57,714
Merlin. 

140
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:59,459
Morgana?

141
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,855
How is she?

142
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,321
She's doing OK.

143
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:08,920
We should let her rest.

144
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah.

145
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,669
Morgana, 

146
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,241
have you spoken to Uther?

147
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:18,973
He must realise this is a mistake.

148
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,360
Whatever Tom was doing, it wasn't
plotting against the King.

149
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,161
I know that. Of course I do.

150
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,275
But Uther...

151
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,788
Uther only sees enemies.

152
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:32,648
But Tom is the most
gentle soul I've ever met.

153
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:35,241
But he was seen with Tauren.

154
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,974
That makes him an enemy.

155
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:41,740
Then...

156
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:43,441
there's little hope...?

157
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,121
There is no hope, Merlin.

158
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:47,835
None at all.

159
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:58,041
Arthur?

160
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:24,001
??? I'm sorry.

161
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,466
I came only to see you
were comfortable.

162
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,081
- How's Gwen?
- She's a brave girl.

163
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:31,960
She wishes only to see you free.

164
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:36,373
I know what Uther
thinks about sorcery.

165
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,793
I'm a dead man, aren't I?

166
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,280
I cannot see the future,
only the present,

167
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:48,481
and one must always
seize the moment.

168
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:53,352
Good luck.

169
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:08,961
- They're to be executed?
- Yes, Merlin.

170
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,166
y order of the King?


171
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,679
They committed a serious crime.

172
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:13,935
Giving a man a bed for the night?!

173
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,865
Not a man. A sorcerer.


174
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:17,028
Maybe they didn't know that?

175
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,354
It is not for you
to question my father's actions.

176
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,539
Is that understood?


177
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,936
Yes, Sire.

178
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,840
Now go get on with whatever
you're meant to be doing!

179
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:22,335
Sound the warning bell!

180
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,480
He's just proved his guilt.

181
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,011
You will kill him on sight.


182
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:48,151
But the trial, Father...

183
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:50,127
The trial is a formality. Now I
want him dead. 

184
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:51,640
And an end to it.

185
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,781
Please...

186
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:20,059
Kill him. 

187
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,131
Nooooooo...

188
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,410
No, Father!!!

189
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,970
No, Father!!!

190
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,960
You have blood on your
hands, Uther Pendragon.

191
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,200
Blood that will never wash off!

192
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:52,240
May I remind you that you
are speaking to your King!

193
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:57,441
May I remind you that
a King is wise and just.

194
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:58,923
You are neither.


195
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:00,296
You rule only with the sword.

196
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,971
You know nothing of
what it means to be King.

197
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:06,925
The fate of Camelot
rests in my hands.

198
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,881
It is my responsibility
to protect the people of
this land from its enemies.

199
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,641
Then the Kingdom is doomed.

200
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,760
For one by one you
make enemies of us all.

201
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,961
You speak treason, Morgana.

202
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:20,903
Only a mad man hears
the truth as treason!

203
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,560
Take care, child,
or I'll have you restrained.

204
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,694
You just try.

205
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:41,811
And you will remain here
until you learn your lesson!

206
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,463
Then release me
because I have learned it already.

207
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,481
That you care not for me,
or anyone but yourself.

208
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:50,114
That you are driven mad with power.

209
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:51,859
That you are a tyrant!

210
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,325
All right?

211
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,680
I just don't understand.
Why did he try to escape?

212
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,396
His trial was this morning.

213
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:25,326
Sire...

214
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:30,490
Guinevere, I...

215
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,040
want you to know
that your job is safe.

216
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:37,001
And that your home is yours for life.

217
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:38,908
I guarantee you that.

218
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:43,700
I know that

219
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:46,041
under the circumstances

220
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,840
it's not much but, erm,

221
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,961
anything you want, anything you need,

222
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:55,241
all you have to do is ask.

223
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,041
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,701
Thank you, Sire.

225
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,773
I want the stone!

226
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,540
Where is it? 

227
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,750
I don't know
what you're talking about.

228
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:35,052
I don't know anything about...


229
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:37,030
Now you listen to me.

230
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:41,321
In two days' time, I'll be
at the darkling woods at dawn.

231
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,518
You find the stone,
you bring it to me,

232
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:47,193
or you will die.

233
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,121
Do I make myself clear?

234
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,333
Merlin, come and take a look.

235
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,171
I have been doing
some research and found this.

236
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:03,730
- The Mage Stone?
- Wonder of the ancients.

237
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:06,102
Lost for a thousand years or more.

238
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,357
- What does it do?
- Theoretically,

239
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:12,201
 it could give the
bearer the power of transformation.

240
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:16,321
Gold.

241
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:17,660
The power of alchemy.

242
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,161
 Exactly.

243
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:21,102
I believe it was the Mage Stone

244
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:23,615
 you sensed on the night of Tom's arrest.

245
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:25,080
Of course!

246
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,921
Gwen said that Tauren
had some kind of stone.

247
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,961
You.

248
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:42,012
How proud you must be.

249
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:44,401
Son of the mighty Uther.

250
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,314
How you must look up to him.

251
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,401
Does the King's
little helper bring a message?
Or have you just come to gloat?

252
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:58,360
Guards!

253
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:02,721
Get away from me, you cowards!

254
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,761
You're free to go.

255
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:14,688
Morgana.

256
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,038
 Yes?

257
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:21,038
I swore to him you'd never
challenge his authority again.

258
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,619
I swore that you'd
learned your lesson.

259
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:27,178
Tread carefully.

260
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:30,155
Next time, I may not
be able to help you.

261
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:34,521
Thank you.

262
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,876
You're a better man
than your father. 

263
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:38,342
Always were.

264
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,681
My lady.

265
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,319
Gwen.

266
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:48,482
I didn't expect to see you here.

267
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
- What happened to you?!
- Nothing.

268
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,506
 Well, nothing
a hot bath wouldn't fix.

269
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,320
I spent the night in the dungeon.

270
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:05,200
Uther.

271
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,414
He doesn't like to be challenged.

272
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,600
It wasn't about my father, was it?

273
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:15,481
You have enough to deal with
without worrying about such things.

274
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,721
You shouldn't have done that!

275
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,275
Not on my behalf. 

276
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:23,880
If anything
happened to you, I couldn't bear it.

277
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:27,229
You need to go home, Gwen.

278
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:29,274
Get some rest. Please.


279
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:30,834
I'm fine, my lady.

280
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,439
I insist.

281
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:38,161
Gwen?

282
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:43,600
- Gwen?
- I can't go home.

283
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:48,510
It's understandable

284
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,231
to feel so alone.

285
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,092
Tauren...

286
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:55,068
Tauren?!

287
00:19:57,603 --> 00:20:01,116
He attacked me! He threatened me!

288
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:04,480
He was looking for
some kind of stone.

289
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:05,626
Stone? 

290
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,744
He said if I didn't
bring it to him, he'd kill me.

291
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,930
He's waiting for me
in the darkling woods.

292
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,023
I have to do something.

293
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:14,881
If I don't get this stone
to him by dawn tomorrow...

294
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:20,761
What are you going to do?

295
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,281
I'm going to send
the guards, of course.

296
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,883
It won't be you that Tauren meets.


297
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:27,321
It'll be the Knights of Camelot.

298
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,705
Where's your maid?


299
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:03,961
I've come in her place.

300
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:06,102
- Kill her.
- No! Wait!I brought the Stone!

301
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,195
What else have you brought, my lady?

302
00:22:08,218 --> 00:22:10,440
The Knights of Camelot?

303
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,265
I came alone. I promise you.

304
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:15,079
Give me the stone.

305
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:19,568
You were foolish to come here.

306
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,382
I had no quarrel with your maid.

307
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:26,103
But you, my Lady Morgana,

308
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:29,150
you are Uther's ward.

309
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,756
If you kill me, you'll regret it.

310
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,840
Why's that?

311
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,040
Because I want Uther dead, too.

312
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,961
You? An enemy of the King?

313
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:41,641
And I'm to believe that?

314
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:43,407
Why else would I be here?

315
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:45,721
I can only guess at
your motives, My Lady.

316
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:48,721
You could be a spy, for all I know.

317
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:51,267
And this... 

318
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:54,896
Is it usual for Uther to
chain his friends to a dungeon wall?

319
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:06,757
The stone.


320
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:08,595
You took it to the forge. Why?

321
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:11,362
With it a man can alter
the very essence of things.

322
00:23:12,712 --> 00:23:15,339
He can turn a lump of lead 

323
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,712
into gold.

324
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:18,160
Gold?

325
00:23:18,317 --> 00:23:20,841
A good man died in your
quest for riches, Tauren.

326
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,361
His daughter is now an orphan.

327
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,200
I am sorry for that.

328
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,783
Truly.

329
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:30,201
But we did not want the gold
to line our pockets.

330
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,248
The gold was but a means,

331
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:36,923
a means to rid this Kingdom of
Uther Pendragon once and for all.

332
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:39,621
What are you saying?

333
00:23:39,644 --> 00:23:42,086
Bribery is rife at Camelot.

334
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:46,480
I will use the corruption
at the heart of his kingdom,

335
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:49,877
and such an abundance of gold will
buy me into the King's chambers,


336
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:52,481
even to the King himself.

337
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:55,413
The guards may be fools,
Tauren, but the King is not.

338
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:59,001
Do you have a better plan?

339
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:02,181
To get to Uther,
you need someone close to him.

340
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,157
And you know of such a person?

341
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:08,972
I do.

342
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:10,810
Me.

343
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,647
Pass the salt, please.

344
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,042
You all right? 

345
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:28,415
What?

346
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:30,764
Yeah.

347
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:33,718
I've just got a few things
on my mind, that's all.

348
00:24:35,463 --> 00:24:38,080
Anything you'd like
to talk to me about?

349
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:42,393
I can't imagine you'd be interested.

350
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,974
So long as you're sure.

351
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:49,836
I should be getting to work.

352
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:53,022
Er, Merlin?

353
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:57,487
That's a broom cupboard.

354
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,536
Well, young warlock,


355
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:39,681
what is it you come to ask of me?

356
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:42,699
I need your help. 

357
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,161
Of course you do,

358
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:47,081
but this time,

359
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:49,887
will you heed my words?

360
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,041
The sorcerer Tauren
is plotting to kill the King.

361
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:57,353
He has made an ally of Morgana.

362
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:59,097
I don't know what to do!

363
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,865
Do...

364
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:02,934
nothing.

365
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,960
What do you mean?

366
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,725
If I do nothing, Uther will die.

367
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:09,772
Don't you want Uther dead?

368
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:14,261
It is Uther that persecutes
you and your kind, Merlin.

369
00:26:14,494 --> 00:26:17,377
It is Uther
that murders the innocent...

370
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:20,121
But surely that doesn't
make it right to kill him!

371
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,959
Only if Uther dies 

372
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,880
can magic
return to the land.

373
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,470
Only if Uther dies 

374
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:28,796
will you be free,
Merlin. 

375
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,960
Uther's reign is at an end.

376
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,564
Let Arthur's reign begin.

377
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:38,361
Fulfil your destiny!

378
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:39,937
Wait! 

379
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:43,681
Where does it say
my destiny includes murder?

380
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:47,124
Free this land from tyranny, Merlin.

381
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,100
Free us all!

382
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,498
I didn't expect to see you.

383
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,801
You wish to say something?

384
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,760
I came to apologise, my Lord.

385
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,242
Good.

386
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:17,360
I didn't mean to rile you.

387
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:20,360
I thought only of Gwen.

388
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,707
The poor girl is all alone in this
world. 

389
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,266
It was not my intention
to hurt your maid.

390
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,313
I know.

391
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:29,987
But now she suffers.

392
00:27:30,034 --> 00:27:31,685
And I know how she must suffer.

393
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:32,801
Morgana...

394
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:34,523
 I only meant,

395
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,779
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

396
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,757
That was a terrible day.
Your father was a great friend.

397
00:27:47,036 --> 00:27:49,120
I had no part in his death.

398
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,201
You sent him into battle.

399
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:55,524
You promised him reinforcements
and then gave him none.

400
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:58,244
You sent him to his death.


401
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:00,060
That is not true.

402
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:02,549
- It was never my intention.
- But it happened!

403
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,440
And it keeps on happening.

404
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,292
Morgana! 

405
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:09,084
I'm sorry, my lord.

406
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:23,899
Do you think Uther's a good King?

407
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:26,573
Sorry?

408
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,551
Uther. Do you think
he's good for the Kingdom?

409
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:35,853
Yes. Yes, I do.

410
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:41,121
In the light of recent events,
you may find that hard to believe.

411
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:44,296
Hard? No. Impossible? Definitely.

412
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:48,901
- Merlin...
- Everyone hates him.

413
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:53,459
It is not Uther's job to be liked.

414
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,320
It is Uther's job
to protect the Kingdom.

415
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:59,018
Most of his methods are right.

416
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:00,716
Sometimes he may go too far.

417
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:04,181
 Really?You mean like executing anyone who
even passes a sorcerer on the street?

418
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:07,553
Yes.

419
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:10,320
Despite Uther's failings,


420
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:14,066
he has brought peace and
prosperity to this Kingdom.


421
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,762
But at what cost?

422
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:18,368
 At the cost of
women and children, fathers and sons!

423
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:20,321
When will it end?

424
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,920
It will end when Arthur is King.

425
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,857
Then why not let that time be now?

426
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:29,346
Why not let Arthur be King?

427
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,960
Arthur's not ready.

428
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,462
The responsibility
would be too great.

429
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:35,533
Brave though he may be, he lacks
experience, 

430
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,510
he lacks judgment.

431
00:29:46,463 --> 00:29:48,206
Is there anything you want to
tell me? 

432
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:50,560
I can't... I just..

433
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,045
No, I can't.


434
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:54,534
You've just got to trust me.

435
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:58,521
Gaius, it's something I've
got to work out for myself.

436
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:01,320
I do trust you, Merlin.

437
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,561
Whatever it is,

438
00:30:03,744 --> 00:30:06,116
I know you'll make
the right decision.

439
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:29,761
Morgana!

440
00:30:32,886 --> 00:30:34,979
I'm not disturbing you, I hope?

441
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:36,840
Not at all.

442
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:41,119
These are difficult times.

443
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,514
They put a strain on us all.

444
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,585
Yes, my lord.

445
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,280
I cannot tell you how much it
pains me to be at odds with you.

446
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:54,120
And I with you.

447
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,681
I've been thinking
about what you said.

448
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:04,027
And 

449
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,887
I realise

450
00:31:05,888 --> 00:31:08,680
 I may
have been insensitive.

451
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,028
I should have foreseen the distress


452
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:14,098
that your maid's loss
would cause you,

453
00:31:15,703 --> 00:31:18,800
that it would stir old memories.

454
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,959
I've opened an old wound.

455
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:26,169
For that, I'm sorry.

456
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:30,634
My Lord, it gladdens my heart
to hear these words.

457
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:34,960
I too wish to heal these wounds.

458
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:38,030
Let us visit my father's grave
together

459
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:40,008
 and put the past behind us.

460
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,752
Nothing would give me
greater happiness.

461
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:45,760
Shall we leave tomorrow
at first light?

462
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,659
I will make arrangements.

463
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,010
So, My Lady, what news?


464
00:32:18,056 --> 00:32:19,730
Uther has fallen for the bait.

465
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,120
We ride out in the morning
for the Old Cairn on the hill.

466
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:25,360
Are you sure
you're committed to this?

467
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:29,522
More than ever - I want Uther dead
as much as you.

468
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:32,127
As much as anyone
in this rotten Kingdom of his.

469
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:36,040
Then the deed is as good as done.

470
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:57,152
Merlin?

471
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:59,151
Gwen. 

472
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:00,735
How are you doing?

473
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:02,841
I was about to ask you
the same question.

474
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,408
I'm fine. 

475
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:07,898
Fine.

476
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:12,681
Morgana's been amazing
these last few days.

477
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,880
I think you've been amazing.

478
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:19,364
After 

479
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:21,596
all that's happened,

480
00:33:23,713 --> 00:33:26,080
getting your life back together...

481
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,504
It's better than sitting in
an empty house, 

482
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:31,440
waiting for my
father to walk through the door.

483
00:33:34,132 --> 00:33:35,680
The thing I find hardest to bear

484
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,620
is that people will always think
he was guilty


485
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:39,318
because he tried to escape.

486
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,601
I know he was innocent.

487
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:43,993
I think he tried to escape
because he knew

488
00:33:43,994 --> 00:33:46,273
 that whatever
he said or did he'd be killed.

489
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,560
Uther had already made up his mind.

490
00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:54,441
That's the kind of man he is.

491
00:33:57,693 --> 00:34:00,880
I wouldn't blame you
if you wanted him dead.

492
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,135
If Uther died I'd feel nothing.

493
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:10,018
He means nothing to me.

494
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,739
But if you had, you know,


495
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,040
the choice, what would you do?

496
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:22,761
If you had the power
of life and death over Uther,

497
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:26,462
would you kill him?

498
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:28,400
For what he did?

499
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,840
No!

500
00:34:35,602 --> 00:34:37,625
No?

501
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:42,081
What would that solve?

502
00:34:42,324 --> 00:34:44,841
That would make me a murderer.

503
00:34:45,161 --> 00:34:47,696
That would make me as bad as him.

504
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:52,000
You're right.

505
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:57,200
Of course you're right.

506
00:34:57,697 --> 00:35:00,720
- Is anything wrong?!
- No, no. See you later!

507
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,881
Do you think that we could have
some privacy?

508
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:02,028
Fine. Wait here. We're in no danger.

509
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:03,165
sire

510
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,801
Father...

511
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:00,400
Ackwele!

512
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:12,964
Your father was the greatest man
I've ever known.

513
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:17,360
He stood for everything
this kingdom represents.

514
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:21,358
Truth, 

515
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,034
justice, valour.

516
00:37:25,337 --> 00:37:29,779
A hundred times he saved my life
on the battlefield.

517
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:34,244
His courage and his honour
were without equal.

518
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:49,966
When Gorlois died, I lost
the truest friend I ever had.

519
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,035
For he was as fearless in
questioning my judgment

520
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:55,478
 as he was
in defending my kingdom.

521
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:58,502
That's the mark of a true friend.

522
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,881
I know how he
respected you, my lord.

523
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:07,665
But I don't share these memories.

524
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:12,321
How can I? I was ten years old.

525
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:17,080
I only know I loved him
and he was taken from me.

526
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:24,131
When he died, 

527
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:26,480
and I took you
into my care,

528
00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:29,969
you fought me from the beginning.

529
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,505
Your will is as strong as my own.

530
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:37,201
You challenge me as a friend must.


531
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:39,063
As your father did in his time.

532
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:41,621
But when I do, you clap me in irons.

533
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:44,528
I know I'm not an easy man.

534
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,668
My temper 

535
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:50,297
blinds me sometimes.
There are things that I regret.

536
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,924
Gwen's father?

537
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,669
Yes.

538
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
Are you saying you were wrong
to have Tom killed?

539
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,902
Yes.

540
00:39:22,578 --> 00:39:24,280
Ackwele!

541
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,370
I will strive to listen to you more


542
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:41,696
and quarrel with you less.

543
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:44,440
a blessing to me, Morgana.

544
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:46,920
You are the daughter I never had.

545
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,417
Your counsel is invaluable,

546
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,976
as is your friendship and your love.

547
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:55,023
???

548
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:57,481
- My Lord
- Please forgive me, Morgana.

549
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,674
No!

550
00:40:21,444 --> 00:40:24,676
Die, Uther Pendragon!

551
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:20,960
- Busy day?
- Had its moments.

552
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:23,029
I hear that Tauren tried
to assassinate Uther.

553
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:25,611
- That's what I hear.
- And that Morgana saved him.

554
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:28,424
How many men were there? Three?
Four? 

555
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:29,635
Yeah, something like that.

556
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:31,308
Morgana must have shown
extraordinary courage 

557
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:33,721
to have
defended a king against such odds.

558
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:37,401
I suppose you had
nothing to do with it?

559
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:41,080
Oh, you know. Just background stuff.

560
00:41:41,472 --> 00:41:44,403
No need to be so modest, Merlin.


561
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:46,822
- Sorry.
- It's not a criticism.

562
00:41:46,845 --> 00:41:49,286
It's a compliment. 

563
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:50,450
Right.

564
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,543
Thanks, Gaius.

565
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:09,801
Somebody help me!

566
00:42:18,313 --> 00:42:20,568
Please, Merlin.???

567
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:26,200
You should not have killed my friend.

568
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:38,383
