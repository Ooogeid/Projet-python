1
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:03,665
<i>In a land of myth
and a time of magic,</i>

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:05,735
<i>the destiny of a great kingdom</i>

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,675
<i>rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.</i>

4
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:10,020
<i>His name...</i>

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,190
<i>Merlin.</i>

6
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:27,535
I hope your trip
isn't too upsetting.

7
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:30,035
Thank you, Arthur.

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,629
Ensure you return to Camelot
before dusk.

9
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,125
Where are they going?

10
00:00:55,915 --> 00:00:58,345
Morgana's on a pilgrimage
to her father's grave.

11
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:07,725
You look troubled, Gwen.

12
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:09,695
I'm fine.

13
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,795
You're very secretive these days.

14
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:16,315
I'm beginning to think
there's a man involved.

15
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:20,315
When do I get
to meet any decent men?

16
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:47,555
My ladies.

17
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,030
You must follow me.

18
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,190
Head for the path. Go!

19
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:28,110
I warn you,
I'm Uther Pendragon's ward.

20
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:31,085
He'll have your heads
if any harm comes to me.

21
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:34,030
I have no intention of harming you.
At least not yet.

22
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,215
You're much more valuable to me
alive...

23
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,190
Lady Morgana.

24
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,150
Arthur's Knights

25
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,670
Merlin - 2x04
<i>Lancelot and Guinevere</i>

26
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,715
He's coming.

27
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,310
You know what you must do?

28
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:27,750
I trust you are... comfortable?

29
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,670
Where are you taking us?

30
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:31,805
You'll find out soon enough.

31
00:03:32,305 --> 00:03:35,185
We have a long journey ahead of us.
Get some rest.

32
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:41,165
I wish to bathe.

33
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,270
You wish to bathe?

34
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:47,990
I am the King's ward,
and accustomed to certain standards.

35
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:51,230
I'm sure you are quite contented
to stink like a pig,

36
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:52,685
but I'm not.

37
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,390
The Lady Morgana wishes to bathe.

38
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,935
Who wants to help me guard her?

39
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:06,270
Morgana hasn't returned to Camelot.
There's no sign of her anywhere.

40
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:09,070
Send riders
to the outlying villages.

41
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:11,835
I want every guard,
every sentry looking for her.

42
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,510
I'll dispatch them immediately.

43
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,790
You may find the water a little...

44
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:22,165
icy.

45
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:24,445
I'm sure I'll manage.

46
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:32,285
If you were any kind of gentlemen
you'd give me some privacy.

47
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:35,310
Well, unfortunately for you,
I am no kind of gentleman.

48
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,145
Get on with it.

49
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:59,545
- You can at least turn your backs!
- So you can make a run for it?

50
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:03,070
- Do you think I'm that stupid?
- I think you're very stupid.

51
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:12,615
Run!

52
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:20,765
No, no. This way.

53
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:34,985
Come on!

54
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,045
Put your arm around my shoulder.
Come on.

55
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,150
No, no, no. We'll never outrun them.
You must go on without me.

56
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:44,030
- I'm not leaving you behind.
- Morgana, go, please,

57
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,505
you must get help.

58
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,710
- Take this.
- Go!

59
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,195
Check to see if anyone's alive.

60
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,675
This is Mercian craftsmanship.

61
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:28,845
It's a ransom note.

62
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:31,425
They've taken Morgana hostage.

63
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,290
The tracks lead off this way.

64
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,225
Where's Guinevere?

65
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,190
How could you let her escape?

66
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:16,190
You bring me this servant?

67
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,675
She's worthless to us!

68
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:32,025
Put them on.

69
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,230
What are you going to do with me?

70
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,790
Hengist has never met
the Lady Morgana.

71
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:39,310
For all he knows,

72
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:41,635
you could be Uther Pendragon's ward.

73
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:45,270
I will not impersonate my mistress.

74
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:47,630
Then you will die where you stand.

75
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:55,830
It is such a relief to see you safe.

76
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:58,345
I couldn't bear
the thought of anyone harming you.

77
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,950
- The bandits still have Gwen.
- I believe they were Mercian.

78
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,670
We've received reports that
Hengist has crossed the border.

79
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:06,235
- Hengist?
- You must send a rescue party.

80
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:09,430
If Hengist is holding her, it would take
a small army to rescue your maid.

81
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,985
We can't abandon her!

82
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,785
How many men would you have me
sacrifice to save a servant?

83
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,455
As many as it takes!

84
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:19,055
Gwen gave herself up
so that I might escape.

85
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,065
I owe her my life.

86
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:23,765
She did so willingly
and she will be honoured for it.

87
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26,435
I don't want her honoured.
I want her rescued!

88
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:32,855
She is more than just my maid.

89
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:36,255
She's my friend.

90
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,166
A servant is of no value
to these bandits.

91
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,005
I fear she's dead already.

92
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:53,155
We cannot give up hope.

93
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:00,725
I'm begging you.

94
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:04,105
- You have to do something.
- My father's right.

95
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,085
I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do.

96
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,695
How can you say that?

97
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:10,725
How can you live with yourselves?

98
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,175
All of you!

99
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,050
Kendrick,

100
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,575
I was beginning to think
you'd failed me.

101
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:50,510
May I present the Lady Morgana?

102
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,070
You're as beautiful as they say,

103
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,310
Lady Morgana.

104
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:10,071
I demand that you
release me immediately.

105
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,350
Just as soon as Uther Pendragon

106
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:14,085
pays your ransom.

107
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:16,070
In the meantime,

108
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:18,750
you'll be my guest.

109
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:23,295
Do not flatter yourself.
I'm not your guest, I am your prisoner.

110
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:24,935
As you wish.

111
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,775
Take her to the dungeon.

112
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:38,310
How can you be so heartless?

113
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,505
She's the most kind, loyal person
you'd ever meet

114
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:42,475
she's been more than a friend
to all of us,

115
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,965
and you would leave her
at the mercy of those animals?

116
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:46,535
Have you no shame?

117
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:48,945
Do you think of no-one but yourself?

118
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,270
I knew you were many things, Arthur
Pendragon, but I didn't know you were

119
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,880
a gutless coward.

120
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:58,225
Perhaps if you'd stop shouting at me
for one second,

121
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:00,895
you'd notice that I'm packing.

122
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:07,830
- You're going after Gwen?
- Of course. What do you take me for?

123
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,685
I couldn't disagree with father
in public.

124
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,230
Bring her home.

125
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:26,510
I suppose you and Arthur
are going after Gwen?

126
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:30,910
Don't even think about telling me
not to go. There's nothing you can say

127
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,995
- that will stop me.
- I wasn't going to try and stop you.

128
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,910
All I ask is you make sure
you come back safely, too.

129
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,295
I'll fetch the horses,

130
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,285
you distract the guards.

131
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,035
How do I do that?

132
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,385
I don't know!
Do I have to think of everything?

133
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,284
What did you do? I said
distract them, not knock them out.

134
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:49,135
There's just no pleasing you
sometimes.

135
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:58,005
Silence!

136
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,625
Our royal guest,

137
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:04,485
Lady Morgana,

138
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:06,270
has grown bored.

139
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:10,025
She needs entertaining.

140
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:26,950
Bring on the challenger.

141
00:13:47,715 --> 00:13:50,870
Only one of you will
emerge from the cage alive.

142
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,125
Do you accept the challenge?

143
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,760
Come on!

144
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,240
Kill! Kill!

145
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,630
What is your name?

146
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,065
My name is Lancelot.

147
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:29,515
You've proved yourself to be a...

148
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:31,755
skilful warrior.

149
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,335
I believe you may even
have impressed

150
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:37,005
our royal guest,

151
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,030
Lady Morgana.

152
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:44,965
My lady.

153
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,065
Next time you fight...

154
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,790
do not expect any mercy.

155
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:56,070
Release the wilddeoren.

156
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,670
What are you doing?

157
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:35,630
I must have fallen asleep.

158
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:38,630
I'm exhausted.

159
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,350
I can...
barely keep my eyes open.

160
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,485
Thank you. I feel so much better.

161
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:49,865
Guinevere's life is at stake.
We can't afford to waste a second.

162
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:09,105
I could not believe my eyes
when I saw it was you.

163
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,910
I thought my mind was deceiving me.

164
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:13,430
Why does Hengist think
you're Lady Morgana?

165
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,709
He believes he's holding Morgana
to ransom.

166
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:20,505
When no ransom is paid,
he'll realise the truth

167
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,755
and then he'll throw me
to those beasts.

168
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,469
I will not allow that to happen.

169
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,665
What are you doing here?

170
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:30,270
Are you one of Hengist's men?

171
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,755
What became of you
after you left Camelot?

172
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:39,595
There are few opportunities
for men like me,

173
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:41,670
so I've earned a living
the only way I know,

174
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,395
with a sword in my hand.

175
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:49,065
It seems it's my destiny
to entertain men like Hengist.

176
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:51,505
I don't believe that of you.

177
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:53,790
You were so full of hope.

178
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:55,865
I was wrong.

179
00:17:57,075 --> 00:18:00,275
- The world is not like that.
- I still see the hope in you.

180
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,825
I do not accept it is gone.

181
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:13,845
I have thought of you often.

182
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:17,190
Have you thought of me at all?

183
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,125
I thought I'd never see you again.

184
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:29,110
Someone's coming.

185
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,390
No matter what it takes,

186
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,190
I'll find a way
to get you out of here.

187
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:35,870
I will.

188
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,155
What's happening?

189
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:53,980
How long was I asleep for?

190
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,150
Long enough.

191
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:56,670
Did you get some rest?

192
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:58,645
Couldn't sleep.

193
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:03,430
I've never seen you like this

194
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:05,005
about anyone.

195
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:07,070
- What are you talking about?
- Gwen.

196
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,790
You really care about her,
don't you?

197
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:15,550
What I care about is
not wasting any more time talking.

198
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,010
Let's get moving.

199
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:31,005
I have not yet received word
from Uther

200
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,670
that he intends to pay your ransom.

201
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:38,535
I was informed that the King was

202
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,710
extremely fond of his ward.

203
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:47,670
Are you not surprised he's content
to leave you here to die?

204
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:51,750
How can I know the King's mind when
I'm locked in your stinking cell?

205
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,555
If I do not hear from Uther

206
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:57,825
by dawn tomorrow,

207
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,795
this stinking cell

208
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:04,005
will be the last place you ever see.

209
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:19,985
The ransom

210
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,375
was supposed to be delivered
to the Vale of Dinaria.

211
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:25,415
If they're holding Gwen anywhere,
it has to be there.

212
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,190
Which means...

213
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:30,615
we can save a day's riding if we

214
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,790
cut through the Tunnels of...

215
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,235
Andor.

216
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:45,313
I know that face.
I'm not gonna like this.

217
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:48,550
- What's in the tunnels?
- They're infested with wilddeoren.

218
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:52,230
- What are wilddeoren?
- They're like giant...

219
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,870
baby rats.

220
00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:00,550
- Baby rats? They don't sound so bad.
- They feast on human flesh.

221
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:03,238
We should go over the mountains.

222
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:09,005
What are you doing?

223
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:12,775
Wilddeoren are completely blind,
they hunt by sense of smell.

224
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:15,607
Gaia berries will put
them off the scent.

225
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,190
If we smear ourselves with them,

226
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:21,008
perhaps we can pass through
the tunnels undetected.

227
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:27,750
These stink!

228
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,350
- They're really bad.
- You'd prefer to be eaten alive?

229
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:34,052
Pass me some more, will you?

230
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:59,729
- I just stood on something.
- That was my foot.

231
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,090
How much further is it?

232
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,530
Wilddeoren coming this way.

233
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,555
Whatever happens,

234
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:30,203
keep completely still.

235
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,690
Lancelot!

236
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,165
I was terrified
I might find your cell empty.

237
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:19,435
There's been no word from Uther.

238
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,436
I fear Hengist
is growing suspicious.

239
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:24,870
You must keep up the pretence.
I will not allow you to die here.

240
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,193
What about you?

241
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,590
- I have little to live for.
- Do not say that.

242
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:32,916
It's the truth.

243
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,070
For all my words, for all I believed,
I've come to nothing.

244
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:40,710
You are everything
that is right with this world.

245
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:48,957
I did not know you felt that way.

246
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:52,096
I didn't even know I could...

247
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,128
feel this way about someone.

248
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:01,037
Then you have given me
a reason to live.

249
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,310
Be ready.

250
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,695
I'll come for you before nightfall.

251
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,461
Gaia berries worked.

252
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,510
- You didn't know if they worked?
- Not for sure.

253
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:33,157
Now you tell me!

254
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:37,110
"What's that wilddeoren eating?
It's just Merlin."

255
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,325
- Were you trying to get us both killed?
- I'm sorry.

256
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:43,670
Shouldn't have risked your life
like that.

257
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:49,342
They do say love
makes you do strange things.

258
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:51,936
What are you talking about?

259
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,630
Why can't you admit
your feelings for Gwen?

260
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:01,110
It's so obvious
a blind man could see it.

261
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:04,710
Is it really that hard to admit
you like her? Just say it!

262
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:06,057
I can't.

263
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,630
How can I admit
that I think about her all the time?

264
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:16,070
Or that I care about her
more than anyone?

265
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,053
How can I admit

266
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,590
I don't know what I'll do
if any harm comes to her?

267
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:25,334
Why can't you?

268
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,042
Because nothing can ever happen
between us.

269
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:32,305
To admit my feelings,
knowing that...

270
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:36,172
hurts too much.

271
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:41,361
Who's to say nothing can happen?

272
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:44,081
My father won't let me
rescue a servant.

273
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,990
Do you believe
he'd let me marry one?

274
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,619
- You want to marry Gwen?
- No, I don't know.

275
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,040
It's all talk,
and that's all it can ever be.

276
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,230
When you're king,
you can change that.

277
00:26:05,536 --> 00:26:07,790
I can't expect
Guinevere to wait for me.

278
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:10,277
If she feels as you do,

279
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:12,696
she'll wait for you.

280
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,950
- We don't even know if she's alive.
- No, she is.

281
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:21,604
We will find her.

282
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,310
Come on,
we've got a long trek ahead.

283
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:32,055
If you dare tell anyone about this,

284
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,470
I promise
I will make your life a living hell.

285
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:40,230
You mean more than now?

286
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:48,733
We could talk about your feelings
while you walk?

287
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,203
Shut up, Merlin.

288
00:26:54,128 --> 00:26:55,110
Morgana...

289
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,350
I keep asking myself,

290
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,015
why does Uther

291
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:06,822
not pay the ransom?

292
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:09,692
He's a rich man.

293
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,430
Why would he leave his beloved ward

294
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:15,881
to suffer a slow

295
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,309
and terrible death?

296
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,870
I don't know.

297
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:22,317
Please...

298
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:26,382
It must be very upsetting to know

299
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,590
that Uther has abandoned you.

300
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:30,419
It seems

301
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:34,750
like no-one in the world
cares for you.

302
00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:37,173
I don't know why he doesn't pay.

303
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,556
Please, I don't know.

304
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,950
Take her to her cell.

305
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:49,710
Bring Kendrick to me.

306
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:51,831
Perhaps he can tell me

307
00:27:52,698 --> 00:27:54,030
why the Lady Morgana

308
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:57,435
has the hands of a serving girl.

309
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:01,568
Wait!

310
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:10,323
We did capture the Lady Morgana,

311
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,650
but she escaped.

312
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:15,830
So who exactly
do I have in my dungeon?

313
00:29:18,254 --> 00:29:19,830
Lady Morgana's maid.

314
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,797
Thank you for being so honest.

315
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,121
Release the wilddeoren.

316
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:32,909
No, please! I'm begging you!

317
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:53,413
We haven't a moment to lose.

318
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:12,190
Find her!

319
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:15,030
Bring her to me alive!

320
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,110
Follow this tunnel. It will take you out
beyond the castle walls.

321
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,549
I will buy you as much time
as I can.

322
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,750
- I'm not leaving you.
- You must.

323
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,145
I will not leave you here to die.

324
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:32,270
I would die for you
one hundred times over.

325
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,458
Live for me,

326
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:40,204
or everything
that I am has been for nothing.

327
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:52,749
As long as I live,
my feelings for you will never fade.

328
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:57,390
Gwen, don't stop running
until you are well away from here.

329
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:00,910
Run.

330
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:01,630
We'll have to scale the walls.

331
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:05,411
Maybe there's another way in.

332
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:07,408
Go and knock on the front gate.

333
00:32:07,578 --> 00:32:10,841
I'm sure if you ask nicely,
they'll hand Guinevere over to you.

334
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:20,512
Before you die,

335
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:23,288
I can promise you

336
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,541
the most unimaginable pain.

337
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,143
You can do what you will with me.

338
00:32:36,543 --> 00:32:37,510
I do not care.

339
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,350
You can do no harm to Guinevere.

340
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:43,769
Was that her name?

341
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:46,630
A serving girl.

342
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:52,949
And you really believe
she's worth dying for?

343
00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:57,950
She is worth more to me
than you will ever understand.

344
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:14,603
You thought she'd got away?

345
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:19,750
You've failed her,
and that must hurt you

346
00:33:20,262 --> 00:33:22,687
more than I will ever understand.

347
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,440
You really are completely useless,
aren't you, Merlin?

348
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
It's...

349
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:53,153
harder than it looks.

350
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:01,536
Now you're just showing off.

351
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:11,381
You distract them,
I'll knock them out.

352
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:15,164
How do I distract them?

353
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,250
- What are you doing there?
- Nothing.

354
00:34:30,347 --> 00:34:32,310
Actually, it's a funny story.

355
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,069
I was out walking,
and I took a wrong turn,

356
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:38,549
and here I am. Do you know the way
to the Vale of Dinaria?

357
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:40,349
Who are you?

358
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:42,259
Me?

359
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:43,990
I'm no-one.

360
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:48,878
- It's him you need to worry about.
- Who?

361
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:58,259
That actually worked pretty well.

362
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:05,618
What do you say?

363
00:35:06,892 --> 00:35:08,030
Shall I spare them?

364
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:12,190
Kill!

365
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:16,869
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

366
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:19,429
You have nothing to be sorry for.

367
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,740
You reminded me of who I am.

368
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,310
I will die with faith in my heart.
That is worth more than anything.

369
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:34,840
Release the wilddeoren!

370
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:17,491
What are you doing here?

371
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,390
- I came to save Gwen. What about you?
- Likewise.

372
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:26,622
Get behind us.

373
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,549
The tunnel, it's our only chance.

374
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:49,112
Don't sit there cowering. Let's go!

375
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,590
After them!

376
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,430
Take Guinevere,
I will hold them off.

377
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,629
Guinevere, we have to go.

378
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,093
Open the gate!

379
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:30,950
I see you're still up
to your old tricks.

380
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,590
It's probably best
you don't tell anyone about that.

381
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:44,989
Good to see you both.
Where are your knights?

382
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,333
It is just us.

383
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:52,950
We've got to keep moving.

384
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,949
We owe you our lives.

385
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,070
I am surprised you would
undertake such a rescue mission

386
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,150
with just the two of you.

387
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:51,270
Father would not risk the lives
of his knights for a servant.

388
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:54,470
And yet you disobeyed him
and came here anyway?

389
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:01,519
Truth is, I only came
because Morgana begged me.

390
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:11,004
I think I'll get some rest.

391
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,550
- We should all get some rest.
- I'll stand guard for a while.

392
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:26,595
I'll just...

393
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,470
sit here, then.

394
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:41,939
Is it true

395
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:44,634
that Arthur came to rescue Gwen

396
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,160
because Morgana begged him?

397
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:54,630
He has feelings for her, no?

398
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,390
What about you?
Do you have feelings for Gwen?

399
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:05,697
My feelings do not matter.

400
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:08,901
I will not come between them.

401
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:14,309
Tell Gwen...

402
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:19,242
Tell Gwen
that she has changed me forever...

403
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,586
... but some things cannot be.

404
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:40,924
Where's Lancelot?

405
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,070
Where is he?

406
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
He's gone.

407
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,510
He said that some things can't be.

408
00:41:04,611 --> 00:41:07,861
He wanted you to know
that you've changed him forever.

409
00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:31,591
We have a long walk ahead of us.

410
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:17,525
There's someone here to see you.

411
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,479
I thought I'd never see you again.

412
00:42:50,036 --> 00:42:51,736
Look on the bright side.

413
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:54,576
You've still got me.

414
00:42:54,983 --> 00:42:57,194
- That supposed to cheer me up?
- Thought it might.

415
00:42:57,364 --> 00:43:00,390
You really are a complete idiot,
aren't you, Merlin?

416
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:05,470
The potion is prepared.

417
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,829
Lady Catrina is not
all that she seems to be.

418
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,430
Already he falls for me.
I can see it in his eyes.

419
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,790
How could he resist such beauty?

420
00:43:19,478 --> 00:43:21,609
Are you gnna tell Uther
his friend's a troll?

421
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:23,430
It is exactly what I'm going to do.
