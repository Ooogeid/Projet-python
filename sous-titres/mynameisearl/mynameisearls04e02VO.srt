1
00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:02,505
MONKEYS TAKE A BATH

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,772
<i>When Dad called to say
that we need to come by</i>

3
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:08,488
<i>and pick up all our old stuff,</i>

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,300
<i>I didn't realize we were going
to have to buy it back.</i>

5
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:18,813
Your father said you could have
everything for $64.73.

6
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,941
I tried to talk him down,
but he seemed pretty firm.

7
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,863
Hey, look! It's Milo.
Remember him?

8
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:30,029
Mom and Dad got him for me
'cause he always tells the truth.

9
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:34,387
"Hi, Earl. Remember that time
you got real drunk and pooped in bed?"

10
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:37,165
That is true.
Embarrassing but true.

11
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,417
Yeah. I never really liked Milo.

12
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:42,921
Ah! Darnell, check it out!
It's one of them IQ machines.

13
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,548
Get the ball in the furthest hole,
if you do, you're a genius.

14
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:48,355
I used to play this at the mall
when we would skip school.

15
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:50,831
I was the only one
that could get genius every time.

16
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:52,944
They called me
"The Ball Genius".

17
00:00:53,132 --> 00:00:55,423
In the 7th grade,
that name took on a new meaning,

18
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:57,477
but this is where it all started.

19
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:58,812
How much for this?

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,689
$3.25.

21
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,023
What?

22
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:04,107
May I remind you
that I'm the mother of

23
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:06,319
what you thought for a second
was your grandson?

24
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,071
$4.

25
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:16,576
- What are you doing?
- I'm not stealing it.

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,283
I'm just going to hold on to it
so nobody buys this thing.

27
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:22,402
Couple of hours, they'll be begging us
to take it off their hands.

28
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,067
"Ball Genius."

29
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:28,241
See? This is why I don't go
to yard sales with you.

30
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:33,054
I'm trying to decide between
buying the lawn darts or our baby teeth.

31
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,808
The lawn darts are more fun,
but our baby teeth are more practical.

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
<i>Seeing those lawn darts
was Karma's way of telling me</i>

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>it was time to do #87 on my list:</i>

34
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:43,982
<i>"Chased away
Mom and Dad's friends."</i>

35
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,375
<i>In the '80s, our next-door neighbors,
Cathy and Clark Clark,</i>

36
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:49,070
<i>were my parents' best friends.</i>

37
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,613
Have you guys seen

38
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:54,242
this new "We Are The World" short film
on that music television video channel?

39
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,877
I think spiders heat up
faster than ants.

40
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:07,505
I'm good at this, Randy.
Maybe I will be a scientist.

41
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:08,840
That'd be awesome.

42
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,925
"Randy forgot to wipe earlier."

43
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:13,428
I mean, all those poor,
starving children,

44
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,472
and... and all those musicians

45
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:19,121
with their different musical styles,
Bob Dylan, Dan Aykroyd,

46
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:22,140
and they're all coming together,
and they're all harmonizing

47
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,290
for... for humanity.

48
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:28,735
What a tool.

49
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:33,156
<i>Seeing a grown man shed
actual tears was hilarious,</i>

50
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:35,283
<i>and, once we saw it,
we had to see more.</i>

51
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:45,655
Poor birdies!

52
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,672
<i>Dead birds were so much fun,</i>

53
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:53,384
<i>we took it up a notch, and found a place
at the mall that made fake newspapers.</i>

54
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:58,626
Why are babies
killing themselves?

55
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,395
<i>But, eventually,
we pushed him too far.</i>

56
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:09,978
<i>Later that afternoon,</i>

57
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:13,062
<i>Clark realized
he just couldn't take it anymore.</i>

58
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:22,244
All I know is he was
real upset about something.

59
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:25,333
He was so emotional, I couldn't
understand what he was talking about.

60
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,335
It just doesn't make any sense.

61
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,879
People just don't move
in one day.

62
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,815
Something's going on here.

63
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:35,093
"Randy tortured Mr. Clark
and made him cry."

64
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:40,155
Come on, Randy.
We need to go find the Clarks.

65
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:43,292
"Randy touches himself sometimes."

66
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,705
Easy, buddy.

67
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:50,451
Hey! You don't want that.

68
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:52,610
It's all jacked up,
it ain't got no marble on it.

69
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,971
Not a problem.

70
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:02,453
That's a straight-up,
street-balling move right there.

71
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:04,956
You're like
the Karl Malone of mailmen.

72
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:07,599
How much, Carl?

73
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,919
$3.25.

74
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,504
No. That's mine.

75
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:14,699
I had my eye on it way before
you had your eye on it.

76
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:16,926
- I'll go $4.00.
- $4.25.

77
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,536
- $4.68.
- $5.00.

78
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:20,221
Darnell, how much money you got?

79
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:23,516
$45. But we gotta stop and
get Dodge's asthma medicine,

80
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:24,934
so more like...

81
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:26,706
- $45.00!
- Sold.

82
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,651
Oh, hell to the no.

83
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:31,983
This was on there
when we were bidding on it.

84
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:33,714
If you wanted
your fake peeper back,

85
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:36,139
shouldn't have
driven up the price so high.

86
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,649
Every day's a new adventure.

87
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:43,844
<i>Wasn't that hard to find Mr. Clark.</i>

88
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,262
<i>He was the only Clark Clark
in the phone book,</i>

89
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:48,280
<i>and they only moved
one town over.</i>

90
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,929
Guys, I appreciate
what you're doing,

91
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:53,838
but you weren't
the reason we moved.

92
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,458
- We weren't?
- No.

93
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,448
We moved because...
Well...

94
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,290
I really...
I can't say why we moved.

95
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:03,741
But you know what?

96
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,929
I have lived with this
for too long,

97
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:09,643
and maybe it's time
that I got it off my chest.

98
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:13,265
We moved because your mother
and I had an affair.

99
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,364
Mom?

100
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,700
You want some cookies?
I've got hot snickerdoodles.

101
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:24,954
You know what I want
more than cookies?

102
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,038
I wanna know why
you had sex with Mr. Clark.

103
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,455
I'd prefer the snickerdoodles.

104
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,795
Who told you
about me and Clark Clark?

105
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,224
Damn you, Clark Clark!

106
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:40,297
<i>Apparently,
Dad was always working,</i>

107
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,716
<i>and Clark's wife was always
at self-defense class,</i>

108
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:45,490
<i>so they kept each other company,
but just as friends</i>

109
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,198
<i>until the A&P
had a sale on wine coolers.</i>

110
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:49,973
Do you have any queens?

111
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:53,606
You are the only queen
that I can see.

112
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:56,505
Go fish.

113
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:01,057
Do you have any twos?

114
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:04,374
I've got two lonely lips
and two supple breasts.

115
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:08,299
Why don't you come on over here
and fish around for them?

116
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:18,350
<i>The next day,
Mom was ashamed of herself,</i>

117
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,653
<i>and broke things off.</i>

118
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:20,758
Kate, no.

119
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:23,219
You are the most generous lover
I have even known.

120
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,140
Cathy just rolls over and goes to sleep
after she gets her tinglies.

121
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,430
What we did was wrong, Clark.
It was a moment of weakness.

122
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,889
It was a mistake.

123
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:34,552
Your husband is the one
making the mistake.

124
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:36,482
He doesn't take care of you
like I would.

125
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,937
Look! He doesn't even have
your storm windows up yet!

126
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,744
Your father's home!

127
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:50,163
Anyone want to tell me
why the Clarks are moving?

128
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:51,910
I tried to talk to him,

129
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,459
but all he'd do is tell me
I need to put up storm windows.

130
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:56,461
Is there a hurricane coming?

131
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:59,578
All I know is he was real upset
about something.

132
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:03,176
He was so emotional, I couldn't
understand what he was saying.

133
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,106
Doesn't make any sense.

134
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:07,430
People don't just move in one day.

135
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,223
You need to tell Dad.

136
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:10,678
Your father is no angel.

137
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,894
I once found a Hooters receipt
in his pocket.

138
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:16,564
Look, no one knows what it's like
to be cheated on more than I do.

139
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,633
Dad deserves to know.

140
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:20,276
Dad deserves to know what?

141
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,529
"Oh, Carl, wait until you hear this.
Apparently, your wife..."

142
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:27,784
What the hell is going on?
What was the puppet talking about?

143
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,786
Mom?

144
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:35,605
Do you remember 1985?

145
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:39,420
My wife's a whore!
All neighbors are welcome!

146
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,570
Line forms at the garage!

147
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,689
<i>When you're little,
and your parents split up,</i>

148
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:46,217
<i>they decide who gets you.</i>

149
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:48,151
<i>When you're adults,
and they split up,</i>

150
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:49,689
<i>you decide who gets them.</i>

151
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:50,828
<i>I got Dad.</i>

152
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,009
Women!

153
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,982
You're with them for 40 years!

154
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,855
You learn the special way
to fold the towels!

155
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,900
You go see Neal Sedaka
at the Civic Center!

156
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,103
You even put up
one of those piece of crap

157
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:05,530
Thomas Kincaid paintings
in the bedroom, and for what?

158
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:08,116
I hear ya! You steal for them,
fight for them,

159
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:12,135
they still hand you a different-colored
baby from a different-colored father.

160
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:13,958
- Bitches.
- Bitches!

161
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:16,582
And Clark Clark.
Who the hell does he think he is,

162
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,256
sticking it to my mother?
Your wife?

163
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,839
- He's lucky you don't kick his ass!
- Oh, he's lucky, all right.

164
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:25,174
But his luck just ran out.

165
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,440
I'm going to make him wish
he went across the street

166
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,972
and banged Mrs. Henderson.

167
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,142
Let's do this!

168
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,705
I know this isn't
a time to brag,

169
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:37,353
but I did bang
Mrs. Henderson.

170
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,402
Why did you stop?

171
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:46,320
Keep doing what
you were doing in the car.

172
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,518
Sorry.

173
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:49,743
It's the eye of the tiger,

174
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,577
it's the thrill of the fight,
rising up

175
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:55,650
to the challenge of a rival.

176
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,874
And the last known survivor

177
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,062
stalks his prey in the night...

178
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,839
Hi, Cathy. Is Clark here?

179
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:07,196
Yeah! He's doing a puzzle
in the sun room.

180
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,426
How are you?

181
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:10,540
Great.
Can you get Clark, please?

182
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Sure.

183
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,975
Rising up,
back on the streets.

184
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,391
Did my time took my chances?

185
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:23,561
Went the distance,
now I'm back on my...

186
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:24,880
Here he comes.

187
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:29,280
Carl, listen.

188
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:38,331
What the hell is wrong with you?!
He's half your size!

189
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,339
It's the eye of the tiger,

190
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,299
it's the thrill of the fight.

191
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:52,498
Rising up to the challenge
of a rival.

192
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:29,840
My nose stopped bleeding.

193
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,553
But I think I ruined my sock.

194
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:35,763
Well, at least you got
to punch Clark Clark.

195
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:37,791
You got your revenge.

196
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:39,832
Man, I'm jealous.

197
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:42,330
That's got to feel
pretty good, huh?

198
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:43,914
Actually, no.

199
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,190
I don't feel
any different at all.

200
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:48,065
And you know why?

201
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:50,361
'Cause I'm not really mad
at Clark Clark.

202
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:51,871
I'm mad at your mother.

203
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:53,823
That's who I should be
getting revenge on.

204
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:56,227
Dad, don't fight Mom.

205
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,452
You already got your ass kicked
by one woman today.

206
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,997
I'm not fighting your mother.

207
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,625
If I want to feel better,
I need real revenge.

208
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:05,186
An eye for an eye!

209
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,066
I need to get laid!

210
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:15,143
Swear to God I used to be able
to do this drunk when I was a kid.

211
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:16,920
Stop eyeballing me, Willie.

212
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,931
If you want this back,
fork over the cash.

213
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,804
Last night, she took a shower,
and she left it on the sink.

214
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:24,979
I tried to grab it,

215
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,196
but it was staring at me,
I got a little freaked out.

216
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:29,437
If she puts it down again,
it's looking the other way,

217
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:31,231
I'll give it another shot.

218
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,654
I know it was wrong, I do,

219
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:35,614
but it's not like
he didn't push me there.

220
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,265
He was never home.

221
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:40,012
And when he was,
well, let, let's just say

222
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,872
your father does not know
his way around a woman's body.

223
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,665
He's got two moves.

224
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,942
Squeeze the Charmin
and poke around down there

225
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,794
like he's trying
to pop a balloon.

226
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:51,955
Yeah, that guy sure is
terrible at touching moms.

227
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,448
I know what might
make us feel better:

228
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:56,018
not talking about this stuff.

229
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:59,017
I mean, what do I have to do,
draw him a map of my vagina?

230
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,668
Oops. I'll go get us
more drinks.

231
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:04,434
I'm gonna tinkle.

232
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:12,996
Randy, you look stressed.

233
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,573
What's the matter, punkin'?

234
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,763
They're words on the menu
you're stuck on?

235
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:21,285
If I tell you,
you promise not to say anything?

236
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:25,831
Well, well, well.

237
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:28,542
Fee, fi, fum, fo,

238
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,504
I smell the stink
of a stank-ass ho.

239
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,547
Oh, God!

240
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:35,187
Who's the piece
of trash strumpet

241
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:37,373
who doesn't deserve
the same last name as you?

242
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:40,304
That's right.
I read your Christmas letters.

243
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:41,747
Leave me alone!

244
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:43,891
We might've gotten along

245
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,310
if we'd a own we both can't be
satisfied by Hickey men.

246
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,229
I am nothing like you!

247
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,233
Damn it, you got me
with your heel!

248
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:57,192
Maybe I had
one moment of weakness,

249
00:12:57,312 --> 00:13:00,205
but you, you made
cheating a lifestyle.

250
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:01,947
I love my husband.

251
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:04,078
He does the best he can.

252
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,880
Great.

253
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:19,378
Darnell, get me a rag!

254
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:22,632
Somebody kicked me in the face
in the bathroom again!

255
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,058
There she is.

256
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,951
If your mother thinks
she's the only one with sexual options,

257
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,439
she is mistaken.

258
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:35,276
Once again, Dad, I gotta say
I'm a little conflicted about this.

259
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,810
Next.

260
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:39,738
Hello, Brenda.

261
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,032
Carl. I like your shirt.

262
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,288
According to you
on numerous occasions,

263
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,495
this color brings out
the blue in my eyes.

264
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,185
Makes 'em sparkle.

265
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:52,114
- What can I do for you today?
- Today...

266
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:54,974
Today I'd like to open
a separate account,

267
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:57,628
one that would be
separate from my wife.

268
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:59,583
Perhaps one that I could use

269
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:02,001
to pay for dinner for two
at <i>Casa de Maison</i>

270
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:05,723
with somebody that likes...
blue eyes?

271
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,078
Next.

272
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:08,879
Oh, you can go.

273
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,228
I'm just watching my Dad
try to get laid.

274
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,189
Look, uh...

275
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,769
I'm sorry if I sent
the wrong message,

276
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:17,985
but I was just trying
to be nice.

277
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:19,737
It's just customer service.

278
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:22,298
With a face like that,
who needs hair?

279
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,071
So...

280
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,663
just to be clear,

281
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:31,687
you're, uh...

282
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:33,814
not interested in...

283
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,420
having sexual relations
with me?

284
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,345
I'd like to close
my account, please.

285
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,229
<i>Our first stop was a disaster,</i>

286
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:49,280
<i>but Dad assured me
that the bank teller</i>

287
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,433
<i>wasn't the only woman in town
who flirted with him.</i>

288
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:52,353
Next.

289
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:54,522
Hello, Diana.

290
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:55,941
There is my Carl.

291
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,209
I'd like a box
of your largest condoms,

292
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,733
ribbed for her pleasure,

293
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,981
and when I say "her",
I might just be talking about you.

294
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:09,286
... gotta go again.

295
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:10,955
Take off my other sock.

296
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,107
<i>Dad said there was one other woman
in town who flirted with him.</i>

297
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,628
<i>The waitress at the diner.</i>

298
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,962
<i>So we headed over
to give him one more chance.</i>

299
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,139
You stay here.

300
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,818
Those other women
would've been game

301
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:23,102
without my son with me.

302
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,552
It creeped them out a little.

303
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:28,938
<i>I wanted Dad
to feel better, but...</i>

304
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,129
<i>I was hoping
he wouldn't find a girl.</i>

305
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:33,269
<i>I was also hoping
he didn't get hit again,</i>

306
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:36,558
<i> 'cause he was outta socks
and I'd been wearing mine for a week.</i>

307
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:44,314
She's coming out
after freshening up.

308
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:46,059
I told this was a slamdunk.

309
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,284
I'm running across the street
for condoms.

310
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,312
We really should talk about this.

311
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:54,431
I don't know if I'm cool
with this actually happening.

312
00:15:58,963 --> 00:15:59,963
Patty?

313
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:04,015
When did you start working here?

314
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:06,517
A couple of months ago.
I had to pick up a second job.

315
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:07,758
My hooking took a hit

316
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:10,347
when Bush monkeyed
with the daylight savings schedule.

317
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:14,336
I'll be needing these
for use this evening

318
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:15,879
with a young lady who delivers

319
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,188
on the promises
she makes with her eyes.

320
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,066
I thought you need
the largest kind we had.

321
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:23,235
Just ring it up, pecker tease.

322
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:27,781
I just don't know that sex with a hooker
is what my Dad's looking for.

323
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,618
Not that you're not great.
I've heard wonderful things.

324
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,044
Thanks.

325
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:34,228
Word of mouth is very important
in my line of work.

326
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:37,708
It's right up there with
eye contact and concealing sores.

327
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:38,709
Hello.

328
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,180
I see you met my son.

329
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:44,060
I just had to run across the street
for a few personal items,

330
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,841
and a little something for you.

331
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:47,519
Thank you.

332
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,500
Oh, they have nuts in them.

333
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,070
That's sweet, but
some of my clients have allergies

334
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,559
so I need to keep this
a peanut-free zone.

335
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,482
Dad, Patty's a hooker.

336
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:04,376
No, she's not.

337
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:06,904
She's a waitress.
A waitress who flirts with me.

338
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:08,990
Daytime hooker,
nighttime waitress.

339
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,809
Damn it! This was not how
this was supposed to work.

340
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,498
It's not revenge sex
if I have to pay for it!

341
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,820
If you change your mind,

342
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,247
sometimes I have coupons
in The Penny Saver.

343
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:21,418
- It says "massage," but...
- I'm not changing my mind!

344
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:25,250
Alright, so the chicks
didn't work out.

345
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,536
Forget the chicks.

346
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,758
I say we go back to Clark Clark's,
but this time, we bring a bat.

347
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:31,696
We do it when his wife's at work.

348
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,595
Why did she do this to me?

349
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:36,198
Why did she make me
feel this way?

350
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:41,302
<i>There were two things I could've sworn
I'd never see with my own eyes:</i>

351
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:43,870
<i>a real bear carrying
a picnic basket,</i>

352
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,401
<i>and my Dad crying.</i>

353
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,818
<i>I was taught from a young age
that Hickey men don't cry.</i>

354
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,820
Don't cry, or I'll give you
something to cry about.

355
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:56,180
<i>And no matter what happened,</i>

356
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,807
<i>he always made sure
I never saw him shed a tear.</i>

357
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,730
Damn it.

358
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,616
Earl, go get me
my reading glasses.

359
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,595
I have to look for my fingertip.

360
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:11,143
<i>Whatever life dished out,
he always remained strong.</i>

361
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:13,868
Well, my mom's dead.

362
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:15,133
Pass the corn.

363
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,475
<i>A funny thing happens when</i>

364
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,895
<i>the man you look up to your whole life</i>
<i>breaks his own rules and cries.</i>

365
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,576
<i>It finally gives you permission to.</i>

366
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,851
Everything with Joy
happened so long ago,

367
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:31,579
but all this stuff with Mom
makes it hurt again.

368
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,951
That's what I'm afraid of.

369
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:36,910
It's never gonna go away.

370
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:39,426
<i>So we cried.</i>

371
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
<i>Together.</i>

372
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:45,241
<i>We even tried talking
about how we felt,</i>

373
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,684
<i>which was hard for my Dad</i>

374
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:48,941
<i>and the son he raised
to ignore his feelings.</i>

375
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:51,907
It's like someone
took out my stomach.

376
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,474
I don't even know why.

377
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:57,352
Stomped on it.
That's what it feels like.

378
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,489
Yeah, but not with a sneaker.

379
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,101
With something worse.

380
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:03,061
Like a golf shoe.

381
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:05,814
I don't know golf shoes.
Are they heavy?

382
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,941
No, but they got
spikes on the bottoms.

383
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:10,694
Oh, then, yeah, Dad,
that's what it feels like.

384
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:12,415
A golf shoe.

385
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,958
Right.

386
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:17,619
<i>And the more honest
we were about how we felt,</i>

387
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,139
<i>the more honest
we became about everything.</i>

388
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,982
If I just wouldn't've spent
so much time at work.

389
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,876
Do not blame yourself.

390
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:28,669
I will not stand here
and let you blame yourself.

391
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,929
I'm not saying what
they did wasn't wrong,

392
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:33,467
but I will say
they're not the only ones to blame.

393
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:35,427
Okay, you're bringing
some stuff up.

394
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:37,548
I'm not sure
I'm ready to hear.

395
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:41,000
<i>After a whole night of crying,</i>

396
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,994
<i>and more hugging
than I'd like to admit,</i>

397
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:45,261
<i>we discovered
something unexpected.</i>

398
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:47,857
I think I feel better.

399
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:49,592
Me, too.

400
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:09,492
<i>Anger's a heavy burden to carry,</i>

401
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:12,470
<i>but Dad realized that revenge
didn't make it any lighter.</i>

402
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:14,061
<i>Forgiveness did.</i>

403
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:27,271
<i>And forgiveness lightened
the burd of guilt, too.</i>

404
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,323
<i>And if it worked
for Mom and Dad,</i>

405
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:45,083
<i>maybe it could work
for me, too.</i>

406
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,626
I forgive you
for cheating on me.

407
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,265
Good, 'cause I'd do it
again in a heartbeat.

408
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,665
Now move,
you're standing in my light.

409
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:56,708
<i>Forgiveness was a peaceful feeling.</i>

410
00:20:56,828 --> 00:20:59,094
<i>I felt calm.
More focused.</i>

411
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:01,346
<i>I can't say if my words
made Joy feel the same,</i>

412
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,266
<i>but I like to think
it might have.</i>

413
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:07,144
I did it! I did it!

414
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,455
Genius!

415
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:10,981
<i>And maybe by forgiving her,</i>

416
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:14,180
<i>I showed her there's room in your heart
for things other than revenge.</i>

417
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,555
<i>That sometimes,
it's far better to give an eye</i>

418
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,134
<i>than to take an eye.</i>

419
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:22,839
Thank you.
