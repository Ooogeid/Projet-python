1
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:05,873
<i>Like most of mangled vegetables,
the hospital wanted to throw me out.</i>

2
00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:09,004
We can put him
in county-run long-term care

3
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:10,180
or...

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,996
you can take him of our hands

5
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:16,060
and receive a one-time payment
of $2,000 in Camden cash,

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,788
redeemable
at more than six local businesses.

7
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:20,084
Paintball!

8
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:23,533
Karma wouldn't dangle a paintball
in front of us if it weren't a sign.

9
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:24,778
We'll take it.

10
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:27,083
<i>Randy felt he made the right choice,</i>

11
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:29,502
<i>and everywhere he looked,
he saw a proof of that.</i>

12
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:32,030
How cool was it that right
when I got tired to carrying you,

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,663
Karma made a supermarket.
Karma rocks!

14
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:37,550
Brace yourself.

16
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,924
That's good, Earl.
You didn't pee that time.

17
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,426
KILLERBALL

18
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:51,787
<i>When you're in coma getting
pushed down the street in shopping cart,</i>

19
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:53,408
<i>things go pretty slow.</i>

20
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:55,433
<i>But my mind time was flying by.</i>

21
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:58,574
50 years in this old house.

22
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:00,605
We sure do have a lot of memories.

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,597
Speak for yourself.

24
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:05,026
I can't remember
what I had for breakfast.

25
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:09,236
Do you remember the time
that we got into that huge fight,

26
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:11,324
and neither one of us
wanted to move out.

27
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,995
Your side needs its diaper changed.

28
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:33,974
Remember
when our own kids stopped being cute,

29
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,369
and Cousin Wendall came
and stayed with us?

30
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:42,647
Why, Cousin Wendall.
What a surprise.

31
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:44,608
What are you doing here?

32
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:46,085
My parents are dead,

33
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,800
so I'm moving in
with my favorite cousins

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,281
on the honky side.

35
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:56,573
That irrepressible scamp
certainly turned our world upside down.

36
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:01,833
Randy, wait up!

37
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:03,877
Look what I bought at the store.

38
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:06,796
Just kidding, it's Earl.
I brought him home from the hospital.

39
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:08,757
He's still got a touch of the coma.

40
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,347
Yeah, they're a tough thing to shake.

41
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,345
I missed a lot of my thirties like that.

42
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,411
Well, he's not gonna be in it that long.

43
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:17,626
I mean,
he's almost back to normal already.

44
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:18,558
Watch.

45
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:24,356
Every opening I stick my finger in,
I get a different reaction.

46
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,185
Sounds a lot like my job.

47
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,861
Hey, I got a wheelchair I can sell you.

48
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:31,717
Does it have a shelf underneath?

49
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:34,866
'Cause this shopping cart's got
a real good shelf underneath.

50
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,711
Well, it's a pretty nice chair.

51
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:39,204
It used to belong
to this pimp friend of mine, Snooky.

52
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:42,243
He got rid of it, 'cause he thought
people didn't respect the chair.

53
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,812
Now I has one of his bitches
carrying him around in a backpack.

54
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:45,961
Yoda style.

55
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,854
<i>Randy loved the Yoda backpack idea,</i>

56
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:53,030
<i>but once he saw Snooky's wheelchair,
that looked even better.</i>

57
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,343
<i>It had everything
a crippled pimp would want:</i>

58
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:58,306
<i>a bumping sound system,
spinner hubcaps,</i>

59
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:01,831
<i>a hook for a sock full of batteries,
it even had a little shelf.</i>

60
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:04,980
Oh, snap!

61
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,829
Darnell, I'm tempted to cripple you,
just to get one of those.

62
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:09,609
I'd tempted to let you do it.

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,409
Did the hospital need the bed?

64
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:14,488
It's nice to see
they throw white folks too.

65
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:17,106
Actually, I could've signed in
a long-term care.

66
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:20,829
But Karma offered us paintball,
Camden cash and a wheelchair.

67
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,164
So, obviously,
I'm doing the right thing.

68
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:26,213
So, you're just going
to take care by yourself?

69
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:28,761
Remember when you turtle-sat
the 1st Mr. Turtle,

70
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:31,124
he ended up outside his shell,
you shoved him back in,

71
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,675
like I wouldn't notice?

72
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,615
These are the things
that make me worry.

73
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:36,697
Randy, you can't do this, trust me.

74
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,008
I know what it takes
to take care of somebody.

75
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:41,850
I've proven that three times
to child services.

76
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,159
Would you guys leave me alone?
He's fine.

77
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:47,071
I've already been looking after him
a whole day.

78
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,438
It's your favorite, Earl.

79
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,863
Chubby's chicken with fries
and a couple beers.

80
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:57,574
It's gonna taste
so good in our blood.

81
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,366
Plus, the best part
about Earl being out of the hospital

82
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,054
is he can start doing stuff
from the list on his own.

83
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:42,145
If Karma was making him better
when we were crossing things off,

84
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:45,163
think how much better he'll get
if he starts crossing 'em off himself.

85
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,251
Is this a gum wrapper in his mouth?

86
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,170
Yeah, I wasn't near a trash can.

87
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:55,781
Here's one
he could definitely do on his own.

88
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,398
"Number 241:

89
00:04:57,518 --> 00:05:00,212
"Make Derrick Stone late for work."

90
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:03,160
<i>In every neighborhood,</i>

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,280
<i>there's people that annoy everybody else
by working odd hours.</i>

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,319
<i>In the trailer park,
those hours are 9:00 to 5:00.</i>

93
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:17,070
How about a little respect, jackass?

94
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,774
It's not even 9:00 in the morning.

95
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:23,576
You know we were up until 5:00.
You yelled at us at 4:30!

96
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:27,065
I'm really sorry, guys.
I just don't want to be late for work.

97
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:30,526
<i>So to make sure
we got a good day's sleep,</i>

98
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:33,394
<i>me and Randy decided
to put in a good night work.</i>

99
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,334
Son of a bitch!

100
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:43,425
Randy talked to Derrick and found out

101
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,472
being late was just
the start of his problems.

102
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:47,343
Showed up late for work,
got fired,

103
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:50,020
my girlfriend said she didn't date
losers, so she broke up with me.

104
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,306
My own personal 9/11.

105
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,691
And it was actually September 11th.
I'm not being dramatic.

106
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,661
Well, you won't be late anymore.

107
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:59,898
Now you can drive in the carpool lane
'cause I put Earl in your backseat.

108
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:01,656
So can I cross you off the list?

109
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:04,062
I guess. I take the bus now.

110
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,578
Sold that car to the lady next door.

111
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:30,268
You're right, Earl. Your mother's dress
is see-through in this picture.

112
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:33,355
What kind of 95-year-old woman
doesn't wear underwear?

113
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:36,610
<i>After finding a bitchin' pair
of truck stop sunglasses</i>

114
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,443
<i>to cover up my red, swollen eyes,</i>

115
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:41,161
<i>Randy tried to find a list item
I could do in a coma.</i>

116
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,175
<i>That turned out to be a lot harder.</i>

117
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:44,698
"Number 116:

118
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:48,244
"Rolled John Fenster
down a hill in a Porta Potti."

119
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,705
You think Earl would mind
if we did that to him?

120
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:52,565
Randy, if you were in a coma,

121
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,288
would you want someone rolling you
down a hill in a Porta Potti?

122
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:56,512
Let me think.

123
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,052
Oh, no. No, I would not.

124
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,953
Here we go.
Earl could do this on his own.

125
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:10,288
It's perfect.

<i>Me and Randy were always jealous of
our neighbours Brett and Tiffany Hensen,</i>

128

<i>'cause their folks took 'em
on great vacations.</i>

129
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:22,487
Oh, man, they got to go to Hawaii.

130
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:27,284
Man, they got to go
to Mystery Funland.

131

<i>Not only did they get
to go on cool vacations,</i>

133

<i>now, they didn't have
to walk places either.</i>

134
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:40,630
<i>That's when I decided
I wanted in on their fun.</i>

135
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:43,982
Brace your home!

136
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:47,425
Excuse me.

137
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:50,354
Could you at least
roll us into the shade?

138
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,477
Anyway,

139
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:57,120
I didn't know where I could find you
so I thought...

140
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,981
What?

141
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:00,422
That you'd look for us
in the wheelchair bar?

142
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,987
We're in wheelchairs, so we have
to be in the wheelchair bar, is that it?

143
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:05,488
But you are here.

144
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:07,240
Only 'cause it's ladies' night.

145
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:11,244
In an hour, this place is going to be
wheel to wheel bitches.

146
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:14,289
Frankly, Earl deserves to be
in a coma after what you did to us.

147
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,499
We fried like bacon out there.

148
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:19,127
Which is why I left Earl
outside in the black top.

149
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:26,843
So you had to lie in the sun,
now, he has to lie in the sun.

150
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:28,511
That seems pretty even.

151
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,879
I got leg-humped by a Doberman.

152
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,475
I got shoulder-humped by a Doberman...

153
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,352
to completion.

154
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:15,725
So, can I cross you off the list now?

155
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:30,100
<i>Randy had failed to charm
the pants off Brett and Tiffany.</i>

156
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,617
<i>But an homeless guy
was having much better luck with me.</i>

157
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:35,791
Get away from him!

158
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,041
If you need an extra pants so bad,
go home and get a pair.

159
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,378
And get a haircut while you're at it!
You look like a bum!

160
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:47,048
Man, you look thirsty, Earl.

161
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,844
Let's go inside and see if they got
a nice sponge you can suck on.

162
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:52,302
I was burning up.

163
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:54,889
<i>Fortunately, in my coma mind,
things were comfortable.</i>

164
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,781
Wakey, wakey...

165
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,270
Before the arthritis makes you achey.

166
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,976
Hey, Earl.
Hey, Mrs. Earl.

167
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,490
We're looking at photo albums.
Have a seat.

168
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:17,579
The doctor said I have to be careful,
so I don't seat on my balls again.

169
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,433
Randy, you remember that?

170
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,844
The time you got hit in the head?

171
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,964
Hey, where's the baloney?

172
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,509
E equals MC squared.
<i>E pluribus unum.</i>

173
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:37,879
In a right triangle,

174
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,928
the sum of the squared sides
equal the hypotenuse square.

175
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,136
Hey, where's the baloney?

176
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,509
Remember this one?

177
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:50,243
That was a very special time.

178
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:54,392
Okay, Randy.

179
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:58,092
Show me on the bear
where the bad neighbor touched you.

180
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:02,909
He doesn't have one.

181
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,672
Can I get a refill on this?

182
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:12,759
He really is in a coma.

183
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:15,034
That's horrible, and...

184
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:17,420
funny, all at the same time.

185
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,869
For someone in a wheelchair,
you're not very inspirational.

186
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,979
Well, well, well.

187
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:26,481
Who's your friend?

188
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:29,119
Why do you care?
You broke up with me.

189
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:32,639
I told you, Tiffany.
I don't get close.

190
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,202
People leave.

191
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:36,872
Or, in my case, they run over
your legs with a Ford Bronco,

192
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:38,273
take the kids...

193
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,865
and then, leave.

194
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:45,945
What you looking at,
Risky Business?

195
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:52,074
l bet you just added a pint
to your catheter bag.

196
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:56,828
You know what, Randy?

197
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:58,798
There is something
Earl can do for me.

198
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,890
- To cross you off his list?
- Yeah.

199
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,393
I am dying to get back together
with T.R.

200
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,118
I know he's rough around the edges,
but when he kisses me...

201
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,875
he send shivers half way
down my spine.

202
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:12,944
- Help me make him jealous.
- Earl is in.

203
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:17,283
<i>Tiffany figured the best way
to make T.R. jealous</i>

204
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,550
<i>was to show me off
in front of all his friends.</i>

205
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:22,120
<i>And all his friends were
at killerball.</i>

206
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,292
<i>That's a game where people
who are already hurt,</i>

207
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,019
<i>try to hurt each other much worse.</i>

208
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,959
<i>And sometimes,
they try to score a goal.</i>

209
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,449
<i>Tiffany was working hard</i>

210
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:42,178
<i>to make it look like
I was quite a catch.</i>

211
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:47,604
You are so funny!

212
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:51,104
Earl looks bad, Randy.

213
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:53,068
His skin is peeking,
he's wheezing,

214
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:56,404
and his mustache...
Where's his normal body and bounce?

215
00:12:56,564 --> 00:12:59,303
You don't think it kills me
to see his mustache like that?

216
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:01,142
But crossing things off the list

217
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:03,686
is the only way
he's gonna start to get better again.

218
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:06,164
Besides, he's not that bad. See?

219
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,507
Maybe he got used to my finger.
Give me your keys.

220
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,260
Randy, he doesn't needed
a car key shoved in his ear.

221
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,377
How do you know?
You're not a doctor.

222
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:22,597
He just needs to cross
something off the list again.

223
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:24,516
Tiffany, make out with him,

224
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:26,768
but stop if he starts to choke.

225
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,547
Yes. Please have her stick her tongue
in his zombie's mouth,

226
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:32,344
'cause this situation ain't
quite wrong enough as it is.

227
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,264
<i>Randy had high hopes,</i>

228
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:37,988
<i>but unfortunately,
T.R. was having such a great game,</i>

229
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,447
<i>he didn't notice us at all.</i>

230
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,543
Look at him out there,
showboating.

231
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:56,440
That kind of showboating got you
in that chair, you jerk!

232
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,572
I love you.

233
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,388
<i>As captain of the other team,</i>

234
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,935
<i>Tiffany's brother Brett
wasn't taking things so well.</i>

235
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:05,724
I didn't jump out of an airplane

236
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,601
with what turned out
to be a torn parachute,

237
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:12,026
land spine first on a tractor
miraculously unharmed

238
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:15,685
only to have my sister
fall out of the sky

239
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,730
and snap my 6-7

240
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,864
so I could end up
playing on a team full of wussies!

241
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:25,118
Now, get out there,
and kick some chair, dammit!

242
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,765
Yeah, I forgot to tell you guys...

243
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:36,713
I can sort of walk.

244
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,519
You're down, Mad Ace.
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit.

245
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,480
Over my half dead body.

246
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:03,239
Look, we need another player,
or out of the game.

247
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,187
Your brother helps me to win this,

248
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:07,275
he can cross me off his list.

249
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:08,786
How's he gonna play?

250
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:11,922
He can't hold a cigarette in his mouth
to take a funny picture.

251
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,353
Without a cigarette,

252
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:15,198
he was just a naked guy
lying in the mud.

253
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:17,303
I feel it's only fair to tell you,

254
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:19,866
I've decided if this ends
the way I think it's going to,

255
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,509
I will be testifying against you.
No hard feelings.

256
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:24,741
This has to be what Karma wants.

257
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:28,056
Otherwise, all the decisions I made up
till now would've been terrible.

258
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:32,402
- Well, is he in or out?
- Put him in, Randy.

259
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:35,981
If T.R. loses to my new boyfriend,
it'll drive him insane.

260
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:40,402
I'm sorry guys, but if Earl's gonna die,
he's gonna die like a man,

261
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:42,237
crossing things off his list,

262
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:44,406
while playing a stupid game
he doesn't understand.

263
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:45,977
Let's do this!

264
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:52,853
<i>I was about to do something crazy,
and I wasn't even awake for it.</i>

265
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,101
<i>But in my mind,</i>

266
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,501
<i>I lived rough a whole lifetime
of wacky stuff.</i>

267
00:15:57,277 --> 00:16:00,092
There's Joy and Darnell
before they moved to Florida.

268
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:01,957
Remember how she used to...

269
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,437
burst in and insult us
for no reason?

270
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:07,762
Sure glad that never happens anymore.

271
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,349
Howdy-ho,
you dried-up old bastards!

272
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:18,189
- Hey, old Earl.
- Hey, old Crab Man.

273
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:21,960
Remember when Earl's twin brother
from the city came to visit?

274
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,741
Thanks for letting me stay here,

275
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:29,909
I so need a vaca,

276
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,244
things are not going well
with the Mrs.

277
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:37,721
<i>In real life, it didn't look like
I'd make it to old age.</i>

278
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:38,990
<i>But lucky for me,</i>

279
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,075
<i>Randy had a degree in joysticks
from the University of Pacman.</i>

280
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:50,096
<i>He kept me safe.</i>

281
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:59,352
<i>And in a moment
I wish I remembered,</i>

282
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:02,692
<i>Randy even helped me score
the gain-time goal.</i>

283
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,452
<i>The clock was running down.
The score was tied, but we had the ball.</i>

284
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,038
Come on!
Let's cut them off at the knees!

285
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,025
No offense, Paul.

286
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:18,852
<i>The pressure was on</i>

287
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:20,919
<i>and we needed all the help
from Karma we could get.</i>

288
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:23,546
<i>But Karma works
in mysterious ways.</i>

289
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,511
<i>Suddenly it seemed like Randy's chance</i>

290
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:31,680
<i>to cross Brett and Tiffany off my list</i>

291
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,890
<i>was slipping just out of his reach.</i>

292
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,023
<i>Buk knocking that remote around
did activate</i>

293
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:40,480
<i>the "dancing bubbles" function
on my pimp-chair.</i>

294
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:46,153
Hold on, Earl!

295
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,497
Somebody, get him!

296
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:01,387
<i>Someone was gonna stop T.R.</i>

297
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,913
<i>Il'll have to be me,
with some help from Tiffany.</i>

298
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,407
I love you, Earl!

299
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:08,216
<i>Who finally found the magic words
to get under T.R.'s skin.</i>

300
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,344
I love you
and your fully functioning penis!

301
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:15,621
<i>And that's when T.R. realised</i>

302
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:18,018
<i>that there was something
he cared about more than killerball.</i>

303
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:25,445
<i>I did it, I made him jealous.</i>

304
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,946
<i>And thanks for the ricochet off my face,</i>

305
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:32,240
<i>I also held my childhood neighbor
win the game.</i>

306
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:37,144
He did it!

307
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:39,778
Earl crossed the Hansons off his list.

308
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:41,632
Karma's gonna love this.

309
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,020
<i>Crossing those two people off my list</i>

310
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,463
<i>scored me a few points with Karma,
but it wasn't enough.</i>

311
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,414
<i>Turns out,
Karma was a little like killerball.</i>

312
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:54,554
<i>Sometimes, you just need
one more point to win the game.</i>

313
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,922
<i>Randy had help me
score a point across town</i>

314
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,141
<i>without knowing it.</i>

315
00:18:58,301 --> 00:18:59,559
Hey, Derrick?

316
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:04,439
Since that guy snuck in my car,
I think I'm scared driving alone.

317
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:06,274
You want to carpool?

318
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,847
<i>By putting me in the backseat
of that woman's car,</i>

319
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,238
<i>Randy not only helped Derrick
get to work on time,</i>

320
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,882
<i>it also got him a little closer
to getting a new girlfriend.<i>

321
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,682
<i>Sometimes when you try
to do good things,</i>

322
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,676
<i>you don't see any results at all.</i>

323
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:22,800
<i>That doesn't mean
you should stop doing 'em.</i>

324
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,710
<i>That last boost Karma
pushed me over the edge.</i>

325
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,113
<i>Suddenly, coma world didn't feel
like the right place to be.</i>

326
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,534
<i>It wasn't real.</i>

327
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,473
<i>It was time to get back to my life</i>

328
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:37,813
<i>and Karma came
to give me a lift.</i>

329
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:41,268
<i>And just like that,
I was home.</i>

330
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:49,974
Well, I'll be damned!

331
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:51,653
Oh, my God.

332
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:53,746
Somebody give him some gum.

333
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,490
You have some bangin' Karma breath.

334
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:57,742
Earl, you're back.
Are you back?

335
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,042
I think so.

336
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,920
I was having this crazy dream.

337
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,678
We were all real old, and...

338
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:06,501
we had spent our all lifes together.

339
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,921
That doesn't sound crazy.
That sounds just about perfect.

340
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:13,425
And I was married to Billie.

341
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:15,427
Billy? Who's he?

342
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:18,054
Oh, crap,
I think the coma made him gay.
