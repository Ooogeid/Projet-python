1
00:00:01,844 --> 00:00:03,656
<i>Being in a coma is never fun,</i>

2
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:06,128
<i>but Randy did his best to cheer me up.</i>

3
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:09,716
"Basic nutrient pack."

4
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:11,473
Now, with cobbler.

5
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:15,352
<i>And I didn't have to worry about my list
'cause my friends were doing it for me,</i>

6
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:17,312
<i>hoping Karma would help me get better.</i>

7
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:18,763
<i>Wasn't always easy.</i>

8
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:20,315
<i>Especially for Randy.</i>

9
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:23,682
<i>So, when it was his turn to pick,
he decided to do a list item</i>

10
00:00:23,802 --> 00:00:26,736
<i>at the one place he was sure
he knew how to get to.</i>

11
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:28,111
Hi, Mom.

12
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,190
Me and Joy are here to make up
for the time Earl ruined Dad's vacation,

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,037
so we can cross it off the list
and wake Earl up out of his coma.

14
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:37,400
Earl's in a coma?
Carl, Earl's in a coma!

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,989
I'm getting my purse.

16
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:41,795
- What happened?
- He got hit by a car a month ago.

17
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:44,492
- Come on! He's in a coma.
- A month ago?

18
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:47,711
And you didn't think to mention that
when you were here for lunch last week?

19
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:49,135
I got distracted, okay?

20
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:50,720
How did he got hit by a car?

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,973
He was running in the street,
after his intervention.

22
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,516
Intervention for what?

23
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:56,522
Don't worry.
He was not on drugs.

24
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:58,466
He was just acting crazy after prison.

25
00:00:58,586 --> 00:01:00,172
Earl was in prison?

26
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,433
I'm going to have to revise
my Christmas letter.

27
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,069
NO HEADS AND A DUFFEL BAG

28
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:09,301
Oh, for goodness sake.

29
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:12,742
They've got him hooked up
to so many machines.

30
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:16,913
Why is he wearing
a "Do not resuscitate" bracelet?

31
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:18,303
That was my idea.

32
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:20,762
Figured if they 'suscitate him once
and it didn't work,

33
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:22,334
they shouldn't do it again.

34
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:25,504
Please, don't tell me you're the one
making all the decisions about Earl.

35
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:27,032
Yes, he is.

36
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:30,349
Last week, he demanded
they remove Earl's tonsils.

37
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:32,220
In my defense, I was pretty drunk.

38
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:35,599
You need to take me
to see Earl's doctor right now.

39
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:39,886
Well, if he wakes up while I'm gone,
first thing you should do is

40
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,110
to tell him there's a tube in his wiener
so he doesn't freak.

41
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,151
I'll be in the cafeteria.

42
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,073
So...

43
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:56,122
Randy told me that you got the time

44
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,579
you guys ruined my vacation
on your list.

45
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:01,974
That was one messed up day.

46
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:04,750
<i>Ever since my parents made me
on their honeymoon,</i>

47
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,528
<i>my dad had been scared to death
to go on another vacation.</i>

48
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:10,436
But, Mom finally convinced him
she wasn't fertile anymore.

49
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:11,985
"American Samoa.

50
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:14,576
"Come see why the Japanese wanted it."

51
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:15,928
Sounds nice.

52
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,643
Yeah, I thought house-sitting
would be a wonderful opportunity

53
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:22,020
to show
what responsible adults you become.

54
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:25,429
Or you can break my heart again...
It's up to you.

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,859
I'll miss you both.

56
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,741
Especially if your plane goes done.

57
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,446
I don't know if I'd miss you more,
but I'd miss you longer.

58
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:33,852
You just say
whatever you think, don't you?

59
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:36,576
Come on, Kay, they can't disappoint us
if we don't leave.

60
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,330
<i>As soon as my parents left, me and Randy
decided to hit the liquor cabinet.</i>

61
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,355
It's gone.

62
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,057
It's all gone.

63
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:47,274
This isn't a liquor cabinet anymore.

64
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:49,714
- It's just a cabinet.
- Vacation time.

65
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:52,175
Let's get our drink on.
Ticktock, Booze o'clock.

66
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:53,451
Where are the boys?

67
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:56,205
You were picking them up so they
could play at their grandparents'house.

68
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:57,547
Their other grandparents.

69
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,768
I don't like 'em
spending time in two story houses.

70
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,936
They'll get all snooty and start
thinking about college and vaccins.

71
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,473
<i>We decided to go on a beer run</i>

72
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:08,625
<i>since there was no way Joy was going
to do me in my parents' bed sober.</i>

73
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:10,521
I think Paula makes good points.

74
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,788
Simon had seemed
like he's high all the time.

75
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,098
I've never seen it.

76
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:16,753
But Randy likes
that guy Randy the best,

77
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:18,353
'cause he's got Randy's name.

78
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:21,314
Makes sense.
That's why I buy Joy dishwasher liquid.

79
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,327
It's a good conversation piece.

80
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:34,278
Spare change?

81
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,729
This is what I've learned.

82
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,701
They call it a "six pack"
'cause there's six beers in it.

83
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:50,276
It has nothin' to do
with people's tummies.

84
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:00,526
That's my bag!

85
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,667
Come on!

86
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>When we got home,
we were surprised to find the duffle bag</i>

87
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,575
<i>but even more surprised
by what was in it.</i>

88
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,134
Sweet mother!

89
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:17,677
Look at all that pot!

90
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,255
I was hoping for money.

91
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,979
Or socks, I need socks.

92
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:23,217
If it was money,
I could have bought socks.

93
00:04:23,337 --> 00:04:24,677
So what do we do with it?

94
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,562
We're not going to smoke it.
Smoking weed kills your brain cells.

95
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:30,357
Drinking only screws up your liver.
You got two of those.

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,189
Yeah, I don't understand weed.

97
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,582
When you smoke,
you get the munchies and you get fat.

98
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:36,738
When you drink,
you throw up and you get skinny.

99
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:38,341
That's just physics.

100
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,895
How the hell did all this weed
get at the back of the car?

101
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,329
Probably felt from the sky.
Sometimes surprises fall from there.

102
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,766
Remember that giant blue popsicle
without a stick that landed on my head?

103
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:49,562
It was disgusting.

104
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:52,543
My Aunt Sheila used to get high
as a kite when babysat me.

105
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:55,436
It was fun until she convinced herself
she really was a kite.

106
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:57,968
I'd have to stand outside for hours
holding her by a string.

107
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,592
Do you think your Aunt Sheila would want
to buy a bag full of weed?

108
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:02,138
No, she's way in the crack now.

109
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:06,441
Then we'll have to go buy baggies
and get rid of it a little at a time.

110
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:09,562
But this is a one-time thing.
We'll only sell it to bad people.

111
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:11,398
No women. No children.

112
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:14,377
I think Mom would be
really proud of us right now.

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,212
Joy, make sure to get flavored vodka.

114
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,617
I like it
when my throw up tastes like cherry.

115
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:25,002
Flavored vodka is for sissies
and pregnant women.

116
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,122
You'll get what you'll get.

117
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,757
The thing is such a piece of junk.

118
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:32,696
I thought it was abandoned.

119
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,255
Wait a minute.

120
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,382
So, with the boozes
and the plastic bags

121
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:41,469
and the chips,
that will be $182.61.

122
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:44,764
Oh, my...

123
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,310
I seem to have brought the wrong purse.
All I have is...

124
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,438
Hello!

125
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,472
Can't take a clump of pot
for grocers anymore.

126
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:57,593
Need to get a Democrat back in office.

127
00:05:58,365 --> 00:05:59,529
Get in the back!

128
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,650
You don't know me!
You don't tell me what...

129
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:06,286
Scoot over, dumb-dumb.

130
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,666
<i>The thing we learned about finding
a duffle bag full of marijuana is that</i>

131
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,845
<i>the original owners
usually aren't too worried</i>

132
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,336
<i>about carrying
unregistered handguns.</i>

133
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:16,004
Mom?

134
00:06:16,164 --> 00:06:17,964
Dad?
What are you doing here?

135
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:20,633
Our flight got delayed five hours.

136
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:24,344
Which apparently was enough time for you
to turn my house into a drug den.

137
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:27,474
Well, this trust exercise
went horribly wrong.

138
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,450
I can't believe
you brought dope in the house.

139
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,605
And, you put it
on your dead grandmother's coffee table.

140
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:35,065
That stuff is addictive

141
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:37,651
and it fosters antisocial behavior.

142
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,738
I'll be in the bedroom.
Leave me alone.

143
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:44,899
But, Dad, where's the weed?

144
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,476
Your father destroyed it.

145
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:47,364
What?

146
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:50,345
You destroyed my weed?

147
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:52,490
He destroyed my weed.

148
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,857
Oh, God, I don't want to die in shorts.

149
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:57,969
Just take it easy.
We can... pay you back.

150
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,835
I don't need money.
This was gonna be my first big delivery.

151
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,246
I was trying to prove
I could be middle-management material.

152
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:05,159
I'm gonna have to kill you,
which could...

153
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,758
skyrocket me to upper-management,

154
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:09,062
and I'm not ready
for that kind of responsibility.

155
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:10,976
Relax.

156
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:14,823
I didn't really destroy the weed.

157
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,066
I just told my wife
I burned it to calm her down.

158
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:19,567
I actually...

159
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,027
threw it in a well.

160
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:24,114
So, if you just come with me...

161
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:27,575
Yeah, right, so you can push me down
the well or something? I don't think so.

162
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,694
How about this:

163
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:34,082
keep some of us here as insurance
and me and my dad will go get the weed.

164
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:35,569
- And me.
- And Randy.

165
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,129
- And me.
- And Joy.

166
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,771
And we'll get my mother too.

167
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,854
No. This is how we're going to work it.

168
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:43,133
OK, you guys go.
The women stay here.

169
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,301
Shotgun.

170
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:50,668
<i>While we went to get the weed,
the pot dealer held Mom and Joy hostage.</i>

171
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:52,678
There's still a well at the park?

172
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:55,130
I thought the city had it cemented over
when Randy fell in

173
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,368
trying to hug
his twin brother at the bottom.

174
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:00,079
That was awesome.
I got my picture in the paper.

175
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,298
Except that stupid fireman's hat
blocked my face. I hate that guy.

176
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:06,031
The pot is not in the well.
Your mother was telling the truth.

177
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,605
I destroyed it.

178
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:17,667
Stay away, Joe! Toxic!

179
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:18,985
Stand back!

180
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,632
I can't believe you destroyed it!
What were you thinking?

181
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:26,314
What was I thinking?
You brought drugs into my house!

182
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:29,491
I am the weekend captain of our
neighborhood watch, for crying out loud!

183
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:31,138
The bag ended up in my car.

184
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:33,402
What was I supposed to do,
leave it in the driveway?

185
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:35,578
Kids could have got into it. Or birds.

186
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,805
You want a bunch of high birds
flying around?

187
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,205
You know what?
I don't care what you do.

188
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:41,808
I give up on you.

189
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:43,818
Randy, you I still have hope for.

190
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:46,071
You always said
you loved us both equal.

191
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:48,156
That's just something parents say.

192
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:53,480
People don't hug enough.

193
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:55,664
Look what you did.

194
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,537
<i>There was only one person I knew</i>

195
00:08:57,657 --> 00:09:00,419
<i>who I thought might be able
to help me undo what I did.</i>

196
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:02,754
We need something.

197
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:05,130
- You need weed.
- How'd you know?

198
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,448
That's what's going on

199
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:08,760
when white people walk up to me
and start whispering.

200
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:10,679
White people are nuts.

201
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,556
We need enough
to fill a duffle bag about yea big.

202
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:15,142
And make it fast.

203
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,223
- Aren't you neighborhood watching?
- I'm not buying for me.

204
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,665
I don't smoke drugs.

205
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:22,766
<i>Drugs were a touchy topic with my dad,</i>

206
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:26,228
<i>especially after he had
a bad experience with them at Woodstock.</i>

207
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,113
- Hey, off the blanket!
- Easy, man.

208
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:33,996
I've got a problem...
I've got a problem with my hair!

209
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,455
- I'm having trouble understanding it.
- What are you talking about?

210
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:40,333
A nice naked hippie couple
gave me some brownies.

211
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,378
Kay, I told you
not to take food from hippies.

212
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:45,474
Why can't we feel out here?

213
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:47,465
I need some scissors!

214
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,912
I need to cut off my dead skull carpet!

215
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:52,475
Kay, Sha Na Na is about to go on!

216
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,025
Sorry about my dad.
He's a little on edge.

217
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:59,185
He might miss his vacation and
a drug dealer is holding my mom hostage.

218
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:02,517
Say no more. We've all been there.
What kind are you looking for?

219
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:05,233
I don't know a brand name.
I burned it all in the trash can.

220
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:11,751
<i>Mendocino Greeno.

221
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,931
Reminds me of a trip to Six Flags
I'm sure I've enjoyed

222
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,453
but I have no memory of.

223
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:17,871
You can help us?

224
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:20,902
You'll need to go see a guy
named Circus at the Palm Motel.

225
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:22,042
Room 231.

226
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:24,317
Probably run you about...

227
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:25,600
2,000 crabs.

228
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,140
That's dollars.
I'm trying to get it to catch on,

229
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,635
but I can tell from your faces
you're not going to be early adopters.

230
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:34,282
<i>While we were off
trying to buy a duffle bag of weed,</i>

231
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:37,984
<i>Joy was trying to keep her mouth shut.</i>
<i>Which, of course, was impossible.</i>

232
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,267
Oh, snap!

233
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:40,685
Snap what?

234
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:42,314
I know you!

235
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:45,025
You're that boy from school
who had those panic attacks.

236
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,414
You'd have to lay on the floor
and suck your fingers.

237
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,534
We used to call you Forefinger Sucker.

238
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,930
I wasn't the only one in high school
with a nickname that ended in "sucker".

239
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,757
But, unlike you, my nickname
just made me more popular,

240
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:57,953
Forefinger Sucker.

241
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,833
Say it again.

242
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:05,774
Forefinger Sucker.

243
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,609
No, if I take the tape off,

244
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,598
you're just going to call me
Forefinger Sucker again.

245
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,491
Forefinger Sucker!

246
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,944
<i>All the stress was really getting
to Dwayne,</i>

247
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,083
<i>so he snuck off
to my parents' bathroom</i>

248
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:34,915
<i>to suck on his fingers and...</i>

249
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:36,655
<i>something even worse.</i>

250
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,353
<i>My parents had smoke alarms,</i>

251
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:57,637
<i>but unlucky for my mom,
they weren't mounted on her face.</i>

252
00:11:57,797 --> 00:12:00,979
<i>And while Mom was checking out,
Dad was dropping in.</i>

253
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:03,768
Is Kay all right?

254
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:06,093
She's fine. You are my hero.
Thank God you came,

255
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:09,062
'cause my legs are starting to cramp
and my tongue is...

256
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:22,566
- Come on. Let's go.
- Is he after you?

257
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:24,431
No.
Our flight leaves in two hours.

258
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:27,318
But we still got to stop by the bank
and cash these savings bonds.

259
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,419
I'm sorry you have
to cash in your bonds.

260
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:30,752
They're not mine.

261
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:32,839
Your relatives gave them to you
for college.

262
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,883
So when Harvard finally comes calling,

263
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,649
you're screwed.

264
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:40,666
Hold on, you always said

265
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,777
these were copies
of my birth certificate.

266
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:44,462
Because I knew you'd steal them.

267
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:46,841
But they're my money.
You've been keeping it.

268
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:48,104
Who's the criminal?

269
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:51,232
I've been saving them until I thought
you were responsible enough.

270
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:53,211
Obviously that's failed,

271
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:55,827
because we're using them
to buy a duffle bag of marijuana.

272
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:56,947
Now let's go.

273
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:01,201
- Do I have any savings bonds?
- You have a couple.

274
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:04,576
Most of the relatives took 'em back
when mom brought you home,

275
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:07,040
and you still weren't responding
to light or sound.

276
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,769
<i>After a quick stop at the bank,</i>

277
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,843
<i>we went to buy drugs
in the very motel room</i>

278
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:14,746
<i>me and Randy
will eventually call "home".</i>

279
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,384
- We're here to buy pot.
- You're not supposed to say it.

280
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:19,970
No, it's okay.
Your honesty is refreshing.

281
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:22,419
Follow me.
I'll get Circus.

282
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:23,265
Dibs.

283
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,603
Oh, look. Our next stop

284
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:30,361
on our tour of lowlifes.

285
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:32,901
Randy, you keep following
your idiot brother

286
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,567
you're going to end up living together
in a dump like this.

287
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,157
How could we both live here?

288
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:40,068
- There's only one bed, we're two guys.
- Give us some credit.

289
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:41,908
We're not going to end up in a motel.

290
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:44,035
Don't talk to me.
I've already given up on you.

291
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,675
What do you want?
I'm trying to shave the kangaroo.

292
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:50,250
Two weedheads and a narc
are here to see you.

293
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:53,250
Lick that shaving cream off,

294
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,849
I'm gonna put pepper
in your pouch again.

295
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,889
What's up people that
are not wearing their Speedos?

296
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:08,184
Darnell sent us.
We need to make a purchase.

297
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:10,860
Ah, certainly.
Now I recognize you two.

298
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,439
You're that guy

299
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,400
with that tight little blond
with the variety pack kids.

300
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:19,738
I'm just, like, wondering about...
this old dude.

301
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:21,364
Don't call me "Dude."

302
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,613
Easy Lebowski.
I just need to do a security check,

303
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,079
to make sure, like,
you're not wearing a wire.

304
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:40,426
Saint Christopher,
Holy patron of travelers,

305
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,386
protect me and lead me safely
to my destination.

306
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,124
I think he likes you.

307
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,747
What is Cairo? What is Paris?
What is Spain? What is Europe?

308
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,095
The correct response is
"What are pies?"

309
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:52,891
I knew that!

310
00:14:53,011 --> 00:14:54,981
Look what Mr. Scissors did.

311
00:14:56,643 --> 00:14:58,318
What the hell are you doing, lady?

312
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:00,612
I'm getting rid of my hair.
It's dead.

313
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:01,894
It's all dead.

314
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,532
It just sits there, doing nothing.

315
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,026
It's loitering.

316
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,002
I'm so hungry,
I could kill a child.

317
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:11,706
Okay, you're freaking me out, Ma'am.

318
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:13,370
Way to go, Forefinger Sucker.

319
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,384
She got a contact high
from the doobie smoking.

320
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:16,670
Now she's tripping.

321
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:22,940
What the hell am I supposed to do?

322
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,221
He's clean.

323
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:30,058
That was long and uncomfortable.

324
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,477
Have a seat, gentleman.

325
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:37,588
Help yourself to some cashews.

326
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:39,901
What are you here to purchase?

327
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:43,780
We'd like a duffel-bag's worth
of <i>Mendecino Greeno</i>, please.

328
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:45,865
Excellent choice.

329
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:53,067
That's our flight taking off.
Our vacation's officially ruined.

330
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:56,394
And I learned how to say
"thank you" in Samoan for nothing.

331
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:58,058
<i>Fa'afetai</i>, Earl.

332
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,463
<i>Fa'afetai</i> very much.

333
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,799
I think you're gonna like this crop.

334
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:05,334
It goes great with marshmallows

335
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:09,055
or those little crackers
that are shaped like fishes.

336
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:12,809
So, have a try before you buy, huh?
Just a little taste.

337
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,895
You know, Mr. Circus,
as generous an offer as it is,

338
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,894
we're gonna pass on the taste.

339
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:20,734
Whoa, Paps.

340
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:24,213
You might not be wearing a wire,
but that right there,

341
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,697
that was a cop move.

342
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:27,381
He... he's not a cop.

343
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,575
Look, he tucks his shirt
into his underwear.

344
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:32,788
What kind of cop
would do that?

345
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,123
Drop your shorts, Dad.
Show him the tuck.

346
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,338
So you're gonna take a hit of this
or Clayton's gun,

347
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,800
and Clayton's not afraid
to shoot someone, isn't it?

348
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:51,426
Really, Clayton?

349
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:54,893
You could have just said yes.
I was just trying to scare to him.

350
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,453
Hit the bong, dude.

351
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:04,277
<i>Me and my dad weren't close,
but I knew a few things about him.</i>

352
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:05,528
<i>He hated violence,</i>

353
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,806
<i>people with unclear sexuality,</i>

354
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:10,225
<i>exotic animals kept
in small spaces,</i>

355
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:12,006
<i>and most of all, drugs.</i>

356
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:15,038
<i>And now, I drag
right in the middle of it.</i>

357
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,999
Come on, Scoutmaster,
fire it up.

358
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:22,825
Alright, then.

359
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:25,190
I guess I've got no choice.

360
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,510
<i>Bravo!</i>

361
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,544
I did not see that coming
from the old guy.

362
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:43,316
Although, I do believe
you owe me a new Clayton.

363
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,678
I don't owe you a turd
on Christmas.

364
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,068
People been telling me what to do
all day, and I've been listening.

365
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:52,490
Doing things I didn't want to do
for people I don't want to do 'em for.

366
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,016
And if I got to break the law
to save my wife,

367
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:56,793
I'm doing it on my own terms,

368
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:58,832
not some freak-show
drug dealers.

369
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:04,588
Here's your $2,000.

370
00:18:06,578 --> 00:18:08,487
I'd like my duffle bag of dope.

371
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:12,189
<i>It wasn't the day my parents expected</i>
<i>when they woke up that morning.</i>

372
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:15,265
<i>My dad had stood up
to a drug dealer, and my mom...</i>

373
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,540
<i>well, she was as high as a kite.</i>

374
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:20,729
<i>Mom and Dad never talked with us
about what happened that day.</i>

375
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:22,439
<i>They just tried to forget it.</i>

376
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:25,358
<i>Which was a lot easier to do
once mom's hair grew back.</i>

377
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,909
I can see why you put
all that on your list.

378
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:36,750
You did ruin my trip.

379
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,122
But what you don't know...

380
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,389
is what happened afterwards.

381
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:44,845
<i>Turns out,</i>

382
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:48,080
<i>I couldn't stop thinking
about what happened in that motel.</i>

383
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,581
<i>It was the most alive
I've ever felt.</i>

384
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,452
<i>Over the next few days,
whatever I did,</i>

385
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:56,913
<i>no matter how boring it was,
it seemed more exciting.</i>

386
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,111
<i>My normal life wasn't
so normal anymore.</i>

387
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,319
<i>I felt like a new man.</i>

388
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,559
<i>And when the rush started
to wear off,</i>

389
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,122
<i>I went back for more.</i>

390
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:24,417
I'll take another two grand worth
of that <i>Mendocino Greeno</i>.

391
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,117
Camden Police!
This is a bust!

392
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,195
You know why I like you?

393
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:38,306
'Cause you never do the thing
that I think you're gonna do.

394
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:45,031
Maybe I never got
to American Samoa,

395
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:48,023
but you gave me
some more important:

396
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:50,819
a chance to prove that
when push came to shove,

397
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,612
I could protect my family.

398
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,688
When my wife and my sons
were in danger,

399
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:58,569
I wasn't just
some middle-aged frame store owner.

400
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,941
I was a hero.

401
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,625
It was the best feeling I've ever had.

402
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:10,086
<i>Fa'afetai</i>, Earl.

403
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:12,575
<i>Fa'afetai</i>.

404
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,504
Oh, and one more thing.

405
00:20:20,248 --> 00:20:22,442
I never gave up on you, son...

406
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:26,108
and I never will.
