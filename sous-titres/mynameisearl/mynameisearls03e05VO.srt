1
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:07,282
<i>I guess my favorite time
in prison is nighttime.</i>

2
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:08,469
<i>Lights out!</i>

3
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:10,767
<i>When it's dark and peaceful,</i>

4
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:13,598
<i>you can almost feel like you're
not stuck behind bars anymore.</i>

5
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:17,301
<i>Outside lights on!</i>

6
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,517
<i>Those are the best
seven seconds of my day.</i>

7
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:25,885
<i>Prisoners like to complain, of course,</i>

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,407
<i>but we're not the only ones
who can feel trapped.</i>

9
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:32,230
<i>Sometimes Darnell felt trapped
in a job that conflicted</i>

10
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:34,180
<i>with his kind and gentle nature.</i>

11
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:43,037
<i>Catalina sometimes felt trapped
just by being too pretty.</i>

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,175
Is the Latina girl
going to be walking to her car soon?

13
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:49,538
'Cause they're really strict
about curfew at the halfway house.

14
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:55,363
<i>Randy sometimes felt trapped
in his day-to-day life.</i>

15
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,823
I wanted the baby one on the bottom.

16
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:03,394
<i>And sometimes Joy felt trapped just
taking care of her overactive kids.</i>

17
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:04,899
You two settle down.

18
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:09,238
And get Mama's thong off your head.
You had pinkeye last week.

19
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,977
<i>But I for one
was about to get an escape.</i>

"Prison Creative Writing. "

21
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:20,156
Creative writing is
a wonderful way to escape from prison,

22
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,442
in your imagination.

23
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:25,327
It's a chance to free your mind,

24
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:27,733
even if you're stuck behind walls

25
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:31,277
and a five-point limb
and torso restraint.

26
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:37,277
Anyway, I want you, men, to create
a story where you're the main character,

27
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:40,851
and you can do absolutely anything.

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,147
<i>This tiny armored lady was actually
getting me excited about writing,</i>

29
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,881
<i>saying how the pen
is mightier than the sword.</i>

30
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:50,681
<i>Then someone used their pen as sword.</i>

31
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:52,261
Excuse me, Misses Teacher?

32
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:55,533
I think Enrico might need
a pass to the nurse's office.

33
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:58,173
3-11.

36
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,922
<i>Getting started on my creative writing
project was harder than I expected.</i>

37
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,661
<i>I always thought
I had a good imagination, but,</i>

38
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:13,134
<i>turns out, that was just my imagination.</i>

39
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,862
- How do you spell "hematoma"?
- I don't know, Sonny.

40
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,684
If you're going to make up words,
just make up how to spell them.

41
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,181
No, it's a real word.

42
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,645
See, I'm writing a story about
me beating up a gymnast.

43
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:24,856
I hate those guys.

44
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:27,631
I wish I had an idea.

45
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,968
I'm trying to write
but just drawing a blank.

46
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,076
You're being too uptight, man.

47
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,778
You've got to just close
your eyes and look inside your brain.

48
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:36,694
You know,
like when you're driving on meth.

49
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,955
<i>I'd never driven on meth before, but</i>

50
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:42,220
<i>I've ridden shotgun plenty of times
while someone else did</i>

51
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:44,065
<i>and closing your eyes did help.</i>

52
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:45,489
<i>So I gave it a shot.</i>

53
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,411
So this is my imagination.

54
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:03,436
Cool.

55
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:08,093
My story can be about me doing anything.

56
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:09,816
Anything I can imagine.

57
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:19,522
You could put me in your story.
It worked for Sonny.

58
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:21,061
Come on, hit me.

59
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,169
- Break my nose.
- That's Sonny's thing.

60
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,460
Sweet of you, though.

61
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,902
You can go now.

62
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,257
I can't leave unless
you stop thinking about me.

63
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:36,707
Right.

64
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:44,190
You're thinking about me.

65
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:45,522
Shut up!

66
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,828
<i>And that right there took me a little
less than four and one half hours.</i>

67
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,375
Writing sounds cool.

68
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:56,246
You could make a world
where anything could happen.

69
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,824
Like a guy all alone in a boat
hunting a big, white whale.

70
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,721
Randy, nobody's gonna want to read that.

71
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:06,075
That's okay. I got lots of ideas.

72
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,333
<i>Randy's been lost a lot,
but never lost in thought.</i>

73
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,567
<i>Suddenly, he was in a world of his own.</i>

74
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:13,134
1,059,

75
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:14,798
1,060.

76
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,328
What's next on my crime-fighter
exercise schedule, H.R.?

77
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:24,733
Golly, Randy, says here you do
ten zillion jumping jacks.

78
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:27,245
Must be a light day.

79
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,855
<i>Afternoon, Randy, bad news.</i>

80
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,606
Some sort of trouble, Commissioner?

81
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,528
<i>Earl's in trouble at the Crab Shack.</i>

82
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,144
At the Crab Shack? Sounds like
Earl's in trouble, we're on it.

83
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:39,899
Now trouble's in trouble.

84
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,533
We'll need to get our driver.

85
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,733
Hey, Richard, we're moving out.

86
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,533
Step on it, Richard.

87
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:03,442
Sumo guy with a bazooka.
That's too easy.

88
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:04,842
It must be a trap.

89
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,084
Look out, team. Puppet sniper, 10:00.

90
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,972
I'll use my X-ray vision
to check on Earl.

91
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,650
Stop your shaking in fear, Earl.
Your brother will save us soon.

92
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,037
He's strong and fearless
and bad to the bone.

93
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,619
He'll never get in.

94
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:30,097
These walls are rock solid metal.

95
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,044
The situation is hopeless.

96
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:35,961
No one can save us now.

97
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:40,195
Since we're going to die,

98
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,014
I should tell you
this is actually Randy's mustache.

99
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,176
He lets me wear it.

100
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:48,052
Look!

101
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,440
How did you get in here?

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,629
Dr. Shrinker shrunk us and
we crawled under the door.

103
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:56,060
Unshrink.

104
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:57,467
<i>Unshrinking.</i>

105
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:03,450
We're here for two things:
to kick some ass and drink some beers.

106
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,615
Get him, you fools.

107
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,021
Did you see that one?

108
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,189
Eat my tail, ninjas.

109
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,066
Get back in there, you loser.

110
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,234
Fight!

111
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:39,415
Booyah, Randy.

112
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:43,487
Game over.

113
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:47,498
Go ahead, finish me off.

114
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:49,201
I'd never hurt a lady.

115
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,153
Lucky for me, you're no lady.

116
00:06:57,874 --> 00:06:59,166
You're the best, Randy.

117
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:01,526
I know.

118
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:03,357
You ruined everything, Randy.

119
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:04,594
I don't ruin things.

120
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:06,458
I make them rock!

121
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:12,547
Thanks, bro.

122
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:14,187
You've done it again.

123
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:16,365
Can I have some money
for the claw machine?

124
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:25,888
You wrote all this in one night?

125
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:29,988
I even drew a poster in case
Hollywood wants to make it into a movie.

126
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:34,713
Well, the doctor always said
you were borderline artistic.

127
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,918
I think I'm all the way artistic now.

128
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm gonna go hang it in the break room.

129
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:43,389
<i>Considering Randy only uses
a 17 letter alphabet,</i>

130
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,221
<i>I was surprised he could write
a story better than me.</i>

131
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,018
<i>So I decided I'd try again.</i>

132
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:52,555
Something interesting.

133
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,646
Think of something interesting.

134
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,974
Just so you know,
I've been all over this place,

135
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:58,840
and there's nothing else here but me.

136
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:01,853
Go away, nobody's interested
in a story about a gymnast.

137
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:05,137
Apparently you've never seen profiles
in <i>Courage: The Kerri Strug Story.</i>

138
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:06,314
No, I haven't.

139
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:08,633
Then how'd you make me say it?

140
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:12,301
Okay, fine, I saw it, it made me cry.
Are you happy now, you son of a bitch?

141
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,253
Damn.

142
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:24,050
<i>It was five days and I still couldn't
think of anything to write.</i>

143
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,946
<i>Seemed like everybody
had an imagination except me.</i>

144
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:35,117
Boys, clean up this mess! It looks
like a toy store took a dump in here.

145
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,459
I know what will cheer you up.

146
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:39,522
Writing a story. You should do it.

147
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:43,665
Here's a story: "Once upon a time,
Randy, shut up. The end. "

148
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,693
Had a slow start,
but I liked the middle.

149
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,199
Y'all didn't do your homework yet?

150
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,991
I want homework done, TV off,
and y'all in bed by midnight.

151
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:58,016
I'm not raising any Nathanville trash.

152
00:08:58,328 --> 00:08:59,958
- I hate homework.
- I hate homework.

153
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,472
- It's stupid.
- I don't like it.

154
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,738
<i>Joy's kids hated everything
from homework to baths.</i>

155
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:09,356
<i>So Joy decided to go to the only place
where kids couldn't complain...</i>

156
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:10,704
<i>her imagination.</i>

157
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:17,254
<i>"Once upon a long, long time ago,
pretty far away,</i>

158
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,566
<i>There were two little brats who I loved,
but I still wanted to wring their necks.</i>

159
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:26,657
<i>And a mom with the class of Princess
Diana and the body of a porn star.</i>

160
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,200
You're mean, you make us do
homework which is yucky.

161
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:32,997
Don't you talk in unison to me.
You think I'm mean?

162
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:35,280
Mean is not being able
to drink daiquiris for 9 months

163
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:37,368
and still having your kids
come out lazy-brained.

164
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,862
Now let me show you something
about homework. Let's go.

165
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:44,665
Once there was a little boy
like you two who never ever studied.

166
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:47,387
I hate crows.

167
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,754
And that boy who didn't do his homework,
grew up to be a giant dummy.

168
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,263
Hey, giant dummy.

169
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:56,962
If a train leaves a station at 60 miles
an hour and you're a quarter mile away,

170
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,475
how long do you have to get
your hairy ass off the track?

171
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,702
Crud, man, that's a toughie.

172
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:06,328
60 divided by a quarter...
a quarter's 25 cents...

173
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,463
"I" before "E" equals...
an hour and a half.

174
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:13,559
And I've got 80 minutes to kill.

175
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,865
Well, he got the kill part right.

176
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,483
Anyway, that's why
I make you do your homework.

177
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:25,084
So quit your bitchin'.

178
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,045
Yeah, quit your bitchin'.

179
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:29,001
Shut up, I got this.

180
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,470
Let's go. Y'all hate bath time?

181
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:34,121
Once there was a lazy slob
who wouldn't take a bath.

182
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,348
He got so nasty and sweaty
that moss grew on him.

183
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:41,669
Then the moss got sticky,
and all his snack crumbs stuck to it.

184
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:43,931
Then mice came,
and the nasty slob said...

185
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:45,284
Shoo, mice.

186
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:49,139
But the mice couldn't shoo because
they were too stuck to the damn slob.

187
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:53,071
Then all the mess of the slob's
filthy house stuck to the slob.

188
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,406
I hate myself!

189
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:59,156
Then cars and trees
and buildings stuck to the slob.

190
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:02,580
And then sure as poo on your shoe,
everything stuck to the slob.

191
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:06,036
Mountains stuck to him,
Canada stuck to him.

192
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,494
And the slob-clump got so heavy
that he fell clear off the Earth,

193
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,804
and fell all the way through space
until he landed on God's desk

194
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,973
where God squished him
with his coffee mug.

195
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,346
God loves everybody,
but I mean, come on.

196
00:11:18,457 --> 00:11:20,699
Looking good, there, Joy.

197
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,995
Just using what You gave me, G.

198
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,814
"And they went back to their trailer
and lived happily ever after. "

199
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:29,524
Okay, you two,

200
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,488
clean up and go to bed, and remember,

201
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:34,029
if you don't listen to what I say,
God will kill you.

202
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:42,016
While I disagree with your view
of a conventional anthropomorphic God,

203
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:45,248
I respect you using that myth
to discipline them rascally boys.

204
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:47,343
I am a creative being, Darnell.

205
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,987
Think about all that stuff
I yell at the movie screen,

206
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,963
all those great Mad Libs I've done.

207
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,551
The purple
Christina Aguilera flew into...

208
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,761
The horny Carol Burnett.

209
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:02,272
That was a fun anniversary.

210
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,653
<i>Apparently, all my friends
were more creative than me,</i>

211
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:12,859
<i>cause even Darnell was able to work out
some issues by putting pen to paper.</i>

212
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:19,886
<i>My sweet animal brother</i>

213
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,594
<i>Please forgive my sin</i>

214
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:29,768
<i>Food source with a mother</i>

215
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:33,271
<i>Where do I begin?</i>

216
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:41,596
<i>To explain how my heart toils
justifying that you boil?</i>

217
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,143
<i>Leftovers I wrap in foil
America burns too much oil</i>

218
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:48,811
Got to stay focused.

219
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,368
<i>When I make my dirty dollar</i>

220
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,159
<i>I have heard the sound</i>

221
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:58,051
Wait for it. It's heavy.

222
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,503
<i>Of a crab who hiss and hollers</i>

223
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,706
<i>As he's drowning down</i>

224
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:14,023
<i>That crab fritter you see frying
was once a critter I sent dying</i>

225
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:16,564
<i>I wanna be a quitter,
and I'm sure trying</i>

226
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:19,954
<i>Cause I'm a cook who can't stop crying!</i>

227
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,388
<i>I'm not saying what to eat</i>

228
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:25,943
<i>Have a shish kebab or piggy feet</i>

229
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:28,351
<i>But honor he who feels the heat</i>

230
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:30,663
<i>Please respect the meat</i>

231
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,189
<i>I wanna say thank you,
thank you from the nation</i>

232
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,608
<i>To the people with claws, crustaceans</i>

233
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:40,530
<i>And to the other animals whose location
will end up in my draws, mastication</i>

234
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,988
<i>It's not selfish, it is quite valid</i>

235
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:46,531
<i>to hope that shellfish
get their own mallets</i>

236
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,785
<i>And you might well wish
you ordered salad</i>

237
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,464
<i>When a crab whups your ass,
Darnell kick your ballad</i>

238
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,186
<i>It's no crime to sell a ton
of murdered exoskeletons</i>

239
00:13:56,312 --> 00:14:02,695
<i>No one cried when he got fried
because he walks from side to side</i>

240
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,584
<i>Baby, I tried to stay away from you</i>

241
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,982
<i>You know, tried seeing other foods</i>

242
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:15,940
<i>Broccoli, tofu,
I even dipped it in butter</i>

243
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:19,902
<i>But it's not you</i>

244
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:22,498
<i>I'm not saying what to eat</i>

245
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:24,657
<i>Life is short and life is sweet</i>

246
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:27,035
<i>And meat is life so I repeat</i>

247
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:29,620
<i>Please respect the meat</i>

248
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:32,040
<i>Digest slowly</i>

249
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,271
<i>Please respect the meat</i>

250
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:36,557
<i>Even in Crete</i>

251
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,442
<i>Please respect the meat</i>

252
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,666
Darnell, these lyrics are
so beautiful and moving.

253
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:59,275
So that's what
Joey looks like on the inside.

254
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:01,119
You should probably stop naming them.

255
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:04,781
That's what we did with the children in
my village after the military took over.

256
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:08,919
Damn, you've got some crazy stories.
You ever think about writing them down?

257
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:10,703
I wish I could write...

258
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:13,873
but with my two jobs,
when will I find the time?

259
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,586
Just want to take her to dinner.

260
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,863
<i>Turns out, she found time to take a stab
at writing that very night.</i>

261
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:39,929
<i>Catalina, Woman of a Thousand Tears.</i>

262
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:48,990
Catalina, why are you crying?

263
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:52,991
Yes, when tomorrow you marry
the richest man in all of Latin America?

264
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:56,771
It is a tear of relief, Randito,
because tonight is the last time

265
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,766
I will be forced into dancing
by my brother's kidnappers.

266
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:01,898
I will finally have enough money...

267
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,840
to pay for his freedom.

268
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,271
<i>Hola</i>, Churro Man.

269
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:07,718
<i>Hola</i>, Earlonzo.

270
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,972
Catalina, these churros are
in honor of your wedding.

271
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,622
Now I have tears of gratitude, Darnando.

272
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:20,364
I will eat them tomorrow after I marry
Javier and lose my virginity to him,

273
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,595
which will happen tomorrow, because
that is when he will arrive into town.

274
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,570
<i>Ay!</i> There he is.

275
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:30,366
He can't see me in this outfit.

276
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:33,198
If he knows I dance in front
of other men, it'll break his heart,

277
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:35,105
and he'll call off the wedding.

278
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,727
Now I cry tears for fears.

279
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,180
Quick. You can use the back door.

280
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,162
Your secret is safe. <i>Andale.</i>

281
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,034
It is not safe with me.

282
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:51,897
She will suffer
for being prettier than I.

283
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:58,269
Don't worry, my brother.

284
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:01,022
After this last dance, you will be free.

285
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:42,230
I wanted to tell you the truth.

286
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:44,148
The truth is...

287
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,984
you're a cheap tramp.

288
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,130
But there is a reason for my actions.

289
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,450
I dance to pay the ransom
for my kidnapped brother.

290
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:07,690
They cut off both his big toes.

291
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:11,175
He can never wear
flip-flop sandals again.

292
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,380
Why did you not tell me?

293
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:16,430
I'm very wealthy
from my flip-flop factory.

294
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:18,242
Because of the irony.

295
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,167
I am not interested in your money.

296
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:23,396
I am only interested...

297
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:25,608
in your heart.

298
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:31,162
I guess dancing is not that bad.

299
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:33,614
At least you were not a maid in a hotel.

300
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,129
<i>Numero uno</i> in our hearts,
<i>numero uno</i> in your stomach.

301
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:52,382
For the first time in my life,

302
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:54,405
I cry tears...

303
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:56,646
of happiness.

304
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:01,788
<i>Catalina, Woman of a Thousand Tears.</i>

305
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,379
<i>Even Catalina,</i>

306
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:07,523
<i>who couldn't think of a more creative
stripper name than Catalina,</i>

307
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,044
<i>was more creative than me.</i>

308
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:12,888
<i>So all night I banged my head thinking
of a story about me that wouldn't suck.</i>

309
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:16,802
<i>I even used other people's stuff,
but nothing I came up with felt right.</i>

310
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:20,480
- How many?
- Golly, Earl, you're still at zero.

311
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:28,200
You can do this.
Just think of some sort of...

312
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:34,553
<i>The next day, I still had
nothing exciting to read out loud,</i>

313
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:38,220
<i>so I gave up trying to imagine
something interesting or cool.</i>

314
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,194
<i>I just wrote down the only things
I could actually picture in my head.</i>

315
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:51,968
<i>Nothing big, just regular stuff.</i>

316
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,919
<i>But it was stuff that made me happy.</i>

317
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,455
<i>And suddenly, the words were flowing.
It was great.</i>

318
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:14,046
<i>Everybody can feel trapped
sometimes in their everyday lives.</i>

319
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:16,499
<i>But when you lose your everyday life,</i>

320
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:19,055
<i>well, that can sometimes
become your best fantasy.</i>

321
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,936
"And that's what I would do
if I could do anything in the world. "

322
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,365
<i>I didn't think
it was gonna be that great,</i>

323
00:20:30,468 --> 00:20:32,031
<i>but people seemed to like it.</i>

324
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,360
Tell again the part
about how the wings tasted.

325
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,269
Sure.

326
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:39,292
"The wings were not hot, but spicy.

327
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,830
And the celery was warm
and bendy like I like it. "

328
