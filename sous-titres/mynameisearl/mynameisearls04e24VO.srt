1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,210
GOSPEL

2
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,965
<i>Most people only go to church
on Christmas and Easter.</i>

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,300
<i>We're all usually
too hung over to go.</i>

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,888
<i>But we always try to make it
when they have cheap food and games.</i>

5
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:15,014
Hey, dum-dums,

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,332
I'm hungered.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,559
Me and Randy were eating that.

8
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,479
You'll have to excuse Joy.
She hasn't been winning any prizes.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,482
The only booth she's doing well at
is the wine tasting one.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,543
How are you supposed to win anything
when the church has Jesus on their side?

11
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:31,484
You don't think he's the one
bouncing those Ping-Pong balls

12
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,859
off the rims of the goldfish bowls?

13
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:37,656
I won two games
and the grand prize in the raffle...

14
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:40,171
AM/FM radio headphones.

15
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:44,319
Well, congratulations,
Slutty Gonzales.

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,480
You can listen
to the radio on the bus.

17
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:49,437
We have a car.

18
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,050
It's time to go.

19
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,491
Okay, fine. Give me the keys.

20
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,806
You've had 25 Dixie cups of wine.

21
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:00,267
Some of those I threw up.
Now, give me the keys.

22
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,541
I hate you.

23
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:05,147
I'm walking.

24
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:07,317
Very well, then.

25
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:12,456
These are the days I'm actually glad
you stole her away from me, Crab Man.

26
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,031
I'm glad every day.

27
00:01:15,682 --> 00:01:19,110
<i>Joy's shoe was the first thing
she lost on her drunk walk home.</i>

28
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,935
<i>The second was her mind.</i>

29
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:44,198
Oh, snap.

30
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,023
I killed her!

31
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,766
<i>Joy panicked and made a beeline
to an abandoned shed.</i>

32
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,587
<i>Well, a beeline
if the bee was drunk.</i>

33
00:01:57,737 --> 00:02:00,244
Holy God! I thought you were dead!

34
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,812
And what if I was?

35
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:05,916
You were just going to leave my body
to lay here and rot in some dirty shed?

36
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,286
I was going to pull out
all your teeth and just...

37
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:12,965
light everything on fire.

38
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:16,424
But I don't have to do that now
because you're alive.

39
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:19,849
So, now this will just be
a funny story we tell people.

40
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,683
It's a real funny story.
I can't wait to tell the police.

41
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:28,396
Damn it.
Move this thing back, so I can get out.

42
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,000
I got two kids

43
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,676
and two strikes.

44
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,527
I can't go to jail.

45
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:39,158
You can scream all you want to,
but nobody's going to hear you.

46
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,001
That was loud. I heard you.

47
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:53,433
But that's because I was pretty close
to the shed when you were screaming.

48
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:55,159
So, what I should have said

49
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:58,235
is, "You can scream all you want,
and nobody's going to hear you,

50
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,774
"except for me
when I'm walking away,

51
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:04,099
"and once I'm far enough away,
I won't hear you anymore."

52
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,385
That is a more accurate statement

53
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,460
about who will and will not
hear your screaming.

54
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:18,657
That psychic was right...

55
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:22,641
I am going to die in a shack,
pinned to the wall by a lawn mower.

56
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:28,340
<i>Me and Randy promised each other
after we lost 50 bucks at the can toss,</i>

57
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:29,648
<i>we'd walk away.</i>

58
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:30,823
<i>So, we did.</i>

59
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,754
Does that guy look familiar to you?

60
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,632
Come on.
It's for a good cause.

61
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,384
Give back to your community,

62
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,302
and take a shot at Satan.

63
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,289
Yo, man! You got to warn me!

64
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,185
<i>Randy was right
to think he looked familiar.</i>

65
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,953
<i>He was #35 on my list.</i>

66
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:53,296
<i>A few years back, me and Randy heard
you could make a fortune</i>

67
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:55,660
<i>selling organs on the black market.</i>

68
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:58,529
<i>At the time, we didn't know
they were talking about livers.</i>

69
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:04,159
Hello, sir.

70
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,037
We're here to pick up the organ
for routine maintenance.

71
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:08,964
We're trustworthy.

72
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,855
- Come on, Randy.
- I don't know, Earl.

73
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,490
He's a man of God, he can summon
the creatures of the earth to attack us.

74
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:19,873
You keep saying that,
but if I remember correctly,

75
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,761
that theory was given to you
by a cricket when you were drunk.

76
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:25,597
Besides, I'm a man of Karma.

77
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,226
I have to trust that it's telling me
the right thing to do.

78
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,312
Gentlemen,
like to take a shot for a dollar?

79
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,647
It depends.
Who's that supposed to be?

80
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,816
Are you serious? It's the devil.

81
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:38,068
I always thought he'd be taller.

82
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:41,613
Reverend, I'm just going to cut
to the chase here.

83
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:43,490
I stole your organ.

84
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,577
We both did actually.

85
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,693
Thanks, Earl.
He usually doesn't give me credit.

86
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,549
<i>So I told him all about my list
and how I turned my life around,</i>

87
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:56,545
<i>and then I learned that me
and the reverend weren't that different.</i>

88
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:58,577
I've been there before.

89
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:01,537
They used to call me Hash Brown.

90
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:05,885
I used to roam the streets of Camden
waiting for somebody to look at me wrong

91
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,058
just so I could grind their face up
like some hash browns.

92
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,603
Anyway, I was a pretty bad dude.

93
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:16,512
<i>Turns out, shooting at the devil
wasn't the first time he had used gun.</i>

94
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,693
I'll ask you one more time.

95
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:23,572
Is my niece Kiki invited
to your daughter's birthday party?

96
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,086
So I know what it's like
to get your life back on track.

97
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:28,762
Let us pray.

98
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:31,538
Heavenly Father,

99
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,692
thank you for providing me
with this test of forgiveness

100
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,460
so I can prove my services to you.

101
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,758
Don't worry, I can get that organ back
from the people I sold it to.

102
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:46,470
I hear it survived the circus fire
in perfect condition.

103
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:49,024
Clowns tried to put that fire out,
but all they had

104
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,482
was confetti in their buckets,
and that just made it worse.

105
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:55,213
They thought
they were going to be heroes.

106
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,691
<i>Me and Randy weren't
the only ones trying to fix mistakes.</i>

107
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,443
Hey, girlfriend! How did you sleep?

108
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,404
Pinned to the wall, you bitch.

109
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:06,907
Still a little upset.
Understandable.

110
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:10,828
You haven't eaten in a day.
Brought you some snacks.

111
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,621
Forgot the drink, though.

112
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,039
How thoughtful.

113
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,418
So...

114
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:19,420
Have you changed your mind
about calling the cops?

115
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:20,589
Hell, no.

116
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:25,134
Is it because I forgot the drink?
I'll be back.

117
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,386
Please don't leave me here again.

118
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,722
I won't call the police. I promise.

119
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,540
<i>We returned the organ</i>

120
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,773
<i>and cleared the burnt clown confetti
out of the pipes.</i>

121
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:41,191
Do it again.

122
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,235
All right. One more time.

123
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:48,093
<i>My name is Randy Hickey</i>

124
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:52,218
<i>and I love to smell my shoes.</i>

125
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:06,198
Hallelujah.

126
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,780
Life is good.

127
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,011
The guy who plays Satan
in my shooting gallery

128
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:13,013
dropped the lawsuit
and now the church's organ is back.

129
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,309
We're all settled up.

130
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,644
Awesome.
'Cause Randy had sort of worn out

131
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,064
the "Earl, stop playing
with your organ," jokes.

132
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,282
It's funny.

133
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,735
I'll just grab my tools
and be on my way.

134
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,101
Hold on a second.

135
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:30,205
These are my tools.
Where did you buy these?

136
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,867
Wait, these are your tools?

137
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:34,172
Have my initials on them.

138
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,878
Look, I could lie to you,

139
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:41,708
and I kind of want to

140
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,224
'cause you already had
to forgiven me once, but...

141
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,206
It looks like
you're on my list twice.

142
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:50,886
<i>Back when I was a petty thief,
I used to steal things that were, well,</i>

143
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:52,318
<i>petty.</i>

144
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:04,240
<i>And I used to do things
that were kind of petty, too.</i>

145
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:05,971
Randy, check this out.

146
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:14,378
Get me out of here!

147
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,648
It landed door-down.

148
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:19,790
I had to kick my way out
through the emptying hatch.

149
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,250
I swore whoever had done this,

150
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,503
I was going to take them
and put them six feet under.

151
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,822
But that was Hash Brown,
and he's dead to us, right?

152
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:30,841
- Right?
- Right.

153
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,869
Right, I'm different now.

154
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,764
Let us pray!

155
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,061
Dear Lord,

156
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:43,145
thank you for this glorious test.

157
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:45,173
You're bringing it.

158
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:47,776
This is some good stuff.
You are bringing it.

159
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,240
Squeezy hand. Hurts a little.

160
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,750
Because, Lord, you know
what the old me would have done.

161
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,262
I would have cut open the big one.
Then I'd have knocked out the little,

162
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,995
then put the little inside the big

163
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,498
then sewed up the big one,
then I would have waited

164
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,506
and listened
for the little one to scream

165
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:06,031
as he woke up
inside his own brother.

166
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:08,343
But not now, Lord.

167
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:09,631
I've changed!

168
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,001
Hand, hand, hand, hand, hand.

169
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,526
I'm a better man
because of you, God.

170
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:18,557
I said Amen.

171
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:25,564
But don't worry, Reverend.
I'll make up for this, too.

172
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,858
If you really want to make it up,

173
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,943
we need volunteers
for Sunday service.

174
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:32,142
Of course. We'd love to.

175
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:37,006
Okay, promise me you won't be mad.

176
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,458
Thank God, Crab Man.
Get me out of here.

177
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,881
Your wife ran me over with this mower
and has kept me pinned here for days.

178
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,379
We have to call the police.

179
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,506
See? I knew it! You lied to me!

180
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,843
- You are going to tell the cops.
- Of course I'm going to, you lunatic.

181
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,470
- Liar!
- Lunatic!

182
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,764
Shut up, everybody!
Shut up! I got to think.

183
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:01,400
I got two strikes.

184
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,727
I can't go to jail
for the rest of my life, baby.

185
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,077
I've used every trick I have to keep you
from getting that third strike.

186
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:10,408
Framed Dodge's principal.
Free crabs for the Asian meter maid.

187
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,902
Replaced the panda at the zoo.

188
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:14,326
Think before you get thrown
in the Big House

189
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:15,864
and I'm left with the boys.

190
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,246
If you don't move this lawn mower soon,
you're both going to jail,

191
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:20,757
I sell my story to Hollywood,

192
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:22,621
they'll make a movie
starring J. Lo as me,

193
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:24,414
and Sally Struthers as you.

194
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,443
I told you not to drive drunk,

195
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:30,629
but no, you couldn't listen to me.

196
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,339
You do what you want, when you want.

197
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,880
'Cause all that matters to you
is that you're happy.

198
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:37,719
Well, I hope you're happy now.
'Cause we're gonna have to kill her.

199
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,887
What?

200
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:43,869
Darnell, I know I said
I wanted your help,

201
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:45,441
but we can't kill her!

202
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:48,313
Maybe we can cut out her tongue,
but we can't kill her!

203
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:51,422
There's nothing we can say to her
to convince her not to go to the cops.

204
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,486
I was taught
a very specific moral hierarchy...

205
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,161
God, family, country.

206
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,695
Strippers who threaten my wife
are not on my list.

207
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,533
We've got no choice.
We have to kill her.

208
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,743
- Do I have a say in this?
- No.

209
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:04,037
But we've been friends
for almost ten years.

210
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,915
And I like you, but I've killed people
I've liked way more than you.

211
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,963
I came to you for help because
you're always the voice of reason!

212
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:13,982
I still am.

213
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,883
Now, you need to shut your hole
and start digging one.

214
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,068
<i>When I agreed to help
with the Sunday service,</i>

215
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:26,977
<i>I thought I'd be handing out
the crackers. I was wrong.</i>

216
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,389
Forgiveness!

217
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:33,727
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
It's an easy thing to say,

218
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:36,165
but it's a hard thing to do.

219
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,698
Meet my friend here.

220
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,085
Hi, my name is White.

221
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,200
I mean, Earl.

222
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:49,082
Now, this man has done
some pretty terrible things to me.

223
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,377
Earl didn't have to come down here
and confess, but he did.

224
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:54,880
He told the truth and let it out.

225
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:56,535
And I forgave him.

226
00:11:56,987 --> 00:12:00,991
You see, that there is a twofold test
that God has laid before us.

227
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,564
Can you confess your sins

228
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,597
and can you forgive
the sins of others?

229
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:10,537
Now, you know that you done
done something to somebody.

230
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,455
And you also know that somebody

231
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,526
has done something to you.

232
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,659
But what God is saying,

233
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,981
he wants you to let it out!

234
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,318
He doesn't want you to let it

235
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,093
fester all in your gut,

236
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:27,565
all in your soul,

237
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,290
down in your body, in your bones.

238
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,309
He wants you to let it out!

239
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,816
A lot of times,

240
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:37,001
when I ask people how they're doing,

241
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,216
I don't really listen
to their answer.

242
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:41,676
I forgive you.
Do the church forgive her?

243
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,428
We forgive you!

244
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:44,697
I hate kids!

245
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:47,490
- Daddy?
- I just love sex.

246
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,436
I forgive you.
Do the church forgive him?

247
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,854
We forgive you!

248
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:56,179
I touched a boob
on that statue outside.

249
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,122
We forgive you!

250
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:02,598
It is me who's been farting
all service.

251
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,075
We forgive you!

252
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:06,284
I have something to confess.

253
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:08,078
My lovely wife, Jackie.

254
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:09,663
I slept with Earl.

255
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,915
You did what?

256
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,667
- We forgive you!
- No! Shut up!

257
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,820
You slept with my wife?

258
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,919
Apparently so.

259
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:21,533
<i>About ten years back,
me and Randy figured out</i>

260
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,962
<i>that prison is a great place
to pick up chicks.</i>

261
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,028
<i>You just had to do it right.</i>

262
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,130
Thank you so much for
getting me out of jail

263
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:32,686
and back home to care
for my sad, lonely wife.

264
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,605
No need to thank me, son.
That's what I do.

265
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,574
I'm a prisoner's advocate.

266
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:40,187
There is one thing
I don't understand.

267
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:42,904
You are expensive
because you are the best,

268
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,552
but how could my wife
afford your services?

269
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:46,700
We are so poor.

270
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:49,411
She had relations with me.

271
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,788
- I know you must be mad...
- Nope.

272
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,314
I'm so relieved to be out of prison
that I forgive her.

273
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:59,213
In fact, I would be angry
if she hadn't done everything she could.

274
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,338
Thanks again.

275
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:02,674
Enjoy your glorious freedom.

276
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:05,127
Excuse me.

277
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:08,138
Can you really help
get a prisoner released?

278
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:09,848
I'll do my best.

279
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:13,602
Well, you are kind of cute.

280
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,218
Good night, Eddie.

281
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,694
So, while I was in prison,

282
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,664
you were grinding on
Jeff Foxworthy over here?

283
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:26,789
Reverend,

284
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:30,198
first of all,
thank you about Jeff Foxworthy.

285
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:32,017
And regarding your wife,

286
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,971
if it makes you feel better,

287
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,291
it only happened in your house once.

288
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,559
Let us pray.

289
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:43,845
Oh, Lord,

290
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,813
please give me the strength
to forgive this...

291
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:48,887
lowlife piece of scum.

292
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,472
Because you know what

293
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,849
Hash Brown would've done
to a man who stole his woman.

294
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,643
Please give me the strength!

295
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,394
You seem pretty strong to me.

296
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:59,232
Oh, Lord, I think
I'm failing this test!

297
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:01,399
Please, help me, Lord!

298
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:03,371
Yeah, please do help him.

299
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,488
Okay, Lord,

300
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,156
you want me to be Hash Brown,
that's why you're not helping me.

301
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:10,992
Fine! You want me to be Hash Brown?!

302
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:13,884
I'll be Hash Brown!

303
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,169
You know,

304
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,005
sometimes it's hard
to interpret God's...

305
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,675
I didn't tell you to get up!

306
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,061
<i>He had turned into
Hash Brown, all right.</i>

307
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:30,986
<i>And not just the violence.</i>

308
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:35,339
You're the one that convinced me
to stop selling crack

309
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:37,014
but the way I see it,

310
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,986
you owe me ten years of lost income.

311
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:41,940
So, I'm taking some stuff.

312
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,996
I'm taking this candlestick.

313
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,935
I can probably
get something for this.

314
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,311
This thing, uh,

315
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:49,072
this is worth some money.

316
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,992
I'm also gonna take
those coats in the lost and found.

317
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:53,736
And this!

318
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:56,582
Give me this!

319
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,343
Hash Brown is back!

320
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:10,051
- Reverend Greene!
- Say another word and I will kill you.

321
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,761
- But...
- I will kill you!

322
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:18,522
Son of a bitch.

323
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,496
<i>That truck was the last thing
I wanted to see at that moment,</i>

324
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:25,432
<i>'cause that meant the reverend
was on my list yet again:</i>

325
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,526
<i>#172.</i>

326
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:32,228
<i>A while back, me and Randy
had snuck into a magic show and</i>

327
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:35,745
<i>we were wowed by a trick that involved
catching a bullet in your hand.</i>

328
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,142
<i>Naturally, we decided
to give it a shot.</i>

329
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,868
<i>After a case of beer.</i>

330
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:41,993
All right, Randy. Abracadabra!

331
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:48,181
Oh, crap, I missed your hand
and blew out that guy's taillight.

332
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,300
Let's get out of here
before we get in trouble.

333
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,741
You didn't miss,
I caught the bullet.

334
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:54,929
I can feel it in my hand, it's hot!

335
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:57,168
And bloody.

336
00:16:58,261 --> 00:16:59,261
Oh, God.

337
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,369
Reverend, look,

338
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,024
I know you said you'd kill me
if I said another word but...

339
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,432
- Yep, and you just said about eight.
- <i>I was scared,</i>

340
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:11,175
<i>but just 'cause the reverend
had lost his faith in God,</i>

341
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,198
<i>didn't mean I had lost
my faith in Karma.</i>

342
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,617
A few years back I shot out
the taillight of your truck.

343
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:16,942
Make it quick!

344
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,287
You broke that taillight?

345
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:22,967
<i>Reverend Greene got pulled over
for having a busted taillight,</i>

346
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:24,757
<i>but the cops forgot about that</i>

347
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:26,693
<i>once they looked
in the back of his truck.</i>

348
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:30,770
AK-47s, cop killer bullets,
plastic explosives.

349
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:33,865
Fine, those are all
legal in this state.

350
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,840
But black market flu shots?

351
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:38,310
I guess public safety
means nothing to you.

352
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,140
That night I got pulled over

353
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,396
I was supposed to meet up
with my gang.

354
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:49,146
We were selling some
flu shots and some dynamite

355
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:51,069
to a Dominican gang
with the sniffles.

356
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:53,234
But it all went bad.

357
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:57,617
Somebody pulled a tissue
and one of my guys thought it was a gun.

358
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,369
All hell broke loose.

359
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,133
By the time the smoke cleared,

360
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:04,801
everybody in my crew was dead.

361
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:06,753
I don't get it.

362
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:12,110
If you hadn't broken that taillight,
I would've ended up a dark blob

363
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:14,509
in a bunch of body parts
and Dominican snot.

364
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,477
All this time I've been thinking
God wanted me

365
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:20,391
to forgive you for ruining my life.

366
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,299
But what he wanted...

367
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,269
was me to thank you for saving it.

368
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,062
God, huh?

369
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:29,357
What can you say about that guy,
isn't he something?

370
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,964
Brothers and sisters, I'm sorry.

371
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,388
We forgive you!

372
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,553
<i>Me and the reverend had been tested,</i>

373
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:53,798
<i>and sure,
he had strayed from his path,</i>

374
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,423
<i>but that's the cool thing
about having a path.</i>

375
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:57,800
<i>Even when you get lost,</i>

376
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:01,225
<i>it's still there waiting for you
to find your way back.</i>

377
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:26,581
I'm not doing this to scare you.
I'm doing this so it will hurt less.

378
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,043
Thank you.

379
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,278
You may want to turn away.

380
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:35,092
I do apologize for this.

381
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,134
I promise to put flowers
on your shallow unmarked grave.

382
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,021
I couldn't let it happen.

383
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:53,358
I want the Lifetime movie they make
about me to be for something good.

384
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,736
Not because I let my husband
murder an immigrant in a shed.

385
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,077
You saved my life.

386
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,129
As a "thank you"
you can tell the cops

387
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,250
I'm headed to Mexico
since I'm going to Canada.

388
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,697
Our white neighbors to the north.

389
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:16,422
How about as a "thank you"
I don't tell the cops anything at all?

390
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,425
Seriously?

391
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:21,085
Anyone who gives their husband
a concussion to save me

392
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,671
from getting my throat slit
is okay by me.

393
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:26,224
That's why I'm still friends
with my bitchy cousin Judy.

394
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,643
I forgive you for all of this, Joy.

395
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:30,373
I forgive you.

396
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,760
Thank you so much!

397
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,672
I knew if I hugged you

398
00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:38,778
you would smell like
burritos and stripper pole.

399
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,700
Tease all you want.

400
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:42,763
Now I know you love me.
