1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,569
Earl, I need you
to drive over to joy's

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,071
And punch her in the face.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,507
I don't think
that's a good idea, randy.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,443
Are you saying that
because it's a <i>great</i> idea?

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,778
She did it again,

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,847
Didn't she?
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,582
And it was a real fancy bird.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,184
(sam the sham and the pharaohs'
"wooly bully" begins)

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,354
Earl:
<i>randy had invested a lot</i>

10
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:25,024
<i>Of his time and my money into</i>
<i>the crab shack claw machine.</i>

11
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,225
I won a horse!

12
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,593
Who won a horse?

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,061
<i>But, thanks to joy,</i>

14
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,497
<i>He didn't have much</i>
<i>to show for it.</i>

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,067
I won a spider!
I will take that.

16
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,335
Thank you.

17
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:41,040
¶ and a wooly jaw,
wool bully... ¶

18
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,009
I won a bird dressed up
for a wedding!

19
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,443
And you're not getting it.

20
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,078
¶ wooly bully ¶

21
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,747
Catch.
(gasps)

22
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,582
(toy squeaks, joy laughs)

23
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,584
¶ watch it now, watch it ¶

24
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,252
¶ you got it, you got it. ¶

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,288
(sobbing)

26
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,057
Randy, you're 32 years old.

27
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,059
I can't protect you
from your bullies forever.

28
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,727
You need to learn
to stick up for yourself.

29
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,596
Joy's not going anywhere.

30
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,464
She's a part of our lives.
Man!

31
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,034
I'm always going to regret
giving her that heimlich.

32
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,303
I mean, first she sued me
and now this?!

33
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,738
Look, I know I go overboard
looking out for you,

34
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,440
But I'm not doing it anymore.

35
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,741
And while we're at it,

36
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,743
I'm not kissing your boo-boos
anymore, either.

37
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,945
It's getting awkward.

38
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,479
Even when we're alone?

39
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,582
Especially when we're alone.

40
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,985
<i>You know the kind of guy</i>
<i>who does nothing</i>

41
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,521
<i>But bad things and then wonders</i>
<i>why his life sucks?</i>

42
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>Well, that was me.</i>

43
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,558
(shutter clicks)

44
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,794
<i>Every time something good</i>
<i>happened to me,</i>

45
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,196
<i>Something bad was always</i>
<i>waiting around the corner.</i>

46
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,899
<i>Karma.</i>

47
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,102
<i>That's when I realized</i>
<i>I had to change.</i>

48
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,938
<i>So I made a list of everything</i>
<i>bad I've ever done,</i>

49
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,507
<i>And one by one, I'm going</i>

50
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,442
<i>To make up</i>
<i>for all my mistakes.</i>

51
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,310
<i>I'm just trying to be</i>
<i>a better person.</i>

<font color="#ffff00">It's what the people want.</font>

54
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,318
Earl:
<i>while randy was bummed</i>

55
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,254
<i>Because joy kept taking</i>
<i>his claw machine toys,</i>

56
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,722
<i>I was kind of happy</i>
(sighs loudly)

57
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,658
<i>'cause it reminded me</i>
<i>of something on my list.</i>

58
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,863
(hums loudly)

59
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,234
Randy, this tantrum
is getting out of control.

60
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,769
Here we go.

61
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:20,139
"#32: bullied wally panzer."

62
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,607
<i>When I was in the eighth grade,</i>

63
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,310
<i>My parents made a last-ditch</i>
<i>effort to fix me:</i>

64
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,945
<i>Catholic school.</i>

65
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,814
<i>I knew that the new kid</i>
<i>at school usually got picked on</i>

66
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,950
<i>Unless there was someone lower</i>
<i>on the totem pole than him.</i>

67
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,686
<i>So I decided</i>
<i>to make that happen.</i>

68
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,927
(screams)

69
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,663
That kid loves butterflies.

70
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,364
And he hates when they die!

71
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,767
(continues screaming)
wally panzer.

72
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,069
More like wally pansy.

73
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,738
<i>And once I smelled blood</i>
<i>in the water, I didn't let up.</i>

74
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,975
Hey, everyone, look.

75
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,743
It's pant-less pansy.

76
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,812
<i>But, like most things in life,</i>

77
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,280
<i>I pushed it too far.</i>

78
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,617
<i>Even thought I got kicked out,</i>
<i>my legacy lived on.</i>

79
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,319
<i>Wally wasn't hard to find,</i>

80
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,721
<i>Since if you hadn't left camden</i>
<i>by grade school,</i>

81
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,123
<i>Odds are you weren't leaving</i>
<i>camden at all.</i>

82
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,658
Okay, the way I remember it,

83
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,527
This guy was
pretty delicate as a kid,

84
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,162
So try to be as friendly
as possible.

85
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,730
I don't want to spook him.

86
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,333
(sighs)

87
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,271
What do you want?

88
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,107
Uh, are you,
uh, w-wally panzer?

89
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,610
Yeah. Who are you?

90
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,045
Cliff.

91
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,447
You here about my ad
in the <i>penny saver?</i>

92
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,349
Mm-hmm.
Awesome!

93
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,850
I hope you're ready
for some pain.

94
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,454
I'm going to get my belt.

95
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,156
Man, you must be scared.
You forgot your name.

96
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,358
I didn't forget my name, randy.

97
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,193
I just don't want him
to know who I am.

98
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,663
Why is he getting his belt?

99
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,965
That's what dad used to say.
Are we going to get spanked?!

100
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,867
I guess it depends
on what's in his ad.

101
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,802
Why didn't you just tell him
why you're here?

102
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,438
Because, if I tell him who I am,
he'll probably kill me.

103
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,941
I'm going to have to try
to cross him of the list

104
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,776
Without him ever knowing
who I am.

105
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,312
We're just going to have
to take our chances with the ad.

106
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,980
What if his ad is sex?

107
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,650
I hope it's not sex.
(door opens)

108
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,451
All right.

109
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,853
You guys ready to pump?

110
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,689
Oh, god!

111
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,958
He <i>does</i> want to have
sex with us.

112
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,693
"us"? You.

113
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,894
Cliff answered the ad.

114
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,696
Come on.
Let's hit the gym.

115
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,131
(sighs)

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,800
We're going to work
out together.
Awesome.

117
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,635
I hope this gym
has group showers

118
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,137
Like the ones we had at school.

119
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,706
I want to show everybody
I have hair now.

120
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,543
<i>I wasn't sure how karma was</i>
<i>going to feel about me lying.</i>

121
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,746
<i>But it turns out, karma already</i>
<i>had a plan in motion.</i>

122
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,683
<i>To torture me the way</i>
<i>I'd tortured wally.</i>

123
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,685
What the hell'd
you do that for?!

124
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,820
To get us pumped!

125
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,956
Come on, cliff. Hit me back.

126
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,992
Go ahead.

127
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,696
Good.

128
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,930
(grunts)

129
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,765
<i>Wally was so hard-core,</i>

130
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,101
<i>He'd already broken</i>
<i>three partners before me.</i>

131
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,070
Come on, cliff. Push it!

132
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,338
You can do it.
Two more!

133
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,606
It's all you.

134
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,343
How about a little less me
and a little more you?

135
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,347
Here we go.

136
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,051
It slipped.
I'll get it.

137
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,053
Come on.

138
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,789
What do you say
we take a quick break?

139
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,092
So I figured
if I got big and strong,

140
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,960
My bully would leave me alone.

141
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,896
How long do I have
to bounce on this thing

142
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,631
Before I look like you guys?

143
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,099
If you want to
really get ripped,

144
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,433
You got to work with
some free weights.

145
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,569
Good, 'cause I don't have
any money.

146
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,471
Don't worry, man.

147
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,473
We'll buff you out.

148
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,975
So, uh, how big
is your bully?

149
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,445
About this tall,

150
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,649
This wide and...

151
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,317
About a 32c.

152
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,421
Wait. Your bully's a girl?

153
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,590
A really tough girl.

154
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,959
32c.

155
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,394
Dude, if your
bully's a girl,

156
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,962
It's not about
how big you are.

157
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,463
It's about confidence.

158
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,099
What you need

159
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,069
Is 100% pure shark adrenaline.

160
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,270
It'll turn you into a beast!

161
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,939
You'll destroy

162
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,107
Everyone and everything
that gets in your way.

163
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,076
Especially baby seals.

164
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,912
Mmm, man, what I wouldn't give

165
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,547
For a baby seal right now.

166
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,115
(both grunt)
cool.

167
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,617
So what's it taste like?

168
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,652
The drugs,
not the baby seal.

169
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,521
I know what those taste like.
Oh, you don't

170
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,523
Drink this;
you inject it into your scrotum.

171
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,326
Yeah...

172
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,897
(screams)

173
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,065
Oh, my god!

174
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,000
That's my scrotum?!

175
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,335
(screams)

176
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,846
(groans, grunts)

177
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,760
Mr. Camden, huh?

178
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,161
Pretty big deal.

179
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,064
I was there when mr. Camden 1998
cut the ribbon

180
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,767
At the opening ceremony
of the new welfare office.

181
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,769
Me and my brother
were third in line.

182
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,238
Eh, the mr. Camden competition
is stupid.

183
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,374
"stupid"? Really?

184
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,342
Look at all this stuff
you could win.

185
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,844
You could get
a month's worth

186
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,946
Of something
called "dvd rentals,

187
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,415
"an office-quality
paper shredder,

188
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,084
"and a gift certificate
for all-you-can eat sushi

189
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,020
From sensei yum-yums."

190
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,722
Okay, fine.

191
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,157
Yes, of course I want to win.

192
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,959
It's always been
a dream of mine.

193
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,195
But there's just some stuff
I'm not willing to do.

194
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,530
<i>Wally told me competing</i>
<i>in mr. Camden</i>

195
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,466
<i>Involved a lot of things</i>
<i>other than just muscles.</i>

196
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,235
<i>You were expected</i>
<i>to shave everything</i>

197
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,237
<i>That wasn't covered</i>
<i>by tiny pants,</i>

198
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,738
<i>Have a head-to-toe tan</i>

199
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,541
<i>And oil yourself</i>
<i>like a catcher's mitt.</i>

200
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,910
<i>And wally wasn't</i>
<i>into that stuff.</i>

201
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,979
(grunting)

202
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,417
I don't care if that contest
comes with a talking pet monkey.

203
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,619
It ain't worth
turning myself into a pansy!

204
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,187
<i>I knew something was wrong</i>

205
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,090
<i>'cause no man would turn down</i>
<i>a talking pet monkey.</i>

206
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,860
<i>Then I realized</i>
<i>me calling wally a "pansy"</i>

207
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,528
<i>When we were kids</i>
<i>was stopping him</i>

208
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,963
<i>From trying to be mr. Camden.</i>

209
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,900
Randy, you're not going
to believe what just happened.

210
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,435
I was just going to say
the same thing.

211
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,504
I know how I can cross
wally off my list.

212
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,005
I'm going to help him
get over his fear,

213
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,107
So he can win
the mr. Camden competition.

214
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,342
See you later, buddy.

215
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,112
I just got a shot in my balls.

216
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,881
Look, I've been thinking,

217
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,416
You're the biggest,
strongest guy I've ever seen.

218
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,085
You should be mr. Camden.

219
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,387
It just makes sense,
like how the biggest,

220
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,322
Strongest peanut
became mr. Peanut.

221
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,657
What?

222
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,492
It's true.
Don't you ever read the jar?

223
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,594
Cliff, dudes like me and you,

224
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,496
We don't do all
that pansy stuff.

225
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,864
We wear flannel.

226
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,666
We have body hair.

227
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,968
We really like soups that are so
hearty you eat them with a fork.

228
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,171
Are you kidding?
I'm totally going to do

229
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,274
All that bodybuilder stuff,
as soon as I'm ripped like you.

230
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,776
Why do you think I was looking
for a training partner?

231
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,145
I don't know, cliff.

232
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,080
Come on.
We'll do it together.

233
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,184
Two men shaving, tanning,

234
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,885
Oiling each other up...

235
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,358
We won't talk about it.
We'll just do it.

236
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,828
All right.

237
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,765
If a man's man like you
can do it,

238
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,300
Then I guess I can, too.

239
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,901
Hot damn!

240
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,469
I'm going to be
mr. Camden.

241
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,071
Let's get psyched.

242
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,041
(screams)

243
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,376
Good. Good.

244
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,279
Uh, could we work out, uh,
some kind of signal

245
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,248
Before you do that?

246
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,450
<i>Just like marcus and kyle</i>
<i>had promised,</i>

247
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,052
<i>That shark adrenaline</i>
<i>was starting</i>

248
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,520
<i>To affect randy's attitude.</i>

249
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,892
Hand over
the floppy puppy.

250
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,694
You're not getting
<i>my</i> floppy puppy.

251
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,229
Give me the floppy puppy.

252
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,531
No! Mine! Mine!

253
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,899
Kill her! Kill her!

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,567
I know a guy who can make
any death look like a suicide.

255
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,036
(growls)

256
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,340
Keep the stupid dog.

257
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,076
Big baby.

258
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,413
I did it! Victory!

259
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,482
I got my floppy puppy!

260
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,351
But I had to burn through
my week's supply

261
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,519
Of that shark's adrenaline.

262
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,686
I'm going to need more.

263
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,022
Well, kyle should be
back from...

264
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,423
Now!

265
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,492
<i>To help wally win</i>
<i>the mr. Camden title,</i>

266
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,127
<i>I was going to have</i>
<i>to do some things</i>

267
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,495
<i>That made me uncomfortable.</i>

268
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,330
<i>Smooth, but uncomfortable.</i>

269
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,532
I don't know.

270
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,133
This doesn't feel right.

271
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,036
Come on.
It's perfectly manly to do this.

272
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,639
And these lady razors
are exactly like the men's.

273
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,041
They're just a little
more flexible

274
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,910
To move with the contours
of our legs.

275
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,751
Okay.

276
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,119
<i>It looked like</i>

277
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>I had wally on the road</i>
<i>to becoming mr. Camden.</i>

278
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,591
<i>I just didn't know trouble</i>
<i>was coming around the corner.</i>

279
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:05,965
Bros, what the hell?!

280
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,302
Relax, randy, we're just
shaving for the competition.

281
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,404
What are you competing for,
who gets to be on the bottom?

282
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,471
Pansies.

283
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,908
What's he talking about?

284
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,310
Tell him, cliff.

285
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,477
We're not pansies!

286
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,746
"cliff"?
You still sticking

287
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,615
With that name?
You haven't told him

288
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,649
Who you really are?

289
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,152
What are you talking
about, randy?

290
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,820
I-I-I am who I am.

291
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:28,821
I'm cliff.

292
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,323
Man, I don't know

293
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,592
Which one of you's
a bigger pansy:

294
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,760
Wally, for actually
being a pansy,

295
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,429
Or you for being too afraid
to tell him

296
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,965
Your real name... Earl.

297
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,468
Wait a minute.

298
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,904
"earl"?

299
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,539
"pansy"?

300
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,278
Earl hickey?

301
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:55,481
I-I-I-I guess cliff
is more of a nickname.

302
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,250
But-but look, I can explain.

303
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,185
I always dreamed
I'd run into you again.

304
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:00,486
Earl hickey.

305
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,656
I-I dream about stuff, too.

306
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,359
(yelps)

307
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,693
I'm glad you're here.

308
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,762
You can clean up
my splatter, lady legs.

309
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,498
Randy, what the hell's
gotten into you?

310
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,966
Shark adrenaline--
that's what's gotten into me

311
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,034
And I love it!
(knocking)

312
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,503
(screams)

313
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:21,443
(screaming)

314
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,744
Damn it, earl!

315
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,112
Open this door!

316
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,548
J-just give me a second.

317
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:28,550
Let me at least
get my jeans on.

318
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,518
I don't want to die
in my underpants!

319
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:33,788
Unlock it, earl.
Take the medicine like a man.

320
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,824
No way!

321
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:37,259
Why is your pee blue?

322
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:40,629
(screams):
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

323
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:41,997
(crashing)

324
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,331
(grunting)

325
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,699
I'm really sorry!

326
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:45,800
I got a list!

327
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,502
It's a karma list.

328
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,703
It's really hard
to explain.

329
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:50,272
I was just trying to help.

330
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,840
By making me look like a pansy?

331
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:53,008
No!

332
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:54,709
(wally grunts)

333
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:57,913
(groans)

334
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:04,519
Eh, fella, you
want to party?

335
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,121
I'm not sharing mine.

336
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:08,790
Randy:
what the hell

337
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:09,991
Are you doing, jerk?!

338
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:11,993
This was my favorite wall!

339
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:14,563
Randy, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

340
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:16,131
<i>I wanted to get things</i>
<i>under control</i>

341
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,365
<i>Before they got too crazy.</i>

342
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,872
¶ keep your eyes
on the road... ¶

343
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:25,540
(grunting)

344
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:27,042
(both grunting)

345
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,720
You take back what you said!

346
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:46,194
(grunts):
thanks!

347
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:48,797
You just released more
shark juice from my scrote!

348
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,967
No, no, no! No, randy!

349
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:53,535
(screams)

350
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,770
Randy, you got to stop this

351
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:57,239
Before you get...

352
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:58,540
Wally, hold on!

353
00:13:58,574 --> 00:13:59,941
I'm trying to...

354
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,776
(screams)

355
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:03,678
Cut it out!

356
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:09,084
¶ all night long... ¶

357
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,518
<i>It was no fun being</i>

358
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,020
<i>In the middle</i>
<i>of two monsters.</i>

359
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:13,922
<i>But they were monsters</i>
<i>I had created.</i>

360
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,390
Randy!

361
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,894
<i>I created one by telling him</i>
<i>to stand up for himself</i>

362
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,962
<i>And the other</i>
<i>by pushing him down.</i>

363
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:28,603
(honking)

364
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,107
Sam, I'm going around back
to grab some ice.

365
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:33,341
You mind watching the bar
for a second?

366
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,619
Who's a pansy now? Huh?

367
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:55,297
(grunting)

368
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:22,224
(thudding)

369
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,758
¶ all night long. ¶

370
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:24,826
What the...?

371
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:29,030
<i>There was only one thing</i>
<i>that could distract randy</i>

372
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:30,232
<i>From fighting with wally.</i>

373
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:36,037
<i>The return</i>
<i>of his original bully, joy.</i>

374
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:38,006
She got my babies!

375
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:55,924
Sam, may we have a word?

376
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:58,026
<i>It took me 20 minutes</i>
<i>to get to my car,</i>

377
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,095
<i>But I knew I had to do</i>
<i>whatever it took</i>

378
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:02,330
<i>To stop randy</i>
<i>before he killed somebody.</i>

379
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:04,299
<i>And I wasn't the only one</i>
<i>looking for him.</i>

380
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:06,701
<i>Wally was also following</i>
<i>the path to destruction.</i>

381
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,371
Hey! Where's the guy
who did this?
(grunting)

382
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:11,606
<i>I should've guessed that path</i>
<i>to destruction would only</i>

383
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:12,841
<i>Lead to one place.</i>

384
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,042
So I told that teacher,

385
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,911
"I'm glad my son's
flunking spanish."

386
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,213
Frankly, I'd be disappointed
if he wasn't.

387
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:20,448
Oh, god.

388
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:22,851
I want my claw machine toys!

389
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:24,219
All of 'em!

390
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,820
Including the ones
you took today!

391
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:27,389
Eugenia, call the police
right now.

392
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:28,823
I'm at...

393
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:34,896
I'll get you a bag.

394
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,302
<i>Randy was happy</i>
<i>he got all of his toys.</i>

395
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,470
<i>Well, except for one.</i>
(penguin squeaks)

396
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,309
Give me that bird
dressed for a wedding.

397
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:48,810
Hey, uncle randy.

398
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:51,112
I said I want
my dressed-up birdie, punk.

399
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,748
But it's mine.
Mommy got it for me yesterday.

400
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,016
Give me that dressed-up birdie!

401
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:57,452
(squeaking)

402
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,854
<i>Though nothing had stopped</i>
<i>this monster so far,</i>

403
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:01,856
<i>There was one thing</i>
<i>he wasn't prepared for.</i>

404
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,024
(sobbing)

405
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:04,526
<i>Even though</i>
<i>the shark adrenaline</i>

406
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:07,028
<i>Had completely taken over</i>
<i>his brain, there was still</i>

407
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,331
<i>One thing that could get</i>
<i>through to the old randy:</i>

408
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:11,533
<i>The cry of a bullied child,</i>

409
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,002
<i>Especially since this time,</i>
<i>he was the bully.</i>

410
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,036
(sobbing)

411
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:17,772
Oh, my god,
what am I doing?

412
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,507
<i>But when I came around</i>
<i>that corner,</i>

413
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:21,610
<i>All I saw was</i>
<i>a juiced-up maniac</i>

414
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:23,278
<i>Heading right for a kid.</i>

415
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:24,913
(randy screaming)

416
00:17:24,947 --> 00:17:27,649
(grunts, toy squeaks)

417
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:35,891
Sorry, buddy.

418
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,659
You turned into a monster.

419
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,663
But it wasn't
your fault, though.

420
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:44,466
I pushed you to be a tough guy
and stand up to joy,

421
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,368
But you're not a tough guy.

422
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:49,538
You're a sweet,
gentle, sensitive guy.

423
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:51,973
I shouldn't have
made you change.

424
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:54,676
Being sweet and sensitive
is a good thing.

425
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:56,711
Randy?

426
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,079
<i>Randy didn't hear me</i>

427
00:17:58,147 --> 00:17:59,648
<i>Since his brain</i>
<i>was kind of swollen</i>

428
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:02,751
<i>At the time, but my words</i>
<i>did have an effect on someone.</i>

429
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,821
You know what, earl?

430
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:09,658
I used to be sensitive, too.

431
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,359
<i>Wally had been sensitive,</i>

432
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:13,828
<i>But I made him ashamed of it</i>
<i>back when we were kids.</i>

433
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:15,363
I'm sorry, wally.

434
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:17,933
I should've never bullied that
out of you.

435
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:20,869
<i>Something about what I said</i>

436
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,038
<i>Made wally realize</i>
<i>that you might be able</i>

437
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:24,673
<i>To change how you look</i>
<i>on the outside,</i>

438
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,509
<i>But you can't change</i>
<i>who you are on the inside.</i>

439
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:30,278
<i>No matter</i>
<i>how big and strong</i>

440
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:32,781
<i>Wally made his outer shell,</i>
<i>he couldn't change</i>

441
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:36,017
<i>The sweetness inside</i>
<i>he was trying to protect.</i>

442
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:37,919
<i>And wally was finally ready</i>
<i>to embrace</i>

443
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:40,589
<i>Both of those people:</i>
<i>the bodybuilder</i>

444
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,857
<i>And the little kid</i>
<i>who loves butterflies.</i>

445
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:47,395
<i>And like a butterfly,</i>
<i>wally finally came out</i>

446
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:50,265
<i>Of his cocoon and became</i>
<i>the person he was meant to be.</i>

447
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,967
(cheering and applause)

448
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:57,372
¶ ¶

449
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:18,493
(grunting)

450
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,292
(grunting)

451
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:56,064
Sorry again.
For what?

452
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:57,699
Oh, hitting me
with the car?

453
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:58,900
That's okay.

454
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:01,436
Hey, earl?

455
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:02,971
Yeah, randy?

456
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:06,141
You think kryptonite works
on people who aren't superman?

457
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:09,311
I don't know.

458
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:10,445
Probably not.

459
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:13,515
What about garlic?

460
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,284
That only works on vampires.

461
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:17,485
Apples?

462
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:19,721
I'm pretty sure
that's only for doctors.

463
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,424
What are you trying
to keep away?

464
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:24,292
Joy.

465
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:29,698
Try hummus.

466
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:32,000
Thanks, earl.

467
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:34,536
Good night, randy.
Good night, earl.
