1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,341
No, Earl, you're not listening.
I never said "instead of."

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:08,417
You'd still have your regular hands,
but you'd also have robot hands.

3
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:09,604
Okay, fine.

4
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:12,411
Yes, with robot hands,
you could open beers faster.

5
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:14,267
Thank you. Jeez!

6
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:17,709
- Oh, wow. Look, a hat.
- Randy, wait!

7
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,879
<i>Every now and then
Randy found a new hat,</i>

8
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,984
<i>which brought the unwelcome addition
of lice and a new personality.</i>

9
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:26,781
Let's go get some chicken wings.

10
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:30,233
Howdy, pilgrim.

11
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,050
Yo, yo, yo, what's up,
my home Earl?

12
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:37,069
<i>But Randy hadn't found
a hat in a while,</i>

13
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:39,209
<i>and I was hoping this time,
it'd be different.</i>

14
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:44,201
Wouldst thou fancy a beer?
I certainly shall.

15
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,716
Son of a bitch.

16
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:48,176
Don't dally!

17
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:52,514
STOLE AN RV

18
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:57,063
Darnell, I do believe
I'll have a beer in a glass.

19
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,145
And why don't we throw
a cherry on top?

20
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:02,917
Thank you, my fine sir.

21
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:04,625
Oh, so suave.

22
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:07,298
I feel like
I'm in Rick's Cafe American.

23
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:10,666
Casablanca.

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,540
They don't watch
black & white movies,

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,828
'cause it reminds them
too much of newspapers.

26
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:16,659
They don't watch
black and white movies

27
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:19,718
because it reminds whom
too much of newspapers.

28
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:23,199
Now, if you'll excuse me,
therefore, what for,

29
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:25,171
wherewithal, henceforth,

30
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,830
English muffins.

31
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,094
I seen the giant pig!

32
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:32,969
I seen Pigsquatch!

33
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:35,169
<i>There was a legend
of a giant pig</i>

34
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,304
<i>that lived in the woods
near the trailer park.</i>

35
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:39,637
<i>Nobody sober
had ever actually seen it.</i>

36
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,098
Pigsquatch!

37
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:43,659
<i>Until Joy.</i>

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,282
Pigsquatch.

39
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:47,657
Maybe the neighbor
just wheeled

40
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:50,003
his shut-in mom out to the yard
to hose her off again?

41
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:53,688
I know the difference between
a prehistoric pig and Jumbo Sally.

42
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:56,249
You know what I'm going to do?

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,662
Catch him.

44
00:01:58,135 --> 00:01:59,831
What would you do
with a giant pig?

45
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:01,204
Make a damn fortune.

46
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:03,346
Tourists pay good money
to see giant stuff.

47
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,552
World's biggest Slinky,
world's biggest staircase,

48
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:07,470
which is next to the world's
biggest Slinky.

49
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,341
Even me and this idiot paid $10 each
to see the world's biggest anthill.

50
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,710
Remember that?
When we took that RV trip?

51
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,926
<i>I did remember,</i>

52
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:17,932
<i>cause that RV trip she was talking about
was #47 on my list.</i>

53
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,039
<i>A while back, the kids were mistakenly
detained by Child Protective Services.</i>

54
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,790
<i>Since we knew
they were in good hands,</i>

55
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,030
<i>we decided we wanted to go
on vacation.</i>

56
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,490
<i>So we stole one.</i>

57
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,470
<i>And we discovered
we hadn't just stole a vacation,</i>

58
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:37,687
<i>we stole a whole new lifestyle.</i>

59
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:39,346
Check it out.

60
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:42,207
These RV people have
special glasses just for wine.

61
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:45,425
Wow, it looks like it's on stilts.
That's really smart.

62
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,882
It's closer to your mouth,
so you can drink it faster.

63
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,714
RVs are so much better
than trailers.

64
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,904
When a twister's coming,
you just drive away.

65
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:55,351
Instead of sitting in a bathtub
with a pillow on your head like a chump.

66
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,888
I ain't ever going back.

67
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,342
Don't have to.
We're RV people now.

68
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,423
Thanks to this baby,

69
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:03,144
it's going to be stilt glasses,

70
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:05,082
cup holders on the walls,

71
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:07,690
and tables that turn into beds
from now on.

72
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,722
Cheers to hittin'
the freakin' jackpot!

73
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:18,660
Randy, did you turn off the stove
when you were finished cooking?

74
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,329
I mean, my hands were full,
so I blew it out.

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,457
I figured what's the worst
that could happen?

76
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:26,532
Now, we know.

77
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:29,589
<i>And just like that,
our RV'ing days were over.</i>

78
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,462
<i>Luckily, the guy we stole it from
was living in the same spot.</i>

79
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,034
<i>Just without wheels.</i>

80
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:37,338
There's gotta be something
I can do for ya.

81
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,809
Get you a new RV?

82
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:41,898
- Find you a new place to live?
- I don't want nothing.

83
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:45,019
Just leave me alone
and let me sit here and wait to die.

84
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,438
I got to cross you off my list.

85
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,387
You wanna cross me
off your list,

86
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,031
just pump me full of morphine

87
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:53,361
and beat me over the head
with that rake till I'm dead.

88
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:59,495
<i>I wasn't going to kill the guy,</i>

89
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,283
<i>but I wasn't gonna do
nothing, either.</i>

90
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:04,946
<i>So I decided to watch him
and see if I came up with any ideas.</i>

91
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:12,117
<i>And I found out
he wasn't lying.</i>

92
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:14,094
<i>He was just waiting to die.</i>

93
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:28,624
<i>And while I still didn't know
what I was supposed to do to help him,</i>

94
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,673
<i>at least I figured out
a place to start.</i>

95
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:33,526
Morning, Jerry!
I'm here to fix your roof.

96
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:37,126
- Sorry.
- Doesn't matter.

97
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,969
<i>While I was fixing Jerry's roof,</i>

98
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,389
<i>Joy was getting started
on her get-rich-quick pig plan.</i>

99
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:47,409
Baby, the boys are hungry.
Where's the bacon?

100
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:50,049
On the end of this string.
Soon as Pigsquatch gets a whiff of it,

101
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,030
I'm going to pull the string,
lure him to me,

102
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,631
and then knock him out
with a baseball bat.

103
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,504
You can't catch a pig
with bacon.

104
00:04:56,624 --> 00:04:59,280
That's like trying to catch
a cow with a cheeseburger.

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,149
I'm hearing a lot of "no" and "can't"
from you right now,

106
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,766
if you're not gonna get with the
pig-catching program, shut up.

107
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,077
All I'm saying is,

108
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:08,720
the boys are drinking
Tom Collins mix for breakfast.

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,325
We can't send them
to school like that.

110
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:17,970
<i>Although I'd spent the morning
fixing Jerry's roof,</i>

111
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,281
<i>I couldn't help feeling that
I still hadn't done enough.</i>

112
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,992
Well, at least it shouldn't rain
on you anymore, huh?

113
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,245
Here, let me get that for ya.

114
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,556
Wait, Randy.
Go back a station.

115
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:54,183
Jerry, you're moving.

116
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,232
You like that jug music?

117
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,337
Love the jug.

118
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,660
It's the easiest instrument
to learn.

119
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,428
Hardest to master.

120
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,477
Actually, that's not true.

121
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:09,372
Hell, in a good wind,
it actually plays itself.

122
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,750
You could be dead
for all that jug cares.

123
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:15,437
I miss my jug.

124
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:19,782
I used to have one before
you blew it up in that RV fire.

125
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:21,478
Jackass.

126
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,719
<i>It still didn't seem like
it made up for burning an RV, but</i>

127
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,017
<i>at least fixing his roof and getting him
a jug were better than doing nothing.</i>

128
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,286
That is a beauty.

129
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:35,231
Brings back good memories, huh?

130
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:39,495
My RV was filled with memories:

131
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,988
doohickeys,
things from my past.

132
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,719
You know, mementos.

133
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:45,791
Yup, the freshmaker.

134
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:48,996
Well, that's what I can do
to make up to you, Jerry.

135
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,521
Find some way to replace the things
that got burned up in your RV.

136
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:54,500
What else did you have in it?

137
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:55,912
My dead wife.

138
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:57,706
I don't think so.

139
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:59,422
We would've remembered
a dead wife.

140
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,229
No, pictures of her.

141
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:04,323
I had pictures of her
all over the wall.

142
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:09,599
I met her when I first came back
from the war in Korea.

143
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:11,476
Those pictures
kind of made me

144
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:13,304
feel like her arms
were around me.

145
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:18,296
This was her song,
"Moonlight Sonata".

146
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,682
And that, gentlemen,
will get you laid.

147
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:54,125
<i>I didn't know how to replace
pictures of Jerry's dead wife,</i>

148
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:57,063
<i>but if he needed some arms around him,
I had an idea where to go.</i>

149
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,098
That's a good one.

150
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:02,849
My favorite's still the one
where you're riding it sidesaddle.

151
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,340
Acting ladylike on a giant pig.

152
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,198
That makes me laugh.

153
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,034
Just keep taking pictures
before this thing wakes up.

154
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:13,204
Holy crap!
You caught Pigsquatch?!

155
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:15,296
How'd you do it?

156
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,285
Put some sleeping pills
in a bucket of slop.

157
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:19,599
Basically, the pig version
of how I got you to marry me.

158
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:20,609
Nice!

159
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,598
Do you still have that doll you bought
to make Darnell think you were

160
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:25,812
in bed when you ran to Mexico
to avoid the cops,

161
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:27,779
but got caught
by Dog the Bounty Hunter,

162
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,845
went on trial,
and I went to prison for it,

163
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:32,288
then got out, then got hit by a car
and went into a coma

164
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,308
where I thought I was living
in a sitcom world?

165
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,186
Can I take her?
It's for a good cause.

166
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:38,776
Don't know.

167
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:41,133
Me and Darnell still use her
sometimes on date night.

168
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:44,735
Boys, Mommy and Daddy
are going out.

169
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:47,204
Aunt Gretchen's here to babysit
and if I were you,

170
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:49,963
I'd stay in your room,
'cause she brought her paddle!

171
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,666
Okay, baby.
Let's go eat some shrimps.

172
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:02,598
You know what?
If you want her, you can have her.

173
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,846
I caught Darnell taking a bath
with her the other day.

174
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:07,216
Says he was washing her.
I have my doubts.

175
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:08,903
Thanks, Joy.

176
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
Joy, come here.

177
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:14,348
Does this pig look funny to you?

178
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:18,393
All pigs look funny to me, Darnell.
Porky, Petunia, Miss Piggy...

179
00:09:18,513 --> 00:09:19,645
Hilarious.

180
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:21,864
No, I mean in that
it's not breathing.

181
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:22,975
He's dead.

182
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,704
And I don't think anybody's going to pay
to see a dead pig.

183
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,904
He's not dead.
He's just sleeping.

184
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:31,323
Oh, hell!

185
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:33,760
I only gave him 50 pills.

186
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,887
My mama used to take that many
every friday night,

187
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:37,260
wash it down with a gin,

188
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,245
and wake up the next morning
fresh as a daisy

189
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:40,499
to do her paper route.

190
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,877
Damn lightweight.

191
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,265
<i>Once I got the real doll
from Joy,</i>

192
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,681
<i>me and Randy gave it a makeover
and changed it into a real old doll.</i>

193
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,012
Hey, Jerry, check it out.
Arms to put around you.

194
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:59,867
What good is a plastic mannequin
going to do me?

195
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:01,187
Give it a shot.

196
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:05,858
Can you make the hug tighter?

197
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:07,480
<i>After he got the doll,</i>

198
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,403
<i>Jerry started thinking
about more things</i>

199
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:11,885
<i>from his trailer
that he wanted us to replace.</i>

200
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,533
<i>Like his old animal heads.</i>

201
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,696
<i>And the more stuff we replaced,
like his old hunting equipment,</i>

202
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:23,445
<i>the more alive he became.</i>

203
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:28,589
<i>When we tracked down an exact replica
of his Special Forces uniform,</i>

204
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,424
<i>he was a new man.</i>

205
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:37,341
<i>And he was feeling so good,
he even wanted to go out for a drink.</i>

206
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:40,135
Oh, there's one more
thing I need.

207
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,572
It's a pendant.

208
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:44,639
There's only one other like it
in the whole wide world.

209
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,010
An old army buddy
of mine has it,

210
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,277
I would like to go
with you to get it.

211
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,570
That's the spirit.

212
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,406
Hip-hip cheerios, Harry Potter.

213
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:58,693
<i>I was feeling good.</i>

214
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:01,207
<i>I hadn't given up on Jerry,
and it paid off.</i>

215
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:04,145
<i>I really felt like
I brought a man back to life.</i>

216
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,636
According to the VFW,
this is the place.

217
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,454
I want to thank you, Earl.

218
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:20,141
All I wanted to do was die.
Now look at me.

219
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,018
I got my stuff back,

220
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:24,274
I got my plastic wife to hug,

221
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,523
and now I'm going
to cut this jackass's ear off!

222
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:31,053
I can't thank you enough, Earl.

223
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,964
Did you say
"cut off his ear"?

224
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:39,493
You're going to cut off
your army buddy's ear?

225
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:41,009
That's what the pendant was.

226
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,622
I'd have called it an ear,
but you wouldn't have driven me here.

227
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,292
<i>Ends up,
during the Korean War,</i>

228
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,436
<i>Jerry and his buddy were caught
behind enemy lines</i>

229
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:50,205
<i>when Jerry got wounded.</i>

230
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:54,383
Jerry, we both can't make it.

231
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:55,711
No, don't go!

232
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:58,179
Haven't you seen the movies?
Never leave a man behind.

233
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:01,557
No, but I've seen the ones
where they say, "Go on without me."

234
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,772
Sometimes they even say,
"Marry my best girl!" Sorry!

235
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:08,702
<i>But the only thing Jerry could keep
from leaving was Joe's ear.</i>

236
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,363
Come back here, you coward!

237
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,782
You're a coward!

238
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,243
<i>Jerry got captured,</i>

239
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:22,995
<i>and held onto the ear
as a reminder</i>

240
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:24,762
<i>of how much
he wanted to survive.</i>

241
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:28,966
<i>And as the months passed,
the ear became more than a reminder.</i>

242
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,352
<i>It became a companion.</i>

243
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:33,464
I got four pretty ladies.
What do you got, Joe's ear?

244
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:37,455
Damn, Joe's ear,
you're good.

245
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,784
<i>It continued to be a part of his life
even after the war.</i>

246
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,683
Okay, Isabel,
Joe's ear,

247
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,508
we're off to see the world.

248
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:55,217
- Sorry, I can't let you do this.
- I'm not asking for your permission.

249
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:57,791
That coward left me for dead
for 50 years,

250
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,260
and he never gave it
another thought.

251
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,852
Jerry, give me the knife.

252
00:13:21,373 --> 00:13:22,611
Look out, Joe!

253
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:28,769
- What the hell's going on out here?
- Jerry Burn, he's here for your ear.

254
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,859
I'm here to protect you from him.

255
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,220
Where is he?

256
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:44,398
<i>After I got my voice back,
I told Joe about the RV</i>

257
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:47,121
<i>and finding Jerry half dead,
and what I'd been doing.</i>

258
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:50,662
You idiots.

259
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:53,043
Do you know
what you've done?

260
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,046
You brought a killing machine
back to life.

261
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,708
- You okay?
- Heart pills.

262
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:02,602
Top pocket.

263
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:07,558
Do you ever perchance think of gluing
a seashell to where your ear used to be,

264
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:09,059
so it would look normal?

265
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:12,229
And you'd always get
to hear the ocean.

266
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,074
Yeah, that's my biggest problem,
right now.

267
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:18,694
You guys don't seem to understand
what we're dealing with here.

268
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,452
I saw Jerry kill three Koreans

269
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:24,616
with a single bullet.

270
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,289
No gun.

271
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:29,914
Just pressed the bullet
right into their skulls.

272
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:33,534
I'm calling the cops!

273
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:39,926
He cut the line.

274
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,627
Well, he's not the only
crazy old man around here.

275
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:49,479
- Oh, mother.
- Blimey!

276
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:54,054
Before we panic
and do something we might regret,

277
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:55,662
at least let me talk to Jerry.

278
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:58,234
He seemed reasonable,
except for the throat punch.

279
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:00,532
Okay. Let's see.

280
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,869
Hey, Jerry,
I'm sorry about what hap...

281
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:14,017
Okay, boys, this is it.

282
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,390
Cinch up your apple sacks.

283
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,337
We're going to war.

284
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,958
<i>And I wasn't the only one dealing
with a scary thing in the front yard.</i>

285
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,195
<i>Since the pig didn't die
of natural causes,</i>

286
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:25,761
<i>the county wouldn't haul it away.</i>

287
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,973
I can't believe the county
won't remove dead pigs.

288
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,476
I can't believe nobody answered our ad
for 800 pounds of free pork.

289
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,517
You know what?
Screw it.

290
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,193
I'm going old school.

291
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,029
Oh, my God!

292
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,474
I'm in the pig!

293
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:50,922
Earl, this hat sucks now.
It's got a hole in it.

294
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:54,039
- It looks like a hobo's hat.
- Randy, this really isn't the time.

295
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:56,194
Joe, this is crazy.

296
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:59,391
You don't have to kill each other over
something that happened 40 years ago.

297
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:02,756
Learn your history!
It was 55 years ago.

298
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:04,586
Pin, pin, pin!

299
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:08,254
Nuts, and I'm shaking
like a geisha on sake.

300
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:11,121
It must be the Parkinson's.
You better do it.

301
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:14,280
Earl, we got to go
back to that bus stop,

302
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,163
see if they got another hat
like this one.

303
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:17,863
Randy, I'm defusing a grenade!

304
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:19,547
I can't wear this.
I'll look stupid.

305
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,559
You're gonna look stupid anyway.
It's a stupid hat.

306
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,238
Like all your other hats
are stupid,

307
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,596
'cause when you wear a hat,
you act stupid.

308
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:29,790
- Even the newsie cap?
- Yes, the newsie cap.

309
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:32,077
"Hey, mister, want a paper?

310
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:34,455
"I'll have a sandwich
with extra mayonnaise."

311
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:36,153
I hate all your hats!

312
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:39,168
Will you guys shut up
and put the... put the pin in!

313
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:49,020
I don't believe you two guys.

314
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,305
Arguing over a hat,
a damn hat!

315
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:54,011
I'm going to get killed because
there's a lunatic out there

316
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,867
who's mad as hell because
I left him in the field!

317
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:01,649
I left him... in the field.

318
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,008
My best buddy.

319
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:04,925
He needed my help,

320
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,556
and I left him.

321
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
I left him.

322
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,642
<i>That was the first time
Joe ever said those words out loud,</i>

323
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:14,161
<i>but it'd been in his head
since the day it happened.</i>

324
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,766
<i>He'd gone off to war
hoping to be a hero,</i>

325
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:19,765
<i>but quickly found out
he was just a scared kid.</i>

326
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:27,206
<i>Jerry felt that Joe ran away
and never gave it a second thought,</i>

327
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,954
<i>but Jerry was wrong.</i>

328
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:31,224
<i>Joe thought about it
every day of his life.</i>

329
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,525
<i>Joe, come back here,
you coward!</i>

330
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:36,767
<i>You coward!</i>

331
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,714
When I was given
the choice to save my life

332
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:43,824
or save someone else's,
I chose to save my own.

333
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:46,568
Maybe Jerry deserves
to take the other ear.

334
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,274
Hell, I'd give it to him, too,
if I didn't remember

335
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,240
it hurt so damn much.

336
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,450
How much did it hurt?

337
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,161
About as much as
getting your ear cut off.

338
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:00,082
Oh, God, he's on the roof!

339
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:01,625
Wait, wait, wait.
Joe, wait!

340
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,126
Maybe we should
call an ambulance.

341
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:16,696
Or that.

342
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:20,768
Oh, my God.
You killed his wife!

343
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:23,058
Now he's really
gonna be pissed.

344
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,764
Quick, back in the house!
Come on!

345
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,829
<i>Jerry may have had
the heart of a killer,</i>

346
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:41,148
<i>but that heart
was 75 years old.</i>

347
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:49,339
I think he's having a heart attack.
Randy, go for help.

348
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:52,092
Joe, I need your pills.

349
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,012
Both of you?

350
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:57,388
This should be a lesson
about trying to kill people

351
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:58,682
when you're over 60.

352
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,267
I only got one pill left.

353
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:08,904
What are you doing?

354
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,450
What I shoulda done
50 years ago.

355
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,783
Open your mouth,
you old buzzard.

356
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:20,663
Never leave a man behind.

357
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:27,383
<i>In the end, they both survived.</i>

358
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,007
It's okay.

359
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:32,088
You saved my life,
so we're even.

360
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,047
There's no doubt in my mind.

361
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:40,825
<i>While you can't reattach
a severed ear,</i>

362
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,730
<i>it's never too late
to fix a severed friendship.</i>

363
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:50,576
<i>Losing your temper
can be a good thing.</i>

364
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:53,947
<i>Jerry and Joe had let their bad feelings
sit inside them for years,</i>

365
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,136
<i>rotting like a pig
in a front yard,</i>

366
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:58,634
<i>and it took a fight
to work everything out.</i>

367
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:00,744
<i>The same with me and Randy.</i>

368
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,372
Thanks for telling me
I acted different in hats.

369
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:04,915
I won't do it again.
I promise.

370
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,959
I'm just sorry I yelled at you.

371
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,150
Oh, that's okay.
Brothers fight.

372
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:11,230
Friends cut each other's ears off.

373
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,058
It's a crazy world, Earl.

374
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,122
I guess this is good-bye.

375
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:21,522
It can make anyone look good.

376
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:24,428
<i>I guess, every now and then
when you're stuck,</i>

377
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:27,012
<i>the best way to clear the air
is to have a big blowup.</i>

378
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:28,576
Fire in the hole!

379
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:38,699
