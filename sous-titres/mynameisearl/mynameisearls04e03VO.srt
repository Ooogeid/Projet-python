1
00:00:00,842 --> 00:00:03,757
<i>With gas prizes so high,
you try not to drive too much.</i>

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:07,779
<i>But when Catalina is so late for work
she's gonna have to change in the car,</i>

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:09,435
<i>it's hard to say no.</i>

4
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:14,174
Can you drive a little faster?

5
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:17,606
It's disabled discount day at work,
and the last girl gets stuck with Jed.

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,232
He's paralyzed from the waist down,

7
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,538
so you never know
if you're doing a good job.

8
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:24,531
Sorry, the engine starts coughing
if I go over 40.

9
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:27,697
I think it has something to do with
Randy spitting his gum in the gas tank.

10
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,454
I told him bubbles wouldn't
come out of the exhaust,

11
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:32,911
but sometimes he has to
not see things to believe them.

12
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:37,719
Is that a hot tub?

13
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,822
<i>A used hot tub
laying on the side of the road</i>

14
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:42,406
<i>may not seem like something
to be excited about,</i>

15
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,798
<i>but there was
someone on my list I owed one to.</i>

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,559
<i>Number 72:
cost Joy a hot tub.</i>

17
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:55,239
Hey, baby.

18
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,070
Wakey, wakey.

19
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,639
Hands on snakey.

20
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,176
No morning bang today.
Got a job doing some spokesmodeling

21
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,150
at the Camden Barbecue
and Hot Tub Convention.

22
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:06,152
Barbe-Tub-a-Con is today?

23
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,446
How about a quick one
before you go?

24
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:10,406
You know I can't resist you

25
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:12,742
when your hair's all classy
and up high like that.

26
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:13,897
I know.

27
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:17,068
When I see myself looking this good,
I get horny, too.

28
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,124
But I don't want to be late.

29
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:21,459
Did I tell you they're paying me
with a free hot tub?

30
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:22,670
Seriously?

31
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,913
So just hold on to your stiffy,
and when I get back,

32
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,425
we'll fill that thing up
and do it fishy style.

33
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:40,176
Randy, come in here.
We look like cartoons.

34
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:43,732
JOY IN A BUBBLE

35
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:46,776
<i>Catalina was nice enough
to help me with a list item:</i>

36
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:48,528
<i>getting a hot tub for Joy.</i>

37
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,538
All right,
let's try lifting it again.

38
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:53,658
This time, I'll try not to fart,
you make sure your top doesn't fall of.

39
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:55,660
Ready?

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,626
Go.

41
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:01,040
Does anybody knock
around here anymore?

42
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:02,243
Sorry.

43
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:04,085
We didn't know
somebody lived here.

44
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:06,877
It's an upside down hot tub
laying on the side of the road.

45
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,757
Of course,
somebody's living in here.

46
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,010
<i>Homeless Joe drove a hard bargain.</i>

47
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:14,811
<i>He traded the hot tub to us
for a bar of deodorant</i>

48
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,248
<i>that he promptly ate.</i>

49
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:18,976
<i>It was the most exciting thing
to come through the trailer park</i>

50
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:22,196
<i>since Mr. Henson tried to teach
his pet monkey to drive stick.</i>

51
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:30,379
Sweet Baby Jesus...

52
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,449
My whole body's relaxed.

53
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:51,150
Earl, for the first time ever,

54
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,353
you have satisfied me
in a way Darnell never could.

55
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:55,782
Go, Earl.

56
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:58,097
Guess that means
I can cross you off my list.

57
00:02:58,493 --> 00:02:59,466
For sure.

58
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:01,196
And the timing is perfect.

59
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:03,260
I've been having
to soak my ingrown toenail

60
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,886
in an old Cool Whip container.

61
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:07,232
Which means Mr. Turtle gets
his swimming pool back.

62
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:08,733
He'll be thrilled.

63
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:11,371
He can't really stretch out
in the Country Crock tub.

64
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,779
Darnell, get in here.

65
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,058
There's a bubble jet
in a place I know you're gonna like.

66
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:19,617
No, thanks.
I boil animals to death all day long.

67
00:03:19,737 --> 00:03:20,672
If I get in,

68
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,872
God may strike me down
just for the irony of it.

69
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,749
My Uncle Thorogood,
the fisherman,

70
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:27,043
choked to death
at a sushi restaurant.

71
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,144
Big Man's got a sense of humor.

72
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:40,974
<i>Joy loved her hot tub so much,</i>

73
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:42,708
<i>she swore she'd never leave it.</i>

74
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,758
<i>And unlike most of her promises,</i>

75
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:46,938
<i>she had already kept
this one for 24 hours.</i>

76
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:50,525
Baby, you sat in that thing all night.
You ever coming out?

77
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:54,123
I expect around noon
I'm gonna need to go buy another 40.

78
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:56,906
Unless you want to send Dodge
to the liquor store with a note again.

79
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,491
You want to put these on?

80
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,327
Gina says the loud music
is making her baby cry.

81
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:04,784
I already put my top back on.
Now you want me to wear headphones?

82
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:06,684
I don't care
what these neighbors think.

83
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:08,949
She's a dumbass
that sold her Pontiac

84
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:12,130
to pay for the in vitro!
Now she's living with the consequences!

85
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:16,537
I don't complain about how loud
that baby's dialysis machine is.

86
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,137
How many signs do you need
that something ain't meant to be?

87
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,723
I wish you could see
your foot from up here.

88
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:23,600
The way the light
is hitting the water,

89
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,982
it makes you look
like you've got a giant toe.

90
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:28,073
I can see it from here.

91
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:29,672
That is funny.

92
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,697
Watch this.
Big toe,

93
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,481
regular...

94
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:42,201
Looks like your toe's infected.

95
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:44,162
So what,
drink a little cranberry juice?

96
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:47,832
Mrs. Turner, you have a very contagious,
flesh-eating staph infection.

97
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:48,895
What?

98
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:51,044
God, I helped you squeeze
your flip-flop on.

99
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:52,712
How the hell did I get that?

100
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:55,882
Darnell, if this is some kind of mad
crab disease, I'm gonna kill you.

101
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:57,383
It's not shellfish-related.

102
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:00,929
I've only seen one case in Camden.
It was in a homeless man.

103
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:04,842
The closest I ever come to the homeless
is buying those videos where they fight.

104
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:06,704
I mean,
I like to be charitable,

105
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:08,951
but I don't want
to just hand them the money.

106
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:11,319
The patient was
a gentleman named Joe,

107
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,608
and he lives out on Route 4
in an old hot tub.

108
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:17,936
Earl, you son of a bitch.

109
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:21,351
Sorry, I didn't know
he was infected.

110
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,034
He seemed like
he was into hygiene.

111
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,078
He had a soup can
full of toothbrushes.

112
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,538
But to be fair,
it was also full of soup.

113
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:29,791
Look what you did.

114
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:33,294
Hell, yeah, "Oh."

115
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,158
Wow, looks like one
of them fancy hot dogs

116
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:38,118
that plumps in the micro oven.

117
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:44,612
You are paying for my doctor bills,
my pedicure bills and my pill bills.

118
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:45,855
And no generics...

119
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:48,434
I want top-shelf meds
like the kind that celebrities OD on.

120
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:50,623
Listen, Joy,
whatever you need, I'll do.

121
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,146
Maybe I could come over...

122
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:56,067
You stay the hell away from me.
All I want to see is your money.

123
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,505
Did someone spill milk
on the floor?

124
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,754
Oh, man.

125
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,107
Popped again.

126
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,405
<i>Darnell had spent time working
with something he called bioweaponry,</i>

127
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,539
<i>so he knew
to take infection seriously.</i>

128
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,043
Can I come in now?

129
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:15,644
Ready.

130
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:20,426
What the hell is all this?

131
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,065
You keep to the foil.

132
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:25,179
The boys, myself and Mr. Turtle
will walk on the regular carpet.

133
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:27,811
Did you have to put it
shiny side up?

134
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:30,643
Now I got to wear my underwear
when the boys are home.

135
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:37,650
Man, what a day.

136
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:40,933
I've been looking forward

137
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:42,541
to getting into bed

138
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,224
and forgetting
about this stupid foot

139
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:46,743
for the next 14 hours.

140
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,873
What the hell?

141
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,703
It gets chilly in here.

142
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,545
Plus, one of us has
to stay alive for the kids.

143
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:07,847
You happy?
Put a bag on it,

144
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,850
so now you don't have to worry
about anybody else catching this.

145
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,326
Yeah, 'cause what germ
could make it past

146
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,313
a produce bag
and electrical tape?

147
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:20,095
You're uncomfortable
even touching me, aren't you?

148
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,368
You know what?
I'm gonna go make some ice tea.

149
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,184
What are you doing in there?

150
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:49,326
Are you boiling your clothes?

151
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:51,377
I'm making ice tea.

152
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:53,413
Lord love a duck, Darnell.

153
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,395
I'm wearing a bag.

154
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:57,258
I'm walking on foil.

155
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:58,951
I'm glazed up in Purell

156
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:00,766
like a damn Christmas ham.

157
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:04,654
What do I have to do to not feel
like a filthy leper in my own house?

158
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:13,375
Bring me Earl Hickey!

159
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,027
Not too shabby.

160
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,257
It's like you're living
in a snow globe,

161
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:21,129
but in the summer,
'cause there's no snow,

162
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:23,561
which is good because...

163
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:27,442
Since I'm kind of stuck here,

164
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:30,032
would you kick Earl
in the side of the knee for me?

165
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,430
Joy, I feel terrible...

166
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,306
Sorry, Earl.
I got to appease her,

167
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:38,132
or she'll break out of that thing
like a tiny pink hawk.

168
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:41,027
Anyway, I got to go to work.
Good-bye, baby.

169
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:42,329
Bye.

170
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:52,349
I feel terrible.

171
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:54,574
Stuck-in-a-bubble-
with-a-flesh-eating-disease terrible

172
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:56,330
or just a little case of the blues?

173
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,643
The second one.

174
00:08:57,763 --> 00:09:00,585
But I'm ready to make it up to you,
if there's anything you can think of...

175
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:02,134
Oh, I've been thinking.

176
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:04,321
You're not the only one
that can make a list.

177
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:08,551
These are the things that I do all week,
but can't since I'm stuck.

178
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:12,349
You've deprived me of my freedom,
and deprived the world of me,

179
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,162
so until I'm free,

180
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:15,512
you gotta be me.

181
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:19,648
<i>I never thought of Joy
as someone who has a to-do list,</i>

182
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,106
<i>but it turns out
she was a pretty busy lady.</i>

183
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:24,041
<i>At 3:00 every Tuesday,</i>

184
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:27,232
<i>she'd go buy meat out
of the trunk of some guy's car.</i>

185
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:29,255
What part of the animal is this?

186
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:31,742
I don't even know
what animal it's from.

187
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,164
<i>On Wednesday,
she'd spend four hours at the salon</i>

188
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,533
<i>just to catch up
on the latest gossip.</i>

189
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,164
And I couldn't quite hear this part,

190
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:52,511
but Fran said her babysitter is
addicted to hooch, pooch, or cooch.

191
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,118
That sitter's a crazy slut,
so it could have been all three.

192
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:01,683
<i>And, always one to hold a grudge,</i>

193
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:04,833
<i>every Thursday she'd track down
the local ice cream man.</i>

194
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:08,440
<i>Don't buy ice cream from this man.
He's a cheat.</i>

195
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:10,252
<i>If you ask for a Rocket Pop,</i>

196
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:13,731
<i>he'll charge you for a Double Rocket Pop
and say it's an accident.</i>

197
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:14,905
<i>It's a scam.</i>

198
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:17,950
She really does this every week?

199
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:22,472
<i>But it wasn't just Joy
I learned things about.</i>

200
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:24,481
<i>Spending so much time
with the Turners, </i>

201
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:27,104
<i>I discovered stuff
about the whole family.</i>

202
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:29,865
<i>Like the fact
that Darnell gets migraines.</i>

203
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,811
Two boys,

204
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:33,437
a demanding job,

205
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,589
making $2.95 an hour...

206
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:38,557
these are the things
that weigh heavily on the Crab Man.

207
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,979
Earl, I'm done with my shower.
Bring me some clothes and new hair.

208
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,276
Go ahead.

209
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,279
If you don't
and she starts yelling,

210
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,069
all your rubbing is for naught.

211
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:56,007
<i>And the most important thing
I learned was</i>

212
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,581
<i>that Dodge and Earl Jr. were the ones
with the biggest problem in the family.</i>

213
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,622
Tomorrow
the boys get out of school early,

214
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:03,374
so you need
to hang out with them.

215
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:05,782
I usually take them
to the arcade or something,

216
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:08,638
- since they don't have any friends.
- No friends?

217
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:09,909
Are you sure?

218
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,565
Yesterday, Dodge said
him and his friend, Roger,

219
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:15,176
played dress-up
and made funny faces at each other.

220
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:17,497
Roger's what he named his wiener.

221
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,441
That's sad that the boys
don't have any friends.

222
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,618
There's a man downstairs
who's friends with lots of young boys.

223
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,399
We should introduce them.

224
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:31,827
I do wish
there was something I could do.

225
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:35,323
What'd you do that year in junior high
when you couldn't make any friends?

226
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:38,409
Mom got me deodorant.
And then I met Bill.

227
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,328
Bill was imaginary.

228
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,413
But our friendship was real.

229
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:45,265
And didn't Bill
eventually move to Canada?

230
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,999
That wasn't his fault.
His dad got transferred.

231
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:51,021
Then his parents got divorced,

232
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:52,747
and Bill started drinking.

233
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,925
I had to pull myself
out of that situation.

234
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,639
<i>I went to pick up
Dodge and Earl Jr.,</i>

235
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,318
<i>prepared to do anything
to help them get friends.</i>

236
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:04,560
See you at the party!

237
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,480
Everyone's going to be there.
See you at the party.

238
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:12,276
- What the hell?
- See you at the party.

239
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:15,529
Wait in the car.
And put this on.

240
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,324
I don't know what's going on,

241
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:21,065
but if this is just a B.O. problem,
I've got it covered.

242
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:23,290
- Excuse me?
- Dodge and Earl Jr.,

243
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,521
they should be able
to come to your party.

244
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,000
- Who are you?
- I'm their mother's ex-husband.

245
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:29,875
Oh, her ex.

246
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:31,608
Well, then you know...

247
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:32,880
I'm Phyllis Woo Hoo.

248
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:35,329
We've had some issues with Joy.

249
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:39,519
<i>Turns out the boys
weren't the problem at all.</i>

250
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,388
Damn, this punch is better than sex.
What's in it?

251
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:44,809
I'm gonna need a cigarette.

252
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:46,352
I need a cigarette.

253
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,770
Better than sex.

254
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:48,839
Damn!

255
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:53,246
<i>Over the years,
she made quite a name for herself.</i>

256
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:54,880
Now that's how you get popular.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,422
Once your boobies grow in,
that's gonna look good.

258
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,282
Just don't let that ass
get any bigger.

259
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:05,595
<i>And while some parents wanted
to give Joy a chance to change,</i>

260
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:06,796
<i>she didn't.</i>

261
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,376
Mom, check out these really cool
water balloons that won't pop!

262
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,838
They'll pop. If they didn't,
you wouldn't have those two playmates.

263
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:16,729
They got into my nightstand.

264
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:19,460
You should've seen them
playing with the lubricated ones.

265
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,080
Looked like
they were wrestling a greased pig.

266
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:26,725
Those boys are fine.
It's Joy that's the problem.

267
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:29,420
Joy won't be a problem right now.

268
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,939
She's stuck in a bubble,
'cause she has a contagious infection.

269
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,513
'Bout time she got a real disease.

270
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:37,738
She comes down with cancer every time
we need parents for a field trip.

271
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,406
The first couple of times,
we raised money for her.

272
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:44,707
Makes you feel any better, I think
she bought cigarettes with that money.

273
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:50,624
As long as Joy's out of the picture,
here's directions for Dennis' party.

274
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,033
Well, this sounds fantastic.

275
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:55,588
And I'll still put the deodorant
on them just in case.

276
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,882
You're not going to tell Joy
what I said about her?

277
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:00,579
You see this?

278
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:04,112
She pierced it with a kebab after
I complained the steak was too dry.

279
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,932
I wore a hoop for a while,
but it made me a little too cocky.

280
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,954
Anyway,
I've learned to keep my mouth shut.

281
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,100
I got your shoes fixed.

282
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,164
The repair guy said to tell you
to quit kicking so many things.

283
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,025
My <i>Jessica Simpsons</i>.

284
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,296
You see what you're missing?

285
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,284
You would look
so good in these.

286
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:27,590
That's right, foot.

287
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,382
You think about that
the next time you want to get infected.

288
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,000
The boys?

289
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,221
At the park
for Dennis' birthday party.

290
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,416
Dennis who?

291
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,020
Dennis Woo Hoo?

292
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:41,075
I think we were wrong
about how unpopular the boys are.

293
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:42,655
They've got friends.

294
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:46,055
Earl, I know my kids.
They never get invited to anything.

295
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:47,484
This got to be a prank.

296
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:51,048
You invite some loser to your party,
you tie him up and throw dog poo on him.

297
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:53,166
I mean, that's hilarious,
but not if it's my kids.

298
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:55,410
- Go get them.
- Joy, it's not a prank.

299
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,565
Kids like them.

300
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,484
Earl Jr. has cool hair

301
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,861
and Dodge does wiener tricks.
Just let them have fun.

302
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,096
They're not gonna have fun
because kids don't like 'em!

303
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:05,449
If you won't go, I will.

304
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:07,493
Joy, trust me.
Just leave it alone.

305
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,098
Trust the guy who used
to leave Dodge at Doggie Day Care

306
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,956
so he could go drinking?
I don't think so.

307
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:13,567
I'm going to get my boys.

308
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,876
Damn it, Joy.
It's not the kids. It's you.

309
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:18,837
People just don't like you.

310
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,506
Says who?

311
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:21,966
Phyllis Woo Hoo.

312
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,583
She says that you make
the other moms uncomfortable.

313
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:27,429
You act trashy and wild.
People don't want to be around you.

314
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,583
Don't beat yourself up over this.

315
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:37,154
Some people...

316
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:47,099
<i>It was the worst-case scenario.</i>

317
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:50,352
<i>I'd unleashed a tiny pink Hulk
to go infect the world.</i>

318
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,131
<i>I knew where she was going.</i>

319
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,716
<i>I knew I had to stop her.</i>

320
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,756
- Don't do it!
- Oh, it's gonna be did!

321
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,261
What the hell are you doing?

322
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,096
Slow down!

323
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,073
You got a dangerous disease!

324
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,155
Innocent people...

325
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,466
<i>Joy couldn't wait
to get to Phyllis Woo Hoo.</i>

326
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,007
<i>She had a lot of big plans
in store for her.</i>

327
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:40,002
What's up, PTA hoes?

328
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:43,128
Looks like I saved you
the trouble of unwrapping these.

329
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:44,495
You're welcome.

330
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,893
Who wants a piece of me?!
You?

331
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:52,476
You, Woo Hoo?

332
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,305
Who wants?

333
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:09,448
Go on! Lick it!

334
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:11,097
Lick the toe!

335
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,204
Come on, Phyllis.
Don't cry.

336
00:17:15,324 --> 00:17:17,667
This ain't the worst thing
you ever had in your mouth.

337
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,335
<i>Joy had horrible thoughts
in her head.</i>

338
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,921
<i>And those same thoughts
were going through mine.</i>

339
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,734
Don't do it!

340
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:31,989
Don't do what?

341
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,841
Don't, uh...

342
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,616
forget to make a wish.

343
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:40,846
I wish I was a girl!

344
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:51,318
You run like a fairy.

345
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:07,297
I'm not afraid of those bitches.

346
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:10,509
I'll make a scene up in their faces.
I don't care what they think of me.

347
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,726
I know, Joy.

348
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:22,716
It's not fair that they're gonna let
some opinions they may have about me

349
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,297
victimize my children.

350
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,770
It's just not fair.

351
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:28,610
Nope, it's not.

352
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:36,558
You know, there's a lot of times

353
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:38,787
when my big personality
is good for my children.

354
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:40,993
Like when we were late
to the movie,

355
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:44,289
I scared the projectionist, he replayed
the first 20 minutes of <i>Ratatouille</i>.

356
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:45,615
They love that.

357
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:50,036
Here!

358
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:51,649
Over here!

359
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,432
You think I'm a bad mom?

360
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,695
If you were a bad mom,
you wouldn't be sitting in this car

361
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:06,425
letting the boys enjoy
a party with their friends.

362
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:14,963
Thanks.

363
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:35,357
You may want
to wipe off the gas pedal.

364
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,448
I was toeing it pretty good.

365
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:45,283
What's so funny?

366
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:46,240
Nothing.

367
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,509
Just something
Bill said the other day.

368
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:50,433
Your imaginary friend, Bill?

369
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:54,266
You were spending so much time with Joy
'cause her toe got sick,

370
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:55,734
that I reconnected with him.

371
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:58,760
He's working at a gas station
and he's about to get married.

372
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,536
- Good for him.
- I hope.

373
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:03,836
His fiancee has kids,
so there's baggage.

374
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,113
Plus, I'm pretty sure
he's drinking again.

375
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,895
You know, Randy,
since Bill's imaginary,

376
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:10,921
you could imagine him sober
if you wanted.

377
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,747
If only it were that easy, Earl.
It's not enough for me to want it,

378
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:17,803
Bill's got to want
to be sober for himself.

379
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:21,851
Good night, Randy.

380
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,553
Good night, Earl.

381
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:25,924
