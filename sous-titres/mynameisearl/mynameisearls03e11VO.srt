00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,538
Earl, you just crossed off
June and July of next year.

4
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:16,297
Are those months not happening anymore?

5
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:18,741
I don't mind, it's just
I need to move some stuff around.

6
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:22,348
I'm just figuring out how much time
the warden is taking off my sentence.

7
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,574
<i>For a few months now, every time
I solved a problem for the warden,</i>

8
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:29,014
<i>he gave me a certificate worth
a week or two off my time in prison.</i>

9
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:32,016
<i>I helped the leaders of violent
gangs learn to get along...</i>

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
<i>really well.</i>

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,229
<i>I captured an escaped prisoner...</i>

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,695
<i>with a little help from Randy
and a high-ranking canine officer.</i>

13
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,953
<i>I even cleaned all the hair out
from the prison showers.</i>

14
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:51,093
<i>Pretty soon I'd gotten all
but six months taken off my sentence,</i>

15
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:52,587
<i>and lucky for me,</i>

16
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:56,241
<i>the warden was one of those people
who never seemed to run out of problems.</i>

17
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,927
Thank God, you're here.
I'm totally screwed.

18
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:02,911
You could just open the safe again.

19
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:04,085
What?

20
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:07,150
No, not this. I do this all the time.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,700
No, I was at this press conference,

22
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:15,235
and this really tricky reporter
tricked me with his tricky trickiness.

23
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:19,894
... continues my commitment
to statewide education reform.

24
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:22,125
Yes, Andy?

25
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,051
Governor, I actually have
a question for your husband.

26
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:38,019
Thank you.

27
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,612
Wait, Warden Hazelwood.

28
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,774
Many of your programs have failed.

29
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,576
What do you plan to do
to turn around this dismal record?

30
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:49,769
Well, I have what I call
the "Super Duper Super Program."

31
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,635
I don't want to go
into all the details now,

32
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:54,713
but I gotta tell you, it's pretty great.

33
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,328
At Quinland penitentiary, the warden
has instituted a reconciliation program,

34
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:02,016
where criminals and their victims
meet face-to-face.

35
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,261
To fight...
Two man enter, one man leaves.

36
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:06,734
Yes, we're doing it.

37
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:10,438
Not to fight, Jerry, to reconcile.

38
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:12,674
Yes, we have that, too.

39
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,275
They have a choice, naturally.

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,765
We try to steer them towards making up.

41
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,450
So, any more questions?

42
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:24,413
I have no idea how to do this.

43
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,854
Earl, you got six months
and ten days left in here.

44
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:29,628
Now, you make this program work,

45
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:33,633
and I will give you a certificate
for six months off your sentence.

46
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:35,166
Six months?

47
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:36,651
I'll do it!

48
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:39,705
Then I'll only need
a certificate worth ten days,

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,362
which maybe I can get by...

50
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,881
making you
my world-famous cheese omelet.

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,860
It does sound good.

52
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:49,872
We'll talk.

53
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:53,665
<i>I liked the idea of helping a prisoner
make up for something bad he did,</i>

54
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:55,713
<i>since that's what I do with my list.</i>

55
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:58,273
<i>All I had to do now
was find the right guy.</i>

56
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:02,351
Sure are a lot of people
in here for aggravated assault.

57
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,725
Isn't everybody who commits
assault kind of aggravated?

58
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,912
Not necessarily.

59
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,244
Remember when I hugged
that baby duck to death?

60
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,194
That was fun until it was sad.

61
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:14,959
When you get free, we're gonna go back
to that lake and just do the fun part.

62
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,335
This guy could work.

63
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:21,490
John Clevenger.

64
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,933
<i>I'd heard about John.</i>

65
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:29,540
<i>He was the sensitive, artistic type,
and a first-time offender.</i>

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,162
<i>He was in prison
for burning down his parents' house</i>

67
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:40,811
<i>when his meth lab caught fire.</i>

68
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,215
- Are you John the artist?
- Cool,

69
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:04,173
I'm glad that name caught on.
I started that a couple weeks ago.

70
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:05,690
Oh, good for you.

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,396
I've been pushing for Duke of Earl,
but it won't stick.

72
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,864
Even with the song?

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,176
There's a song?

74
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,002
Hey, that's mine!

75
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,763
You're not supposed
to have pudding in your cell.

76
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,129
You got anything else
you're not supposed to have?

77
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,631
Maybe something salty?

78
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,993
Listen, I'm here to talk
about what happened with your parents.

79
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:24,904
That fire was an accident.

80
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:26,537
Clearly.

81
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:29,749
No one makes meth
with anything but the best intentions.

82
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,905
How would you feel about a program

83
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,319
where you could sit down
with your parents and talk?

84
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:35,925
Really hash things out.

85
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:39,383
And, hopefully, it would lead
to an apology and a big hug.

86
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:45,390
I can't imagine they want to do that,
but if they're up for it, I'm in.

87
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,626
Great.

88
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,562
<i>Since I couldn't go myself,</i>

89
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:52,689
<i>I asked Joy to meet with John's parents
and convince them to come see their son.</i>

90
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:55,905
Look, I understand you're feeling weird
about meeting with your son.

91
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,739
I mean, everybody hates meth heads.
That's like a 100 percenter.

92
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,705
On the other hand,

93
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,345
he is your son.

94
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,609
I just don't think meeting with John
is such a good idea.

95
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,509
He was a very sweet boy...

96
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:10,162
but he changed.

97
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:12,786
Hell, everybody changes.
Changed how?

98
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:14,236
Well John was little,

99
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:17,799
he didn't burn down the house
and destroy everything we own.

100
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:19,685
So, that was different.

101
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:23,778
Mr. and Mrs. Clevenger, I think
I know what you're going through.

102
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:26,799
Last year,

103
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:30,434
Mr. Turtle knocked over a candle
in our trailer and started a fire.

104
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:32,630
To this day,

105
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,653
I don't know if it was an accident

106
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:38,024
or the result of
pent-up turtle hostilities of some kind.

107
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,441
Our relationship was very strained
the next few months.

108
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,947
We couldn't even be in the same room.

109
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,162
Usually, I'd leave
because it was quicker.

110
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,501
I thought this... was over.

111
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,344
I think we both did.

112
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,344
But, eventually, we sat down
and faced our problems head-on.

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,252
That's right.

114
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:00,288
I'm not going to lie to you.

115
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:03,056
It wasn't easy.
But we got through it.

116
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:06,776
And now,
our relationship is stronger than ever.

117
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,004
And he seems more careful, too.

118
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,237
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:14,137
I have something in my eye.

120
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:18,296
Thank you.

121
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,648
We'll do it.

122
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,354
We'll go meet with John.

123
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,574
Nice work, Darnell.

124
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,777
Thanks.

125
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:29,661
I hope that wasn't too awkward for you.

126
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:31,548
<i>It was a big day.</i>

127
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:33,926
<i>John was going
to make up with his parents,</i>

128
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:37,288
<i>and I was going to get my certificate
for six months off my sentence.</i>

129
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,515
Earl, if I wanted uncomfortable silence,

130
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,769
I would have made
a lunch date with my wife.

131
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,098
A little awkwardness
is completely normal.

132
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,818
So far,
this is a classic reconciliation.

133
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,493
Just say whatever's in your heart.

134
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,871
Me?

135
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:12,078
If they're here to apologize,
shouldn't they go first?

136
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:13,773
What?

137
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:15,062
What are you doing?

138
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,302
You said we're here for an apology.

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,981
Yeah, from you. You're the one
who's supposed to be sorry.

140
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,334
But it was their fault.

141
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:22,524
Our fault?

142
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,864
You burned down our house.

143
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,882
You left your mother
smoldering and hairless.

144
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:28,965
That fire was the only time

145
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,921
there was any warmth in that house,
you cold-hearted bastards.

146
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,329
You should thank me.

147
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,334
Earl, on three,
we both fake heart attacks.

148
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:38,579
John, these are your parents.

149
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:41,067
They wouldn't have come here
if they didn't love you.

150
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:43,294
You are a monster!

151
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,724
And whose fault
do you think that is, huh?

152
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,280
I'm a monster because
you ignored me my whole life.

153
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,368
The most time we ever spent together

154
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:53,913
was the six weeks of my trial,
and you wouldn't even look at me!

155
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:56,045
My eyes were bandaged!

156
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:00,352
Like you couldn't pull up
a little corner and give me a peek?

157
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:01,323
Cow!

158
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,069
How could you?!

159
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,664
Don't talk to me
while i'm waiting for the door!

160
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,020
Earl, this is a disaster.

161
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,390
You got a week to fix this.

162
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,153
This couldn't have gone better.

163
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:16,529
They're really doing the work,
as my marriage counselor likes to say.

164
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:19,433
You and the governor
are in marriage counseling?

165
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:20,899
Don't tell anybody.

166
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:24,152
She's pretty sensitive about it,
partly because of her sex addiction.

167
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,697
The governor has a sex addiction?

168
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:29,829
How do you know all this stuff?

169
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:36,271
<i>The only way I was gonna get
the last 6 months taken off my sentence</i>

170
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:38,854
<i>was if I could get John
to make up with his parents,</i>

171
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:41,711
<i>but John was having trouble
getting with the program.</i>

172
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,060
Hey, buddy.

173
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:46,782
- Crazy stuff in there, huh?
- I know.

174
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:49,879
Can you believe my parents
expected me to apologize to them?

175
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:54,840
See, here's the thing, everybody
expected you to apologize to them.

176
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:56,606
Hey, it's not my fault.

177
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:59,217
It's my parents
for being such monsters my whole life.

178
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,976
They wouldn't let me have
a color tv in my room.

179
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:03,493
They never got me cargo pants.

180
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:05,707
They wouldn't even let me go to my prom,

181
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,900
because they said
I was too stoned to drive.

182
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:09,737
As if that's possible.

183
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:12,840
John, this is my freedom
we are talking about.

184
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:16,043
I don't need you to be sorry,
I just need you to say you're sorry.

185
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,990
It's two totally different things.

186
00:09:18,578 --> 00:09:21,120
If you want me to do
something big like that,

187
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,004
I want something big in return.

188
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,916
How about an aircraft carrier?
They're big.

189
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:27,542
I want a prom.

190
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:31,649
I want to go to a prom,
I always think about missing mine,

191
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:33,300
and I know I would have had a date,

192
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,532
because we lost the entire football team
in a bus accident that year.

193
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:40,371
We can do a prom in prison,
where are you going to get the girls?

194
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:43,159
We only have
five trannies to dance with,

195
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,086
and they're all spoken for.

196
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,408
Fine! Then I want
to drive an aircraft carrier.

197
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:48,668
Done!

198
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:53,401
I don't even know who to call
to get an aircraft carrier.

199
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:56,876
- Isn't your wife the governor?
- The state doesn't have a navy, Earl.

200
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:00,389
If we can't get him an aircraft carrier,
we've got to throw him a prom.

201
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,724
Prom?

202
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,134
A prison prom?

203
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:05,953
I know, it's crazy, isn't it?

204
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:08,154
Yeah, it's crazy.

205
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:14,095
But I just looked like a jackass
in front of the press.

206
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:18,455
And it's time to show them
that Jerry Hazelwood is no fool.

207
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:24,144
So, let's get some women behind
these bars and have ourselves a prom.

208
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:29,861
<i>Normally getting 50 women into
a men's prison would have been tricky.</i>

209
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:33,826
<i>But luckily, the warden had stolen
some of his wife's governor stationery.</i>

210
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:38,639
<i>Attention. By order of the governor,
this coming saturday,</i>

211
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:42,390
<i>you will all be traveling
to the men's prison to attend a prom.</i>

212
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:50,006
<i>I needed help if I was going
to throw a successful prom.</i>

213
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,268
<i>So I got someone who started going
to them when she was 12.</i>

214
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:55,742
I think my favorite prom
was my fourth one.

215
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:58,282
Six of us piled up
in the back of that limo.

216
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,846
That was one hell of a basketball team.

217
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,500
They went to state that year.

218
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:05,121
The first thing I think we need
is a theme, right?

219
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,923
Oh, yeah,
a theme unifies all your elements.

220
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:10,285
How about that one?

221
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,461
Underwater wonderland, that's awesome.

222
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,696
Plus, my hair looks really good
when it's wet.

223
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,691
It looks kind of expensive.

224
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:18,987
Is that a whale

225
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,998
with a chocolate fountain blowhole?

226
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:23,103
- You got money.
- He's got money?

227
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,261
Yeah, he won the lottery.
Didn't he tell you?

228
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:28,664
He's got $24,612.17 left,

229
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:29,962
minus $400.

230
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:32,690
The kids' school was selling candy
and you went a little crazy.

231
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:35,702
We could throw
a pretty awesome prom for $24,000.

232
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:39,011
- Wait, wait, wait a second.
- Oh, snap.

233
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,584
A nine-foot-tall purple seaweed arch
trimmed in platinum coral.

234
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,041
It's the gateway to a magical universe.

235
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:47,936
<i>Things were adding up fast.</i>

236
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:51,555
<i>But then I thought about how much
I'd enjoy being out of prison.</i>

237
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:55,037
<i>It was the little things about life
on the outside I missed the most.</i>

238
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,675
<i>Like sleeping in my warm bed next
to my warm brother.</i>

239
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:00,735
<i>Having the freedom to wear
something different every day.</i>

240
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,299
<i>Feeling the wind in my hair...</i>

241
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:09,745
<i>grass...</i>

242
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:13,229
<i>and just enjoying time with my friends.</i>

243
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,621
<i>So there it was.</i>

244
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:18,933
<i>Giving john what he wanted
was going to cost me every dime I had.</i>

245
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:23,545
<i>But I wasn't just buying a prison prom,
I was buying six months of my life back.</i>

246
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:26,726
Okay, fine. Let's do it.

247
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:30,041
I haven't written a check in a while.

248
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,542
What do I put in this memo section?

249
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,346
You're supposed to put something
to remind you what it was for.

250
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:37,998
But I usually just write
"Suck it, gas company."

251
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:40,669
I'd never forget
what this check was for,

252
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,876
but I wanted to write it down anyway.

253
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,834
I can't believe this.

254
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:52,253
I made a prom in prison happen.

255
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,757
I bet this is what it feels like
to be Oprah.

256
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,251
<i>Finally, the big night had come.</i>

257
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:06,893
<i>Even though no one actually
got to choose their date,</i>

258
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,330
<i>everyone seemed happy
to have some new company.</i>

259
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,183
<i>Including me.</i>

260
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:18,930
<i>Depending on who you asked,
my date, Tanani, was either in prison</i>

261
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,426
<i>for protesting the oppressive treatment
of native americans, </i>

262
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,974
<i>or for stabbing her boss
at the company picnic.</i>

263
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:26,688
<i>It may have taken all my money,</i>

264
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,430
<i>but it really was turning out
to be a magical night.</i>

265
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,888
<i>And splurging on the food
really paid off.</i>

266
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,829
This food is awesome, Earl, thanks.

267
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,786
People seem to be enjoying it.

268
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,224
How come
there's no white chocolate fountain?

269
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:43,614
Good man.

270
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:56,915
<i>Everybody was having a blast,
especially me.</i>

271
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:05,777
<i>Because it wasn't just a prom,
it was my getting out of jail party.</i>

272
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,663
<i>And then something happened
that made a sweet night even sweeter.</i>

273
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:26,783
We crown Earl Hickey as prom king

274
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:29,758
because he is responsible
for this entire evening,

275
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:32,755
including getting me
this awesome outfit.

276
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:38,178
<i>I never thought being prom king
would mean so much,</i>

277
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,880
<i>mostly because I didn't know
proms had kings.</i>

278
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:43,215
<i>Well, now that I knew it, it felt great.</i>

279
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:45,593
Thank you, fellow creatures of the sea.

280
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:52,391
<i>Then I realized this crown
would mean even more to someone else.</i>

281
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:58,583
But you know who we should really
be thanking for all of this?

282
00:14:58,923 --> 00:14:59,797
Jesus?

283
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,884
Well, okay, but I was thinking
of someone a little more on our level.

284
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:05,085
The pope?

285
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:07,640
Okay, church guy, stop answering.

286
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:09,349
I'm just going to tell you.

287
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,809
- It's John.
- John the baptist?

288
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:13,504
No, John the artist.

289
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:15,623
He's the real prom king.

290
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,889
Without him,
none of this would har happened.

291
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:35,873
<i>Sure, john was prickly andemanding,</i>

292
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:39,674
<i>but underneath that he was a sad kid
who had missed out on a lot in life.</i>

293
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,840
<i>And I was glad to give some of it back.</i>

294
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:46,247
<i>Especially since I was getting
six months of my own life back, too.</i>

295
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:49,077
Thank you...
for giving this another chance.

296
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,544
Things are going to be
a little different this time.

297
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:54,608
Oh, there they are, Mr. and Mrs. Hitler.

298
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,306
Go back to communist Russia.

299
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:02,263
You're a terrible son and
you know nothing about history.

300
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:05,982
I got elected prom king. I'm the king,
everybody loves me except for you,

301
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:09,318
because you're both fat failures
who don't know how to love.

302
00:16:09,564 --> 00:16:10,603
How dare you!

303
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:14,852
What the hell was that?

304
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:17,408
You promised me you were going
to make up with your parents.

305
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:20,116
What do you want from me?
I saw them again and I went off.

306
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:23,546
We had a deal.
I spent every dime I had on you.

307
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,560
And all I have for it
are pictures of me

308
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,043
and a short chick
who didn't even put out at the prom.

309
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:31,293
My parents treated me like crap,
so now I treat other people like crap.

310
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,007
It's out of my control, Earl.

311
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:34,716
You still make your own decisions.

312
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:38,375
Anything bad I do isn't my fault.
It's theirs for being losy parents.

313
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:41,025
My middle name is Lou... John Lou.

314
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:45,101
There's two toilets in my name, Earl.
I never had a chance!

315
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,651
<i>Right then,
something inside me just snapped.</i>

316
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:55,289
<i>I don't know if it was cause
I'd been in prison for too many months,</i>

317
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,872
<i>or the fact that this punk
was keeping me in for six more,</i>

318
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:01,546
<i>but all I wanted to do
was make him suffer.</i>

319
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,180
<i>I wanted to take everything from him</i>

320
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:10,670
<i>like he took everything
from me and his parents.</i>

321
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,424
What are you doing?!

322
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:33,133
Hey, you treated me like crap,
so now I treat other people like crap.

323
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,609
It's out of my control.

324
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,641
My prom picture, my painting...

325
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:38,204
you son of a bitch!

326
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:44,974
Oh, I'm sorry, did I hit you?

327
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,415
Well, don't blame me, because
anything bad I do isn't my fault,

328
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,085
it's your fault. Including this.

329
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:54,158
This isn't over, hickey.

330
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,913
<i>I wasn't proud of what I did</i>

331
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,485
<i>and doing it
didn't actually make me feel any better.</i>

332
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,781
<i>Plus, John promised there'd be payback.</i>

333
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,653
<i>And there was.</i>

334
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:08,608
<i>Just wasn't the payback I expected.</i>

335
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,222
<i>Turned out the more John blamed me
for burning down his cell,</i>

336
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:14,362
<i>the more he admit
he should blame himself</i>

337
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:16,102
<i>for what he had done to his parents.</i>

338
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,286
<i>And he knew he needed to make it right.</i>

339
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,935
<i>Turns out all the time john spent stoned
staring at the wall had a benefit.</i>

340
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,600
<i>He memorized
every family photo in that wall.</i>

341
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:49,146
<i>Photos that john's parents
assumed were lost forever.</i>

342
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:52,783
<i>Which was reasonable, since they'd
all been destroyed in the house fire.</i>

343
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,447
<i>And john had found a way</i>

344
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:59,459
<i>to give them back something
they thought they'd never see again.</i>

345
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:08,473
<i>It was the best reconciliation
John's parents could have hoped for.</i>

346
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:10,945
<i>And most importantly for me,</i>

347
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:13,523
<i>the warden was going
to look good in front of his wife.</i>

348
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,629
Earl, that was amazing.

349
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:20,538
You really understand
the psychology of the criminal mind.

350
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:22,909
You're like the scumbag whisperer.

351
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:26,151
I'm just glad
everything turned out so well, sir.

352
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:28,310
And for somebody,
it's only going to get better.

353
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,210
Here's 6 more months off your sentence.

354
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:31,900
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.

355
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:35,454
No, earl, thank you
for bailing me out one more time.

356
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:41,048
Honestly, I don't know what I would
do here without you to cover my ass.

357
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:43,851
Well, I guess you're going
to find out tomorrow.

358
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:45,733
Thanks again, sir.

359
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,985
