1
00:00:01,182 --> 00:00:03,298
SWEET JOHNNY

2
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:08,223
<i>They say in Camden County a crime
is committed every seven minutes.</i>

3
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:09,554
<i>Unfortunately for Joy,</i>

4
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:12,134
<i>it had been
6 minutes and 57 seconds.</i>

5
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:16,603
The hell?
This ain't a bus.

6
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,418
You're getting carjacked.

7
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,234
- Get out!
- Fine...

8
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:23,860
but carjacking a red, white, blue Brat
is like spitting on the American flag.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,906
At least
let me get my nuggets.

10
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,823
Oh, snap!
My hand snapped!

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,555
Have you heard that if you can tear
the label off your beer in one piece

12
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:37,791
it means you're not a virgin?
Willie the mailman was talking about it.

13
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:39,404
I hadn't heard that.

14
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,290
Guess it's true.

15
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:47,539
What?

16
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,468
I've had sex, you stupid beer!

17
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:50,787
Stop the Brat!

18
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,048
Holy God!

19
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,398
Damn it.

20
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:06,861
That was the best stunt I've seen
since Sweet Johnny.

21
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,360
Sweet Johnny.

22
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:11,753
<i>Sweet Johnny was #7 on my list,</i>

23
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:14,285
<i>and one of the things
I felt the worst about.</i>

24
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:15,781
<i>Sweet Johnny got his name</i>

25
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:18,258
<i>because he was the sweetest guy
anyone knew...</i>

26
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,653
<i>but also because he was a stunt man
and did some sweet stunts.</i>

27
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:27,172
<i>His stunts were impressive,</i>

28
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,167
<i>but I was even more impressed
with his girlfriend Sheila.</i>

29
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:35,473
So, the doctor says you're going to be
laid up for a couple of days, huh?

30
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:38,044
Yeah, but it was worth it,

31
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,587
'cause that stunt
Sweet Johnny just pulled off

32
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:42,701
was sweet!

33
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:45,835
Oh, God.

34
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,278
Hang in there, buddy.

35
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:53,032
<i>So this time when Johnny got hurt,
I decided to make my move.</i>

36
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,085
There's a back porch
I could spend an afternoon on.

37
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:06,833
Yeah. Nice, ain't it?

38
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,883
Reach out and
grab a slice of that bundt cake.

39
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:17,225
<i>I knew if I wanted
to keep fooling around with Sheila,</i>

40
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,128
<i>I had to keep Johnny
out of the way,</i>

41
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:20,797
<i>so I came up with a plan.</i>

42
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,640
The doomsday chair, huh?

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,731
Yep, saw it as a kid
on <i>That's Incredible</i>.

44
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:26,528
You sit on the chair,

45
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:29,027
when the seat blows up,
it throws you 20 feet in the air.

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,710
But I was thinking

47
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:34,157
you make the whole chair out of TNT,
you'll go even higher.

48
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,865
40 feet in the air!

49
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:38,721
Sweet Johnny's going to fly!

50
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:40,747
<i>I knew I was doing wrong,</i>

51
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,102
<i>but a great heinie can
make a man do crazy things.</i>

52
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,384
Sweet Johnny!

53
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,243
<i>Or make a man
make a man do crazy things.</i>

54
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:06,068
<i>It didn't take me long to realize
the worst Johnny got hurt,</i>

55
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:08,798
<i>the more time I got
in his van with Sheila.</i>

56
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:11,548
<i>I don't remember how many stunts
I convinced him to do,</i>

57
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:14,380
<i>but it was a lot.
Like the human speed bump.</i>

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,158
<i>And the simple yet extremely
unpredictable rocket unicycle.</i>

59
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,612
<i>But by the time I talked him
into the human wrecking ball,</i>

60
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,477
<i>I'd started to feel bad.</i>

61
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,357
Sweet Johnny!

62
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:34,884
I'm sorry,

63
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,059
I can't do this anymore.

64
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:40,682
This is some sick stuff.

65
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:07,250
I got to find Sweet Johnny.
You want to come?

66
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,158
No, you go ahead.

67
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,864
Drop me off at the Crab Shack.
I'm going to get another beer

68
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,690
and prove to it I'm not a virgin.

69
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,634
By doing the label thing,
not putting my weiner in it.

70
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:18,619
I just want to be clear.

71
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:38,030
<i>I hadn't heard anything
about Johnny for a while,</i>

72
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,934
<i>so I was afraid
he'd be hard to find.</i>

73
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:42,827
<i>But it ends up
he was living in the same house.</i>

74
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:49,417
Whazzup!

75
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:53,052
Whazzup...

76
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:54,005
with you?

77
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:56,466
Nothing,
I'm just preparing for a stunt.

78
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,927
I'm going to attach this chair
to two weather balloons,

79
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:00,790
float as high as the planes fly,

80
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,268
high-five God,

81
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:04,098
then jump off
and use this parachute

82
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:06,209
to float sweetly
back down to earth.

83
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:07,493
Sweet Johnny!

84
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,244
Look, Johnny...

85
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,357
I came here to confess something.

86
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:16,751
All that time I was convincing you
to do crazy stunts,

87
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:20,943
I was doing it to get you hurt
so I could sleep with Sheila.

88
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,243
You slept with Sheila?

89
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:26,345
Why would you do that?

90
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,027
Why would she do that?

91
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:30,814
She's the love of my life.

92
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,336
I thought you were my friend.

93
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:34,869
I am,

94
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,507
I feel really bad
and want to make it up to you.

95
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,217
You son of a bitch.

96
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,221
God, Johnny,
just give me a chance, man!

97
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:45,829
<i>I have a rule of thumb
with the list.</i>

98
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:47,345
<i>If someone pulls a weapon,</i>

99
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:49,102
<i>I give them time to cool off.</i>

100
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:55,066
Baby, are these socks thicker
than my regular socks?

101
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:56,246
I feel taller.

102
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,319
Where did you get a gun?

103
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,279
At that Indian dude's garage sale.

104
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,480
I got you a tank top, too.
It says "Whitey, Off the Res,"

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,743
but since you're black
you could get away with it.

106
00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:08,793
You know how I feel about guns.
No good can come from having one.

107
00:06:08,913 --> 00:06:11,338
If I had this yesterday,
we'd still have our car

108
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,419
and you wouldn't be going to work
riding bitch on Fernando's bicycle.

109
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,748
No, if you had that
there would've been a shoot-out.

110
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:19,424
It would've looked like
someone turned on a blender.

111
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:22,181
You're stepping
on my First Amendment rights.

112
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:25,054
Freedom of speech
is the First Amendment.

113
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:27,506
And nothing speaks louder than this.

114
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,771
<i>I gave Johnny a night to sleep on it,
then went back.</i>

115
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,941
Whazzup!

116
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:39,861
I'm back.

117
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:44,324
Just checking to see if you cooled down
since I was here yesterday.

118
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:45,776
Yesterday?

119
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:49,454
I was in Nathanville with Sheila
picking up helium for my next big stunt.

120
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:50,747
You're gonna love it.

121
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:53,216
I'm going to attach this chair
to some weather balloons,

122
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:55,251
float up to where the planes fly,

123
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:56,566
high-five God,

124
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,671
then jump back down
with this parachute...

125
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:00,256
Whoa, hold on...

126
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,885
I feel like I caught that French disease
that makes things happen to you twice.

127
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,135
You don't remember me,
coming by yesterday

128
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,571
and telling you
I slept with Sheila?

129
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,690
You slept with Sheila?

130
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,219
Why would you do that?

131
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,732
Why would she do that?

132
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:19,876
She's the love of my life.

133
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:21,569
I thought you were my friend.

134
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,821
You son of a bitch!

135
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:26,119
<i>Johnny had always been
unpredictable,</i>

136
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,215
<i>but now, he just seemed weird.</i>

137
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,829
<i>If I was going to cross him off my list,
I was gonna have to find out why.</i>

138
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:36,667
<i>The next day I tracked down Sheila,</i>

139
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:40,338
<i>hoping she might know
why Sweet Johnny was acting so strange.</i>

140
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,131
Sheila? That you?

141
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:45,522
I haven't seen you for years!

142
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:47,544
Hold on, I'll be right there.

143
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,768
Damn people.
Parking too close together.

144
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,484
Baby got a little bigger downstairs.

145
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:03,653
But she still remembers you.

146
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,322
You want to give it a little squeeze
for old times' sake?

147
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,788
So what you doing in Mount Trace?

148
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:15,832
Actually, I was looking for you.

149
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:18,703
I need to ask you something
about Sweet Johnny.

150
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:22,230
I talked to him yesterday,
and he seemed kind of...

151
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,763
- "forgetty."
- You don't know about the accident.

152
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:26,518
About the brain damage?

153
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,139
<i>Turns out,</i>

154
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,664
<i>even though I'd put Johnny
in danger a bunch of times,</i>

155
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:34,172
<i>it was something he did all on his own
that ended up hurting him permanently.</i>

156
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,230
He hurt his brain so bad
he can't make new memories.

157
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:40,661
Whenever he falls asleep,

158
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:43,276
he wakes up thinking
it is the day before his big stunt.

159
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:45,403
He's got no idea
it's 10 years later?

160
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,695
He never leaves the house.

161
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:50,718
He just goes to that garage
and works on that chair.

162
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:53,481
I stayed with him
for a couple of years,

163
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,330
but he got hurt the summer
that song <i>La Vida Loca</i> was big.

164
00:08:57,233 --> 00:09:00,376
If I heard him sing it one more time,
I was going to drown him in the tub.

165
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,401
I know what that's like.

166
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,903
Randy got really
into that song for a while.

167
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,091
It's the only time
I ever spanked him.

168
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:11,470
That explains why he didn't remember me
telling him about us sleeping together.

169
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:13,598
Why did you do that?

170
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:16,219
Because it was a bad thing,
and I need to make up for it.

171
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,413
Sure we did wrong,

172
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,362
but the way that I look at it
we got a get-out-of-jail-free card.

173
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,007
Oh, nice?

174
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,902
Someone just parked illegal
across the street. Be right back.

175
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,134
I'm ignoring you, Darnell.

176
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:39,204
All I see is Charlie Brown falling

177
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:41,923
while that bitch pulls
the football away again.

178
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:45,338
Tell you what, if Chuck was packing
people would stop messing with him.

179
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,125
I don't get it.

180
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,514
I'm not a virgin.

181
00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:51,669
Does sex not count
with daytime hookers,

182
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:53,978
illegal aliens,
or 60-year-olds?

183
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:57,267
I don't know how I'm going
to cross Johnny off my list in one day.

184
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:59,370
He's so pissed
when I tell him what I did,

185
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,104
I can't even get to the apologizing
and making it up to him part.

186
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,861
There's another staple.
That makes six.

187
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,528
I don't know why you just don't skip him
and go to another item.

188
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:11,545
It's not like you're going
to live long enough

189
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:13,242
to actually finish
that list anyway.

190
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,362
Wrong.

191
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,494
Earl promised me
he'd live forever.

192
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:18,552
I want to finish the list.

193
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:20,363
And, if I start
thinking about something

194
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,821
I need to cross it off
so I can forget about it.

195
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:24,961
Otherwise, it'll just nag at me.

196
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,082
Everybody freeze!

197
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,615
People, it was a pool cue.

198
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,099
Put the guns away.

199
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:41,863
- What the hell, Joy?
- Stop being a wuss.

200
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:44,439
If that had been a robber,
I would've saved the day.

201
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:51,612
It's all right, everybody!
Just grazed my booby.

202
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:55,035
<i>I realized I had no choice but
to give Johnny another try.</i>

203
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,941
<i>And this time,
I had protection.</i>

204
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:58,245
Sweet Johnny?

205
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:05,042
I slept with Sheila, made you do stunts
so you'd get hurt and I could bang her.

206
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:06,836
You son of a bitch!

207
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,176
<i>So, I decided
to wait out his anger</i>

208
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:11,305
<i>hoping he'd work
his way through it.</i>

209
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:14,398
<i>And it didn't occur to me
he might change weapons.</i>

210
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,146
<i>But, eventually, he got</i>
<i>to where he could listen.</i>

211
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:20,822
Look.

212
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:22,928
I know you're upset.

213
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,299
I'm really sorry
for what I did, but...

214
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,149
I want to make it up to you so,
what can I do?

215
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:30,565
- I'm going to talk to Sheila.
- Hold on!

216
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:33,237
That's not a good idea.
There's something you don't know.

217
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:37,174
You got this brain injury
and when you go to sleep,

218
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:39,205
you wake up thinking
it's the same day.

219
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:41,912
- You've been doing it for 10 years.
- 10 years?

220
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,205
That's crazy.

221
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:46,045
I don't know what kind of trick
you're trying to pull on Sweet Johnny,

222
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,043
but it's decidedly unsweet!

223
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,219
What the hell did you
bring him here for?

224
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:00,217
- Sorry, but he wanted to see you.
- You idiot.

225
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:02,433
He's not going to remember
any of this in the morning.

226
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:05,519
Baby, tell me you didn't
cheat on Sweet Johnny.

227
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,564
Sweetness, there is nothing for you
to get upset about.

228
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,483
Let's just
get you back home,

229
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:13,132
- so you can get ready for your big...
- Ass!

230
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:14,600
Oh, God!

231
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,156
What happened to your ass?

232
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,116
You know I got
that lazy thyroid.

233
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,785
But it's huge!

234
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,623
It's like 10 years of ass growth
since yesterday.

235
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,536
Oh, God, it's true!

236
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:29,710
It is 10 years later.

237
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,639
Oh, why?!

238
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:39,006
So, now you see my problem.

239
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,860
I got to make this
up to you in one day

240
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,590
before you go to sleep
so, if we could just talk...

241
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:46,283
Wait!

242
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:52,733
Johnny, what do you got there?

243
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:55,853
Is that generic nighttime sniffling,
sneezing, coughing, aching, fever,

244
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,905
the best sleep you ever got
with a cold medicine?

245
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:00,116
Johnny, don't do it!
Don't go to sleep!

246
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:01,492
You'll forget everything!

247
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:06,247
That's the point, Earl.
I just want this day to end.

248
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:14,547
Darnell, have you seen my gun?

249
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,575
Maybe the boys
brought it to school.

250
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,945
They mentioned something about
being alienated and disillusioned.

251
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:21,804
Are you trying to make
some point?

252
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,931
You know
I don't like points, Darnell.

253
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,698
I'm just saying,
it's a shame you lost it.

254
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:29,749
Today the cops are having
that "guns for hams" exchange.

255
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,570
Damn you!

256
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,488
How am I supposed to protect
my family with a honey-glazed ham?

257
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,257
<i>The next day,
I got back to work on Johnny,</i>

258
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,202
<i>but since I knew
what I was dealing with,</i>

259
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,559
<i>I was able to get things
done a little faster.</i>

260
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:51,167
- <i>I told him what I'd done...</i>
- I thought you were my friend.

261
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:52,918
<i>let him work out his rage.</i>

262
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:54,753
<i>I told him about
his brain problem...</i>

263
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:57,173
This is crazy.
I'm going to go talk to Sheila.

264
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,676
- <i>took him to see Sheila...</i>
- Sheila, tell me all this isn't true.

265
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:02,553
Oh, hell, not again.

266
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,221
Oh, my God!

267
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:05,890
I'm really enjoying this, Earl.

268
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:07,881
No get-out-of-jail-free cards.

269
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:09,614
<i>And I took him home.</i>

270
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,788
<i>But this time,
I came prepared.</i>

271
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:17,151
Get away from me, you devil!

272
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,239
Calm down, Johnny.
I'm going to get you through this.

273
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:22,489
<i>Eventually, I discovered
all Johnny needed</i>

274
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:25,411
<i>were some kind words once sung
by a handsome Cuban man.</i>

275
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,294
Upside, inside out

276
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,072
Livin' la vida loca

277
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:34,714
She'll push and pull you out

278
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,998
Her skin's
the color of mocha

279
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:41,436
Livin' la vida loca.

280
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:44,845
Feeling better, buddy?

281
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:48,254
So it's just like that movie
<i>Groundhog Day</i> here.

282
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,185
But instead of Andie MacDowell,

283
00:14:50,316 --> 00:14:53,233
I got a cheatin' ex-girlfriend
with a big fat dumper.

284
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,997
And I never get
to do my stunt.

285
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:58,397
Afraid so.

286
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:04,308
I guess then,
that's what you can do for me, Earl.

287
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,046
You can help me
do that base jump.

288
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:09,019
Really?

289
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,361
Do you think we could
pull it off right now?

290
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:14,629
'Cause I kind of need
to do it today.

291
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,318
I got everything
ready out back.

292
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,251
Apparently, I've double-checked
it all 3,654 times.

293
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:24,603
All right then, let's jump!

294
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:28,282
I'm going to call the Crab Shack
and tell people you're doing a stunt.

295
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:30,172
Everybody's going to be
leaving soon anyway

296
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,936
'cause happy half-hour's
almost over.

297
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:34,323
This is great,
give me a "Sweet Johnny!"

298
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,358
<i>So, we went through it
one last time.</i>

299
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:52,379
All right then, let's jump!

300
00:15:55,617 --> 00:15:56,458
Look alive.

301
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:59,810
<i>At last, the stunt Johnny had waited
10 years to do was ready.</i>

302
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,380
Greetings, people of Camden,

303
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,839
and what's left
of the Sweet Johnny Fan Club.

304
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:07,416
I love you, Johnny!

305
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:10,139
Thanks, Paul.

306
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:12,933
I'm going
to take this chair,

307
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:14,343
and I'm going to fly.

308
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:16,145
And then
I'm going to jump off,

309
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:19,265
and if, uh,
Lady Gravity does her job,

310
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,942
you're going to see a stunt
that you'll never forget.

311
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:24,560
I'll never forget you, Johnny!

312
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,151
Thanks again, Paul.

313
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:30,176
Just dial it down a notch, bro.

314
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,118
All right, Sweet Johnny!

315
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:33,941
<i>I felt good.</i>

316
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,414
<i>I was a few minutes</i>

317
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:37,436
<i>from crossing
Sweet Johnny off my list</i>

318
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:40,302
<i>and put what I'd done to him
behind me forever.</i>

319
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,129
What the...

320
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:48,817
You forgot your parachute.

321
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,764
- What the hell are you doing?
- Ending it.

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,808
If this is my life, with Sheila's ass,
I don't want to go on.

323
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,041
You can't kill yourself.

324
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:59,313
Watch me!
Sweet Johnny!

325
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:04,652
- What are you doing? Help!
- Let go!

326
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,528
Sweet Johnny,
what are you doing?

327
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,676
Help! Somebody, get me down!

328
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:12,848
Get me down! Help!

329
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,288
Oh, my God, I did it!

330
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:19,827
The bottle says
I'm not a virgin, I knew it!

331
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:22,090
Look, Randy!
They're going to die!

332
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:29,594
You know,
if I still had my gun,

333
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,762
I could shoot out a balloon
and save those idiots.

334
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:33,180
Joy, now is not the time.

335
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,354
You still can't admit
that sometime, somewhere,

336
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:37,293
there's a good reason
to have a gun, can you?

337
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:38,960
- Admit it!
- Yes, I admit it.

338
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,384
When 2 men are floating away
in a lawn chair tied to balloons,

339
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:43,181
and 1 of them has forgot
his parachute,

340
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:44,775
that might be okay
to have a gun.

341
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:46,187
Thank you.

342
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,549
This is America. You didn't think
I could get another one?

343
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:00,666
Is anybody dead?

344
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,377
He's knocked out
but breathing.

345
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:06,797
Well, Darnell, looks like
the gun saved the day.

346
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,164
Maybe it's time you recon...

347
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:17,609
It's okay, everybody!

348
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:19,632
Just grazed my stinker.

349
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,941
I thought my stunt
was tomorrow.

350
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,593
Hey, everybody.

351
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:34,377
<i>It took Johnny trying
to commit suicide</i>

352
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,437
<i>for me to see
how selfish I had been,</i>

353
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,873
<i>and how I was really only
trying to make me feel better</i>

354
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,741
<i>by crossing Johnny</i>
<i>off the list.</i>

355
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,166
Hey, Sweet Johnny.

356
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,192
All right,
easy on the squeezy.

357
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,780
I just want you
to know something.

358
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:59,426
I really like you,
and I'm sorry.

359
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:01,686
Well, thanks, Earl.

360
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:04,144
But there's no reason for being
sorry for liking Sweet Johnny.

361
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:05,803
Sweet Johnny likes you, too.

362
00:19:05,923 --> 00:19:07,250
You mind helping me out?

363
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,712
Some kids must've broken
in here last night

364
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:11,236
and messed up
my stunt chair.

365
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
Must've kicked my ass
while I was sleeping, too.

366
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,076
Somehow I bit halfway through
my tongue, little bastards.

367
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:19,744
<i>For the first time since
I started doing my list,</i>

368
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:22,291
<i>I wasn't going to be able
to cross somebody off.</i>

369
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,381
<i>I was going to have to
just let it nag at me.</i>

370
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:26,686
<i>But since Johnny was
never going to remember,</i>

371
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:29,254
<i>it felt right that someone
would never forget.</i>

372
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:34,316
Are you standing there
or helping me?

373
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:35,719
I got a big stunt tomorrow.

374
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,973
I know, I can't wait.

375
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:40,786
Sweet Johnny!

376
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:45,875
