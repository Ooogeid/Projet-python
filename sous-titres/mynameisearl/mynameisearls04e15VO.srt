DARNELL OUTED (PART 1)

2
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,049
What the hell happened?

3
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:21,367
Looks like Santa got shot down
over Baghdad.

4
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:24,033
I must have dozed off
watching <i>C-Span</i>.

5
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,582
Great. Now I don't know how
the senate voted on corn subsidies.

6
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:30,029
I'm gonna look like an idiot
at the Crab Shack tonight.

7
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,267
I just cleaned up today, Darnell.

8
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:33,824
Look at this mess.

9
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:40,247
Darnell, whose child is this?

10
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:43,832
I don't know.
Looks like Al and Mary Lou's kid.

11
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:48,631
Deaf as a doorknob.
That's Oliver.

12
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,758
Damn it. What did I tell you
about falling asleep with the door open?

13
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:53,767
People gonna use you
as a babysitter.

14
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:56,197
Now I gotta check
the whole house for more.

15
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,605
Hey, buddy.

16
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:05,713
Are you hungry?

17
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:08,473
Do you want some...

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,143
Shoot, I can't remember
the sign for "cheese crunchies."

19
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,368
There's one in the bathtub
and two in the hamper.

20
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:19,060
Boring...

21
00:01:25,058 --> 00:01:26,261

23
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:36,137
Randy, this isn't <i>CHiPs</i>.

24
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:38,681
I don't know what this is.

<i>A few years back,

57
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:16,694
<i>so she made an audition tape.</i>

58
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,003
Fear is no factor here, Joe Rogan.

59
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:34,191
<i>Fear Factor</i>!

60
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:36,891
<i>She wanted to show
she was willing to do anything.</i>

61
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:45,888
<i>Fear Factor</i>!

62
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,827
<i>No matter how scary.</i>

63
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,377
Get em out! Get em out!

64
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,577
You get it, Randy?

65
00:03:57,187 --> 00:04:00,039
All right, guys, time to put
you fellas back in the wall.

66
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:02,564
<i>And to show
that she could look good doing it.</i>

67
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:16,590
<i>Fear Factor</i>!

68
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,770
<i>Unfortunately, later that day,</i>

69
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:21,189
<i>me and Randy stole
one of those pull guns.</i>

70
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:22,066
Pull!

71
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,805
<i>I told Joy I mailed the tape,</i>

72
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,318
<i>and since it was still
pretty early on in our marriage,</i>

73
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,846
<i>she believed me.</i>

74
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,265
We got to get Joy on that show
to challenge Erik Estrada.

75
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:45,901
I'm gonna challenge him, too,
when I think of a talent.

76
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:48,867
It's not gonna be
having the prettiest smile,

77
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:51,332
'cause his is unbelievable.

78
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:55,789
<i>I wanted to get Joy
on</i> Estrada or Nada,

79
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:58,339
<i>so I had to tell her the truth
about the </i>Fear Factor <i>tape.</i>

80
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:01,550
Son of a bitch!
You never sent the tape?

81
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:06,975
But remember, we used that pull gun
to rob the medical supply place.

82
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,433
You weren't complaining
when you got to sit down in the shower.

83
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,964
That was the day
I got all those rubber gloves.

84
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,813
For a week, I could put hands anywhere.
It was awesome.

85
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,548
So, you faked the rejection letter.

86
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:19,034
I thought it was weird
that Joe Rogan said I came off bitchy

87
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:21,538
and that I should be nicer
to my husband and his brother.

88
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:24,935
Anyway, Joy, I'm sorry
and I'm gonna make it up to you.

89
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,368
I'm gonna get you
on <i>Estrada or Nada</i>.

90
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,587
I'm not doing it.

91
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,705
Thanks, Earl,
but I gave up on that dream.

92
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,415
What dream?

93
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:35,856
The dream of being famous.

94
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:39,502
<i>Turns out, </i>Fear Factor<i> was one
of many disappointments in Joy's life</i>.

95
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:43,376
<i>Since she was a kid,
she had her sights set on being famous.</i>

96
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:45,906
Grammy,
I'm gonna be special someday.

97
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,551
I'm gonna be famous.

98
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:50,076
Doubt it.

99
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:53,268
You come from a long line
of liars, cheats, and harelips.

100
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:57,663
You're never gonna be famous.

101
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:59,275
You got failure in your blood.

102
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:03,237
Your mom is as crooked
as a do-it-yourself haircut,

103
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:05,545
and your poor, dumb daddy,

104
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,742
he was 14 years old
before he could even wave good-bye.

105
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,720
Night-night, sugar.

106
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,171
<i>But Joy didn't listen
to her grandma.</i>

107
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:24,487
<i>She still had big dreams,
like being a beauty queen.</i>

108
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:25,492
Wait.

109
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:27,965
None of these other girls
are pretty enough,

110
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,232
so I get to be Miss America
for two years in a row?

111
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,298
There's no rule against that?

112
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:35,810
Oh, there was
and you broke it for me?

113
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,420
And to think
it all started years ago

114
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:42,479
when I won
Camden's Prettiest Pretty Princess.

115
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,854
<i>But she didn't win that title</i>

116
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,740
<i>because a prettier prettiest princess
came along.</i>

117
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:50,055
<i>When beauty queen didn't work out,</i>

118
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,399
<i>she started to fantasize
about being a famous politician.</i>

119
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:55,768
Wait.

120
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:59,376
You want me to be the President of USA
for two years in a row?

121
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,596
Isn't there a law against that?

122
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:04,908
There was and you broke it for me?

123
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,786
Well, I am honored to serve.

124
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:09,224
And to think

125
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,765
it all started when I won president
of my sophomore class in high school.

126
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,859
<i>But politics didn't go very well,
either.</i>

127
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,181
I'm not just going to be
a president for the hotties.

128
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,940
I'm going to be
a president for the people.

129
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,035
The fat girls, the nerdy Asians,

130
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,776
you "butta-face" cheerleaders,

131
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,461
and the closeted gays,
like quarterback Mikey Shipley,

132
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:30,741
I've got your backs.

133
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:32,743
Joy for president.

134
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,059
Nice pass, Shipley!

135
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:39,294
<i>And years later,</i>

136
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,275
<i>Joy took one more shot at being famous
by trying to get on</i> Fear Factor.

137
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,374
Oh, my God. I won the award

138
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:48,418
for being the most unafraid person
on <i>Fear Factor</i> ever?

139
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:52,093
And my reward is
I get to dump my stupid husband

140
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:53,918
and marry Kevin Bacon?

141
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,664
Isn't there
some kind of law against that?

142
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:58,485
What?

143
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:01,711
You changed
the laws of marriage for me?

144
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:05,681
And to think
this all started a couple weeks ago

145
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:08,904
when I gave myself dysentery
by swallowing that worm.

146
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:12,741
So, <i>Fear Factor</i> was really
just the last straw for me.

147
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,490
That means
I didn't just keep you off a TV show,

148
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,830
I killed your childhood dream
of being famous.

149
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,365
You did me a favor.

150
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,126
My grammy was right.
There are certain people in the world

151
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,744
that are destined to be somebody
and I'm not one of them.

152
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,505
I'm not an Estrada.
I'm a nada.

153
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,289
Joy, you can't believe that.

154
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:31,135
My grammy may have been
a drunk, racist monster,

155
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,333
but she was a good judge of character
and she didn't see any in me.

156
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:40,627
We're lucky our grandma told us
we could be anything.

157
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:43,946
She told you that?

158
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:52,043
I bet Erik Estrada can't catch
50 pennies on his elbow.

159
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:58,172
I'm gonna try 49.

160
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:00,086
<i>I had trouble getting to sleep,</i>

161
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:01,915
<i>not just 'cause of Randy,</i>

162
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,376
<i>but 'cause I couldn't stop
thinking about Joy.</i>

163
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:08,270
<i>The thing was, Joy couldn't stop
thinking about Joy either.</i>

164
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,264
<i>Seemed like everything she did,</i>

165
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,584
<i>she ended up
glimpsing herself in a mirror.</i>

166
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,193
<i>And it made her think
of the mirror she looked into</i>

167
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:26,879
<i>when she was a little girl.</i>

168
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:31,623
<i>She remembered
when she still used to dream.</i>

169
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:34,573
My goodness.

170
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:36,874
You're giving me a Nobel Peace Prize

171
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,620
for best performance
in a reality TV show?

172
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,289
Is there even a prize for that?

173
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,447
You made one just for me?

174
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,474
And to think this all started

175
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,997
when I beat the chips
out of Erik Estrada.

176
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:56,803
Earl Hickey,
you're gonna get me on that TV show.

177
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:35,092
He's good.
I better go practice.

178
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,156
<i>The Camden locals brought out
their "A" games</i>

179
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:49,440
<i>to try out for the new reality show,</i>
Estrada or Nada.

180
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,140
Man, I haven't seen a line
this long in Camden

181
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:54,394
since the opening day
of the methadone clinic.

182
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,954
That place was a rip-off.

183
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,990
Me and Randy waited
in line for two hours

184
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,708
and all we got was a cup
of weird tasting orange juice.

185
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,766
Really, Earl?
You didn't like it?

186
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:04,144
I thought it was great.

187
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,937
Remember, I went there
every day for a month and then,

188
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,765
when you told me I couldn't go back,
I tried to kill you.

189
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:13,851
Man, that was good orange juice.
God, I wish I had some right now.

190
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:16,957
299...

191
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:19,050
300.

192
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,404
Everyone with numbers, follow me.

193
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,264
Hey, headset, I didn't get a number.

194
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:26,614
So don't follow me.
We're only seeing 300 contestants.

195
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:28,895
Dummy! Maid!

196
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:31,940
You know how much I care about you.
Give me your number.

197
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:34,126
Don't look at me.

198
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:36,653
I've been training for this moment
since I was six.

199
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:39,820
I can slice an apple in two
from 50 paces

200
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:41,714
or decapitate a man from ten.

201
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,619
Mr. Estrada's choice.

202
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,621
Randy, you gotta help me out.
This is for my list.

203
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,879
No way, Earl.

204
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:50,083
I'm wearing a rubber band
so I can hit the high notes.

205
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,420
If I don't go, I'm just some guy on line
with a rubber band around his danglers.

206
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:57,330
I'm gonna snap that rubber band
if you don't let me take your number.

207
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,676
Come on, Randy,
I really need your number.

208
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,018
- How about we thumb wrestle for it?
- No way.

209
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:04,577
You know I inherited
Mom's slow, clumsy thumbs.

210
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:07,059
How about you give Joy your number
and the next list item I do

211
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,227
will be something I make up to you.

212
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,564
Will you do it right now,
no waitsies?

213
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:14,807
Yes, he will.
Come on, Darnell.

214
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,402
It's time for me to shine
and rub my dead grammy's face in it.

215
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,613
Hope she gets TV reception in hell.

216
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:31,886
Got it.

217
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,585
<i>He picked #182:</i>

218
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,971
<i>"Played tetherball
with Randy's face."</i>

219
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:42,013
One.

220
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,013
<i>For his audition,</i>

221
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:48,389
<i>Iqball decided to challenge
Erik Estrada at fancy talking.</i>

222
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:50,322
Alas, poor Yorick.

223
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,606
I knew him, Horatio.

224
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:55,107
A fellow of infinite jest...

225
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,455
and most excellent fancy.

226
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,449
<i>And win or lose,
there was plenty of variety.</i>

227
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:05,826
Knock, knock.

228
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:08,703
Who's there...

229
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,519
<i>My favorite audition was the guy
who played Ponch</i>

230
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:16,193
<i>in some stage show called</i>
Micro-CHiPs.

231
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:27,722
Last up is number 300,

232
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,573
Joy Turner.

233
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:30,698
Finally.

234
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,379
Dunkleman out.

235
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,356
Hack stole it from me.

236
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:45,590
Hello. My name is Joy Turner,

237
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,969
aka "The Crustacean Sensation."

238
00:13:57,322 --> 00:14:00,881
<i>You keep saying
you've got something for me</i>

239
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:04,258
I don't remember her being that
flexible when we were married.

240
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:05,403
I do.

241
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:06,760
Sorry, buddy.

242
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:09,786
<i>These claws were made for walking</i>

243
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:12,295
<i>And that's just what they'll do</i>

244
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:15,437
<i>One of these days,
these claws are gonna...</i>

245
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,909
The hell?

246
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,276
Which one of you sons of bitches
gave me the buzz?

247
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:25,322
I'm pretty sure
Erik wouldn't want to do

248
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,933
something like that.

249
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:28,867
It's frankly just too silly.

250
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:30,783
Too silly?

251
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:33,888
Y'all took a guy that acted out
an episode of <i>The Smurfs</i> by himself

252
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:35,786
and he didn't even sound
like Gargamel.

253
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,419
On this show,
you're dealing with an Erik Estrada

254
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,421
and Erik enjoys being funny.

255
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,465
He doesn't like being silly.

256
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:46,505
You tell Erik Estrada

257
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,346
that this is what happens to men
that say no to Joy Turner.

258
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,995
I was afraid of this.

259
00:15:05,798 --> 00:15:08,131
Darnell Turner,
you let me loose right now.

260
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:10,163
I'm gonna bite off your nose,
Brian Dunkleman,

261
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,118
then we'll see who looks silly.

262
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,508
<i>We all watch the show
together at the Crab Shack</i>

263
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:17,706
<i>just like when there's a plane crash
or chemical spill</i>

264
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:20,529
<i>or when someone we know is
involved in a slow-speed chase.</i>

265
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,823
I don't want to watch this crap.

266
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:26,394
This show is everything
that's wrong with America today.

267
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,209
Change the channel.

268
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:29,970
<i>Celebrity Rehab</i> is on.

269
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:32,881
No, keep it on.
I'm hoping they show my audition.

270
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,387
I didn't split the apple,

271
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:36,518
but a girl with nice boobies
swinging a machete?

272
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,686
Come on!

273
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,942
<i>It's time to find out if you are...</i>

274
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:43,111
Estrada or nada!

275
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,150
<i>There are nadas who are good sports</i>

276
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,279
<i>and nadas who are bad</i>

277
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:50,168
<i>and then, there's Joy Turner.</i>

278
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,033
<i>You tell Erik Estrada</i>

279
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,127
<i>that this is what happens to men
that say no to Joy Turner.</i>

280
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:03,003
<i>Darnell Turner,
you let me loose right now.</i>

281
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,963
<i>I'm gonna bite off your nose,</i>

282
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:06,756
<i>then we'll see who looks silly.</i>

283
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:09,316
<i>Hey, Estrada,</i>

284
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:11,815
<i>come to Camden
and face me like a man.</i>

285
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,004
<i>Pimmit Hills Trailer Park, Lot L,</i>

286
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:16,057
<i>the one with the bathtub
in the front yard.</i>

287
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:20,724
<i>The small bathtub, not the big one.</i>

288
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:26,004
Y'all got a problem with that?

289
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:29,154
'Cause I got another big-ass shoe.

290
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:31,306
Anybody? Anybody?

291
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,584
I believe that's for me.

292
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,126
I'm gonna need to step away
to take this.

293
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:49,965
- Go for Darnell.
- Cool.

294
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,177
Darnell's got a hair phone.

295
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:58,634
Roger that.
Don't worry, I'll destroy it.

296
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:04,187
Cool!

297
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,232
Darnell blew up his hair phone.

298
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,626
Darnell, what is going on?

299
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:10,468
While we may laugh at reality TV

300
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:12,470
for being the lowest form
of entertainment,

301
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:15,700
apparently, the ratings are quite large.
20 million people just saw my face.

302
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,369
My cover has been blown.

303
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,521
Well, I guess all this means
I can't cross you off my list.

304
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:21,790
Hell, no, you can't.

305
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,043
You just humiliated me
in front of the whole country,

306
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,587
and you put my husband in danger.

307
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:30,246
Now you're gonna have
to bold, underline

308
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:32,258
and "italiancize" me on that list.

309
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:35,377
Actually, Joy,
he put us all in danger.

310
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:36,805
We have to relocate.

311
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,563
I don't get it.

312
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:41,123
One minute, we're watching TV

313
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:43,608
and the next you're telling me
the FBI is snatching us away

314
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:45,813
because there's people
that want to kill us?

315
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:49,317
They only want me, but they'll kill
whoever else is in the room.

316
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,987
When you say
"whoever else is in the room"...?

317
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:54,447
- Yeah, I mean you.
- Well, what about me?

318
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:55,859
- You, too.
- Nice.

319
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:58,827
If the FBI gets here first, well,
you don't want to be here for that.

320
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,287
We only have time
to pack the essentials:

321
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,207
clothes, medicine,
and my grandma lemon square recipe.

322
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,640
Is she even gonna be
your grandma anymore?

323
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,532
Truth be told, she wasn't
my real grandmas to begin with.

324
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,549
She testified against Halliburton,
but I love her to death.

325
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,969
As you know from the flyers I put up,
the candlelight vigils

326
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,624
and the billboard on Third Street,
Mr. Turtle remains lost.

327
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:21,220
The good news is,
I gave him plenty of survival training,

328
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:22,812
so I expect his imminent return.

329
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,498
So, here's his food,
his favorite scarf,

330
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:27,869
and his lip balm for the dry season.

331
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:33,319
I'm really sorry, Joy.

332
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:36,101
I feel like this is kind of my fault

333
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:38,310
for getting you to go on that show.

334
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:40,135
It's totally your fault.

335
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,968
- Sorry. You weren't talking to me.
- He's right.

336
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:44,998
My childhood dream of being famous

337
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:46,958
was dead and buried
and you dug it up,

338
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:49,095
made me go on TV

339
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:51,124
and turned my dream
into a nightmare.

340
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:54,173
- You made me a laughingstock.
- Yeah, dummy.

341
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:59,877
She's not gonna be Joy anymore.
I thought I'd try it.

342
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,123
It's not for me.

343
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:04,392
Joy, I promise
I'm gonna make this up to you.

344
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,563
What are my boys doing
wearing their bicycle helmets?

345
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:10,496
Sometimes the pick ups are rough.

346
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,650
Tuck your arms in, fellas.
Joy, please hustle.

347
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,354
I'm not hurrying for the government.

348
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,403
I paid their salary
the year I did my taxes.

349
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,824
They may tell me I have to move,
but I call the rest of the shots:

350
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:23,379
what I pack,
when I pack, how I pack...

351
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,528
- They're gone
- I can't believe it.

352
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,169
There are so many things
I never got to say to them, like...

353
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,795
Well, maybe I got that covered,
but still, I miss them.

354
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,520
I can't just let someone take
my ex-wife,

355
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:11,554
the guy she cheated on me with,
and my two "igellitimate" kids.

356
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:14,732
I promised Joy
I'd make her dream come true.

357
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,291
That's the last thing I said to her.

358
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,091
We gotta find them.

359
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,343
There's still a little liquid in mine.
I wonder what it tastes like.

360
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,443
Randy, no!

361
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,225
