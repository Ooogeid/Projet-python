1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:02,464
THE MAGIC HOUR

2
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:05,675
<i>Recently Randy had become
curious about hair dryers</i>

3
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:07,732
<i>so we borrowed one from Joy.</i>

4
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:10,151
I really like the look, Earl,
but come on,

5
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:13,145
who has 30 minutes every morning
to spend on their hair?

6
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:19,201
You keep practicing,
little buddy.

7
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:22,342
I gave up the xylophone
and always regretted it.

8
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,215
Lucky kid.

9
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:28,469
Still got a shot
at being somebody.

10
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,411
What's going on?

11
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:35,755
It's the grand re-opening
of Mystery Funland.

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,544
These <i>Make-A-Wish</i> T- shirts'll keep us
from having to wait in long lines.

13
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,585
- I'm dying.
- I'm dying, too.

14
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:44,297
I'm not going to the funeral, Earl.
Tiny coffins creep me out.

15
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:47,634
And you still owe me 45 cents
from when I used to live here.

16
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,419
- We need to settle up, <i>pronto</i>.
- They're not sick, Randy.

17
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,739
Joy's just taking advantage
of <i>Make-A-Wish</i>.

18
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:55,221
The kid two trailers down
got to go to Space Camp

19
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:56,924
once his sickle cell kicked in.

20
00:00:57,044 --> 00:00:59,229
Why should my kids suffer
just 'cause they're healthy?

21
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:01,356
<i>I couldn't be too judgmental.</i>

22
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:04,484
<i>A few years back, I did a bad thing
to the </i>Make-A-Wish<i> people myself.</i>

23
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,755
<i>It was late New Year's Eve
and Randy drove home without me</i>

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,577
<i>on account of me accidentally
giving him a midnight kiss.</i>

25
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,341
<i>Which we still don't talk about.</i>

26
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:13,868
<i>Walking wasn't working well,</i>

27
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:16,547
<i>but I found
another means of transportation.</i>

28
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,540
That's a giant dog!

29
00:01:22,643 --> 00:01:24,449
You're going the wrong way.

30
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:30,093
<i>Next morning, I felt like
I'd been kicked in the head by a horse,</i>

31
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,126
<i>which might have happened.</i>

32
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:35,569
Make-A-Wish <i>child
Buddy Zaks lost his wish today</i>

33
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,501
<i>when the pony he was to ride
in the New Year's Day parade</i>

34
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:39,811
<i>was tragically stolen.</i>

35
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:42,835
<i>So, well-wishers tried bravely</i>

36
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:45,086
<i>to salvage little Buddy's dream.</i>

37
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,464
<i>This sucks.</i>

38
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,095
<i>This was Buddy's last chance
to ride in the parade,</i>

39
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:54,591
<i>because while not
all </i>Make-A-Wish<i> kids are dying,</i>

40
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:56,060
<i>this one is.</i>

41
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:59,372
<i>Now here's Chick Dabney
with the weather.</i>

42
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:02,109
<i>It was almost ten years
since Buddy died,</i>

43
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,294
<i>so there wasn't much
I'd be able to do for him.</i>

44
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:07,296
<i>But I figured I'd try
to do something for his parents.</i>

45
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:10,717
This is so cool!

46
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:13,207
I wonder if getting tattoos
hurts trees

47
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:14,846
as much as it does humans.

48
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,558
Hello... Mrs. Zaks?

49
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:22,200
A few years ago, I stole
your son's <i>Make-A-Wish</i> pony

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,075
and I'm here
to make it up him.

51
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:26,478
I mean, not to him,
'cause he's, you know...

52
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,211
an angel.

53
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,078
What's up, bro?
You stole my pony?

54
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,748
I thought you were dead.
I saw you on the news.

55
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:43,759
I know what happened.

56
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,829
He made a wish to still be alive.

57
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,992
Why don't they all do that?

58
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:51,807
<i>After I told him about my list,</i>

59
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:54,163
<i>Buddy invited us in
and he explained how he had defied</i>

60
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:56,877
<i>all the doctor's expectations
about him dying.</i>

61
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:58,967
It may surprise you,

62
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,985
but Camden doesn't have
the best doctors.

63
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:03,657
I've had three watches
dropped in my body during surgery,

64
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:05,605
and one of them's still in there.

65
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,024
So you're a movie buff?

66
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:09,286
Hell, yeah!

67
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,409
You spend 95%
of your teen years in bed,

68
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,988
- you're gonna watch some flicks.
- What's your favorite?

69
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:16,491
Without a doubt,
<i>2 The Max</i>.

70
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:17,909
It's all action

71
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,541
with Max Patrick...

72
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,745
CIA agent,

73
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:22,664
Navy SEAL, gigolo,

74
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:24,319
and devoted family man.

75
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,416
Watch as Max stops
the terrorists

76
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:29,337
from using a giant robot squid
to kill the president!

77
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,677
Me and Randy love squid movies.

78
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,440
- How'd we miss it?
- Wait.

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,128
Is that the one that started out boring
with the Renée Zellweger girl?

80
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:40,022
'Cause we walked out of that thing.

81
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:42,744
You didn't miss it
because it hasn't been made yet.

82
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:44,018
It's all up here.

83
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:46,356
And... in here.

84
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,509
And some of it's over here.

85
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:51,140
Stop it!

86
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:55,261
Do it again.

87
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:56,955
Stop it!

88
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:58,636
Do it again.

89
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,535
Wait.
Let me lick it.

90
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,411
I like your brother.

91
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,027
He likes you, too.

92
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,037
Wait a minute.

93
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:09,246
I like him.

94
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,537
He likes me.

95
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,297
We all like squids,

96
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:13,673
and you owe me.

97
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:15,709
You know
what we're gonna do?

98
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:18,399
We're gonna make this movie!
And it is going to be...

99
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,804
awesome!

100
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:21,989
Stop it!

101
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,543
Do it again.

102
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:25,932
Hold on.

103
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,479
- We're going to make a movie?
- Don't worry.

104
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,882
I've got plenty of books
on how to do it.

105
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:33,965
And if you want to cross me
off your list, you'll help me, man.

106
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:36,154
- You can be the producer.
- Producer?

107
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,116
- Look at me, Randy. I'm a producer.
- I know. I saw.

108
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,244
Besides sounding cool,
what exactly does that mean?

109
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,506
Being a producer is awesome.

110
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,797
You get to pay for everything
and hire everybody.

111
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,225
You get to make sure
that everything happens exactly

112
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:52,904
like it looks up here.

113
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,966
Yeah,
we can absolutely make your movie.

114
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,260
Or...

115
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:04,515
Nah. I want the movie.

116
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:10,041
<i>Buddy wanted each person he cast
to fit his artistic vision.</i>

117
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:11,175
<i>For Max's wife,</i>

118
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,557
<i>he wanted someone who was hot,
but edgy.</i>

119
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:14,695
Teresa!

120
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,654
Get your fat ass out here
and bring your noisy little brat inside.

121
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:23,493
And he seems
to have misplaced his xylophone.

122
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:28,748
- What are you looking at?
- You're perfect.

123
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,371
I know.

124
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:33,469
<i>And who was I
to judge his artistic vision?</i>

125
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,144
Oh, God!

126
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,862
Soda water, please!

127
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:39,968
It's setting!

128
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:41,678
Does anyone have a Tide stick?

129
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:43,846
This is my best irregular
Tommy Bahama.

130
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:45,939
There's our panicky scientist.

131
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,094
That's right, <i>cucaracha</i>.

132
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:52,022
Drink the poison
and bring it back to your filthy home

133
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:53,815
to feed to your babies.

134
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,728
Ruthless terrorist.

135
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:57,464
Nice!

136
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:00,488
Check out this great suit
I found behind the motel.

137
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,221
I had to kick a litter
of fresh cat babies off it,

138
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:05,040
but I left them my T-shirt.

139
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,206
That's a sweet suit.

140
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:09,665
We have our president.

141
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,789
And here's my Secretary of Cute.

142
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,860
<i>Once we had our cast,
we started shooting our movie.</i>

143
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,168
Okay, so...
This is the scene

144
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:22,262
where the president first hears
about the giant squid.

145
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,929
Everybody know what to do?

146
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,234
All right.

147
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:27,303
Lightning in a bottle, people!

148
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,264
And...

149
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:33,688
action!

150
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:35,449
Mr. President,

151
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,980
as per your request,

152
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,304
we are unfreezing
Benedict Arnold

153
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:41,362
so you can punch him
in the stomach.

154
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,000
While he thaws,

155
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,603
the vice president
has an announcement.

156
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:49,935
Mr. President,

157
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,671
this fax just came in.

158
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,224
New York City is under attack
by a giant squid.

159
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:56,877
The joint chief of staff

160
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,959
has declared
a state of emergency.

161
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,977
He is requesting permission

162
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:03,551
to go to death con six.

163
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:07,188
I didn't take this job

164
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:10,168
to let our free land
be swallowed by some squid.

165
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:11,893
Get me Max Patrick.

166
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,604
And then you hear a big thud
from outside and react.

167
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,442
What in the tarnation was that?

168
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:22,085
And then we'll cut to a shot
of the squid. Randy, you say...

169
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:24,072
I said get me Max Patrick! Now!

170
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:25,827
And then I enter.

171
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,620
Did somebody say my name?

172
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:33,013
Ad-lib excitement!

173
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:36,821
Cut!

174
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,088
You don't say "ad-lib excitement."

175
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,922
You just act excited like...

176
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,658
We have a major problem here.
Earl.

177
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:48,747
Listen...

178
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:50,556
Thanks.
Thank you.

179
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:54,456
Listen, other than Randy,
who is awesome,

180
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:56,826
everybody else stinks.
These other actors...

181
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:59,100
Patty sounds like a transvestite.

182
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,697
And Joy, she just keeps
looking right in the camera,

183
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:03,356
so you got to fix this.

184
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,397
I'll be in my trailer!

185
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,905
Don't worry, I'll figure it out.

186
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:14,754
Look...

187
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:18,421
Buddy isn't happy
with some of the performances.

188
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,586
And Joy, you got to stop
looking at the camera.

189
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,297
If I don't, how would
the audience know I'm talking?

190
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:25,670
He says Randy's
the only one who gets it.

191
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,915
Acting's easy.

192
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:29,637
You just pretend to be different people
and then talk like that.

193
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,764
Joy should say,
"Mr. President,

194
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,114
"per your request,

195
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:36,466
"we're unfreezing Benedict Arnold
so you can punch him in the stomach."

196
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:39,989
And then Patty goes,
"Mr. President, this fax just arrived.

197
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,984
"New York City's under attack
by a giant squid!"

198
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:44,444
See?
You can do anybody.

199
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:46,950
Are you talking to me?

200
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:49,449
Nobody else is here,
so you must be talking to me.

201
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,006
E... T...

202
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:54,537
phone... home.

203
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:56,726
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock!

204
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,749
Plymouth Rock landed on us!

205
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:01,141
I want a hard target search
of every farmhouse,

206
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,914
doghouse, henhouse,
in-house and outhouse.

207
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:06,382
Your fugitive's name
is Dr. Richard Kimble.

208
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,563
I'm not an animal.

209
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,636
I'm a human being.

210
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,067
It puts the lotion on its skin.

211
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,820
It does as it's told.

212
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,310
Put the lotion in the basket!

213
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,020
Choosy moms choose Jif.

214
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:22,218
<i>Randy showing off
just made people more upset.</i>

215
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:25,463
<i>And it wasn't just the performances
that caused problems.</i>

216
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,695
I eat terrorists for lunch
with my caviar.

217
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,447
I'm Max Patrick.

218
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,837
I am afraid of no one.

219
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:34,235
It's time for me to declare...

220
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:35,487
a jihad!

221
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:43,920
Cut! Did we get it?

222
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:46,297
I need to take a five.

223
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,027
<i>Another thing I learned about movies
is special effects can be tricky.</i>

224
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,620
Everybody remember, the last thing
that's gonna happen in the scene

225
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,758
is that my flamethrower watch goes off.
Is safety ready?

226
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:58,188
And...

227
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,435
action.

228
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:01,479
Mr. President, this...

229
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,007
The president's on fire!

230
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,568
Keep filming!

231
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:15,204
<i>But the hardest part of all was
dealing with Buddy's perfectionalism.</i>

232
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:23,785
Cut!

233
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:26,520
Earl, I need real limousines
for the motorcade.

234
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,979
The president needs
a kick-ass limo.

235
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:30,607
It has got to be...

236
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,503
awesome!

237
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:34,232
I'll be in my trailer!

238
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:36,604
Maybe you didn't see.

239
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,516
This is a '98 Civic,

240
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,065
and it's got a spoiler.

241
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:42,849
<i>What with the screaming
and people catching on fire and all,</i>

242
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:45,357
<i>by the end of the week,
morale was pretty low.</i>

243
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,233
So the president and Max's wife

244
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,695
are trapped by squids on the roof
of the White House, and it's like...

245
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:53,485
And they're all...
And then,

246
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:56,409
Max Patrick appears out of nowhere,
he saves the president

247
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:59,462
and blows up the squid
with his laser watch.

248
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,008
It's gonna be awesome.

249
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,959
- Any questions?
- How is this not gonna look like crap?

250
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:06,655
You got to trust me.

251
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:09,746
It's all gonna be done
with special effects and camera tricks,

252
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,577
but we only got one shot at this

253
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:14,010
while the sun is rocking
that awesome gold color.

254
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,839
In the business,
we call that "the magic hour".

255
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:20,442
Well, my magic hour is
when this thing is done

256
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:23,277
and we're all drinking
at the Crab Shack. Huh?

257
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:26,114
Let's go!

258
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:28,524
All right, Earl...

259
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:29,859
Call it.

260
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:32,236
And... action.

261
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:36,032
Wherever you are,
please save us.

262
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,600
Sorry I was late.

263
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,289
DC traffic is a bitch.

264
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:43,789
The fate of the free world is
in your strong, handsome hands.

265
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:45,708
Now... helicopter!

266
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,795
Mr. President,
I've got to get you both out of here.

267
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:52,098
Come with me.

268
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:58,943
- We have to go.
- I'm not going without you.

269
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:02,099
Don't you realize what these suction
cup bastards will do to you?

270
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,538
Okay, I'll go,

271
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,186
but not without a kiss first.

272
00:12:05,797 --> 00:12:07,480
- Can I do it on the hand?
- Lips.

273
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:08,845
Cheek.

274
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:14,803
Let me check my watch
and see what time it is.

275
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:16,581
It's time for fish stew.

276
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,324
Explosion!

277
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:31,254
Awesome take, everybody.
Let's do a couple more.

278
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:32,755
Oh, hell, no. I quit.

279
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,507
I only do tongue kisses

280
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:37,658
if it's Brad Pitt or Eric Roberts.

281
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:39,533
What the heck is that smoke?

282
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:41,906
My eyes hurt,
and I have an unproductive cough.

283
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:42,890
Don't worry,

284
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,548
I got it from a crop duster,
it's even safe for plants.

285
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,499
Oh, God.
Now my nose is bleeding.

286
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:48,437
I quit.

287
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,140
Come on, don't quit.

288
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,026
I'll get you a Wet-Nap.
Your people love those.

289
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,320
Magic hour.

290
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:00,102
Sorry, Earl, but I quit, too.

291
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:04,559
And so will William,

292
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,080
if he ever wakes up again.

293
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:20,602
What's going on?
Crew call's at 10:00. It's 10:02.

294
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:23,305
What do you mean?
You were there. Everybody quit.

295
00:13:23,658 --> 00:13:26,200
So what? In Hollywood,
people say they quit all the time.

296
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,853
Nobody actually does it.

297
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,827
I'm sorry, but this is Camden.
People quit everything here.

298
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:33,267
That's why
the freeway ends in a field.

299
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:34,458
But, look...

300
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,144
I can play the president.

301
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:38,597
And I got a blonde wig
to play your wife.

302
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,240
We just tape down
the button on the camera,

303
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,955
I can hold the boom mic
down low out of frame,

304
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,557
or hide it on my head under a hat.
We can do this.

305
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,581
Yeah, but it'll suck donkey.

306
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,871
You know what?

307
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:54,826
It's fine.
Things happen in this business.

308
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:57,498
Production gets cut short,
you gotta roll with the punches.

309
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,736
And I already got
all my dream shots.

310
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:01,928
Better to make a short,
awesome movie

311
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:03,387
than a long, mediocre one.

312
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:05,931
So, is that it?
You don't need me anymore?

313
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,473
One more thing.

314
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:11,812
Give me two weeks to edit the footage,
and then throw me a movie premiere.

315
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,356
But everybody quit.
Who's even gonna show up?

316
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:18,246
If you throw it...

317
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:19,801
they will come.

318
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,978
What?

319
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,473
If you throw it...

320
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:27,859
they will come.

321
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,217
Have you ever seen a movie
without Burt Reynolds in it?

322
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,626
Not all the way through.

323
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:38,297
<i>A couple weeks later,
</i>2 The Max<i> was set to premiere.</i>

324
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,541
<i>It was the first film
shot in Camden</i>

325
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,765
<i>since the documentary
about the chemical spill,</i>

326
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:44,323
<i>so we got a good crowd.</i>

327
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:46,950
As if turning down
the part of Indiana Jones

328
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,345
to play a bank teller
on <i>Laverne & Shirley</i>

329
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:50,816
wasn't bad enough.

330
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,626
I also made the mistake

331
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:55,439
of not nailing Penny Marshall
when I had the chance.

332
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:59,537
So what part do you play
in this movie?

333
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:01,195
What movie?

334
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:05,022
<i>And despite the bad taste everyone had
in their mouths from the filming,</i>

335
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:07,862
<i>they came out to enjoy the glamour
of a Camden movie premiere.</i>

336
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,596
Here come two of the film's stars,

337
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:11,912
Joy
and Darnell "The Crab Man" Turner.

338
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:14,208
So, Joy, tell the viewers
whose clothes you're wearing.

339
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:17,043
What are you talking about?
These are mine.

340
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:18,682
I meant, which designer?

341
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:22,795
I got it at <i>Rite Aid</i>.
Supposed to be worn the other way,

342
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:25,626
but what would you rather see,
shoulder blades or cleavage?

343
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:28,457
Sometimes I think
clothing designers are gay men.

344
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,861
I did all my own stunts.

345
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:36,938
I even caught on fire.
That wasn't in the script.

346
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:39,610
Turns out I've been doing
my own stunts my whole life.

347
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,819
I've just been calling them
accidents until now.

348
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:44,646
In my younger days,
I did some commercial acting.

349
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:46,208
See if this rings a bell.

350
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,952
"Pretty sneaky, sis."

351
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:51,855
I didn't say that,
but I was the sneaky sis.

352
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:56,160
<i>I finally got everybody seated,
then realized not everybody was seated.</i>

353
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,588
<i>The man of the hour
still hadn't shown up.</i>

354
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,899
Hey, Mrs. Zaks.
Where's Buddy?

355
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,123
The projectionist has to get
the equipment back tonight

356
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:05,074
before the janitor
locks up the school.

357
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:07,052
Earl, Buddy's not coming tonight.

358
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,056
<i>Buddy's mom had
some really bad news.</i>

359
00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:13,626
<i>There was a reason Buddy kept
storming off to his trailer.</i>

360
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:16,196
<i>He wasn't just
a bitchy little Hollywood wannabe.</i>

361
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:19,273
<i>He was a bitchy little Hollywood wannabe
who need hourly treatments.</i>

362
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:22,345
I put a Fonzie sticker
on the IV bag today.

363
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:24,278
I thought it would make it more fun.

364
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:28,824
<i>Turns out the doctors were right
about Buddy's health.</i>

365
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,786
<i>They were just about ten years off
on the expiration date.</i>

366
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,738
I can't believe he's gone.

367
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,025
His one dream was
to make a movie,

368
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,377
and he didn't even get
to see the premiere.

369
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,872
Making the movie
wasn't his only dream.

370
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:44,632
Buddy had tons of crazy dreams,
and you helped him with all of them.

371
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:48,884
You'll understand
when you see this.

372
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,264
<i>I decided not to tell anyone about
what happened to Buddy</i>

373
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:54,928
<i>until after the premiere.</i>

374
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,882
<i>I kind of figured he wouldn't want
people feeling sorry for him.</i>

375
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:00,257
<i>He'd rather
they just enjoy the movie.</i>

376
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:28,796
<i>I didn't take this job</i>

377
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,553
<i>to let our free land
be swallowed by some squid.</i>

378
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,639
<i>Get me Max Patrick.</i>

379
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:37,965
<i>What in the tarnation was that?</i>

380
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,606
<i>I said get me Max Patrick, now!</i>

381
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,734
<i>Did somebody say my name?</i>

382
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,154
<i>And everyone did enjoy it,</i>

383
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:49,825
<i>including me and his mom.</i>

384
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,243
<i>Watching Buddy's film,</i>

385
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,673
<i>I realized
what his mom was talking about.</i>

386
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:57,401
<i>Making that movie let him live out
every crazy dream a boy could have.</i>

387
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:59,223
<i>He got to meet a president.</i>

388
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:02,790
<i>He got to be a spy in the CIA.</i>

389
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:06,282
<i>He got to save someone's life.</i>

390
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,119
<i>The president's on fire!</i>

391
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:10,758
<i>And thanks to special effects,</i>

392
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:15,160
<i>Buddy finally got to ride a horse
in the 1999 New Year's Day parade.</i>

393
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:18,357
<i>And the best part was,</i>

394
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,296
<i>Buddy somehow
pulled off his magic hour shot.</i>

395
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:26,677
<i>Sorry, I'm late.</i>

396
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:28,302
<i>DC traffic is a bitch.</i>

397
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:33,537
<i>Stand back, honey.</i>

398
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:37,875
<i>The fate of the free world is
in your strong, handsome hands.</i>

399
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:39,329
<i>Here comes the chopper.</i>

400
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:41,915
<i>Mr. President,
I've got to get you both out of here.</i>

401
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:45,551
<i>Let me just check my watch
and see what time it is.</i>

402
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,366
<i>It's time for fish stew.</i>

403
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,305
<i>Lasers are awesome,</i>

404
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,647
<i>but not as awesome
as your lips, baby.</i>

405
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,144
<i>Why not put them</i>

406
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,322
<i>2 the Max?</i>

407
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,108
<i>Rocket shoes, engage.</i>

408
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:12,632
<i>Hey, baby, you ever been to Paris?</i>

409
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,871
<i>Buddy knew
his own sun was setting.</i>

410
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:17,290
<i>That's why he was
so particular about the movie,</i>

411
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,621
<i>and even though we didn't finish,
he got all his dream shots.</i>

412
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:25,000
<i>And everybody in the audience could see
he'd really made something special.</i>

413
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:32,946
<i>After that, you couldn't help
but think of your life as a movie,</i>

414
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:35,510
<i>knowing eventually
your own sun was gonna set,</i>

415
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:38,183
<i>making every hour
into a magic hour.</i>

416
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:39,932
<i>Buddy made us all realize</i>

417
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:42,453
<i>we shouldn't waste our shots
screwing around.</i>

418
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:46,146
<i>We should do the things we always wanted
to do while we had the chance.</i>

419
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:48,923
<i>Darnell tried his hand
at creating great art.</i>

420
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:51,339
<i>Catalina used
one of her shifts at Club Chubby</i>

421
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,140
<i>to try something
she always dreamed of.</i>

422
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,223
Instead of stripping,
I'll be doing improv.

423
00:19:55,343 --> 00:19:57,375
I need a location
and a kind of food.

424
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:00,505
<i>Joy started her own clothing line.</i>

425
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,643
I did it!

426
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:04,380
You made that shirt?

427
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:06,218
No, I stole the shirt.

428
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,232
I designed a way to make
the security tag look like jewelry.

429
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:12,756
<i>And Randy decided to explore
things he was curious about.</i>

430
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:20,154
<i>And I took up the xylophone again.</i>

431
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:23,275
<i>And I wasn't very good,</i>

432
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:26,789
<i>but that didn't mean I wasn't gonna
give it my best and try to make it...</i>

433
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:27,923
<i>awesome.</i>

434
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:32,184
