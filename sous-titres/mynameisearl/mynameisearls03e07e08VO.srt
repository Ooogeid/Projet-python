00:00:02,556 --> 00:00:04,907
<i>Life as a prison guard
was tough on Randy.</i>

3
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:07,226
Good luck.

00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,170

for him to turn off the tv.</i>

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,848
Sorry, everyone. Time's up.

7
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:30,608
Hey, guys.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,972
If you learn to follow the rules
in here, like, "no tv after 8:00",

9
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:38,699
it'll be easier to follow the rules when
you get out, like "no murdering people".

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,744
All right, who's got the knob?

11
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:44,538
I see it in your hand, Joey.

12
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:52,427
I guess we get to watch tv all night.

13
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:59,199
<i>Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?</i>

14
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:01,511
Oh, my God! Our other <i>Cops</i> is on.

15
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:08,103
<i>Welcome back to Camden.
I'm Officer Stuart Daniels.</i>

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,981
I'm in charge this week
because the Captain,

17
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:12,191
my mom,

18
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,846
is fighting a difficult battle
with a flesh-eating bacteria.

19
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:17,899
Lost her nose.

20
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:21,753
It's an important week.

21
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:26,020
It's our first Independence Day
since the September 11th 9-11 attacks.

22
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:28,553
Raffle tickets sponsored by <i>Bargain Bag</i>!

23
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:30,861
Win a bus trip to <i>Ground Zero</i>.

24
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:34,046
See firsthand
what Saddam Hussein did to our country.

25
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:35,539
<i>Raffle tickets!</i>

26
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:40,573
<i>America rocks!</i>

27
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:44,000
Get your Bin Laden toilet paper!

28
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:49,019
Give Osama a dose
of your morning shock and awe!

29
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,847
This is a new addition this year.

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,365
Hey, Osama, I hope you're watching <i>Cops</i>.

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,870
It doesn't matter,
that's just a guy in a mask.

32
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:17,194
The real one will be caught in a month.

33
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:20,784
Check it!

34
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,032
Score one for the good guys.

35
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:29,959
I'm Officer Jeff Hoyne.
I grew up here in Camden,

36
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,351
so did my twin brother
and my twin sister.

37
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,866
He's in the appliance business,

38
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:36,286
and she manages
the <i>Big Gals</i> shop at the mall.

39
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,342
I worry about them, cause...

40
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:41,361
both locations could be
high priorities for terrorists.

41
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,134
I mean, after all, what's more american
than appliances and obese women?

42
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,818
Hold on! Hold on now!

43
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:54,168
Officer, she's crazy.
You got to do something.

44
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,654
You got to do something,
like provide for me.

45
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:59,882
I'm the queen, you are the worker bee.

46
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:02,259
Your job is to feed me, do me and die.

47
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:03,575
Ma'am! Ma'am!

48
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,690
I don't blame you, but you have
to put the weed whacker down.

49
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,974
- Now, who called 911?
- It's me.

50
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:11,393
- What are you, iraqi?
- I'm sikh.

51
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,496
- I hope you feel better.
- I feel fine.

52
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:17,115
- She destroyed my beautiful garden.
- Hey, look, Joy, <i>Cops</i> is back.

53
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:22,855
<i>Bad boys, bad boys, what's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be when they be from me?</i>

54
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:23,791
<i>Cops</i>?

55
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:26,117
Wait. Oh, hey Kevin!

56
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:28,160
Wha... now, don't be scared.

57
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:31,308
I'm sorry I hit you with that brick
last time you guys were in town.

58
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:32,966
Stop chasing me, Kevin!

59
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,513
Come on, man, be cool.

60
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,289
I'm not messing around, Kevin.

61
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,132
You made me do it, Kevin!

62
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:45,377
Okay, somebody needs to tell me
exactly what the problem is.

63
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,034
I'll tell you what the problem is.

64
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,640
I sent this doofus to the fair
to find a way to make us some money,

65
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:53,393
and he ends up spending the only cash
we have left on some stupid toaster.

66
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:55,435
I bought a patriotic sandwich-maker

67
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,663
because I love America
and hot sandwiches,

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,441
and she attacks me with a weed whacker.

69
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,802
It's the all-american sandwich press.

70
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:04,933
It burns an american flag
into any food item.

71
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,584
"French toast?

72
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:08,293
"Not anymore."

73
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:11,395
It don't even make sandwiches!
It just decorates them.

74
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,456
I mean, what's next?
You gonna buy a dress for a watermelon?

75
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:17,000
- Put the weed whacker down.
- Oh, you want it down?

76
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:18,740
Is that low enough?

77
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:24,007
I need you to take your lazy butt
back to the fair and make me some money.

78
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,701
Sometimes it's best just to let
them work these things out themselves.

79
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,891
Crazy ho!

80
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:32,868
Oh, I'll show you a crazy ho!

81
00:04:32,993 --> 00:04:35,794
Without a weapon in her hand,
he should be all right.

82
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,697
- Come here. Who's the crazy ho, now?
- That's sharp, Joy!

83
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,401
- Who is it, huh?
- Put it down, Joy!

84
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,888
It's bad enough
we have no customers today

85
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:49,990
because it's a holiday and
everybody's with their stupid families,

86
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:53,449
but then this drunk guy gets up
and he kicks us off the stage.

87
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,676
<i>Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry</i>

88
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,974
<i>When I take you out in the surrey</i>

89
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:05,134
<i>When I take you out in the surrey
with the fringe on top.</i>

90
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,854
<i>Oklahoma</i>... what a treat.

91
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,081
Usually when Mr. Stack gets drunk
and forces his way onto a stage,

92
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,687
he does <i>My Fair Lady</i>.

93
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,356
<i>All the wheels are yeller,
the upholstery's brown,</i>

94
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,648
<i>the dashboard's genuine leather,
with ice in glass...</i>

95
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,625
Get off the stage, whore!
This is my time.

96
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:26,862
Excuse me, Mr. Stack.

97
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:29,568
Take a bow, Mr. Stack. It's time to go.

98
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:32,903
Gee, Laurey, you're just in time
for the dream ballet.

99
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,051
Picking up a guy who won a ride along
with a cop at a silent auction.

100
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,057
He must really want
to see an end to leukemia,

101
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,903
because he went crazy on the bidding.

102
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:52,199
Hi, Stuart.

103
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:53,922
Oh, I see they're back.

104
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:56,308
Yeah. <i>Cops</i> is doing another episode.
You ready?

105
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,561
Hold on!

106
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:02,356
Nobody's leaving the scene
of this crime without a picture.

107
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:03,315
Dad...

108
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:06,068
Kenny never went to his prom,
so this picture will take its place.

109
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,707
- Mother!
- Don't worry, Kenny.

110
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:10,864
Most guys who get shot down in
high school turn out to be big studs...

111
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:11,918
or gay.

112
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,143
Right, stud?

113
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,914
Say, "book 'em."

114
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,995
Book 'em.

115
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,164
Be careful out there.

116
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,700
Oddly enough,

117
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:24,696
if you add a retainer and a dress,
you'd look a lot like my prom date.

118
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,430
Be careful. I might get you drunk
and try to dry hump you later.

119
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:32,732
We're heading over
to the cotton candy booth.

120
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,235
It's a hot spot for trouble.

121
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:37,074
- Randy, calm down.
- I can't see. It's in my eyes!

122
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,308
How did this happen?

123
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,228
He was watching that man make
cotton candy, got dizzy and fell in.

124
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,351
Well, lucky he's still alive. I think
I heard a Kennedy died this way.

125
00:06:44,477 --> 00:06:46,024
Hey, buddy! Calm down there.

126
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,360
He can't hear you,
he's got cotton candy in his ears.

127
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,575
You got to keep an eye out on these
Hickey boys. The big one's an idiot.

128
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:55,765
The other one's got a wife who's always
bugging him to steal stuff.

129
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:58,561
We got a manila folder
on them down at the station.

130
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:00,872
No, no, just stay still, big fella.

131
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,468
Stay still.

132
00:07:05,445 --> 00:07:07,632
Free cotton candy!

133
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:13,782
In law enforcement, we call
cotton candy "the deadliest snack".

134
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:18,702
Vultures.

135
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,698
We got a problem over
at the "hang on a hardbody" contest.

136
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:27,276
Come on, Kenny, let's roll!

137
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:33,275
Hey, quiet down, quiet down.
Patty...

138
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:36,764
This is supposed to be a contest
to win a truck, where is it?

139
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:39,377
Well, the car dealership backed out,

140
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:41,824
because last year the winner
had been up for three days,

141
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,875
fell asleep driving home and
plowed through a marching band.

142
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,880
Anyway, since the money's going
to the firemen, I donated my hard body.

143
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,831
Winner gets me for an hour, full menu.

144
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,843
- But no asphyxiation!
- The little guy is cheating.

145
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:58,562
Why "little guy"? Why can't I be
"the guy with the red shirt"?

146
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,891
Fine, the guy
in the little red shirt's a cheater.

147
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:04,084
- He glued his hand to Patty.
- Hickey, aren't you married anyway?

148
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:05,532
I'm doing this for my wife.

149
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,165
I'm going to sell the hour with Patty
with the giant teddy bear Randy won.

150
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:11,560
I hit the balloon guy
in the eye with a dart.

151
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,810
He said
he didn't care what prize I took.

152
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,084
Are they allowed to use glue?
What are the rules?

153
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:20,452
Rules? There are no rules.
I was supposed to be a jeep.

154
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:21,745
I want glue, too!

155
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,504
Fine, have some glue.

156
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:27,334
That's mine! I got it.

157
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,180
Hands off! Hands off!

158
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,420
Son of a bitch.

159
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:31,797
All right, problem solved.

160
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,041
Good luck to the rest of you.

161
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:35,773
You know what'd be hilarious?

162
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,684
We should see how long we can keep
our hands on each other.

163
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:39,805
Kidding.

164
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:49,370
This is the safest spot
on the fairground, really.

165
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:52,267
It's where we keep
all our important stuff...

166
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:53,482
Fireworks.

167
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:57,872
And homeland security sent us equipment
to protect us against attack.

168
00:08:58,393 --> 00:08:59,596
For example,

169
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:04,405
this is a surface-to-surface
urban combat transport vehicle.

170
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,601
You may know it as a "scooter."

171
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,194
We got a call about
someone being held in a bathroom.

172
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:14,875
My mother used to lock us in the john
when one of my "uncles" came to visit.

173
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:17,919
Mom was a cheater.
It affected my relationships with women.

174
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:19,281
Don't trust them at all.

175
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:20,481
Here we are.

176
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,011
Thanks for coming.

177
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:29,703
My grandmom's having a dustup with
my girl on account of her being married.

178
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,024
- It's <i>Cops</i>. Damn!
- <i>Let me out of here, you crazy old bat!</i>

179
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,969
Repent, child of Lucifer.

180
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:39,487
I can't reason with her when she has
iron in her hand and Jesus in her ear.

181
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:42,569
I said repent, you cheating white bitch.

182
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:46,038
I'm going to have to ask you to let
the white bitch out of the bathroom.

183
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:47,493
Who the hell is that?

184
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:49,249
Burn, harlot.

185
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,689
<i>You burnt my new eyelashes!</i>

186
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,054
Give me the curling iron.

187
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,345
Oh, I'll give you the curling iron.

188
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:57,852
God!

189
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,364
We got a runner.

190
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:08,726
Our grandmom was
in the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

191
00:10:09,186 --> 00:10:11,204
Man, Hitler hated her.

192
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,318
I hate her, too.

193
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:15,436
Crazy old bat thinks I'm cheating.

194
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,553
I just came here to by
a nickel bag for my sweet husband,

195
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,751
you know,
to celebrate the Fourth of July.

196
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,599
She means a bag of nickels.

197
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:38,005
So, the hostage was freed.

198
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,096
I burned my face a little.

199
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:45,042
I chased the perp for a while,
but she was quick.

200
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:48,345
You know, my father had a saying
and I never understood until now.

201
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,270
"Never get in a foot race
with an old black lady."

202
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,149
We're responding
to a child endangerment call.

203
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,799
Probably an underage dancer.

204
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:05,527
Unfortunately, sometimes runaways
end up in seedy places like this.

205
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:10,362
Ma'am, will you and your baby
step off the stage?

206
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,977
Officer, it's not mine.
I'm baby-sitting.

207
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,251
Take it off!

208
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:15,961
Take the baby off!

209
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:32,671
We got a call that a lamb
was taken from the petting zoo.

210
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:35,359
That means there down to
a german shepard and those worms.

211
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:38,831
We spotted two characters
who appear to be walking some blankets.

212
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:41,611
Crap, it's Earl again.
If you shoot him, I'll lie

213
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,187
and say he lunged for your weapon
and would've killed us all.

214
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:46,249
I appreciate that.
You'd make a good cop, Ken.

215
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,160
- Come on, <i>IQ-Ball</i>.
- Iqball!

216
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:51,559
Whatever. Look, my wife's gonna kill me
if I don't come home with some money.

217
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:54,167
You can eat it, ride it, hump it,
I don't care.

218
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:55,628
20 bucks, it's yours.

219
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,894
Hello, Officer.

220
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:02,478
Happy Fourth of July.
Don't you agree?

221
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,041
You guys didn't happen to see
a lamb around here, did you?

222
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:08,992
What's this?

223
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,368
It's my dog.

224
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:12,559
It's a sheep dog.

225
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,979
Uh, most of it's on the sheep side.

226
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:21,776
Shoot him! Shoot to kill!

227
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:25,322
You can't encourage me to shoot
cause in the heat, the gun could just...

228
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:30,833
Move along!

229
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,817
Everything's fine!

230
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:35,477
I had to put down a rabid lamb.

231
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:37,584
It was rabid.

232
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:40,827
- Can I have it?
- Take it. Take it fast.

233
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,803
I was in New York on September 11th...

234
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,315
not 2001, it was '82 or '83.

235
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,981
High school class field trip,
but still...

236
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,212
pretty eerie.

237
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:04,277
Hey, check that out.

238
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:10,617
- Speed it up.
- Hey, guys.

239
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:13,263
Looking good!

240
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:17,304
It's nice to see someone else
who cares about the environment.

241
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:18,995
Keep it green!

242
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:26,138
We're responding to a 10-66.
That's a domestic intruder.

243
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:29,020
I came home,
and there were two men in my trailer!

244
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:30,865
Two of them and three of us?

245
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:33,030
I don't like those numbers.

246
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,597
Freeze! Freeze!

247
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:40,021
It's okay. We're Americans.

248
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,571
Give me a break, man.

249
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,143
I come back from the fair
with apparently not enough money,

250
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:47,079
and the wife locks me out of my house.

251
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:49,587
I pee out here all the time,
but I'm not gonna poo.

252
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:51,110
Our kids play in this yard.

253
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,717
You're allowed to use the bathroom
in other people's trailers.

254
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:55,795
You need to cool it, magic genie!

255
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:59,609
Joy, come out and tell this guy
you locked me out of the house!

256
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:05,880
You're not really going to arrest me?
I'm the victim here.

257
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,816
Don't you think having a crazy wife

258
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,619
who locks you out of the house
for no reason is punishment enough?

259
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:15,852
Sometimes she just...
seems to hate guys, you know?

260
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:17,869
Women... You married?

261
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:19,968
Not anymore.

262
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:21,226
Lucky you.

263
00:14:21,522 --> 00:14:22,779
She passed away.

264
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,788
Sweet. No alimony.

265
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:32,627
I'm dropping these guys off at the fair.

266
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:35,109
I probably should arrest them...

267
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,067
but it's the Fourth of July...

268
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,074
and they seem like pretty nice guys.

269
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,865
Guys, guys!
I had a hep c tranny back there.

270
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:45,052
You don't want to touch that glass.

271
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,591
Okay, so we are looking for the parents

272
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:54,475
of this little blonde-haired,
blue-eyed, eight-year-old boy.

273
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,828
- Anybody?
- I'll take him.

274
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:59,516
There you go.
You guys work that out.

275
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:02,566
Okay, I'd like
to introduce Officer Stuart Daniels

276
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:07,168
who is going to give us a demonstration
on our new anti-terrorism equipment.

277
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:09,567
Hello, residents of Camden!

278
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,434
Sorry.

279
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,862
I'm not used to speaking to the public,
just arresting them.

280
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,373
We have a great two-hour show for you.

281
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,260
We are going to bring out

282
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,296
over $50,000 worth of
high-tech surveillance equipment.

283
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,721
It was supposed to go
to Camden, New Jersey,

284
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:31,925
but it came here.

285
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,665
And in the post-9-11 America,
it's every town for itself!

286
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:42,297
We have thermal cameras.
We have helmet cameras.

287
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:44,464
We have this digital fibroscope

288
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:49,119
which bends so you can find contraband
that's hidden in the walls and such.

289
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,401
Back at the station,

290
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,404
we found, like, 5 ping-pong balls
out from under the soda machine.

291
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,817
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

292
00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:01,913
All right, to start this demonstration,
we're going to have some t-shirts!

293
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:04,832
Who wants a free t-shirt?

294
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:13,643
Oh, crap. I had it set on stadium.

295
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:22,562
What is the problem here, ladies?

296
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:26,604
The problem is, Officer,
that this <i>perra</i> stole my regular.

297
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,940
All right, let's hear
<i>Perra</i>'s side of the story.

298
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:32,386
He's my regular now.
You weren't around.

299
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:33,767
A man's got needs,

300
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:36,281
and I got everything he need right here.

301
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:40,195
What's your side of the story, sir?

302
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:43,829
I don't know why they're fighting.
They have both sat on my lap.

303
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,790
They are both now my wives.

304
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,268
Just because a girl sits on your lap
doesn't mean you're married to her.

305
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:52,162
You shouldn't even be sitting
on his lap. You'll break his legs.

306
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,008
I'm calling you fat.

307
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:58,503
Oh, no,
you should not have explained that.

308
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,156
Wives! Wives!
I have enough seat for the both of you.

309
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:03,458
The skinny one,
I will lay with you for pleasure.

310
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,779
The thick one, you will birth my sons.

311
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,478
See? He called you "thick".

312
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:13,809
Hold on.
Let see where this goes.

313
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:17,572
<i>Gentlemen,
there's a cat fight at the pool table!</i>

314
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:42,448
It's gone.
$50,000 worth of equipment, gone.

315
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:43,896
We're screwed.

316
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:46,184
I should have bought
into that <i>Quizno</i>'s franchise.

317
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:49,265
We can handle it, right?
What did that guy at the <i>Marriott</i> say?

318
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:52,441
Stop, he says "visualize."

319
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:55,818
Wait. Where are the fireworks?
They took the fireworks.

320
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:58,013
The bastards stole our Fourth of July!

321
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:01,471
This is crazy. Who would want
high-tech cameras, and fireworks?

322
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:03,744
Fireworks could be turned
into explosives.

323
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:05,240
I think we know who.

324
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:06,843
Hey, white powder.

325
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:08,743
Check it out. That could be anthrax.

326
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:11,577
- It looks like part of a funnel cake.
- Anthrax on funnel cake?

327
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:14,629
- I had like four of those today!
- My fingertips are going numb!

328
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,131
Nothing's coming.

329
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:23,442
I have an announcement to make.

330
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,682
First, my brother's here with his kids.

331
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,317
Take the kids and get out
of here as fast as you can!

332
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:31,646
Leave grandma, she's had a long life!
Go, go, go!

333
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:33,356
Pull it together, Hoyne.

334
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:35,191
There's nothing to be worried about.

335
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:36,737
We may,

336
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,490
and I stress "may",
have had a breach of security

337
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,228
that could lead to
a possible, little, bitty,...

338
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:45,256
Terrorist attack that could rival 9-11!

339
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:52,291
My baby! My baby!

340
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:06,097
Terrorists!

341
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:08,629
Run for your lives!

342
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,729
My mom's gonna kill me.

343
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,649
We've had a breach of security.
Cameras and fireworks were stolen

344
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:25,013
by terrorists.
And as soon as we figured out

345
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,474
how to put together
this torturing device and find them,

346
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,158
this gonna be hell the pay.

347
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:32,248
Ouch, son of a bitch!

348
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:34,583
Tensions are high.

349
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,754
I got the camera on
but I can't see anything.

350
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,566
- You got it backwards.
- Oh, right.

351
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:42,685
I think the camera on mine is working.

352
00:19:44,078 --> 00:19:47,255
This is sweet stuff, Randy. We're going
to make fortune when we'll sell it.

353
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,469
Wonder what this button does.

354
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:53,649
Wow. It turns everything
into a <i>Fruit Roll Up</i>.

355
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:54,811
Let me see.

356
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,718
Cool, I think it sees heat.

357
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:01,858
Here, move my cigaret around.

358
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,824
Sweet!

359
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,682
It's like a ghost dog.

360
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,541
I'm a ghost dog.

361
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:13,431
I'm floating around.

362
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:17,668
Earl, I'm scared.

363
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,513
Well, they stole our Fourth of July.

364
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,165
Look at this place... Totally deserted.

365
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,188
This was the heart of our town.

366
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:30,147
It's like the terrorists
kneed us in the nuts.

367
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:32,016
The nuts of our heart.

368
00:20:32,423 --> 00:20:35,731
The worst part is
that they took our fireworks.

369
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,865
God knows what they'll do with them.

370
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:40,285
I've already lived in one explosion.

371
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:41,692
I can't do it again.

372
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:47,137
<i>She lost a leg!</i>

373
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,977
Am I scared?

374
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:53,219
Hell yes, I'm scared.

375
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,364
And a little surprised.

376
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:59,342
I always thought I die at the hands
of a team of juvie football players.

377
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:02,941
It really makes you think about
what's important in your life.

378
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:06,467
I should start calling my mama more.

379
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:10,258
And I'm definitely going
to keep my next baby.

380
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,128
I remember my first terrorist attack.

381
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,904
I was 6 years old, I hijacked the school
bus filled with children of diplomats.

382
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:31,057
I was angry because they got to eat
peanut butter and jelly for lunch,

383
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:33,160
while we only had mud and jelly.

384
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:36,595
It looks the same
but it tastes completely different.

385
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:40,955
The next day, they took away our jelly
and we only had the mud.

386
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:44,131
There are no winners in terrorism.

387
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:49,939
I read the manuel on
how to profile possible terrorists,

388
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:51,572
but it was really confusing,

389
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:53,526
so I got this at the hardware store.

390
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:57,708
I'm questionning anybody that falls
between Swiss almond and Coconut husk.

391
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,265
No, he's all right.

392
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,109
Stay out of the sun, fella.

393
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:06,628
You're on the bubble.

394
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:09,840
They took our fireworks?

395
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:11,671
My husband loves those fireworks.

396
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:14,112
Now, what is he gonna be doing
between 8 and 10 tonight?

397
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,988
They can't just do that.
People have made plans.

398
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,814
Randy, hurry. Get in there. Get down.

399
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:29,566
This will be hilarious.

400
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:32,006
We're outside the dinner.
When they take the trash out,

401
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:34,263
Randy's going to jump out
and scare the crap out of them.

402
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:36,827
The best part is
he's got a camera on his helmet,

403
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:39,215
so we can see their stupid faces
when they scream.

404
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:46,576
Holy Moses!

405
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,531
Hang on, buddy!

406
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:56,077
I'm getting it! I got it!

407
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:57,527
- Help me!
- Yeah.

408
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,529
People are freaked, and they should be.

409
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:05,201
Everybody in the city could be dead
before sundown.

410
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,255
Still, the charity ride along
had a coupon for lunch.

411
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,383
This wine isn't wine.

412
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:12,718
I think it's beer with <i>kool-aid</i> in it.

413
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:15,564
I saw the guy roll his eyes
when you ordered <i>Merlot</i>.

414
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:17,713
I'm pretty sure he spit in it.

415
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:20,434
You get used to it. That kind of thing
happens to cops a lot.

416
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:23,113
It's the real reason
we eat so many donuts.

417
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:25,936
Hard to hide a loogie on a donut.

418
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:28,170
You know,
if you'd rather, I could just...

419
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:30,203
make us dinner tonight.

420
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,077
- Or friday night.
- No, no, no.

421
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:36,055
You paid top dollars for this.
You shouldn't have to cook.

422
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,322
I make a great risotto.

423
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:48,958
I feel 87% sure it wasn't terrorists
that stole those fireworks.

424
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,033
Nevertheless, I'm happy
for the public misconception.

425
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:55,752
All this misguided anti-arab hysteria
significantly reduce

426
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:59,233
my likelyhood of being victimized
by random police brutality.

427
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,968
I feel bad for Hispanics, though.

428
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:10,990
A lot of people think we've been living
in a terror free America until now.

429
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:13,709
That's not true,
I've been terrorized my all life.

430
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:15,199
When I was ten,

431
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:18,855
my father forced me to play catch
for a all hour... without stopping.

432
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:20,953
And my mom... didn't care.

433
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,220
She was too busy not using
the pot holders I made her.

434
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:30,557
Another disturbance at Pimmit Hills.
Third one, today.

435
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,575
I keep saying we should just wall it off
and let them police themselves,

436
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,302
but no one listens.

437
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:38,653
Come out, you pervert.

438
00:24:39,918 --> 00:24:42,077
- Come on!
- All right, guys. What's the problem?

439
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,032
He thinks,
just cause I used his bathroom,

440
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,812
he could peep on me and my wife
having a romantic hump.

441
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,763
You're not going to believe
what we scored at the fair.

442
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:53,449
Our kids will never gonna have
to steal a day in their live.

443
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:56,210
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing.

444
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:58,695
Look out the new shirt!

445
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:03,479
"Danger. Educated black man."

446
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:08,001
I... bought that... for... Earl Jr.

447
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:10,692
Thought we could give it to him
if he finishes high school.

448
00:25:10,814 --> 00:25:12,129
I know what's going on...

449
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:14,217
You do?

450
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,743
You're setting up a little afternoon
delight for Mummy and Daddy.

451
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,303
Feeling hot for the provider?

452
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,847
Well, let's see how hot, little lady...

453
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,933
You're on fire!

454
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,543
Guess we don't have to waste
anytime kissing.

455
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:36,078
If you are gonna be in the room,
you have to face the wall.

456
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:39,180
- I know the rule.
- Let's get this party started, Joy.

457
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:53,129
Damn it, Randy! No peeping!

458
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:59,176
- What the hell was that?
- I heard it too.

459
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:02,429
Randy, I think someone is
in the back of the trailer. Let's go.

460
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:13,023
I know it's him.
I saw him running away from my trailer.

461
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:14,640
Why would I spy on her?

462
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:17,778
Look at how she dresses.
I can see her elbows anytime I want.

463
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:21,115
Dude, if you like elbows,
boobies are going to blow your mind.

464
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:24,596
Where did you get that helmet?

465
00:26:26,222 --> 00:26:28,037
I'd like an attorney, please.

466
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:29,486
Nobody move.

467
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:31,087
I want an attorney!

468
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:32,052
Crap!

469
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:33,692
Send all units!

470
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,972
Officer down!

471
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,651
Not shot... just felt.

472
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,097
Officer up.

473
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:48,436
We saw the suspects enter this trailer.

474
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,199
We're going in on three.

475
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:52,167
Hey, you know what?
Let's going on two.

476
00:26:52,283 --> 00:26:55,221
- More of a surprise.
- Come on. I'll use my hand as a gun.

477
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,262
You know what? Let's keep it to three.
Standard procedure.

478
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,560
It's locked.

479
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:04,366
Freeze!

480
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,413
Hey, Kevin. Did you knock?

481
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,916
I'll get the bleached blond hussy!

482
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,912
Hey, Darnell. Why are you naked?

483
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:21,454
I'm a free spirit.
Look, we got to get out of here.

484
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,360
How? There's cops everywhere.

485
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,546
Follow me. I've had a lot of practice
sneaking in and out the trailer park.

486
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:27,727
Stay close.

487
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,426
But not too close.
Remember that I'm naked and whatnot.

488
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,049
I'm on my way to the trailer park,
* some terrorists.

489
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:39,200
Technically, I should pull myself over,

490
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,209
cause I'm driving
with an open container.

491
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:42,780
An open container I won't pass.

492
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,578
Thank you, sir.
I got him from here.

493
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:53,040
Somebody help me...

494
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:55,956
Dear... mom...

495
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,354
today... I... call...

496
00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:00,798
the wrong... girl... a hussy.

497
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:02,753
Terrorist!

498
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:09,610
Well, looks like the bad guys
have been apprehended.

499
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:12,809
These cops are amazing,
the way they're so in control.

500
00:28:13,795 --> 00:28:15,927
Maybe later, we'll all relax a little.

501
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:19,330
And go to a strip club,
look at some female breasts,

502
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:22,793
and pour in some shots,
maybe do some Apple Martinis.

503
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:26,609
Then race for pink slips,
like Danny Zucco in <i>Grease</i>.

504
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:54,858
I haven't seen the country
this broken since Vietnam.

505
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:58,814
My son and I passed through there
on a sex tour in the lately 80's.

506
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:04,236
The Vietnames are
beautiful and flexible people.

507
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:08,509
Can one of you guys
give me a ride home?

508
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:10,326
I drove my car into a quarry.

509
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:14,922
We're going to take them into the tent
for a little bit of questionning.

510
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:17,374
In the old days, we'd just book him
and read him his rights,

511
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:18,865
but it's a 9-11 world.

512
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:22,131
Terrorist got a booboo?

513
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:26,012
I am innocent.
I don't want to go down with him.

514
00:29:26,122 --> 00:29:27,632
Hey, can I play bargain?

515
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:29,636
I know who kidnapped
the mayor's daughter.

516
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,565
I swear, I'm not a terrorist,
I'm American.

517
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:34,176
I drive a <i>Chevy</i>.

518
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:37,627
We know you're hiding the truth,
somewhere deep inside you.

519
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,064
And this little camera,
is going to help us find it.

520
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:45,640
<i>All right, I did it, I'm a terrorist.
Get it out of me!</i>

521
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:49,405
The suspect caved almost immediately.

522
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,590
You know, sometimes,
police work is challenging.

523
00:29:52,897 --> 00:29:54,551
Sometimes, it's rewarding.

524
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,107
Sometimes, it's just gross.

525
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:03,614
They beat a confession
out of you already?

526
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,409
More like into me.

527
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:07,844
Oh, snap.

528
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:12,012
Well, now you know why I confessed
to all that stuff on our anniversary.

529
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:14,176
Mom, we caught the terrorist.

530
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:18,484
Yeah, I know you don't have
a lot of weekday minutes left.

531
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,733
I'm going to have to call you back.

532
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:25,118
No, nothing bad happened.
My girlfriend's on the other line.

533
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:27,032
Maybe I do have a girlfriend!

534
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,864
Mom, why can't things
be easier between us?

535
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:36,666
I saw a cop car with the keys
and I had to steal it.

536
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,580
It's like when a horse puts on a saddle,
it wants you to ride it.

537
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:43,533
All I did was run from a cop today.
I wasn't even in that much trouble.

538
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:47,616
Well, I also told them you were planning
to blow up the Camden <i>Shoe Pavilion</i>.

539
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:48,722
What?

540
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:51,969
That's crazy. I love that place.
That's were I get my irregular jellies.

541
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,017
Torture hurts, Joy.

542
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,827
I also told them
my mom shot Abe Lincoln.

543
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:58,265
You betrayed me.

544
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:01,321
Just remember this moment
if you ever find out I betrayed you.

545
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:03,494
I haven't, but now I can.

546
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:07,420
Look, I'll make it up to you.
We'll go to Canada and start a new life.

547
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:10,154
You love Michael J. Fox.
He's from there.

548
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:12,334
MJF is from Canada?

549
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:15,565
Oh, that's right.
You're the one who loves him.

550
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,620
Fine. I guess Canada's not that bad.

551
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:21,076
Their beer has twice
the amount of alcohol ours does,

552
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:24,560
plus you know they're laid back. I mean,
they got a pot leaf right on their flag.

553
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,962
Pot flags? We're going to Canada.

554
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:30,387
Hey, Canada.
That sounds like a super idea.

555
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:33,560
Listen, can you guys
drop me off at the next block?

556
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:36,885
Well, we can't now, Kevin.
You heard us talking about Canada.

557
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:39,098
You should've spoken up
before we made our plan.

558
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,854
Yeah, man, use your head.

559
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:45,529
Squad cars get stolen pretty frequently,
so now they all have low jack.

560
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:47,963
Plus they break down
every 30 to 40 miles,

561
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:50,068
so I don't expect
the culprits to get far.

562
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:51,904
What in the world?

563
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,512
Oh, this is odd.

564
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:03,280
<i>O beautiful for empty fairs</i>

565
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:06,715
<i>Jihad makes me sad...</i>

566
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:08,527
That's the heart
of our town right there.

567
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:10,101
That heart is broken.

568
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:13,550
Be careful out there, Mr. Stack.
There's a lot of idiots on the road.

569
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:15,014
Okay, Mom.

570
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,244
He's clearly drunk,
but bumper cars are made for crashing.

571
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,244
Besides,
I don't want to alienate the guy.

572
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,245
He's in the Camden tourist brochure.

573
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:25,008
There's a nice picture
of him on the antique train.

574
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:37,067
It's kind of funny how you keep
getting kidnapped by us, Kevin.

575
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:40,160
Maybe you should look inside yourself
and see what you keep doing wrong.

576
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:43,453
When we get to Canada, I'll call them
and tell them where we hid the car.

577
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:46,580
And I'm still pretty sure I can talk
Randy out of ditching it in the lake.

578
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:48,418
Lake! Lake! Lake! Lake!

579
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,128
Well, you do make a good point.

580
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:58,727
Freeze! I will shoot you this time.

581
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:02,099
<i>The terrorists have won again</i>

582
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,269
<i>The score is orange to none</i>

583
00:33:05,755 --> 00:33:07,271
<i>America...</i>

584
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,131

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,442
<i>I should've hosted family feud</i>

586
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:26,913
<i>O beautiful...</i>

587
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:29,757
<i>For spacious skies</i>

588
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:34,299
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

589
00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:40,153
<i>For purple mountain majesties</i>

590
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:45,225
<i>Above the fruity plains

591
00:33:57,766 --> 00:34:00,771
Man, the Chinese make a nice firework.

592
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:03,433
Their food's really good, too.

593
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:19,302
It's beautiful...

594
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:23,982
I only have one testicle.

595
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:25,667
Gross.

596
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:31,629
<i>I have all the parts of my body!</i>

597
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Look at that!

598
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:40,301
This is the greatest country to live in

599
00:34:40,438 --> 00:34:43,218
and sell your body
to strangers in the world.

600
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,743
Amen.

601
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,222
All right, I can do this. Stay calm.

602
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:55,142
There's got to be something in here
I can use to escape.

603
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:57,669
What's this?

604
00:34:58,442 --> 00:34:59,646
Road flare?

605
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:04,721
Quite a sight, isn't it?

606
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,773
All right, watch your heads.

607
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:16,616
<i>Help! Help!</i>

608
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:18,568
<i>Quick! Quick, I... Help!</i>

609
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:23,429
Well, we did it.

610
00:35:23,918 --> 00:35:25,025
We won.

611
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,736
Camden's back, the fair is back.

612
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,579
The spirit of independence is back.

613
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:33,100
<i>America rocks!</i>

614
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:36,800
<i>America rocks!</i>

615
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:40,794
Yeah, it's a great Fourth of July.

616
00:35:40,991 --> 00:35:43,162
I guess we got a little carried away,
though.

617
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,392
But nobody ever saved any lives
by not getting carried away.

618
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:50,386
That Hickey character agreed not
to sue us for torturing him

619
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:52,665
if we dropped
all the charges against him.

620
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:54,605
So all in all, a good day.

621
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,727
Terrorists 1...

622
00:35:57,203 --> 00:35:58,451
Cops 1...

623
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:00,076
tie score.

624
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:01,903
Your move, terrorists.

625
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:04,424
Thanks, Kenny.

626
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:09,041
I know cops aren't supposed
to show emotion,

627
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:10,478
but damn it, this town...

628
00:36:10,566 --> 00:36:11,641
I'm so proud.

629
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:13,874
The heroes and them...

630
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:18,255
Do you ever feel so American

631
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:22,068
that you just want to be American
with another American male?

632
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,649
I think I see
what you're getting at here, Kenny.

633
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:28,436
And believe me,
I've thought about it.

634
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:30,253
You're a very attractive man.

635
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:32,696
But I'm catholic.

636
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:34,895
It's a no go.

637
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:56,439
<i>Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when they...</i>

638
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:59,281
<i>After that, the prisoners treated
Randy differently.</i>

639
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:02,215
<i>In fact, they started treating him
like one of their own.</i>

640
00:37:02,311 --> 00:37:06,274
Randy, it's cool that you're famous.
I'm famous, too.

641
00:37:06,698 --> 00:37:09,221
I won the $350 millions mega ball.

642
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:11,143
Then I shot my dad.

643
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:12,685
That was stupid.

644
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:16,228
Oh, yeah, you were on the news.
"The million dollar moron."

645
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,814
"Multi-million dollar moron."

646
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:21,863
That was me.

648
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:28,632
So you actually know Tim Stack?

649
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,798
He's funny. I'd like to kidnap him.

650
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:36,206
Spend some time with him.
Then maybe, set him on fire.

651
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,569
Yeah, he would be funny on fire.

652
