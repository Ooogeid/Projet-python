00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:01,705
<i>There's nothing more romantic</i>

2
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:04,740
<i>than the morning after a honeymoon
with your new bride.</i>

3
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:07,174
You change your own sheets today.

4
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:10,180
Last night...

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,396
I mean, that was... ooh!

6
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:14,100
I didn't get too rough with you?

7
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:17,687
It's nothing a bucket of ice
on my husband parts can't fix.

8
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,785
I have a little surprise for you.

9
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:22,192
I started up my own list.

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,362
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,364
This is fantastic!

12
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:28,978
You're actually...?

13
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:30,617
Give me a second.

14
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,373
Thank you, Karma!
You gave me the best woman in the world!

15
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:39,208
Screw you!
I came to this motel to die!

16
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:41,371
Stop showing off your happiness.

17
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,083
Somebody help!
My hooker stopped breathing!

18
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:46,883
Sorry, it's just that
I finally found my soul mate...

19
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:49,606
My bad.

20
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:52,040
Sorry for the outburst.

22
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:57,227
The neighbors send their regards.

23
00:00:58,034 --> 00:00:59,771
GIRL EARL

24
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,525
<i>I knew marriage was about give and take.</i>

25
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:06,276
<i>I just didn't realize
how much I'd have to give</i>

26
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:08,109
<i>and how much Billie would take.</i>

27
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,448
What's going on with the chips, honey?

28
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,617
Sharing. It's what married people do.

29
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:16,358
It's just that I have everything
timed out for crunch, sandwich, crunch.

30
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:17,835
Now that you took that chip,

31
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:20,667
I'm going to be left with one bite
of sandwich and no crunch.

32
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:22,544
But that's crazy, baby.

33
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:26,464
That's not crazy.
Just what I like to do.

34
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:29,634
Yeah, but I'm a sharer.
I mean, that's just who I am.

35
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:33,012
When you marry a woman you hardly know,
you've to learn a lot about her quickly.

36
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:35,337
<i>And that's what I was doing with Billie.</i>

37
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,770
<i>I learned she always kept track
of my comings and goings.</i>

38
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,941
- Where are you going?
- Soda machine.

39
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:42,642
- What are you getting?
- Soda.

40
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:45,076
- When are you coming back?
- When I get soda.

41
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:46,260
Love you!

42
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,488
<i>I learned she had different ideas
about clothes than I did.</i>

43
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,243
Oh, my God!
What do you think?

44
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,219
I can't breathe.

45
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,910
<i>And I learned a little bit
about her boundaries.</i>

46
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,163
<i>She had none.</i>

47
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:02,542
Private time.

48
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:05,205
- Shy pee-er in here.
- Don't be ridiculous.

49
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,255
We're married now.
You don't have to be shy.

50
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:09,424
Is it always that color?

51
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,519
This song is lame.

52
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,679
Someone has to take control
of this jukebox.

53
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,853
I'm going to go put on some Van Halen.

54
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,768
Sweet! J-19, <i>Running With the Devil</i>.

55
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:21,264
Ew! No!

56
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:22,562
The Real Van Halen,

57
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:23,890
with Sammy Hagar.

58
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:29,326
I don't get it, Randy.

59
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:31,651
Clearly Karma wants
me and Billie to be together,

60
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:34,815
but there's 20 songs on that jukebox
of David Lee Roth Van Halen.

61
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:36,659
And she spends good money on Hagar?

62
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:39,341
I know, Earl,
but a lot of people like him.

63
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:41,081
That's why it's on the jukebox.

64
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:44,167
Maybe so, but what about that crap
she pulled with the chips?

65
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,586
Some people don't mind sharing chips.

66
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,154
Please. It's no big deal.

67
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,995
I'll get a crunch next time.

68
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,601
Everybody's got
some little annoying habits, Earl.

69
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:02,852
Even you.

70
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:06,017
Like when you're thinking,
you always raise just one eyebrow.

71
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:07,524
I hate that.

72
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,521
<i>Maybe Randy was right.</i>

73
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,288
<i>Maybe the problem wasn't my wife.</i>

74
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,154
<i>Maybe the problem was me.</i>

75
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:17,296
Great jukebox.

76
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,411
They even have some Lynyrd Skynyrd
from after the plane crash.

77
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:23,540
<i>I decided to focus on the one thing
I knew we could agree on:</i>

78
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,001
<i>the list.</i>

79
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,292
Let's see...

80
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:28,128
what should we do first on your list?

81
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,130
Hey, this guy's on my list, too.

82
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,590
<i>In Camden County
if you were a champion bagger,</i>

83
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,226
<i>it usually meant
that you bagged a lot of chicks.</i>

84
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,170
<i>But Joel was a different kind of bagger.</i>

85
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,568
You're watching
Camden's own Joel Maloney

86
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,402
demonstrating a skill that's earned him

87
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,991
a place
in the National Bagging Competition

88
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:48,242
scheduled to kick off tomorrow
in beautiful Youngstown, Ohio,

89
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,941
rivet capital of the world.

90
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:51,600
Joel, are you nervous?

91
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,749
<i>Kind of, but...</i>

92
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:55,965
<i>this is what everybody who's ever
worked at a grocery store dreams of:</i>

93
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:57,824
<i>bringing home that golden sack!</i>

94
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:01,202
- That loser is going out of town.
- We should clean him out.

95
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:05,164
I'm sick of those grocery workers
acting like they're better than us.

96
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:06,523
<i>And once word spread,</i>

97
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:09,231
<i>every criminal in Camden
decided to go shopping.</i>

98
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:12,392
<i>As a courtesy, everyone who stole
from Joel left the TV on</i>

99
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:14,879
<i>so the others could see
when he was on his way back.</i>

100
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:17,441
<i>I'm here live
at the National Bagging Competition</i>

101
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,952
<i>with one of the hot, young newcomers
on the scene this year, Joel Maloney.</i>

102
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,614
Joel, congratulations
<i></i>on your first round victory.

103
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:27,306
<i>Most people don't realize
how exhausting competitive bagging is.</i>

104
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:30,629
<i>I had to run out and put quarters
in the parking meter, but...</i>

105
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:31,733
<i>thanks.</i>

106
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:35,460
<i>The longer poor Joel competed,
the emptier his house got.</i>

107
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,865
<i>And, Billie, just like everyone else,</i>

108
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,658
<i>wanted a piece of the action.</i>

109
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:43,891
You should've got here earlier.

110
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:47,002
Guess all you get's the broom.

111
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,793
You can have the broom.

112
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,584
I'll take the fan.

113
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:01,094
<i>Joel Maloney just put
an exclamation point on this one!</i>

114
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:02,919
<i>It's the third day of competion</i>

115
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,597
<i>and nobody's come within 12 nectarines
of the pride of Camden.</i>

116
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:08,260
<i>By the time we got there,</i>

117
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,797
<i>people had already stolen
everything that wasn't nailed down.</i>

118
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,292
<i>So we took what was.</i>

119
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,432
<i>I know you're disappointed, Joel,</i>

120
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:17,807
<i>but second place
is still something to be proud of.</i>

121
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:21,745
<i>What are you going to do with
that $25 gift certificate to Applebee's?</i>

122
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:24,410
<i>I guess I'll go to Applebee's.</i>

123
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,686
<i>Joel thought he was disappointed then,</i>

124
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:33,003
<i>but it was about to get a lot worse.</i>

125
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:35,921
<i>Of course when Joel came home
with his gift certificate,</i>

126
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,369
<i>he saw that his house was trashed.</i>

127
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:46,821
<i>The first stop in repaying Joel
was to visit Joy's tipped-over trailer</i>

128
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:49,185
<i>to get back his carpet and his TV.</i>

129
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:50,311
Excuse me.

130
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,398
Just curious, but how do you use
the bathroom in here?

131
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,150
Joy put a seat on the exhaust fan.

132
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,736
Neighbors hate it,
but it works like a dream.

133
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,242
When we were first married,

134
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:06,667
was there stuff
about each other that we...

135
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:09,122
had trouble getting used to?

136
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,505
Oh, God, yeah.

137
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,088
Your stupid chip crunch thing,
that eyebrow,

138
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,254
and the foreplay. Darnell, you wouldn't
have believed this guy's foreplay.

139
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:19,436
It was just a wrestling match
to see who got to be on the bottom.

140
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,032
I bet that was a hoot to watch.

141
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:24,512
You all red-faced,
trying to get out of doing work.

142
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:26,597
It wasn't that.
I liked looking up at her.

143
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:28,389
Oh, you were just lazy.

144
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,367
But I accepted it.
That's all a marriage is...

145
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:34,698
accepting the annoying crap
your partner makes you put up with.

146
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:36,711
That's even true in the animal kingdom.

147
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,110
You think the tomcat likes
the way the lady cat screeches

148
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:42,155
when he humps her?
He keeps coming back to hit that kitty.

149
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,605
This carpet's got
a lot of memories, Earl.

150
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:55,263
Remember when I took it up on the roof
and tried to fly on it?

151
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:57,300
Hard to forget.
You cracked your head open

152
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,557
and for three weeks you thought you were
president of an insurance company.

153
00:07:00,677 --> 00:07:02,967
- You tried to fire me.
- Nothing personal, Earl.

154
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:06,641
You just weren't making the sales.
Aunt Shirley from Accounting hated you.

155
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,236
Man, brains are funny.

156
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:10,325
You shake them around hard enough
and it's like,

157
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:12,817
"Whoa, who's steering this ship?"

158
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:15,725
<i>What do you want?</i>

159
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,413
Hi, my name is Billie.

160
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,475
I once did a bad thing to you,
but I have this list,

161
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:25,185
and you're on it
and I want to make up for it.

162
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,371
Is this some kind of trick?

163
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,797
No really, we're sorry
for stealing your stuff.

164
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,250
We brought it back.

165
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:43,322
<i>I told Joel
that once we put the carpet back down,</i>

166
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,141
<i>it'd be like we never took it.</i>

167
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,928
Don't worry, we'll get it cleaned.

168
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,097
And we'll get you
some new rabbit ears for the TV.

169
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:52,190
I sent Randy to go get some, but...

170
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:55,686
nah, you don't want to hear
the end of that story.

171
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:57,408
It doesn't matter.

172
00:07:57,664 --> 00:08:01,024
The robbery was far from the worst thing
that happened that day.

173
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:15,033
<i>The graffiti hurt Joel's feelings,</i>

174
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:19,080
<i>and the stud behind the graffiti
broke most of the bones in Joel's hand.</i>

175
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:27,147
I was never able to compete again.

176
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:30,763
It's been swollen and twisted
like this for seven years.

177
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:32,390
During year four,

178
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,940
I tried to hammer it flat, but...

179
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,727
I think it just made it worse.

180
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,981
Enjoy your ceiling fan.

181
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,817
Excuse me a minute.

182
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:48,739
You can't cross Joel off your list yet.

183
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,020
Why not?
I gave him back the ceiling fan.

184
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,202
- That's what I stole from him.
- We need to do more.

185
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:56,497
We took away his dream
of ever winning a national championship.

186
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:59,083
Of bagging.
I mean, look at him.

187
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:01,127
He's a sweaty guy.

188
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,159
He's just psyched
to have his fan back.

189
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,297
Take care, Joel.

190
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,083
<i>I was stunned.</i>

191
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:11,004
<i>We didn't just disagree
about chips and sandwiches</i>

192
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:14,002
<i>or peeing with the door open
or how to spell "warehouse,"</i>

193
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:17,514
<i>we also didn't agree on the most
important thing in my life: the list.</i>

194
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:23,149
You seem to have a lot of room here.

195
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,694
Do you think you might want
to adopt an earless rabbit?

196
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:32,450
<i>I was disappointed
Billie had given up on Joel.</i>

197
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,575
<i>But I still had a job to do.</i>

198
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,459
<i>Joel was just a store sweeper now</i>

199
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,353
<i>and it made me sick to see how
this great competitor was humiliated.</i>

200
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:46,576
I appreciate your good intentions, Earl.

201
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:49,884
A round-trip ticket to anywhere
Greyhound goes is a very generous offer,

202
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:51,636
but I'm fine.

203
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:53,128
Hey, southclaw!

204
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:54,764
Price check on peas.

205
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,434
Nice catch, southclaw's friend.

206
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,596
That was a nice catch.

207
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,152
Wow, you're a natural!

208
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,113
- Natural what?
- A natural bagger.

209
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:18,228
Hands that special
are a rare gift, Earl.

210
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:21,357
Some say Jesus had hands like that,

211
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:25,419
and that he fit every food item
from the Last Supper into one bag.

212
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,797
If only I had your hands now,

213
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:30,414
instead of this clump
of spastic meat.

214
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,929
Earl, that's it.
That's what you could do for me.

215
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:39,559
Yeah, I'd love to find a simpler way
to help you without giving you my hands.

216
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,111
No, I don't want your hands.
I want to train them.

217
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:44,981
I'll never be a champion,
but I can make one.

218
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:48,442
Work with me, and we'll win
the National Bagger title together.

219
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:50,861
Me? I never even
graduated high school.

220
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,147
That doesn't matter.

221
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:55,709
With my knowledge and
your incredible ability to grab things,

222
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,493
we could do this, Earl.

223
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:01,690
Together, we'll be unstoppable.

224
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,520
<i>So Joel started training me.</i>

225
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,151
<i>It was like Rocky meets
Supermarket Sweep.</i>

226
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,802
Don't see the food.

227
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,293
Feel the food.

228
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:17,146
Come on, come on, come on!

229
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:20,724
Come on, do it again!
You can do this!

230
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:25,202
Come on!

231
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:32,528
Again!

232
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:40,374
There. You crossed your right
hand under your left,

233
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:42,973
and then you had to uncross it
before you reached for the next item.

234
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,803
- Did you see that?
- I think so.

235
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:47,048
You think so?!
Let's watch it again.

236
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,407
<i>And then, just like that,</i>

237
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:55,609
<i>all the drills, the sweat,
it all clicked into place.</i>

238
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,763
I got it! I got it!

239
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:03,747
<i>In fact, I got it so much that I won
the 1st round of the tournament.</i>

240
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:05,800
Bag Blue, winner!

241
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:09,035
<i>How about a big hand
for newcomer Earl Hickey,</i>

242
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:11,495
<i>who's moving on to the Elite Eight!</i>

243
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:14,578
<i>I also won the 2nd round</i>

244
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:16,835
<i>against some schmo
from Schenectady.</i>

245
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:20,178
<i>And Barry Schmo heads home
with an empty sack!</i>

246
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:24,274
<i>And in a tough one, I took care
of Angry Gustav from Baltimore.</i>

247
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,365
Bag Blue...

248
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,173
<i>Clean up on table two.</i>

249
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,859
<i>And that put me in the finals
against Lance Parker,</i>

250
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,460
<i>a giant in the bagging world.</i>

251
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,385
<i>He also went by the name
of Bagger Lance.</i>

252
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:38,928
Can I have your autograph?

253
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,557
You want that on paper or plastic?

254
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,701
This kid just asked
for my autograph.

255
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:47,588
I said,
"You want that on paper or plastic?"

256
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,929
He's a 12-time champion, Earl.
You got to beat him!

257
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:53,580
Don't worry, Joel.

258
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,000
It's in the bag.

259
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,704
<i>Backstage, Randy tried
to keep me loose.</i>

260
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,374
Man, Earl, your glutes
are really tight.

261
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:02,827
Probably 'cause you got
your hands on my glutes.

262
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:06,997
Sorry I'm late.
I was just finishing up my list.

263
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,417
- You finished it already?
- Yeah.

264
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:13,918
- How could you finish so fast?
- Maybe she did them in order.

265
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:16,162
I keep telling you,
if we did yours in order,

266
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:18,426
at least we'd have some idea
how we're doing.

267
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,827
I called everyone up,
and said I was sorry.

268
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,215
So, the tourists
you carjacked and robbed,

269
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,266
you just said you were sorry?

270
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:27,726
Well, actually,
they're back in Japan,

271
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:29,824
and the Japanese hunt whales,
and that's bad,

272
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,230
so I figured it was a wash.

273
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,274
And you feel fine about that?

274
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:37,156
Yeah. Karma doesn't have to be
as hard as you make it, Earl.

275
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:41,240
Three years and you haven't even
finished half the stuff on your list?

276
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:44,285
I had to take two weeks
off for the chicken pox.

277
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:47,831
All I am saying is,
work smarter, not harder.

278
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:51,965
It looks like the student
is becoming the master.

279
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,794
How you like that, Grasshopper?

280
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,823
<i>When you're married,
you have to bite your tongue</i>

281
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:01,853
<i>over the little things that don't matter
but some things matter a lot.</i>

282
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,725
This one's not me.

283
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,391
- What?
- This one is not me.

284
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:11,134
Maybe I was wrong to complain about
crunch, sandwich, crunch,

285
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:12,646
or whose Van Halen's better,

286
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:15,696
but this is Karma
we're talking about here. Karma!

287
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:17,902
- You're wrong!
- Are you gonna cry?

288
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:20,289
I don't know. Maybe.
But I do know,

289
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,703
you don't half-ass something
just to get it done.

290
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:25,071
Whether it's competive bagging
or doing the list,

291
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:28,587
especially the list. You pour
your whole damn heart into it!

292
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,414
Or, what the hell's the point?

293
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,167
And how do you like it
when someone pokes you, huh?

294
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:36,795
Finger! Finger! Finger! Finger!

295
00:14:37,122 --> 00:14:39,169
- What the hell?!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:41,011
I acted on instinct.

297
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,220
I have bad finger-pointing memories.
I had a very picky mother.

298
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,681
At least you know
never to do that again.

299
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:51,060
Good luck out there, you.

300
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:57,423
I think it's broken.

301
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:01,119
I know how to fix that.
You just twist it back the other way.

302
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:03,073
- Randy, let go!
- Hang in there, Earl.

303
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,222
I'm only about halfway around.

304
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,411
<i>Didn't make sense.</i>

305
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:11,871
<i>Karma had brought me and Billie together
so I could teach her to do her list,</i>

306
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:14,208
<i>but instead,
now I couldn't do mine.</i>

307
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:15,501
That hurt?

308
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:19,054
Yup, it's broken.
If I let you go back there like this,

309
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:21,389
they could pull my bagging
competition inspection license,

310
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,703
and I can't remember
the Web site where I got it.

311
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,594
So, I'll inform the judges.

312
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:30,266
So sorry, Joel.
I hope you're not mad at me.

313
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,973
Look, Earl,

314
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,396
you reminded me
that some things are worth living for.

315
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,890
And then you took that away.

316
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,775
So, of course I'm mad at you.

317
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,952
Hey, you each have one good hand.

318
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,260
Together, you have two good hands,

319
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,822
four good eyes, pretty smiles.

320
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:49,721
You guys are handsome.

321
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:52,621
Wait.
Where was I going with this again?

322
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,402
Randy's right,
we do have two good hands.

323
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:59,211
Joel, get the rule book.

324
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:02,633
Can I have your attention?

325
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,801
Due to a forfeit,
this year's Golden Sack Award goes to...

326
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:09,680
Earl's gonna bag?

327
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:12,329
Ladies and gentlemen,
Earl Hickey's gonna bag!

328
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,190
And he's gonna bag with me.

329
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,448
The rule book doesn't say
that two people can't bag.

330
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:19,055
It just says
you can only use two hands.

331
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:23,444
- This is outrageous.
- No.

332
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:24,941
Let 'em do it.

333
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:27,698
I'll beat both these turkeys
at the same time.

334
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,108
Mano a mano.

335
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:30,906
A mano.

336
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:40,691
Isn't she something?

337
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:43,130
Jennifer Jackson, this year's
Miss Bag On Her Head.

338
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,094
Okay, baggers,

339
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:47,426
take your marks, get set.

340
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:48,844
Bag! Bag! Bag!

341
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:54,790
<i>Bagger Lance had both his hands
perfectly coordinated.</i>

342
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,125
<i>We did not.</i>

343
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:03,018
<i>Lance was so good,
he was even hamming it up for the crowd.</i>

344
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:09,956
Bag Red.

345
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,510
Anyway, the vet said
he should be able

346
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,857
to live a completely
normal rabbit life.

347
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:18,576
He just won't be able
to hear long distances.

348
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:19,884
I told you, Randy.

349
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:23,193
I'll only take him if you let me
make him into stew.

350
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:27,072
<i>Lance had gotten a head start,
but we finally found our rhythm, too.</i>

351
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:33,295
Bag Blue!

352
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:45,901
Bag Red!

353
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:50,572
<i>We were still a little behind,
so we had to step it up.</i>

354
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:53,321
Bag Blue!

355
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:55,888
<i>Since Bagger Lance was
a 12-time champion,</i>

356
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,976
<i>he started
getting a little overconfident,</i>

357
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:00,516
<i>and he reached for a pineapple
too recklessly.</i>

358
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:01,792
I'm cut!

359
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,461
<i>But even that didn't slow him down.</i>

360
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,694
<i>Lance was the best bagger
I'd ever seen.</i>

361
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:09,142
- Stupid fruit!
- <i>And I'd seen five.</i>

362
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,593
<i>We didn't have more hands
than he did,</i>

363
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:13,679
<i>but what we did have
was more hearts.</i>

364
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,946
Tangelo!

365
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,155
Bag Blue.

366
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,658
Earl won! He did it!

367
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:36,888
We get to go home now.

368
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,115
What a victory.
Congratulations, gentlemen.

369
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:47,938
- You just bagged yourself a trophy.
- No, we double bagged it.

370
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:53,427
Maybe some people think
this bagging stuff is silly,

371
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:55,006
but it's been my life's passion

372
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,723
ever since my first
trip to a grocery store.

373
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:59,807
Stepping on that black pad,

374
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,781
the doors whistling open,

375
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,601
the beep of the scanner.

376
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:05,564
Anyway,

377
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:07,649
you gave me my life back.

378
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,110
Nice bagging, Joel!

379
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:11,927
Thanks, ladies.

380
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,533
Grocery groupies.
They love a winner.

381
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:19,661
Anyway,
thanks for everything, Earl.

382
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,331
You're welcome, Joel.

383
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:28,679
I get it now.

384
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,256
I wasn't putting my whole heart
into this list thing.

385
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,551
But seeing how hard
you two worked up there,

386
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,858
and seeing how proud Joel is now...

387
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:40,220
Well, how proud both of you are.

388
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:41,642
I get it.

389
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:44,176
That means more to me than you know.

390
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,730
<i>It did mean a lot,
'cause if me and Billie</i>

391
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,609
<i>could see eye-to-eye about Karma,</i>
<i>maybe we were gonna be all right after.</i>

392
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:54,191
You know what I was thinking
when you were standing up there?

393
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:56,330
You should lose the mustache.

394
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:00,744
You need to shave it.

395
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,687
- I don't like her.
- She's got to go.
