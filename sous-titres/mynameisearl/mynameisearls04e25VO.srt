INSIDE PROBE (PART 1)

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:07,430
<i>Ernie's Crab Shack
was named after three things:</i>

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:10,927
<i>the food they're most famous for,
the type of building it was</i>

4
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,895
<i>and the owner, Ernie Belcher.</i>

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,655
<i>And after 54 years
of being in business,</i>

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,961
<i>the crabs and the shack
are still around</i>

7
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,132
<i>but old Ernie's been missing
for years.</i>

8
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:23,533
<i>And until today, we never thought
we'd find out what happened to him.</i>

9
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:26,067
It's coming on!
Oh, my God, it's coming on!

10
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,235
It's coming on! It's coming on!

11
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:29,915
It's coming on!

12
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,595
Our <i>Inside Probe</i>
is finally coming on!

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,513
I can't believe they're gonna air that.
It's been like eight years.

14
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:39,330
- I wonder what took them so long.
- Actually, that's my fault.

15
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,319
Now that I'm no longer in protection,
I was able to sign the release papers.

16
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,361
Next week,
my <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> will air.

17
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:47,713
All day long
with that witness protection mess.

18
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,231
How long you gonna milk that thing?
We all we got stories we're proud of.

19
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:53,302
I went to the prom
as a sixth grader.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,345
Shut up.

21
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:56,067
It's starting.

22
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:02,687
<i>Hi, I'm Geraldo Rivera,
sitting in for Stone Phillips,</i>

23
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:05,687
who's recovering from
some pretty serious plastic surgery.

24
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:08,239
Welcome to another edition
of <i>Inside Probe</i>.

25
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:11,153
Eight years ago,
we visited the small town of Camden,

26
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,811
where a search for the missing owner
of a seafood restaurant

27
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:17,307
uncovered some "fishy" details

28
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,870
and an "ocean" of possibilities.

29
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,856
Tonight, on <i>Inside Probe</i>,
a small town bar...

30
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,532
a likeable restaurant owner,
Ernie Belcher, disappears.

31
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:27,709
Was it murder?

32
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,579
And if so, who did it?

33
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:33,068
Why would someone want
Ernie Belcher out of the picture?

34
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,429
What surprises did the local police
have in store for them?

35
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,848
And what is this guy talking about?

36
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:40,967
Two days to find a way to get

37
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,788
four foreigners on time,

38
00:01:42,913 --> 00:01:46,213
right outta here's
where you and your sister bedposts

39
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,488
want me to go in the first place!

40
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,607
Join us for the next 30 minutes,
as we probe inside

41
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:56,431
the case of the disappearance
of the Crab Shack's Ernie Belcher

42
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:58,868
in "Claws Of Death: Unknown."

43
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,327
It's back on! It's back on!

44
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,888
To fully understand
the disappearance of Ernie Belcher,

45
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,725
first, you have to understand
the town of Camden.

46
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,603
And to understand
the town of Camden,

47
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:21,411
you have to understand
the people who live here

48
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:24,289
in this town
nestled in the heart of America.

49
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,115
Hey, Herardo, fuck you!

50
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,391
<i>Earl Jehosaphat Hickey.</i>

51
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:34,326
<i>Born and raised in Camden County,</i>

52
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:36,901
<i>Earl epitomizes
the Camden experience.</i>

53
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:40,199
<i>Brought into the world
as an innocent young child</i>

54
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:42,167
<i>full of hopes and dreams,</i>

55
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,995
<i>only to eventually realize</i>

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,109
<i>he is stuck in this dead-end town
for the rest of his life.</i>

57
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,748
<i>Hope turns to despair.</i>

58
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,753
<i>And often in towns like this,</i>

59
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,172
<i>crime is seen as the only way out.</i>

60
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,046
<i>And Mr. Hickey is
no stranger to crime,</i>

61
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:58,427
<i>with 77 misdemeanors under his belt.</i>

62
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,389
<i>Hickey steals anything
he can get his hands on,</i>

63
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,849
<i>including, apparently,
one of our cameras.</i>

64
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:08,043
<i>Look at me! I'm Herardo.</i>

65
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:11,495
<i>And when he's not committing
petty thefts,</i>

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,659
<i>he's at his favorite restaurant,
Ernie's Crab Shack,</i>

67
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:16,362
<i>enjoying his favorite food:</i>

68
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:17,953
<i>beer.</i>

69
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,434
Everyone loved Ernie.

70
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,774
He was funny.

71
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:24,870
Sometimes when you weren't looking,
he'd drop a peanut in your beer.

72
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:27,543
When you'd get to the end of your beer,
you'd be, like,

73
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:30,068
"Whoa, where'd that peanut
come from?"

74
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,642
Sure enough,
every time, you'd look up,

75
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:34,922
and there would be old Ernie
with a smile on his face.

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,340
Like that dude who ate a canary.

77
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:41,442
<i>Randy Hickey, the younger
and - if you can believe it -</i>

78
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,013
<i>stupider brother of Earl Hickey.</i>

79
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,867
<i>Randall Doo Hickey
was Camden County's first-ever</i>

80
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:49,454
<i>unintentional underwater birth.</i>

81
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,857
<i>At an early age,
he developed a love for guns,</i>

82
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:54,733
<i>smashing things with shovels</i>

83
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,051
<i>and balancing things on his head.</i>

84
00:03:57,363 --> 00:04:00,603
<i>But eventually,
Randy turned to crime, as well,</i>

85
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:03,715
<i>also with 77 misdemeanors
under his belt.</i>

86
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:06,109
<i>Randy is a classic example of</i>

87
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,126
<i>"dummy see, dummy do."</i>

88
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,300
<i>Like everyone in this town,</i>

89
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:13,127
<i>Randy has
his own fond memories of Ernie.</i>

90
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:15,776
Ernie taught me how to tie my shoes.

91
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:18,852
I've know him for a long time.
Almost two years.

92
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,719
Ernie used to let me play
the claw machine for free,

93
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,939
but if I got a prize
bigger than my fist,

94
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,433
I had to throw it back.

95
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,567
I don't know where he went,
but I'm sure he'll come home soon.

96
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:31,292
Sometimes
people just go away for a while.

97
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:34,231
Aliens take 'em for a ride
on their spaceship.

98
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,168
I'm always
on the lookout for aliens.

99
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:38,726
I'm not scared of 'em.

100
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,572
I just want to make sure
I don't miss my turn to take a ride.

101
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:45,328
Randy, are those your toenails
in the ice cube tray?

102
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,078
<i>Joy Farrah Hickey,</i>

103
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:48,996
<i>wife of Earl Hickey.</i>

104
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:51,264
<i>Born Joy Farrah Darville,</i>

105
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,252
<i>this blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty
always had dreams of stardom.</i>

106
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:57,344
<i>But when those dreams faded,</i>

107
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:59,769
<i>she, too, turned to a life of crime.</i>

108
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:03,524
<i>This low-rent Bonnie
to Hickey's half-wit Clyde</i>

109
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,886
<i>has a rap sheet
with crimes ranging from</i>

110
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,765
<i>impersonating the handicapped,</i>

111
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,830
<i>huffing stolen paint,
and robbing the Afro Hut.</i>

112
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:15,012
<i>We caught up with Joy at her home
in the Pimmit Hills trailer park.</i>

113
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:17,607
I knew Ernie,

114
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,277
but I didn't know Ernie
as good as everybody else.

115
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:23,106
I'm not originally from Camden.

116
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,728
I grew up one town over
in Nathanville.

117
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:27,053
Much classier.

118
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:30,746
My family owns
a very successful water bed business.

119
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:32,956
Anyway, Ernie was cool.

120
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:34,929
One time,

121
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:37,420
this drunk guy tried to dry hump me
in the parking lot

122
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,756
while I was bending over
picking up this nickel I found.

123
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,391
Ernie sprayed him with a water hose.

124
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:46,512
He was always there
for his customers.

125
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:52,113
That crazy son of a bitch
was always spraying me with a hose.

126
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:55,592
<i>If you recognize this man,
you may be among the dozens</i>

127
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:58,305
<i>who have enjoyed his work
on the small screen.</i>

128
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,373
<i>He is Camden County's
own TV's Tim Stack.</i>

129
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:03,970
<i>Supposedly born in Camden County,</i>

130
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:05,421
<i>Tim was found naked,</i>

131
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:08,146
<i>except for a diaper,
in a cucumber patch.</i>

132
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,101
<i>He was 14 years old.</i>

133
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:14,289
<i>Taken in by former Father Joe
and former Father Ed,</i>

134
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:18,109
<i>Tim has blocked out nearly
every memory of his childhood,</i>

135
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:21,630
<i>and now considers himself
to have a healthy addiction to vodka.</i>

136
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,144
I liked Ernie.

137
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:24,469
We had a deal.

138
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:28,335
I used to do a little dinner theater
around here a couple nights a week,

139
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,358
and he wouldn't bother me
when I need to use the bathroom to...

140
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,059
"powder my nose."

141
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:36,465
With a little white lightning.

142
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:40,449
Let's just say it used
to snow a lot back in the day.

143
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,569
I'm talking about cocaine.

144
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:47,771
Tim, man, what was
that pill you gave me?

145
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:49,996
I don't know. What color was it?

146
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:51,997
Is this real life?

147
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,264
Is it going to be like this forever?

148
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:00,586
<i>Wilfrid Dierkes, Tim Stack's agent.</i>

149
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,850
<i>Wilfrid Dierkes
was a weird little kid</i>

150
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:06,708
<i>who grew
into a morbidly obesed teenager,</i>

151
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,483
<i>who shrunk back
into a weird little adult.</i>

152
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,015
Yeah, Tim's a pretty good actor,
and I've got an on-line law degree...

153
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:14,592
so, we got a business

154
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:17,990
where Tim does slip-and-falls
and I settle things out of court.

155
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:20,024
Last year,
we did close to four figures,

156
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,695
which pretty much covered
Tim's medical bills.

157
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,888
Wilfrid,
this one didn't go through, either.

158
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,963
I think it's your library card.

159
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:30,048
<i>Darnell Turner, aka the Crab Man.</i>

160
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,054
<i>Ernie's favorite employee
was evasive about his past,</i>

161
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,829
<i>which could only mean one thing:</i>

162
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,414
Witness Protection.

163
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:40,865
<i>But he could not deny
that he knew more about Ernie</i>

164
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,586
<i>than anyone else in Camden.</i>

165
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:44,189
Ernie was a genius.

166
00:07:44,314 --> 00:07:46,792
He understood that if you introduced
a very low grade of seafood

167
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,593
to a population a little bit at a time,
peoples' stomachs would adapt.

168
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:52,891
And he was right.
You should see the stuff we serve.

169
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:54,515
Basically, it's chum.

170
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:58,644
Aside from coworkers and the customers,
did Ernie have any other friends?

171
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,730
He was good friends
with Michael Waltrip.

172
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,649
<i>NASCAR's Michael Waltrip,</i>

173
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,111
<i>an unlikely friend
to the small-town restaurateur.</i>

174
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:11,410
<i>While in Camden, Michael Waltrip likes
to stay at the Palm Motel,</i>

175
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,586
<i>where, according to their brochure,</i>

176
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,121
<i>if a hooker comes
to your room by mistake,</i>

177
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,046
<i>you don't have to pay her.</i>

178
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,926
I met Ernie at an autograph signing
at a Napa store at Mount Trace,

179
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:23,627
and we just hit it off.

180
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,450
After that, we started hanging out
whenever I came through town.

181
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:27,589
He understood me.

182
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,866
We both had brothers that competed
with us in the same business.

183
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:33,597
My brother Darrell
was a racecar driver, also,

184
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,682
and his brother Quizno,
he invented the toasted sub.

185
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,852
So, how did you
blow off steam together?

186
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,832
Walk through a typical day

187
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:43,313
in the friendship
of Ernie Belcher and Michael Waltrip.

188
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,025
Pool, pinball,
making left-hand turns.

189
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,694
You know, guy stuff.

190
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,864
Aside from you, is there
anyone else special in Ernie's life?

191
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:56,303
Ernie had some lady friends
he was very fond of.

192
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,615
<i>One of those woman
was Catalina Rhona Aruca,</i>

193
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,927
<i>Camden County's first hot immigrant.</i>

194
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:06,086
<i>Catalina was born
in the small town of Guadalatucky.</i>

195
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,610
<i>And came to Camden in a box</i>

196
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:12,134
<i>to seek fame and fortune
in the land of opportunity.</i>

197
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:15,693
<i>The other woman in Ernie's life
was daytime hooker</i>

198
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:17,334
<i>Patricia Michelle Weezmer.</i>

199
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,016
Come back when you're alone.

200
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,883
Got a Father's Day special
all month long.

201
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:25,958
<i>Half Cherokee, Patty spent
the first several years of her life</i>

202
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,783
<i>on an Indian reservation</i>

203
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:31,231
<i>before her mother divorced
her father, Chasing Squirrel,</i>

204
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:33,582
<i>and moved
to their new home in Camden.</i>

205
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,210
<i>Patty splits her time
between selling her body</i>

206
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,194
<i>to strangers during the day</i>

207
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:41,955
<i>and starring in local community
theater productions in the evening.</i>

208
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:43,762
Ernie was the best.

209
00:09:43,993 --> 00:09:45,334
Quick, clean.

210
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,668
Very polite.

211
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,837
"No" really meant "no" with him.

212
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,340
We both kind of dated Ernie
as a team.

213
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,179
He'd come see me dance for a while,
get all worked up,

214
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:56,511
and then take Patty out
in the parking lot.

215
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,629
She'd shake up the bottle,
and I'd pop the cork.

216
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:02,901
It seemed
as if everyone loved Ernie.

217
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:05,625
And they thought
Ernie would be around forever.

218
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,150
And that was true,

219
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:10,734
if by forever
they meant April 9, 2001.

220
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,192
It was a pretty quiet morning.

221
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,690
Officer Lisa...

222
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:19,687
I don't know her last name.
She's around here somewhere.

223
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:21,870
Tall, decent face, small boobies.

224
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,436
Anyway, she brought in some bagels
with pumpkin cream cheese.

225
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:27,459
Delicious.

226
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,187
Yeah, it's like a little pumpkin pie,
but a bagel.

227
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:31,763
You know, so it's good for you.

228
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:35,217
We were enjoying those things,
and then the phone started lighting up.

229
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,390
It's police policy
not to waste resources

230
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,082
looking for a missing person
in the first 24 hours,

231
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,801
they usually show up on their own.

232
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,428
And after 24 hours,

233
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:22,140
if they're still missing,
usually means they're dead,

234
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,443
so we don't look for them
that hard then, either.

235
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,054
- Are you wearing makeup?
- No.

236
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,645
Anyway, when Ernie didn't show up,
we started to think the worst:

237
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,689
Murder.

238
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:36,200
- You're wearing makeup.
- Fine! Yes, I am.

239
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:39,591
You saw me on <i>Cops</i>.
I looked like I hadn't slept in weeks.

240
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:41,921
Could Ernie have been killed?

241
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:43,073
It's possible.

242
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,598
But if so, by who?

243
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,162
In a town where the Little League teams
are sponsored

244
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:50,641
by bail bondsmen, pawnshops
and methadone clinics,

245
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:53,253
how do you narrow down the suspects?

246
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,163
Was it the petty thief?

247
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,111
His simpleton brother?

248
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:59,214
The stay-at-trailer mom?

249
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:01,277
The black coworker?

250
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,388
The immigrant stripper?

251
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:05,113
The so-called celebrity?

252
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:07,315
The small-time agent?

253
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:09,025
The black coworker?

254
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:10,687
Or the daytime hooker?

255
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:13,743
<i>We'll learn more
when</i> Inside Probe <i>returns.</i>

256
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:20,185
- Did they just show me twice?
- I don't think so.

257
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:22,449
I think they showed me twice.

258
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:28,675
<i>Now back to our story.</i>

259
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:32,513
<i>Eight years ago, local Camden
restaurateur Ernie Belcher</i>

260
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:34,388
<i>vanished without a trace.</i>

261
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,230
<i>The problem was figuring out</i>

262
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,955
<i>which small-town lowlife
was responsible.</i>

263
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,419
With no motive, no body,

264
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,513
and a Police Department
fishing trip looming,

265
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,888
Ernie Belcher's case looked like
it was going to be closed.

266
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:49,768
But then police caught a break.

267
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,022
We were searching the victim's office,
standard procedure.

268
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:56,952
We pretend looking for clues,
but it's really just to find stuff

269
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,944
to auction off
at our department fund-raiser.

270
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,134
<i>As they tried to raise money
for their break room Foosball table,</i>

271
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,197
<i>the police found one thing
they could not auction off.</i>

272
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:10,122
<i>Hundreds of threatening letters
addressed to Ernie,</i>

273
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,204
<i>all from this man... Randy Hickey.</i>

274
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,596
<i>Dear Ernie,</i>

275
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:21,180
<i>How dare you stop providing
free toothpicks?</i>

276
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:25,071
<i>What kind of jerk serves corn
and pulled meat</i>

277
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:27,759
<i>and doesn't offer
his customers a way</i>

278
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:31,111
<i>to get those items unlodged
from their teeth.</i>

279
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:35,576
<i>Attached is everything
I've had stuck in my mouth</i>

280
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,508
<i>for the last two weeks.</i>

281
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,283
<i>I hope you choke on it.</i>

282
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,987
And the threats didn't stop there.

283
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:43,295
<i>Dear Ernie,</i>

284
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:47,789
<i>How dare you only serve
my favorite item,</i>

285
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>fish wings, on Wednesdays.</i>

286
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:55,008
<i>I have included a list
of famous people</i>

287
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,706
<i>who agree that fish wings
should be sold every day.</i>

288
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:02,716
<i>Do as we say
or something bad will happen.</i>

289
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,767
Is it possible that a man
could lose his life

290
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,942
over toothpicks and fish wings?

291
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,833
That's what police wanted to know.

292
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:17,191
"Bad things will happen
if fish wings aren't served every day."

293
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,507
What kind of bad things
will happen, Randy?

294
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:21,882
I don't know. People will be angry.

295
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,300
Fish wings are great.

296
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:25,936
The only bad part is,

297
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,864
sometimes the real chewy pieces
get stuck in your teeth.

298
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,467
Which wouldn't be a problem

299
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:33,317
if they'd still offer
free toothpicks, but no!

300
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:34,847
Ernie got rid of the toothpicks

301
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,691
because he said people were just
using 'em to poke each other.

302
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:39,557
But what he didn't realize,

303
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:43,256
is that some of us are using 'em
to get stuff out of our teeth

304
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,941
before we poked each other!

305
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,740
Now we'll have to poke each other
with our fingers

306
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,096
while we got fish wings stuck
in our teeth!

307
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,319
Damn it!

308
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:53,642
Why are you making me
relive this again!

309
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,941
<i>Obviously full of rage.</i>

310
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,939
<i>Police were happy
to have this monster off the streets.</i>

311
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:02,644
<i>But even though
they had a suspect in custody...</i>

312
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:06,128
police were not convinced
that a man who is routinely arrested

313
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,814
for getting stuck in the return box

314
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,317
while trying to steal videos
could kill someone,

315
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,160
and hide the body all by himself.</i>

316
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,020
So they started looking
for an accomplice.

317
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,768
Would you like a cup of coffee?

318
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,922
Tell me where the hell
you and your low-life brother

319
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,946
were the night Ernie disappeared?

320
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,629
Come on, man! It was night.
I don't know where we were.

321
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:31,954
We were drunk.

322
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:33,691
We were pretty desperate.

323
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,438
So I had to deploy
a somewhat advanced

324
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:38,188
interrogation technique.

325
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,814
A little thing
my grandma called "lying."

326
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,774
Well...

327
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:45,339
your brother confessed.

328
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:48,441
If you want to get the same deal he got,
you better confess, too,

329
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:50,662
or you're gonna get
the death penalty for sure.

330
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:52,284
He didn't confess.

331
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,004
You're just trying to get me
to admit something I didn't do.

332
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:57,751
I know all about
reverse biology, buddy.

333
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:00,125
I'm not an idiot.
This isn't going to work.

334
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:02,995
Think it'll work on your brother?

335
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,752
My brother said we did it?
We killed Ernie?

336
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,342
Yep, he said you guys were drunk

337
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,377
and there wasn't anything
good on TV that night,

338
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,304
so you decided to go down
to the Crab Shack

339
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,873
and take Ernie's life.
Any of that ring a bell?

340
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:18,088
Maybe. I mean,
if he said we did it, we probably did.

341
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,045
But I don't know.
It sounds a little strange.

342
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,689
There's usually something
pretty good on TV.

343
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,187
Don't do it! Don't confess!

344
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,049
They're lying to you!

345
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,156
- What's that?
- Oh, that's your brother.

346
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,492
They're bangin his head against the wall
until you confess to killing Ernie.

347
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,579
He'll probably die in the next
few seconds if you don't confess.

348
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,706
Well, then we did it.
We killed Ernie.

349
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,435
With a trial approaching,
and very limited funds,

350
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,810
the Hickey boys were forced to hire

351
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:52,174
the only lawyer they could afford.

352
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,185
<i>Wilford Darcus,
lawyer for poor people.</i>

353
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,502
<i>After a brave negotiation
that ended with a $35 check</i>

354
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,627
<i>written by us to their lawyer,</i>

355
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:07,822
<i>the Hickeys agreed to sit down
with</i> Inside Probe.

356
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:11,136
Your trial's a couple of days away.
It doesn't look good.

357
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,364
What's your strategy?

358
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,149
Well, with the mustached one,
I'm going to plead insanity.

359
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:22,644
And for the big fella here,
I think I'm gonna plead "retarded-ity."

360
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:25,710
- Sounds good.
- Herardo, we didn't do this. Help us!

361
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,215
I can't go to jail!

362
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,749
I had a dream the other night.

363
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:32,122
I went to jail then I got out and
got hit by a car and-and was in a coma.

364
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:33,323
Me in a coma?

365
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:35,948
Come on, man,
nobody wants to see that!

366
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,372
With public opinion against them,
a confession,

367
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,744
and a lawyer
with a law degree from Haiti,

368
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:50,019
the Hickeys looked to be going
away for a long time.

369
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,236
Or were they?

370
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,747
Remember this man...

371
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,198
two-time Daytona 500 winner
Michael Waltrip?

372
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,451
I remember the night
Ernie disappeared.

373
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:01,705
<i>Waltrip agreed
to reenact that night for us</i>

374
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,910
<i>with the help
of our</i> Inside Probe <i>actors.</i>

375
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:07,293
<i>I was driving through Camden
between races,</i>

376
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,725
<i>and I thought why not stop off
and see my old buddy Ernie.</i>

377
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:14,588
<i>I sat in the bar for about an hour,
catching up with Ernie.</i>

378
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:20,021
<i>That's about when this drunk woman
offered to flash me</i>

379
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,225
<i>if I agreed to buy her a beer
and share it with her.</i>

380
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,544
<i>I wasn't drinking, so I declined,</i>

381
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,862
<i>but she flashed me anyway.</i>

382
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,734
<i>The next thing I know,</i>

383
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,183
<i>the woman's husband is
in my face demanding</i>

384
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:35,905
<i>that I not only buy his wife a beer,
but I get him one, too.</i>

385
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:37,615
<i>Then his brother...</i>

386
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,910
<i>he comes up and wants a cheeseburger
for pulling his pants down.</i>

387
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,290
<i>Well, since beers are only a dollar,</i>

388
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,931
<i>I went ahead and bought 'em all one
along with the burger.</i>

389
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,679
<i>Unfortunately for the woman,</i>

390
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,628
<i>think that was her one beer
too many.</i>

391
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,924
<i>The other two
weren't doing much better.</i>

392
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,494
<i>But since they were fun
I decided to hang out with 'em</i>

393
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,175
<i>and be their designated
two-time Daytona 500 winning driver.</i>

394
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:05,682
Fortunely for those guys,
I'm a bit of a shutterbug,

395
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:06,811
I had my camera.

396
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,558
So I got a pretty complete record
of what happened that night.

397
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>With an airtight alibi
from a two-time Daytona 500 winner,</i>

398
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,931
the Hickey boys were released

399
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,245
and sent home to their loved ones,

400
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,070
and <i>Inside Probe</i> was there
for the reunion.

401
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:23,168
We're free!

402
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:29,627
<i>With the Hickey brothers
cleared of all charges</i>

403
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,804
<i>a lot of questions were answered.</i>

404
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:34,292
<i>A lot of questions except one:</i>

405
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,441
Where was Ernie Belcher?

406
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,793
We thought our visit
to Camden was over.

407
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:43,427
But the more <i>Inside Probe</i>
probed the inside,

408
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:44,952
the more we found.

409
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,727
And you're not going to believe
the things we discovered.

410
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:49,990
<i>Next week on</i> Inside Probe<i>:</i>

411
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:52,915
<i>the baffling case
of Ernie Belcher continues.</i>

412
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:56,590
<i>So if he wasn't murdered,
what did happen to him?</i>

413
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,630
<i>Was it a long-standing
historical grudge?</i>

414
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:02,943
<i>Or was it something
from out of this world?</i>

415
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,286
And what the heck is this all about?

416
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,113
Join us next week
for an ending so shocking

417
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:10,838
you will * your pants.

418
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:12,598
<i>Inside Probe</i>...

419
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:15,104
<i>next Thursday at 8:00, 7:00 Central.</i>

420
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,259
Are you kidding?

421
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,051
We have to wait a whole week
to find out what happened to Ernie?

422
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,649
- That's ridiculous.
- I know.

423
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:26,683
Why didn't they show the whole thing
in a special one-hour episode?

424
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:29,424
The network executives probably
didn't order enough episodes

425
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,113
of <i>Inside Probe</i> for a whole season,

426
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:33,429
so they had to stretch it out
over two weeks.

427
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:35,677
That way they don't have to air
a repeat during sweeps.

428
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,444
Network executives.
They sure take the cake.

429
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:42,699
Plus they don't let people cuss anymore
on TV until a certain time at night.

430
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:47,838
Douche bags.
