1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:02,773
<i>Tradition at the Crab Shack was,</i>

2
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:06,174
<i>if you passed out the week
before Christmas, you got decorated.</i>

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,717
<i>I wanted to join in,</i>

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,604
<i>but there were certain times
when I needed to be looking after Randy.</i>

5
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:12,428
<i>Like when he was reading the comics.</i>

6
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,928
Oh, God! That's terrible.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,789
That's not funny at all.

8
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:22,161
Randy, remember,
comics are only on the left.

9
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:25,266
If y keep reading, you'll run
onto the side with the obituaries.

10
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,756
- So what do we do?
- Fold the paper.

11
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:31,822
Three, two, one...

12
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:38,985
What have I told you?
If you're going to decorate the drunks,

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,666
please have a fire extinguisher
standing by.

14
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,544
ORPHAN EARL

15
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:51,300
Excuse me.

16
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,848
My wife and I were driving home
from building Nerf playgrounds

17
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:56,097
for autistic children,
and we ran out of gas.

18
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,659
She would have come with me,

19
00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:00,351
but she's shy because we had
to sell her hair for baby formula.

20
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,186
If you'd loan me a 20,
I'll mail it back to you.

21
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:06,076
Goodness me,
that is such a sad story,

22
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:08,567
and there were so many details,
it has to be true.

23
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,208
Would you mind sharing it
with my friends inside?

24
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,050
I'm sure they'd love to help.

25
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:21,453
And then he said he had a bold wife
who sold her hair for...

26
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:23,323
What was it she sold it for?

27
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:24,645
Baby formula.

28
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:31,717
What an idiot.

29
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,276
The baby formula is man plus woman.

30
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:35,993
Everybody knows that.

31
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,641
<i>That hustler coming in here
reminded me of #201 on my list:</i>

32
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:43,144
<i>"Conned an old man out
of 100 bucks."</i>

33
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:45,706
<i>A couple weeks
before I discovered Karma,</i>

34
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>me and Joy were watching TV.</i>

35
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,815
<i>There are
one million orphans in Africa.</i>

36
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,047
<i>These children do not ask,
"What shall I eat for diner?"</i>

37
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,390
<i>They ask, "Will I ever eat again?"</i>

38
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:58,651
Change the channel, I can't eat
while I'm looking at that kid.

39
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:00,849
I'll try, but my hands are saucy.

40
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:02,237
<i>For pennies a day,</i>

41
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:05,082
<i>you can make sure little Kwami
has rice and broth to eat,</i>

42
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:07,856
<i>instead of bowl after bowl of mud.</i>

43
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,809
Those kids really pull
at your heartstrings.

44
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:14,182
Makes you think, doesn't it?

45
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,763
We could make a fortune off
those scrawny little tearjerkers.

46
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:21,974
You got rib meat in your teeth.

47
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:23,672
Well, get it.

48
00:02:25,632 --> 00:02:27,229
Man, that's really in there.

49
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,236
Is this true?

50
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:38,949
Nine out of ten African children
die every minute?

51
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,049
Africa's hard on kids,

52
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:44,821
what with the hot sun
and giant leeches and no...

53
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,822
speed limits.

54
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,001
I suppose you want some cash.

55
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,171
<i>The 1st rule of scamming money</i>

56
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:54,221
<i>is to look
like you aren't looking for money.</i>

57
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:56,008
We're not asking for money.

58
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:58,695
But, if you have trouble
sleeping tonight,

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,327
you can just send a check
to the address on the back.

60
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:04,600
<i>The 2nd rule of scamming
was not to tell Randy it was a scam,</i>

61
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,887
<i>there's no better salesman than someone
who believes he's telling the truth.</i>

62
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:09,769
All they're eating is air.

63
00:03:09,894 --> 00:03:13,871
And the orphans' bellies are really big,
but it turns out they're totally empty.

64
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:17,112
And all they're asking for
is a cup of coffee a day.

65
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,114
My God! Nine more just died!

66
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,841
Open your eyes, people!
Take a pamphlet!

67
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:25,637
<i>We handed out 100 pamphlets,
and even went down and got a "PO" box</i>

68
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,944
<i>so the address would look
more official.</i>

69
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:30,131
<i>Most people saw through our scam,</i>

70
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:31,929
<i>but we did get one bite.</i>

71
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:34,088
It worked!

72
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,591
Some guy in Nathanville sent us
a $100 check for the orphans!

73
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,584
Sweet!

74
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:41,867
Why are you getting the money
for the African orphans?

75
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:47,530
Randy, maybe it's time to tell you.

76
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,564
This was a scam.

77
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:51,415
It was?

78
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,883
You always get me.

79
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:55,814
Oh, man!

80
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,236
I cried so much.

81
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,560
I didn't even tell you
about the nightmares I've been having.

82
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:02,741
What a relief.

83
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,202
So there's no starving children
in Africa, then?

84
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:11,737
<i>And so me and Randy
went to find the guy</i>

85
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:14,306
<i>who sent us that check
all those years ago.</i>

86
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,194
Do you know Aunt Ramona wrote
a book about barbecue sauces?

87
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,056
Mom says it bought her a condo.

88
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,728
I think I'm going to write a book
about barbecue sauces.

89
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:27,298
Maybe other sauces, too.

90
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:29,644
Randy, you don't know
anything about sauce.

91
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,673
People write books
about things they know.

92
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,981
Think about how much meat
Aunt Ramona eats.

93
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:37,172
Maybe I could write a book
about how things taste.

94
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:39,245
You know, non-food things.

95
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,059
I have a curious tongue.

96
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,545
That could be the name of the book!

97
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,702
Mr. Hill?

98
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:49,910
I don't know if you remember,
but, three years ago,

99
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:52,958
you sent me $100 to help save
an orphan kid in Africa.

100
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,562
Of course.

101
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:55,918
Mbungo.

102
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,139
That little fella!

103
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,757
Why, he's changed my life.

104
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,425
Excuse me?

105
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,847
Here are some drawings
Mbungo made me.

106
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:06,680
All his letters,

107
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,718
and his report cards
from the village school.

108
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,142
Teacher comments,

109
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,219
"Plays well with zebras.

110
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:14,980
Expert stick thrower."

111
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,355
You can tell he's special.

112
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,423
So, you've been sending checks
this whole time?

113
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:21,854
$100 a month.

114
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,697
But it's worth it.

115
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,518
Take a look at this kid.

116
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:30,331
Knowing that I make
a difference in Mbungo's life,

117
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,282
it makes me feel...

118
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,872
Exactly.

119
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,220
Joy!

120
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,221
Cactus:

121
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,621
painful, but worth it.

122
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,231
Come on, Darnell,
let me lick your head.

123
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:57,954
It'll be in my new book, right after
"All of Joy and Darnell's Spoons."

124
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:00,484
I guess,
if it's for research purposes.

125
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:03,426
You've been scamming that poor man
for three years?

126
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:05,700
I can't believe
you're not ashamed of yourself.

127
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,358
If I had only fooled him once,
it'd be shame on me,

128
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:11,412
but I have fooled him a bunch of times,
so, it's shame on him.

129
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,072
It's cruel, Joy.

130
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:15,322
You didn't just con him
out of thousands of dollars.

131
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:16,583
He loves that kid.

132
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:19,825
How is he going to feel if he finds out
Mbungo doesn't even exist?

133
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,432
You better not tell him the truth,

134
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:24,399
'cause you'll ruin Christmas for
a lot of people in this trailer park.

135
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,020
What?

136
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,591
<i>Turns out, Joy was so proud of keeping
the African orphan scheme going,</i>

137
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:32,349
<i>she couldn't resist bragging
to her friends in the trailer park.</i>

138
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,409
<i>Her friend Sylvia used
some barbecue ashes</i>

139
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:37,296
<i>to fake a disaster photo.</i>

140
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,967
<i>Then she sent Mr. Hill a letter</i>

141
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:46,634
<i>asking for donations for families
who lost their homes in wildfires.</i>

142
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,971
<i>Tammy went the other way.</i>

143
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,134
<i>She sent Mr. Hill a letter</i>

144
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,405
<i>asking for donations for families
displaced by floods.</i>

145
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,760
<i>And, pretty soon, he was sending
monthly checks to everybody.</i>

146
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:05,466
- This is wrong and you know it.
- Says you.

147
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,691
Sure, I took from one person,
but I gave the idea to two other people,

148
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,354
which means I have given twice
as much as I have taken.

149
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,813
So suck on that!

150
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:18,851
Hair:

151
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:20,692
tastes like marijuana.

152
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:26,997
Joy's not going to budge on this.

153
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,683
I don't want to, but maybe
I should just write Mr. Hill a check

154
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,610
for all the money Joy and her friends
conned him out of.

155
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:35,496
Snoopy tastes horrible!

156
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:39,834
I think writing a check is the only way
I can cross Mr. Hill off my list.

157
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:42,086
That's terrible.

158
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:44,464
Just fold the paper over, okay?

159
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,595
I hope you're happy.

160
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:54,848
Oh, my God!
Mr. Hill had a stroke and died?

161
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,183
This is horrible!

162
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,489
I just took a picture of Earl Jr.
with flies in the corner of his eyes.

163
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:03,065
Do you know how hard it is to get a kid
and a fly to hold still for a picture?

164
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,025
Read the rest of the obituary.

165
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:09,542
"Mr. Hill is leaving everything
to his three favorite charities:

166
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,573
"Pimmet Hills African Relief,

167
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,411
"Pimmet Hills Wildfire Victims,

168
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:16,370
"and Pimmet Hills Flood Helpers
Give Us Money Fund."

169
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,534
Mbungo's sugar daddy
just took a dirt nap,

170
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:20,768
and we're rich!

171
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:24,477
Not if I have anything to say about it.
I'm going to cross Mr. Hill off my list

172
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:27,135
by making sure you and your friends
never get that money.

173
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,554
That's my money, Earl Hickey!
Don't you mess with me.

174
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:33,178
You know what I'm capable of.
You know why you only got nine toes!

175
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:36,649
<i>So me and Randy headed over
to Mr. Hill's house.</i>

176
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:40,455
This will be just like old times,
breaking into a house.

177
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,428
You think we could steal
a few things, too?

178
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:46,176
I brought a grocery list
of stuff we're out of.

179
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,548
Deodorant, Fig Newtons, underwear...

180
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:50,195
We're not taking anything.

181
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,188
We just have to find something
with Mr. Hill's lawyer's name on it

182
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:56,075
so we can tell the lawyer
those charities are fake.

183
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,998
I knew it. That bastard's trying
to screw up our inheritance.

184
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:09,625
Oh, my God! This is it!

185
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:11,660
It's his will.

186
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:14,001
"Charities shall receive monies

187
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:16,900
"in the amount of $280,000."

188
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,270
The lawyer's name and address
are right here.

189
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:28,206
They found the will!

190
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:31,074
That old coot was holding on
to $280,000!

191
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,028
I want to buy a fur coat
with the little head still on it

192
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:37,877
so people will stare and I'll be all,
"Yeah, this bitch is real!"

193
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:39,976
Get down.
They're coming out.

194
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,273
We gotta get that will
away from them.

195
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:49,630
We'll just keep following them
real quiet.

196
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:55,965
It's Joy.

197
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:58,772
She must have figured out
we have the will.

198
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:00,300
We gotta split up.

199
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,289
You take the will and start walking
to the lawyer's office.

200
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:05,645
Joy will be sure I kept it.
She'll follow me.

201
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:10,349
- What are you doing?
- I'm pretending I'm mad at you,

202
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,568
and that's why I'm getting out
of the car.

203
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,538
What do you mean,
you hate our troops?

204
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:21,663
They're protecting our freedom!

205
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,638
I'm getting out of your car!

206
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,387
Give me the will, dummy.

207
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,556
Maybe you should give me the will.

208
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:44,392
I don't have the will.

209
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:45,788
Well, I do.

210
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,062
Not, not, not.

211
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:58,854
Hello, we're here to pick up
our checks from the dead guy.

212
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,351
You are Mr. Fischer, the lawyer,
aren't you?

213
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:06,247
Yes, I'm Mr. Fischer and
I believe you know Mr. Hickey.

214
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,668
Son of a bitch.

215
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,088
Hello, Joy.
I knew you'd follow Randy.

216
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,384
That gave me enough time to get here
and tell Mr. Fischer everything.

217
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,477
Thank you, Mr. Hickey.

218
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:23,180
You can cross Mr. Hill
off your list.

219
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,016
See you around, Joy.

220
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,596
You had to stop for tacos.

221
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,034
A counter offer?

222
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:36,806
Excuse me?

223
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:38,223
I could...

224
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:40,416
do a little paperwork magic,

225
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,409
make your charities legal,
then you could collect the cash.

226
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:47,079
And what's your kickback?

227
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:49,220
Well, I don't need any money.

228
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:50,561
It's just that

229
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:52,814
I'm a very lonely man.

230
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:54,538
My wife's dead.

231
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,221
To me.

232
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:58,220
She lives in Oregon now,
with the kids.

233
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:00,719
I'm not supposed to know that,
but the cops slipped up and...

234
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,658
I see where you're going with this.

235
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:04,424
You'll help us out
with the documents

236
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,408
as long as you have sex
with Sylvia here.

237
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:09,810
Stop whining! It's a lot of money
and you are not married!

238
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,427
Well, actually,
what I had in mind was

239
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:13,939
something in a blonde.

240
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:15,824
Oh, I don't have...

241
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:17,936
Zip it!

242
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,325
Blonde's not on the menu.

243
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:25,021
How about we give you
Sylvia and $6,000?

244
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:28,496
- Or Tammy and $3,500?
- Can you go to five on Tammy?

245
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:30,581
- I don't know if I'm down with...
- Deal.

246
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:34,315
For crying out loud!

247
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:44,834
<i>While Tammy and Mr. Fischer
were getting busy under his desk,</i>

248
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,472
<i>Joy and Sylvia were busy</i>

249
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:49,873
<i>getting the $5,000 in bribe money
from a local loan shark.</i>

250
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:51,196
Five grand.

251
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,297
Thank you very much.

252
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:55,189
Here's a check for you,

253
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:57,246
and one for you,

254
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:58,776
and one for you.

255
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:01,527
Pleasure doing business with you.

256
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,287
- It worked.
- You got all the money?

257
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,790
Every penny.
What are you going to do now?

258
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,969
I'm going to take it back
where it belongs.

259
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,910
<i>Which was to Mr. Hill,
who wasn't really dead.</i>

260
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:20,131
<i>You see, I'd just
pulled a huge scam.</i>

261
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,884
<i>First, I got Mr. Hill out of town
for a few days by arranging for him</i>

262
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,489
<i>to win a vacation
to the National Rodeo Championships.</i>

263
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,852
<i>Then the old scam rules
still applied.</i>

264
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,469
<i>I knew the best way
to convince Joy it was real</i>

265
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:37,189
<i>was to make Randy think it was real.</i>

266
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,608
Oh, God. That's terrible.

267
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:44,718
<i>I also knew hearing about all that money
would make Joy greedy.</i>

268
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:48,317
Mbungo's sugar daddy
just took a dirt nap and we're rich!

269
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:50,244
<i>I knew Joy wouldn't let me
out of her sight,</i>

270
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:52,121
<i>but before we broke into the house,</i>

271
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,767
<i>I had to make sure
she'd followed me there.</i>

272
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,542
<i>Then I just had
to pretend to find the will</i>

273
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,253
<i>I'd planted in Mr. Hill's house.</i>

274
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,714
Oh, my God. This is it.
It's his will!

275
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:06,219
<i>I needed to make Joy think
she was a step ahead of me,</i>

276
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:08,216
<i>so I gave the fake will to Randy,</i>

277
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:10,347
<i>knowing she'd get it away from him.</i>

278
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,343
<i>But to actually get these marks
to hand over the money,</i>

279
00:14:13,468 --> 00:14:15,957
<i>I needed someone
to gain their confidence.</i>

280
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,028
<i>Somebody willing to scam people,</i>

281
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:20,357
<i>who also had a grudge against Joy.</i>

282
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:22,247
<i>Of course,</i>

283
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:24,570
<i>my 1st rule of getting money
out of people still applied.</i>

284
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,840
<i>Look like you're not
looking for money.</i>

285
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,145
Well, actually,
what I had in mind was

286
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:31,183
something in a blonde.

287
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,704
<i>And after I knew we had the money,</i>

288
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,039
<i>there was only one thing left
to take care of.</i>

289
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,340
I'm going to take it back
where it belongs.

290
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:41,905
Mr. Hill gets back from
the rodeo championships next week.

291
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,380
I think he's going to be very happy.

292
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:47,607
I'm sorry, Earl,

293
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,809
but I let Joy get the will.

294
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,240
That was my plan, Randy.

295
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:54,016
This whole thing was a scam.

296
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:57,686
Oh, man, Earl.

297
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,394
You got me again!

298
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,189
This was a long one, though.

299
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:04,486
All that running around, Karma...

300
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,679
I believed in that crazy list
for three years!

301
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,757
Bravo, Earl.

302
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Bravo!

303
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,454
<i>And when Mr. Hill
got back from his vacation,</i>

304
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:18,027
<i>I was there waiting
to tell him the whole story.</i>

305
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,461
<i>From my original scam,</i>

306
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,940
<i>all the way up to getting
his money back from Joy.</i>

307
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:27,341
This money covers every nickel
Joy and her friends conned you out of.

308
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,513
Plus another $100
for breaking your front door lock.

309
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,305
And I think Randy
took some of your underwear.

310
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,098
I can't believe it.

311
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:37,226
There were no hurricanes?

312
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:38,852
No fires?

313
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:41,063
No Mbungos?

314
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,504
I'm such an idiot!

315
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:46,893
But wait!

316
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:50,489
The important thing is
you got your money back now.

317
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,266
Well, how's that supposed
to make me feel better?

318
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:56,102
I'm still the moron
who thought he bought

319
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:59,498
an entire African village
athlete's foot vaccinations.

320
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,715
You know what you need?

321
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,296
Let's go laugh in their faces.
It'll feel great.

322
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:09,338
<i>I took Mr. Hill to the trailer park,</i>

323
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:11,907
<i>so we could laugh at the people
we'd gotten revenge on.</i>

324
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,963
<i>I had hoped that the opportunity
to do a victory dance</i>

325
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:16,973
<i>in front of the lowlifes
who raped him off</i>

326
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:18,708
<i>would cheer him right up.</i>

327
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,814
<i>But when we got there,</i>

328
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:25,566
<i>things had changed.</i>

329
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,336
<i>What was once
a middle to low-end trailer park,</i>

330
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:30,628
<i>now looked like
a Third World country.</i>

331
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,288
What happened to all of you?

332
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,373
You happened, you jackass!

333
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,960
<i>Turns out that raising the money
to pay back the loan shark</i>

334
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,776
<i>had hit Joy and her friends
harder than I expected.</i>

335
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:48,834
<i>Since the lawyer's checks bounced,</i>

336
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,091
<i>Tammy had no way
to pay the loan shark.</i>

337
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:53,648
I'm sorry they took
your plumbing truck, baby.

338
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:56,388
We'll be okay.
What's the worst that could happen?

339
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:59,725
<i>The answer?
A busted water heater.</i>

340
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:04,883
We probably should have kept
a couple of wrenches.

341
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,237
<i>Sylvia gave the loan shark
her furnace</i>

342
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,194
<i>and had to find
other ways to keep warm.</i>

343
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,934
Hey, that's better.

344
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:14,958
Move over.

345
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:23,310
<i>And Joy had to hand over
all her appliances.</i>

346
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:26,919
What do you want me to say, Darnell?
It looked like a sound investment.

347
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,696
Besides, joke's gonna be on him

348
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:31,732
when he finds out
that crisper don't work for squat.

349
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,956
<i>Once Joy and Darnell
lost their refrigerator,</i>

350
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:37,793
<i>Christmas came early
for all the neighborhood flies.</i>

351
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:39,431
<i>All 10,000 of them.</i>

352
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:43,711
<i>Without money for an exterminator,</i>

353
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:46,686
<i>the Turners had no choice
but to move outside.</i>

354
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:50,815
Did you come here to gloat

355
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,445
or is it just natural that after flies,
maggots show up?

356
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:54,822
Excuse me?

357
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:58,409
How much would it cost
to hire an exterminator

358
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,786
to get rid of all these flies?

359
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:03,087
I don't know.
A couple hundred bucks.

360
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,670
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me, miss?

361
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,298
Could you use a donation
to help with your flood damage?

362
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,718
Is this some kind of scam?
'Cause if it is,

363
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,431
it's someone else's turn
to have sex with the gross guy.

364
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,266
Don't give me that look, Don.
We already talked about this.

365
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,185
Okay, stop!
I put a lot of effort

366
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,956
into getting this money out of them.

367
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,831
How can you just give it back?

368
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,774
Laugh at them. They're fools.

369
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:35,582
I don't have that much
going on in my life.

370
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:38,714
I mean, I'm a rodeo fan
and I do like to whittle,

371
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:41,164
but not that much.

372
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:43,787
But when I gave to those charities,

373
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:46,194
even though they weren't real,

374
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,167
I thought I was helping people.

375
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:50,554
Now, that made me feel good.

376
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,173
Looks to me like these people
really have been through

377
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,508
some floods and fires and such.

378
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:59,720
This is a chance for me
to help people for real.

379
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,232
I really think
you're missing the point.

380
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,600
These are the exact people
who've been ripping you off.

381
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:06,836
I know.

382
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:25,902
<i>I was amazed
by Mr. Hill's generosity.</i>

383
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,952
<i>And it definitely had an effect
on the people he helped.</i>

384
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:31,827
<i>When you've been a jerk
and someone's still nice to you,</i>

385
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:33,502
<i>it's a powerful thing.</i>

386
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:45,393
<i>Seeing what Mr. Hill had done
really put me in the Christmas spirit.</i>

387
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:48,523
Wakey, wakey.
Christmas snow flakies.

388
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:57,474
Thanks, Earl!

389
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,969
<i>And to my surprise,</i>

390
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:16,255
<i>he ended up teaching me
something pretty important, too.</i>

391
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:18,935
Merry Christmas, Joy.

392
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:23,512
Oh, my God!
You got our old refrigerator back!

393
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:25,622
We don't have to keep
the kids' antibiotics

394
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:27,151
up against the AC anymore!

395
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:30,263
<i>He taught me that being generous
to someone who's done you wrong</i>

396
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:32,938
<i>can be the best kind
of charity there is.</i>

397
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:37,097
It's empty.

398
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,242
That's okay. It's still nice.

399
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:42,722
Come on in.

400
