00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,918
CHAZ DALTON'S SPACE ACADEMY

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,237
<i>Joy and Darnell were out
of Witness Protection </i>

3
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:07,476
<i>and back in Camden,
which meant me and Randy</i>

4
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:10,251
<i>had a few things to fix
from our time living in their trailer.</i>

5
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:13,676
I ain't never seen anything like this.
It's everywhere.

6
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:16,812
It's not my fault
the cops chased that guy in here.

7
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:18,184
Or that he fought back.

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,144
Just scrub that guy
off my wall, dummy.

9
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:23,314
Then go outside and pull down
all that crime scene tape.

10
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:24,994
<i>After years in hiding,</i>

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,068
<i>Darnell was excited to surface again
using his real name.</i>

12
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,647
It's nice to finally get
on the Internet again as Harry,

13
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:34,033
but, man, have I got
a lot of e-mails to return.

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,567
Don't get any ideas
about going by Harry again.

15
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:39,104
It took me a long time to remember
to say "Darnell" during sex,

16
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,185
and I'm not starting from scratch.

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,431
I finished unpacking
all your clothes

18
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:45,378
and picked the bugs
off the flypaper.

19
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,213
Will space camp take me now?

20
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:51,740
Unfortunately, they just called,

21
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:55,865
and said that future astronauts
also have to wash Mama's dishes.

22
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:04,146
Are you going
to Chaz Dalton's Space Academy?

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,759
Me and Randy went when we were kids.
It's the awesomest camp of all time.

24
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:11,445
Chaz Dalton went to outer space,
plus he walked on the Moon.

25
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:14,990
And he was the first person
to sneeze in space and survive.

26
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,451
Earl, why are you so gay for space?

27
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:19,370
I'm not gay for space.

28
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,206
He's gay for the men who went to space,
there's a difference.

29
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:24,154
I'm not gay for astronauts.

30
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,252
But if you had to be gay,
you'd pick astronauts,

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,005
and of all them,
you would pick Chaz.

32
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,844
<i>Randy had me there.</i>

33
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,719
<i>Chaz was a true hero,
and he was on my list.</i>

34
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,188
<i>The week I spent at the Space Academy
was the greatest week of my life.</i>

35
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:39,920
<i>I thought it was gonna suck,</i>

36
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:42,421
<i>like everything else
my parents made me do.</i>

37
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:45,296
<i>But that all changed
when I met Chaz Dalton.</i>

38
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:00,502
Good morning, cadets.

39
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:03,577
I'm Chaz Dalton,
and I've been to outer space.

40
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,779
This is the actual suit
that I wore on my mission.

41
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:15,296
<i>Camp was the first time
I'd ever been interested in learning,</i>

42
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:17,053
<i>and I was a good cadet...</i>

43
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,181
You better pay attention, or I'll open
your throat like a juice box.

44
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:22,244
<i>... in my own way.</i>

45
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:28,105
<i>But I wanted to do more
than just learn from Chaz Dalton.</i>

46
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,123
<i>I wanted to be Chaz Dalton.</i>

47
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,490
<i>For once in my life,
I took something for a positive reason,</i>

48
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:40,294
<i>and I even planned
on bringing it back.</i>

49
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,271
<i>I felt like a real astronaut.</i>

50
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:48,950
<i>I was even weightless...</i>

51
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:50,725
<i>at least between jumps.</i>

52
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,176
<i>I stayed up all night
living my astronaut dream,</i>

53
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,303
<i>and by morning,
that suit was pretty dirty.</i>

54
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:01,254
<i>So I decided to wash it</i>

55
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,974
<i>and return it to the Space Academy
as clean as I'd stolen it.</i>

56
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:07,186
<i>Apparently, space suits
are a match for space</i>

57
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,904
<i>but no match for a large,
energy-inefficient '70s era dryer.</i>

58
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,341
<i>I felt so bad about ruining it,
I never went back to finish camp.</i>

59
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:19,449
<i>Me and Randy hadn't been back
to the Space Academy since,</i>

60
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,724
<i>and as soon as I walked in,
I felt like a kid again.</i>

61
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,746
Everybody be aware
of where they are.

62
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,208
You have to admit,
he wears 20 years well.

63
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,716
I've never been this nervous
about a list item before.

64
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:36,257
Do you think American space heroes
like chocolates?

65
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,051
- It's not too late to go buy doughnuts.
- You know what?

66
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,012
If you go back and forth on this
one more time, I'm punching you.

67
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:44,140
Great work today, cadets.

68
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,029
America would be proud of you,
fine men and women.

69
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,503
Now it's time for a potty break.

70
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:52,186
Even if you don't have to go, try.

71
00:03:57,518 --> 00:03:58,926
Don't embarrass me.

72
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,501
Don't embarrass me.

73
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:07,658
Excuse me.

74
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:09,918
Mr. Astronaut, sir...

75
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,506
I was wondering
if I could talk to you about

76
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:14,587
something that happened here
when I was little.

77
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:17,327
I've never had children in the office
unless the door was open.

78
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:18,802
Permanent pocily.

79
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,376
We used to go to camp here...

80
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,096
I stole your space suit.

81
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:29,793
<i>I told Chaz all about the list
and how I had turned my life around,</i>

82
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,563
<i>and about how sorry I was
for what I'd done.</i>

83
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,416
Anyway,
I feel awful about what I did.

84
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:39,746
You're the only American hero
I've ever shaken hands with,

85
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,471
other than Ted Nugent.

86
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,450
Of all the bad things
I've ever done...

87
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,744
I'm not gonna cry...

88
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,162
I'm just...

89
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,880
really sorry
for what I did to your suit

90
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,620
and to you and...

91
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:53,945
I'm gonna cry.

92
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,046
You don't have to make it up to me.
I forgive you.

93
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:59,256
It's enough
that you finally told the truth.

94
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,386
You're still teaching me lessons.

95
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,887
Kids like you
are the reason why I do this.

96
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,517
You know
what fuels the space shuttle?

97
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,061
- Dreams.
- Dreams.

98
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,893
I'm gonna get you that space suit.

99
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:27,194
I just found out
there's a planet called...

100
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,153
Ura...

101
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:31,812
Ura...

102
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,837
Wait, I forgot. I'll be right back.

103
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,872
You've been on that computer a lot.

104
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:45,547
Nobody likes a black nerd.

105
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:48,614
You know that's why I won't let Earl Jr.
get those prescription glasses.

106
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,089
Baby, I'm just on BuddyBook.

107
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:52,398
A social networking site
that connects you with friends.

108
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:56,021
It's like what MySpace and Facebook used
to be before the old people ruined it.

109
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,870
Hear that? It means
I've got another friend request.

110
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:00,985
I'm up to 320.

111
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:03,796
320 friends?

112
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,191
Are you trying to get
on the prom court?

113
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:09,451
Why would you need that many friends?
Everybody knows you only need two.

114
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:12,830
A poor friend to make you feel rich and
a fat friend to make you feel skinny.

115
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,125
If you're lucky like me,
you get both in one, like Eugenia.

116
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,670
Who's this old bag hanging on you?

117
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,338
Margaret Thatcher.

118
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,991
At least I know
you're not banging her.

119
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,944
Not anymore.

120
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,352
<i>To find a new space suit for Chaz,</i>

121
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:33,016
<i>me and Randy went
to the nearest NASA field office,</i>

122
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,556
<i>and lucky for us,
they validated parking.</i>

123
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:38,313
I asked, and it seems
like we don't sell space suits,

124
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,232
but I'm going to call
another office.

125
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,001
Cape Kennedy is
a little more loosey-goosey.

126
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,404
You can wait over there
by the Wall of Astronauts.

127
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,919
Do you have aliens here?

128
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,967
If you'll wait over there, thanks.

129
00:06:52,785 --> 00:06:55,097
They definitely keep the aliens here,
don't you think?

130
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:58,494
Maybe. It was a big issue
in the election a few months ago.

131
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,454
Catalina wouldn't shut up about it.

132
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:01,992
Don't tell her I said this,

133
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:05,100
but I don't think they should
have the same rights as us.

134
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:07,346
Look, it's Chaz.

135
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:10,854
<i>It was the right name,</i>

136
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,182
<i>but that picture wasn't
the Chaz I knew.</i>

137
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,617
No, it's not.

138
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:17,305
Son of a bitch!

139
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,821
That's not the dude from Camden.

140
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:25,361
I can't believe this guy...

141
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,025
pretending to be a hero?

142
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,438
Getting kids all excited
about space camp?

143
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:32,421
For God's sakes,
Dodge's middle name is Chaz.

144
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:33,871
You know what?

145
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,371
We gotta find the real Chaz
and get some answers.

146
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,273
<i>While we went to search
for the real Chaz,</i>

147
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:40,680
<i>Joy was making it easier
for people to find her.</i>

148
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,145
Once we get you BuddyBooking,

149
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,089
you'll find out
there's nothing to be threated by.

150
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,257
Sex...

151
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,383
Love it.

152
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:48,967
Race.

153
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:50,265
American.

154
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,929
Sexual orientation.

155
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,347
Reverse Cowboy.

156
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,640
Occupation.

157
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,940
Pimp.
No, wait. Hustler.

158
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:58,386
No, wait...

159
00:07:58,683 --> 00:07:59,733
Big baller.

160
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,327
You know what, just put "Mom."

161
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,260
- Hometown?
- Your face.

162
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
That's funny?

163
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,822
- Political views?
- Gop.

164
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,653
- Favorite book?
- Phone.

165
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,470
That's it. You're on BuddyBook.

166
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,995
See, it's not some big secret.
Now we just put out a friend request.

167
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,838
Once the people approve you,
they'll show up in your friend list.

168
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,310
Snap!
There's a place to put a picture.

169
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:27,297
I'm gonna use the one of me
posing with that deer I ran over.

170
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,859
<i>For 50 bucks
and a ride to her boyfriend's house,</i>

171
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:32,548
<i>that NASA lady gave us
Chaz's address.</i>

172
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:35,095
I don't know exactly
what words I'm gonna use,

173
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,994
but I do know
that he deserves to hear the truth.

174
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:41,919
'Cause what we're dealing with here,
is a true American treasure.

175
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,613
That guy was an astronaut?

176
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,824
So, he doesn't look like one.

177
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,233
That's okay.

178
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,202
He's still an American hero.

179
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,260
Excuse me, Mr. Dalton?

180
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,480
I got a religion
and all the Bibles I need.

181
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,169
He thinks we're Jojoba Witnesses.

182
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,429
Now get off of my lawn!

183
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:12,588
Look, there's a guy in Camden
impersonating you.

184
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:15,473
He's been at it for years.
He's got a camp called...

185
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,431
the Chaz Dalton Space Academy.

186
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,407
What?

187
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:20,184
I know, it's terrible.

188
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,812
This good-for-nothing flimflam man
has been lying to kids for years,

189
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:26,063
telling them
he's the real Chaz Dalton.

190
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,317
Is this guy making money
off my name?

191
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,590
Hell, yeah, he's been making money,
on your glorious coattails.

192
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:32,728
Tons of it.

193
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:34,503
He drives a Saturn SVU.

194
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,075
He's even got a credit card
just for the gas station.

195
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,166
If you'll allow me
to escort you to Camden,

196
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,725
it'd be my honor to walk you
into that imposter academy,

197
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,165
that hall of lies.

198
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:47,018
Just to see that faker quake
in his fake-faker space boots.

199
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,841
I'll go.

200
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,299
But I get to pick the radio station.

201
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:55,215
No deal.
Earl, let's get out of here.

202
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,805
He'll ride in the back
with your bag.

203
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,095
<i>I was on my way
to making a new friend,</i>

204
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,040
<i>which was one more than Joy had.</i>

205
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:05,959
My BuddyBook is broken.
Nobody responded to my friend request.

206
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,816
BuddyBook probably broke.
Best just to forget the whole thing.

207
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,834
Whatever. I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

208
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,237
All right, listen up everybody.

209
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,620
Y'all been ignoring my BuddyBook request
and I want some answers.

210
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:22,287
Pickled Egg Guy?

211
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,067
Black Cowboy?

212
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,979
Fat Dude's Brother?

213
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:32,923
I thought we were friends.

214
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,219
None of y'all cowards
are gonna answer me?

215
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:38,512
And TV's Tim Stack,

216
00:10:38,894 --> 00:10:40,681
how long have we known each other?

217
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:43,827
Joy, I didn't accept
your friend request

218
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,686
because you're mean.

219
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:49,356
And you commented
on a photo of me and wrote:

220
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:52,109
"Your face looks like
it has syphilis."

221
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:53,712
That was a joke.

222
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,488
It's not a joke
when you really have syphilis.

223
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,827
<i>I finally made it back to Camden
with my brother,</i>

224
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,708
<i>and the guy I wished
was my other brother,</i>

225
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,831
<i>and I was ready to see
the fireworks fly.</i>

226
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,506
Olly-olly-oxen-fraud!

227
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,544
I found the real Chaz Dalton.

228
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:14,047
Take a good look, 'cause this is
what a real American hero looks like.

229
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:16,758
Fight, fight, fight.

230
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:20,942
You scared, impostor Chaz?

231
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:22,973
My name is Wayne.

232
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:24,817
Is it Wayne?

233
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,835
Or is Wayne another name
you stole from an American hero?

234
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,260
Like John Wayne,

235
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,881
or Wayne Newton,

236
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,274
or Dwayne Wayne.

237
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:35,233
He's telling the truth.

238
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:38,780
<i>It turns out Wayne worked
with Chaz back at NASA.</i>

239
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,530
<i>Wayne wanted to be an astronaut
more than anything,</i>

240
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:43,176
<i>but he kept getting passed over</i>

241
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,579
<i>'cause he was born
with female-sized lungs.</i>

242
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:51,918
That throttle looks clean.

243
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:53,754
I wanted to ask you something.

244
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,390
You think you could go to this...

245
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,865
park opening thing in Camden for me?

246
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:01,053
I'll pay you 50 bucks.
I hate crowds.

247
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,721
Nobody's going to believe I'm you.

248
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:07,015
People respect astronauts.
They don't know what we look like.

249
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,852
It's the helmets, you know.

250
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:10,265
Come on.

251
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:11,563
Give it a try.

252
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,933
If you're lucky, there might be
some space groupies there.

253
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:18,008
Maybe even some John Glenn
hasn't gotten to yet.

254
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,408
Doubtful.

255
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:24,113
<i>And the next day, Camden gathered
a group of American heroes</i>

256
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:25,753
<i>to honor the late Paul Lynde,</i>

257
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,079
<i>who had once stopped in town
for a sandwich.</i>

258
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:30,843
And then, the space shuttle
reaches the speed

259
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:33,130
of 17,000 miles per hour.

260
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,368
You're the greatest American hero
I've ever met.

261
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:37,817
Sorry, Dad.

262
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,704
<i>And Wayne pulled it off.</i>

263
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,679
<i>He was a hero among heroes.</i>

264
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,955
I can't believe you did that.

265
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,891
You put the "ass" in astronaut.

266
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,390
You put the "not" in astronaut.

267
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:53,492
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,195
I guess this place belongs to you.

269
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:04,078
Do you mind if I get the other half
of my sandwich out of the fridge?

270
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:05,826
I was going to have that for din...

271
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,045
Never mind.

272
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:12,844
It better not have been
a hero sandwich.

273
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:13,969
Bye, Chaz.

274
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,817
<i>The next morning,
I was so excited about announcing</i>

275
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:19,264
<i>that a real astronaut
was taking over the academy.</i>

276
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:22,259
<i>Me and Randy even made a curtain
out of comforters from the motel.</i>

277
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:25,146
So any of you kids
allowed on BuddyBook?

278
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:26,805
Good morning, campers.

279
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,474
We have a special surprise for you.

280
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:32,853
It's my pleasure to introduce
a true American hero.

281
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,966
Get off of my lawn!

282
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:49,778
All right, I can walk from here.

283
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,832
What the hell are you doing?

284
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,834
I just took some anxiety pills.

285
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:59,556
Well, anxiety pills smell a lot
like scotch and Dentyne Ice.

286
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,756
Don't make me go back out there.

287
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,425
I'm not a real hero.

288
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:06,097
I'm also a fraud.

289
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:10,098
<i>Turns out Chaz wasn't exactly
who I thought he was either.</i>

290
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,819
<i>He only got to be an astronaut</i>

291
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:15,704
<i>'cause his dad was a senator
who gave funding to NASA.</i>

292
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,479
<i>And the other astronauts
hated him for it.</i>

293
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,322
<i>Some people might have worked hard
to prove themselves in that situation,</i>

294
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:27,597
<i>but not Chaz.</i>

295
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:30,080
<i>All he cared about before takeoff</i>

296
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,484
<i>was eating as much real food
as possible.</i>

297
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,195
<i>And after the shuttle
finally launched,</i>

298
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,945
<i>Chaz suddenly discovered
he was claustrophobic,</i>

299
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,320
<i>had motion sickness</i>

300
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,071
<i>and was afraid of heights.</i>

301
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:47,760
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

302
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,133
I'm not a hero.

303
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,130
I blew it.

304
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:03,818
They had to cut the mission short,
'cause I threatened to kill myself.

305
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,321
I thought enough time had gone by,

306
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,755
but when I thought
of those little kids, I just...

307
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,743
I just couldn't do it.

308
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:15,121
But they look up to you.
I can't let you break their hearts.

309
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,040
They don't look up to me.

310
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:20,567
There's Chaz Dalton the man
and Chaz Dalton the myth.

311
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:22,087
They look up to the myth.

312
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:24,172
This whole place is a myth.

313
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,926
I'm gonna go out there and tell them
I'm shutting the camp down.

314
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:32,639
I mean, they're all paid up, right?
Hey, kids!

315
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:34,373
Camp's closing!

316
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:38,317
There are no heroes!

317
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,568
That's it.

318
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:42,397
<i>I knew what I was doing wasn't right,
but I was pissed.</i>

319
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:43,672
Let go of me!

320
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,754
I'm not going to let those kids
find out how bad it hurts

321
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,579
when you lose your hero.

322
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,882
And then you think
you find your real hero,

323
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:55,957
and it turns out
he's not your real hero either.

324
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,506
<i>Are you crying?</i>

325
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,870
<i>Dealing with Chaz
was going to have to wait...</i>

326
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,422
<i>because there was an entire room of kids
hoping there was more to space camp</i>

327
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,740
<i>than watching a drunk astronaut
battle with gravity.</i>

328
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,348
<i>So, me and Randy decided to try
running the space camp ourselves.</i>

329
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,183
<i>Unfortunately, we didn't know
a lot about space.</i>

330
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,270
Three, two, one... blast off!

331
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:21,945
<i>Or camp.</i>

332
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,025
<i>Or running things.</i>

333
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,243
All right, campers, helmets on.

334
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:35,531
Mine's really working.
I'm actually starting to see space.

335
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,537
Hey, look, there's Grandma.

336
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,669
Bags off,

337
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,917
bags off.

338
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:46,415
<i>Eventually the kids caught on.</i>

339
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,026
<i>We tried our hardest,
but sometimes your hardest just sucks.</i>

340
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:51,843
Show us how to walk on the Moon.

341
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,770
That's not how you do it.

342
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,733
You show us.

343
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:10,578
I know I said I wouldn't come back,

344
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:13,490
but I really do want
to get that half a sandwich.

345
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,681
Will you show us the right way
to walk on the Moon?

346
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,917
All right,
but then you have to leave.

347
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:27,253
Everybody up.

348
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,608
Now remember,
you never move too fast.

349
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:33,588
And you look before you step.

350
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:37,065
'Cause there's lots
and lots of craters.

351
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:40,684
And I think Alan Shepard
left a few golf tees up there.

352
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,103
Do you think I could be
an astronaut?

353
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,979
Definitely, with some hard work.

354
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,459
What about me?

355
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:50,250
<i>I didn't like it, but I couldn't deny
Wayne was good with the kids...</i>

356
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:51,577
<i>and Randy.</i>

357
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:53,446
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

358
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,313
<i>Luckily, someone else did.</i>

359
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,211
Can I have your autograph?

360
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:01,425
I'd love to.

361
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,209
Kids, there's something
I got to tell you.

362
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,210
Go ahead.

363
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,389
Give it to him.

364
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:10,541
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

365
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,018
<i>me getting pissed
and throwing Chaz in a closet</i>

366
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:15,427
<i>was the best thing
that could have happened.</i>

367
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,927
<i>He found a bunch of boxes
filled with thank-you letters.</i>

368
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:31,026
<i>There were hundreds of kids
who looked up to Chaz,</i>

369
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,690
<i>just like I had.</i>

370
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,486
<i>Kids who might never grow up
to be astronauts</i>

371
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:38,411
<i>but who Chaz had inspired.</i>

372
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:41,637
<i>Kids who had learned
to love science,</i>

373
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:43,827
<i>kids who had learned
to love adventure,</i>

374
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:47,002
<i>kids who had learned
to love chasing their dreams.</i>

375
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:52,422
<i>And one creepy guy from Nathanville</i>

376
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,758
<i>who wanted Chaz to have sex
with his wife.</i>

377
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,179
Every kid deserves an autograph
from their hero.

378
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:00,627
Are you sure?

379
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,092
You're good with people,

380
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:05,825
and with explaining stuff

381
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:08,008
and you're fun.

382
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:10,246
Not all astronauts are.

383
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,073
<i>Chaz realized that
the myth of Chaz Dalton</i>

384
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:15,888
<i>was more important than the man.</i>

385
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:18,126
<i>'Cause the myth had inspired
hundreds of kids</i>

386
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:19,532
<i>and that was real.</i>

387
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,636
<i>So it worked out the camp would be
both of their legacies.</i>

388
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,086
<i>Wayne-Chaz was good
at talking about stuff</i>

389
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:28,073
<i>and Chaz-Chaz had access
to all the real stuff,</i>

390
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:30,011
<i>including another spacesuit,</i>

391
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:33,236
<i>which means I got to cross
Chaz Dalton off my list.</i>

392
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,506
<i>It turned out
pretending to be someone else</i>

393
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:40,636
<i>could help a lot
of different people,</i>

394
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:42,573
<i>even if it meant
staying up all night</i>

395
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:45,556
<i>making 351 fake profiles
on BuddyBook.</i>

396
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,812
"Holden Caulfield, New York.

397
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,196
"Occupation... catcher."

398
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,196
Hot damn, I did it.

399
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:03,785
Baby, I won BuddyBook!

400
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,976
Yesterday the only friend I had was you,
but now I got 352.

401
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:11,751
That's more than Catalina,
and most of hers are probably roommates.

402
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:15,083
That's great, baby.
I knew you could do it.

403
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,322
I don't remember this one woman,

404
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:19,467
she said she was my choir
teacher in the 3rd grade.

405
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,486
She kind of looks familiar.

406
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,019
Bless her little Asian heart.
I'm gonna throw a sheep at her.

407
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:27,387
<i>It goes to show,
whether it's space heroes</i>

408
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:28,998
<i>or computer Net friends,</i>

409
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:32,313
<i>sometimes a fake one works
just as good as the real thing.</i>

410
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:35,385
<i>Joy wasn't the only one
who got what she wanted.</i>

411
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,196
<i>Chaz made a phone call to NASA</i>

412
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,401
<i>and somebody finally made
his first trip into space.</i>

413
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,781
Houston, we're totally awesome.

414
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:45,765
<i>It may have just been a simulator,
but the feeling was real.</i>
