00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:08,765
<i>When you're in prison,</i>

4
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:12,631
<i>nobody trusts you to do the simplest
things you used to take for granted.</i>

5
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:18,968
I don't understand why they're so touchy
about us having our own nail clippers.

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:20,955
Yeah, seems kind of silly.

7
00:00:21,117 --> 00:00:24,180
But last year an inmate used a pair
to cut off another guy's arm.

8
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,375
Took a week and a half.

9
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,904
Big lawsuit.

10
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:31,699
Oh, I forgot. I'm supposed
to take you to the warden.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,535
- The warden?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:36,525
I got so caught up watching you
cut your nails, I lost track of time.

13
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:40,062
Do you mind if I tell him we're late
cause you resisted a little?

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,616
I guess not.

15
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:43,294
Great, thank you so much.

16
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,181
Got make it believable.

17
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:51,286
No, don't rub it.
It only makes it worse.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,428
<i>It hurt to get maced in the eyes,
but Randy miss me so much,</i>

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,420
<i>he felt like
he'd been maced in the heart.</i>

20
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,089
<i>So hoping to join me in prison,</i>

21
00:00:58,211 --> 00:00:59,254
<i>he stole a car.</i>

22
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:03,764
Oh, my God, I'm stealing a car!

23
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,011
I'm stealing a car!

24
00:01:06,814 --> 00:01:08,057
Come and get me!

25
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,402
<i>Then he waited to get arrested.</i>

26
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:12,945
<i>And waited...</i>

27
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:28,952
<i>and waited.</i>

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,582
<i>And after three days, he gave up.</i>

29
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:37,135
<i>Then Randy had another not so good idea.</i>

30
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,042
Excuse me, Officer.

31
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:44,188
What's the name of that killer that's
killing all the people at truck stops?

32
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:45,734
The Truck Stop Killer.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,674
That's me.

34
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:50,271
We already caught that guy.

35
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:53,152
See that graffiti over there?

36
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,946
- I did that.
- Really?

37
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:57,226
That's nice work.

38
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,138
My wife's been looking for somebody
to do a mural in the baby's room.

39
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,656
Would you do it for 50 bucks?

40
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:08,034
They're not going to send you
to prison for slapping a cop.

41
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:11,613
And even if they did, you know the odds
you'd be sent to the same place as Earl?

42
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:12,967
Seven.

43
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:14,634
Seven what?

44
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:16,721
Seven going to prisons?

45
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,347
That don't even make sense.

46
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,427
Twelve?

47
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,824
I'm going to bail you out because
I promised Earl I'd take care of you,

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,389
and I'm a woman of integrity.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,149
Just be thankful your brother's
in prison for a felony I committed.

50
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:31,988
My uncle once slapped a cop.

51
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,120
He got 12 years in the penitentiary.

52
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,990
Guess what color he was.

53
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:36,935
Lucky.

54
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,096
Oh, wait, that's not color.

55
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,538
<i>As warden,</i>

56
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,891
<i>Jerry Hazelwood was responsible
for oversee in the prisoners.</i>

57
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:46,237
<i>Thing was,
he didn't like seeing prisoners.</i>

58
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:49,693
You wanted to see me... Warden?

59
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:51,086
Sir?

60
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:53,513
Sir Warden?

61
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:59,957
Nice work on helping that Camden Scout
make his parole a couple days ago.

62
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,640
As a reward,

63
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:05,006
I would like to give you a certificate
for one week off your prison sentence.

64
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:09,134
And a coupon for 20% discount
at the prison store.

65
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,791
A week off my sentence.

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,958
Plus, I like those coffee mugs they sell.

67
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:17,519
And I always thought
they were about 20% too much.

68
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:19,641
Well, you were a big help.

69
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,661
Lord knows,
I need all the help I can get.

70
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:26,153
Don't tell anyone, but this being
a prison warden... it's hard.

71
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:28,353
<i>The warden used to have
a pretty sweet life,</i>

72
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:31,041
<i>but then his wife became governor
and ruined all his fun.</i>

73
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,872
Jerry and I are honored to be living
in the Governor's Mansion,

74
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:36,634
and to be a part of
its distinguished history...

75
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,491
What? I have underwear on.

76
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:45,324
<i>And so the governor decided
to get Jerry a job.</i>

77
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:47,603
<i>Unfortunately,
the first job didn't work out.</i>

78
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,704
Training?
These guys don't need training.

79
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:52,525
We're the National Guard,
we're ever going to fight in a war.

80
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:57,405
<i>So his wife made him a warden.
But he just kept making mistakes.</i>

81
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,741
<i>Like letting a company hire
prison labor to make something</i>

82
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,331
<i>that probably
shouldn't be made inside a prison.</i>

83
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:11,286
<i>And there was his mandatory:
"Bring Your Daughter to Work Day".</i>

84
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,085
And I bet with that ladder incident,

85
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,511
nobody talks about
the 740 inmates that didn't escape.

86
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:22,361
I like that.

87
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,807
You're a prison-half-full kind of guy.

88
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,101
Anyway...

89
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:28,369
I've got this problem
with these two gangs.

90
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:31,795
It's kind of an ebony-ivory
sort of thing.

91
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,675
Only the ivory is a spanish gang,
so it's...

92
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:36,101
ebony and spanish.

93
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:39,207
<i>The gangs the warden was talking about,
had one thing in common:</i>

94
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,480
<i>they hated each other.</i>

95
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:42,423
<i>So, the warden tried keep the peace</i>

96
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:44,804
<i>by taking the leader
of the latin gang, Hector</i>

97
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:47,197
<i>and the leader
of the black gang, Jamal,</i>

98
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,999
<i>and locking them in solitary
together for a month.</i>

99
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:53,570
<i>The warden was a big fan
of that TV show The Odd Couple,</i>

100
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:57,235
<i>and thought if it didn't work out,
then at least there'd be some laughs.</i>

101
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,634
All right, open it up.

102
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:10,501
<i>Sure enough, after a month together,
they hated each other more than ever,</i>

103
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,521
<i>and the gang violence continued.</i>

104
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:14,745
You get these two gangs
to stop fighting,

105
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:16,817
I'm going to give you
another certificate.

106
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:18,445
This time,

107
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,738
for one month off your sentence.

108
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:22,781
A month?

109
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,200
I'm in.

110
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,761
All right, just a little
reward of advice.

111
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:29,552
These fellas can smell fear.

112
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:32,480
You got to let them know
who's boss from Jump Street.

113
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:36,679
You got to stand taller than they do,
you got to speak louder than they do,

114
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:39,590
you got to be tougher
than they are, you got...

115
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,600
<i>The warden was going to give me
a certificate for time off my sentence</i>

116
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:48,567
<i>if I could stop the gangs from fighting.</i>

117
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,496
<i>First thing I had to do
was figure out what started it.</i>

118
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:23,484
Balls.

119
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,831
<i>And so I convinced the warden
to get another ball.</i>

120
00:06:27,324 --> 00:06:30,631
<i>That way both gangs could play
and everyone would be happy.</i>

121
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,523
More balls.

122
00:06:57,224 --> 00:06:58,377
Too many balls.

123
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,798
Your ex-wife and current brother
are here to see you.

124
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,445
They, uh, they look mad.

125
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:07,742
Why can't people just be nice
to each other, Ron?

126
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:09,513
People need guarding, Earl.

127
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,425
That's all I know about them.

128
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:17,605
I had to go bail out this dummy
and miss my Brazilian wax.

129
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,471
If I go into labor now, I'm gonna be
all stubbly on my home video.

130
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:22,276
I didn't ask you to bail me out.

131
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,285
You could have gone
to Brazil if you wanted.

132
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,419
It's so humiliating.
The police tought Randy was my husband.

133
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,486
Although they thought Darnell was
my driver, that was flattering.

134
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,952
I miss you, Earl.

135
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:34,580
It's all he ever talks about.
He's making me crazy.

136
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,815
Randy, I miss you, too,
but you got to get used to the fact

137
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,172
that we can't be together right now.

138
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:42,725
I brought us a Snowball.

139
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:45,915
We can unscrew it, and I'll eat the top
and you can eat the inside.

140
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:48,551
Kind of like we used to do
when we were kids.

141
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:51,548
Oh, God, somebody turned
the sprinkler on again.

142
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:53,075
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

143
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,200
<i>Unfortunately, living in
the trailer together</i>

144
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:57,182
<i>wasn't any easier for Joy and Randy</i>

145
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,894
<i>then living in solitary was
for Hector and Jamal.</i>

146
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,428
Knock it off.

147
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,249
Both of you.

148
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:08,842
I want you to look Joy and
find one nice thing to say about her.

149
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:10,199
Go on.

150
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,413
I suppose she does have a nice rack.

151
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,144
Was that so hard?

152
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,503
Now, Joy, you say
something nice about Randy.

153
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,886
He has been remembering more
to flush the toilet,

154
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:29,455
especially after a big job.

155
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,903
I'm trying.

156
00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:32,432
And I appreciate that.

157
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:35,839
<i>It was working.
And suddenly I had an idea.</i>

158
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,792
Ron, I have to see the warden.

159
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:40,062
What? You're leaving?
What about our snack?

160
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,482
Sorry, Randy,
I'll have to take it with me.

161
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,932
Is that a Snowball, Earl?

162
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,810
- Sure is, Ron.
- I love Snowballs. Especially the top.

163
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,385
Really?

164
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:52,420
Cause I only like the insides.

165
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,512
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

166
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:03,419
Stupid bad-guy zookeeper
is eating my Snowball.

167
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,899
<i>The warden was happy to let me use
his office to try my experiment.</i>

168
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:09,261
<i>Mostly cause it meant
he could leave and go see a movie.</i>

169
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,598
Thanks for agreeing not to kill
each other while we try work this out.

170
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,015
I want you to say
one nice thing about Jamal.`

171
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:26,597
You don't want to be photographed saying
something nice about him, is that it?

172
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:31,976
Fine.

173
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,408
I'm not giving up on you guys.

174
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:36,791
We're going to stay here
as long as it takes for...

175
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,423
So...

176
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,418
you're kissing.

177
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,322
What's with that?

178
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:48,583
I'm not going to lie anymore.

179
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,498
Jamal is my everthing.

180
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,561
I can't hear that enough.

181
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,078
<i>Then they explained what really
happened insolitary that month.</i>

182
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:02,854
<i>But after a few days,
they were worn out.</i>

183
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:05,027
<i>At the beginning, it was awkward.</i>

184
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,759
<i>Eventually, they started talking.</i>

185
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:10,227
<i>And it turned out
they had lot in common.</i>

186
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:13,391
<i>Both of them didn't like spiders
or negative people</i>

187
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,554
<i>or being startled while taking drugs.</i>

188
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,511
- It sucks.
- It does suck.

189
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,866
<i>And a few days later, well...</i>

190
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,588
<i>it was a relationship.</i>

191
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:23,836
You have incredible eyes.

192
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:26,304
Fierce like an eagle,

193
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:29,058
but soft like a water bed.

194
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:36,556
<i>When their time in solitary was up,</i>

195
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,862
<i>they knew they'd have
to keep their feelings secret</i>

196
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,958
<i>so as to not undermine their authority
as vicious gang leaders.</i>

197
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,687
Well, I guess this is it then.

198
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,129
I'm sad.

199
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:49,335
This time together
has been so special for me.

200
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:50,831
I'm sad.

201
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:52,722
<i>All right, open it up.</i>

202
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,907
- I'll see you in my dreams.
- I'm sad.

203
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,732
<i>And so they pretended
to still hate each other.</i>

204
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:13,781
<i>They couldn't be together,
but they couldn't stand to be apart.</i>

205
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,247
<i>When their longing
for one another got too great...</i>

206
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:18,888
<i>well, they got together
the only way they could.</i>

207
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,284
- I missed you.
- Squeeze my buttocks.

208
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:37,115
So you make your gangs fight just so
you can have a few seconds together?

209
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:40,324
In fairness, they also enjoy fighting.

210
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:44,048
You guys should just be honest
about how you feel.

211
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:46,379
You could be prison role models.

212
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,189
We could use more of those.

213
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,392
Or one.

214
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,384
You know what, I think he's right.

215
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:54,173
I want to be honest.
I'm sick of living in the shadows.

216
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:58,689
Puss, we've talked about this.
My gang will never accept you.

217
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:01,875
So what? I'm not good enough for them?

218
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,829
You're just not the right color, Jamal.

219
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,674
Plus the gay thing.
They'll think it's icky.

220
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:12,064
Well, I need more from you than
just an occasional punch in the throat.

221
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,055
If I can't have that,
I don't want anything.

222
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:15,920
Don't.

223
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:21,688
But you guys aren't going
to fight anymore, right?

224
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:24,683
<i>Unfortunately, Jamal felt scorned,</i>

225
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:26,583
<i>and that meant all-out war.</i>

226
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,051
I got the spoon last time.

227
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,195
Hopefully,
the guy you're fighting has soup.

228
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,178
Now just so we're clear.

229
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:43,301
You'll only get a month-off certificate
if you increase the peace,

230
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:46,023
not decrease it.
That I could have done on my own.

231
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,560
Sir, I'm doing my best.

232
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,809
Your best has gotten me an infirmary
full of stab wound victims,

233
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,174
not to mention a guy
with a bucket stuck on his head.

234
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:55,636
They're not sure that thing's
ever going to come off.

235
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,424
Yeah, they're already calling him
"Bucket Head."

236
00:12:58,776 --> 00:12:59,938
I'll level with you.

237
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:03,864
I have a fraternity reunion coming up,
and if I'm not employed,

238
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:07,091
Slime Cracker and Man Boobs
are gonna tease the crap out of me.

239
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:11,648
I'll fix it.

240
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:13,755
<i>While things were getting
worse in prison,</i>

241
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,111
<i>they were finally getting better
for Joy and Randy.</i>

242
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:18,858
Joy, I have a question
and Darnell won't help me.

243
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,872
- It's a book, Randy.
- I know.

244
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,052
I figure the only way I can be with Earl
is to try to become a prison guard.

245
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:30,412
I think it's a dangerous job for him.
I mean, look at his reaction time.

246
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,531
Randy, I'm going to slap you.

247
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:40,100
He's like a snake in winter.

248
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,988
Is this a full-time job
that'll get you out of the house

249
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:46,520
so I don't stare at you sitting
on my couch like a uncooked biscuit?

250
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:50,107
And part of what you just said
hurt my feelings.

251
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:52,985
I'm sorry, Randy.

252
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,844
Let me make up for it,
by helping you study.

253
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,380
We'll start slow.

254
00:13:58,426 --> 00:13:59,443
"True or false?"

255
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:02,039
"If I was held hostage,
I would sue the city."

256
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,739
False?

257
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:07,001
That's right.

258
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,668
<i>If I was going to fix the gang problem,</i>

259
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,033
<i>I needed to fix the romance problem.</i>

260
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:17,643
<i>I started by stealing
Jamal's sweaty shirt.</i>

261
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,115
<i>Since Jamal was
the one feeling scorned,</i>

262
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,351
<i>I had to get Hector
to make the first move.</i>

263
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,177
<i>Lights out.</i>

264
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:50,794
<i>Next I talked to Homer,
who works in the prison laundry.</i>

265
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:53,375
<i>Other than once killing
nine people on a party boat,</i>

266
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:55,111
<i>he's a real nice guy.</i>

267
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,573
Thanks, man.

268
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:38,821
<i>While Hector was watching
Jamal lick his ice cream,</i>

269
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,599
<i>Randy was hoping
he could lick his prison guard test.</i>

270
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:47,538
<i>Then he waited for the results.</i>

271
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:50,310
Are you Randy Hickey?

272
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,354
Tell me I didn't get that one wrong.

273
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,466
Mr. Hickey, you scored 55%.

274
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,942
I think I'd like
to play the race card.

275
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:00,445
How do I do that?

276
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:03,495
<i>Randy might not have gotten
the results he wanted, but</i>

277
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:05,931
<i>it looked like I was starting
to get the results I wanted.</i>

278
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:07,450
I miss Jamal.

279
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:10,373
Go talk to him.
Tell him you want him back.

280
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,686
And then your gangs can stop fighting.

281
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,298
I can't go over there.

282
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:16,926
His people will kill me.

283
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,798
You tell him.

284
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,924
I'll write down
what I want you to say.

285
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:23,362
All right, but...

286
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:26,559
since I have to read this,
nothing too embarrassing.

287
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:29,462
"You're my pouty-lipped he-slut."

288
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,732
"My chocolate-covered man Candy."

289
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,902
You know what,
I'm going to just cut to the chase.

290
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:39,030
Hector's sorry,
and he wants you back.

291
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:43,383
He broke my heart, Earl.
I can never trust him again.

292
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,250
Tell him it's over.

293
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:48,298
Then kiss him hard for me
and squeeze his nipples.

294
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,631
He likes that.

295
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,660
That's all he said? "It's over"?

296
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,081
But that's no reason to keep fighting.

297
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,782
These things happen.

298
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:02,236
Sometimes people
just can't be together.

299
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,299
I can't live without him.

300
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:07,550
There's times we all have to live
without the people we love.

301
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,696
That's what sadness is all about.

302
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:12,186
Would you want to live
in a world without sadness?

303
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:14,936
Without sadness,
we wouldn't know joy...

304
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:17,716
or love.
And love is what makes life worth.

305
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:25,140
Tell Jamal...

306
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:26,903
I'll always love him.

307
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:33,692
Hector, where you going?
We're all lining up for lunch.

308
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:35,332
Come on, fish sticks.

309
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:43,028
<i>It turned out Hector would rather die
then live without Jamal.</i>

310
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,902
<i>And seeing that made Jamal realize that
he couldn't live without Hector either.</i>

311
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,478
<i>So he tried to get him off the fence.</i>

312
00:17:57,965 --> 00:18:00,644
<i>Jamal's gang assumed
he was just beating their sworn enemy</i>

313
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,650
<i>as he was being electrocuted,
which they thought was cool.</i>

314
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:11,542
- Hector, you crazy fool.
- I can't go on without you, Jamal.

315
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:14,060
Then be with me. Always.
We'll find a way.

316
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:15,564
I love you.

317
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:19,223
You're the first thing I've ever
said that to that I haven't killed.

318
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:22,965
Get him!

319
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,171
Get him! Stomp him! Get him!

320
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,741
<i>With Hector and Jamal back together,</i>

321
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:37,830
<i>I convinced the warden
to let them use his office once a month</i>

322
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:41,023
<i>to work out the gang's differences,
alone and in private.</i>

323
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,114
That sounds like it's gonna be
a tough negotiation.

324
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,276
I would not want to be
in the middle of those two.

325
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,701
Cause they're
definitely fighting in there.

326
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:52,675
That's what's happening.
Two straight guys fighting.

327
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:55,662
<i>And with Hector and Jamal
able to be together every month,</i>

328
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:59,252
<i>the gang violence stopped and
I earned another month off my sentence.</i>

329
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,276
Congratulations, Earl.

330
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,756
So what are you going to do
with your five weeks off?

331
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:08,293
- It's almost two years away, so...
- Fine, don't tell me.

332
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:10,000
We'll just be work friends.

333
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:11,374
I get it.

334
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,762
<i>It felt good to see everyone
on the yard finally getting along.</i>

335
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:51,766
<i>It also felt good to realize that,
no matter how difficult it may be,</i>

336
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:55,553
<i>if two people want to be together,
well, they'll somehow find a way.</i>

337
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:02,552
I took the guard test and got 55%.

338
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,643
That's the highest score
they've had this year.

339
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:07,198
And my cholesterol tests
were off the charts.

340
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,779
Keep walking, Ron.

341
00:09:58,325 --> 00:09:59,984
<i>First, they did fight.</i>

342
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:02,854
<i>But after a few days,
they were worn out.</i>

343
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:05,027
<i>At the beginning, it was awkward.</i>

344
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,759
<i>Eventually, they started talking.</i>

345
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:10,227
<i>And it turned out
they had lot in common.</i>

346
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:13,391
<i>Both of them didn't like spiders
or negative people</i>

347
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,554
<i>or being startled while taking drugs.</i>

348
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,511
- It sucks.
- It does suck.

349
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,866
<i>And a few days later, well...</i>

350
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,588
<i>it was a relationship.</i>

351
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:23,836
You have incredible eyes.

352
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:26,304
Fierce like an eagle,

353
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:29,058
but soft like a water bed.

354
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:36,556
<i>When their time in solitary was up,</i>

355
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,862
<i>they knew they'd have
to keep their feelings secret</i>

356
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,958
<i>so as to not undermine their authority
as vicious gang leaders.</i>

357
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,687
Well, I guess this is it then.

358
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,129
I'm sad.

359
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:49,335
This time together
has been so special for me.

360
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:50,831
I'm sad.

361
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:52,722
<i>All right, open it up.</i>

362
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,907
- I'll see you in my dreams.
- I'm sad.

363
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,732
<i>And so they pretended
to still hate each other.</i>

364
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:13,781
<i>They couldn't be together,
but they couldn't stand to be apart.</i>

365
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,247
<i>When their longing
for one another got too great...</i>

366
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:18,888
<i>well, they got together
the only way they could.</i>

367
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,284
- I missed you.
- Squeeze my buttocks.

368
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:37,115
So you make your gangs fight just so
you can have a few seconds together?

369
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:40,324
In fairness, they also enjoy fighting.

370
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:44,048
You guys should just be honest
about how you feel.

371
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:46,379
You could be prison role models.

372
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,189
We could use more of those.

373
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,392
Or one.

374
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,384
You know what, I think he's right.

375
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:54,173
I want to be honest.
I'm sick of living in the shadows.

376
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:58,689
Puss, we've talked about this.
My gang will never accept you.

377
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:01,875
So what? I'm not good enough for them?

378
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,829
You're just not the right color, Jamal.

379
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,674
Plus the gay thing.
They'll think it's icky.

380
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:12,064
Well, I need more from you than
just an occasional punch in the throat.

381
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,055
If I can't have that,
I don't want anything.

382
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:15,920
Don't.

383
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:21,688
But you guys aren't going
to fight anymore, right?

384
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:24,683
<i>Unfortunately, Jamal felt scorned,</i>

385
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:26,583
<i>and that meant all-out war.</i>

386
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,051
I got the spoon last time.

387
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,195
Hopefully,
the guy you're fighting has soup.

388
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,178
Now just so we're clear.

389
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:43,301
You'll only get a month-off certificate
if you increase the peace,

390
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:46,023
not decrease it.
That I could have done on my own.

391
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,560
Sir, I'm doing my best.

392
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,809
Your best has gotten me an infirmary
full of stab wound victims,

393
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,174
not to mention a guy
with a bucket stuck on his head.

394
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:55,636
They're not sure that thing's
ever going to come off.

395
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,424
Yeah, they're already calling him
"Bucket Head."

396
00:12:58,776 --> 00:12:59,938
I'll level with you.

397
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:03,864
I have a fraternity reunion coming up,
and if I'm not employed,

398
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:07,091
Slime Cracker and Man Boobs
are gonna tease the crap out of me.

399
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:11,648
I'll fix it.

400
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:13,755
<i>While things were getting
worse in prison,</i>

401
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,111
<i>they were finally getting better
for Joy and Randy.</i>

402
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:18,858
Joy, I have a question
and Darnell won't help me.

403
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,872
- It's a book, Randy.
- I know.

404
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,052
I figure the only way I can be with Earl
is to try to become a prison guard.

405
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:30,412
I think it's a dangerous job for him.
I mean, look at his reaction time.

406
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,531
Randy, I'm going to slap you.

407
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:40,100
He's like a snake in winter.

408
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,988
Is this a full-time job
that'll get you out of the house

409
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:46,520
so I don't stare at you sitting
on my couch like a uncooked biscuit?

410
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:50,107
And part of what you just said
hurt my feelings.

411
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:52,985
I'm sorry, Randy.

412
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,844
Let me make up for it,
by helping you study.

413
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,380
We'll start slow.

414
00:13:58,426 --> 00:13:59,443
"True or false?"

415
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:02,039
"If I was held hostage,
I would sue the city."

416
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,739
False?

417
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:07,001
That's right.

418
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,668
<i>If I was going to fix the gang problem,</i>

419
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,033
<i>I needed to fix the romance problem.</i>

420
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:17,643
<i>I started by stealing
Jamal's sweaty shirt.</i>

421
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,115
<i>Since Jamal was
the one feeling scorned,</i>

422
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,351
<i>I had to get Hector
to make the first move.</i>

423
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,177
<i>Lights out.</i>

424
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:50,794
<i>Next I talked to Homer,
who works in the prison laundry.</i>

425
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:53,375
<i>Other than once killing
nine people on a party boat,</i>

426
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:55,111
<i>he's a real nice guy.</i>

427
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,573
Thanks, man.

428
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:38,821
<i>While Hector was watching
Jamal lick his ice cream,</i>

429
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,599
<i>Randy was hoping
he could lick his prison guard test.</i>

430
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:47,538
<i>Then he waited for the results.</i>

431
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:50,310
Are you Randy Hickey?

432
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,354
Tell me I didn't get that one wrong.

433
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,466
Mr. Hickey, you scored 55%.

434
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,942
I think I'd like
to play the race card.

435
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:00,445
How do I do that?

436
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:03,495
<i>Randy might not have gotten
the results he wanted, but</i>

437
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:05,931
<i>it looked like I was starting
to get the results I wanted.</i>

438
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:07,450
I miss Jamal.

439
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:10,373
Go talk to him.
Tell him you want him back.

440
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,686
And then your gangs can stop fighting.

441
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,298
I can't go over there.

442
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:16,926
His people will kill me.

443
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,798
You tell him.

444
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,924
I'll write down
what I want you to say.

445
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:23,362
All right, but...

446
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:26,559
since I have to read this,
nothing too embarrassing.

447
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:29,462
"You're my pouty-lipped he-slut."

448
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,732
"My chocolate-covered man Candy."

449
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,902
You know what,
I'm going to just cut to the chase.

450
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:39,030
Hector's sorry,
and he wants you back.

451
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:43,383
He broke my heart, Earl.
I can never trust him again.

452
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,250
Tell him it's over.

453
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:48,298
Then kiss him hard for me
and squeeze his nipples.

454
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,631
He likes that.

455
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,660
That's all he said? "It's over"?

456
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,081
But that's no reason to keep fighting.

457
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,782
These things happen.

458
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:02,236
Sometimes people
just can't be together.

459
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,299
I can't live without him.

460
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:07,550
There's times we all have to live
without the people we love.

461
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,696
That's what sadness is all about.

462
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:12,186
Would you want to live
in a world without sadness?

463
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:14,936
Without sadness,
we wouldn't know joy...

464
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:17,716
or love.
And love is what makes life worth.

465
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:25,140
Tell Jamal...

466
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:26,903
I'll always love him.

467
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:33,692
Hector, where you going?
We're all lining up for lunch.

468
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:35,332
Come on, fish sticks.

469
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:43,028
<i>It turned out Hector would rather die
then live without Jamal.</i>

470
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,902
<i>And seeing that made Jamal realize that
he couldn't live without Hector either.</i>

471
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,478
<i>So he tried to get him off the fence.</i>

472
00:17:57,965 --> 00:18:00,644
<i>Jamal's gang assumed
he was just beating their sworn enemy</i>

473
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,650
<i>as he was being electrocuted,
which they thought was cool.</i>

474
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:11,542
- Hector, you crazy fool.
- I can't go on without you, Jamal.

475
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:14,060
Then be with me. Always.
We'll find a way.

476
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:15,564
I love you.

477
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:19,223
You're the first thing I've ever
said that to that I haven't killed.

478
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:22,965
Get him!

479
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,171
Get him! Stomp him! Get him!

480
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,741
<i>With Hector and Jamal back together,</i>

481
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:37,830
<i>I convinced the warden
to let them use his office once a month</i>

482
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:41,023
<i>to work out the gang's differences,
alone and in private.</i>

483
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,114
That sounds like it's gonna be
a tough negotiation.

484
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,276
I would not want to be
in the middle of those two.

485
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,701
Cause they're
definitely fighting in there.

486
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:52,675
That's what's happening.
Two straight guys fighting.

487
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:55,662
<i>And with Hector and Jamal
able to be together every month,</i>

488
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:59,252
<i>the gang violence stopped and
I earned another month off my sentence.</i>

489
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,276
Congratulations, Earl.

490
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,756
So what are you going to do
with your five weeks off?

491
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:08,293
- It's almost two years away, so...
- Fine, don't tell me.

492
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:10,000
We'll just be work friends.

493
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:11,374
I get it.

494
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,762
<i>It felt good to see everyone
on the yard finally getting along.</i>

495
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:51,766
<i>It also felt good to realize that,
no matter how difficult it may be,</i>

496
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:55,553
<i>if two people want to be together,
well, they'll somehow find a way.</i>

497
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:02,552
I took the guard test and got 55%.

498
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,643
That's the highest score
they've had this year.

499
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:07,198
And my cholesterol tests
were off the charts.

500
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,779
Keep walking, Ron.
