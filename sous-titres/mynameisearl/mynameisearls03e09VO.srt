00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:10,730
<i>For me, prison was like
a long car vacation with my parents.</i>

3
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:13,080
<i>The more I slept, the shorter the trip.</i>

4
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,994
Wakey, wakey, hands off penis.

5
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:18,116
It's for protection.

6
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:20,890
There's a new guy here
who thinks it's funny

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,825
to pull on your junk
while you're sleeping.

8
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,574
The principal wants to see you.

9
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,138
You mean the warden?

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,034
Did I say "landlord" again?

11
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:31,101
Good.

12
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:35,790
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yeah, Hickey, come on in.

13
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:38,407
You don't mind if I multitask, do you?

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,973
Not at all, sir.

15
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:43,370
Vinny's here to shave
some guy for the electric chair.

16
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:45,859
Oh, I hate execution days.

17
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:49,376
Especially if they die with a funny face
and then you start giggling.

18
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,487
And suddenly you're the jerk
who's laughing at an execution.

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,006
Anyway,

20
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:57,801
I am getting ready to start
a program called "Scared Straight".

21
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,887
Not into the ladies, huh?

22
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:02,910
Well, it worked for a guy
at my parents' church.

23
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:06,755
The program I'm talking about
is where we go into schools

24
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:09,021
and we try to scare kids
out of a life of crime.

25
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:11,781
We used to bring 'em here.

26
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:13,756
Didn't work out too well.

27
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,924
Remember. Be scared, stay straight.

28
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:20,491
Excuse me.

29
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:24,392
He wasn't my buddy when we came in.

30
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,238
We finally found the real kid
in a washing machine.

31
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:33,087
2 months later, he's still dizzy.

32
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,518
What do you say?

33
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,752
Are you in?

34
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:41,985
I'll give you a certificate

35
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:44,363
that knocks another 5 weeks
off your prison sentence.

36
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:48,379
If it keeps me out of trouble and
gets me out of here 5 weeks sooner,

37
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,521
I guess scaring kids is a good thing.

38
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:53,118
Great. You're gonna be putting
on a presentation

39
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:54,815
at the school in a couple of days.

40
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:58,022
You just pick any three prisoners
you want to help you.

41
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:01,436
Just, if you pick a black guy,
make sure he's a doctor or lawyer

42
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,956
we don't want to perpetuate
negative stereotypes.

43
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:07,322
Season 3 - Episode 9
<i>Randy In Charge</i>

44
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:10,387
<i>I was really excited to get started
on my Scared Straight project.</i>

45
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:12,642
<i>But first, I had to look after Randy.</i>

46
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,071
You okay, Randy?

47
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,776
I'm great.
I found a shady spot in the yard

48
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:20,036
where no other guards could see me,
and I took a nap.

49
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,578
<i>Because as great as it was
to see Randy every day,</i>

50
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:25,567
<i>he really wasn't the best prison guard.</i>

51
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,627
Elvis, great. How was your weekend?

52
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,886
<i>Sometimes I got there
in the nick of time.</i>

53
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:43,085
<i>And sometimes I didn't.</i>

54
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,408
Meal time.

55
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:47,302
Hello? Dinner.

56
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,857
That tickles.

57
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,369
<i>And sometimes,
he wasn't just a danger to himself.</i>

58
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:13,282
Everyone, this is Fred.

59
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:16,110
It's his first time in prison
and he's a little nervous.

60
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:19,121
He used to be a police officer
and then he molested a little boy.

61
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:20,877
So, make him feel welcome.

62
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,683
Really?
They wrote "Best Guard" on my forehead?

63
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:28,804
They sure did.

64
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,629
<i>I realized if I wanted
to keep Randy out of trouble,</i>

65
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,276
<i>I needed to keep him close.</i>

66
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:35,176
<i>And I figured the warden wouldn't mind.</i>

67
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:37,162
Good news, Randy.

68
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,968
The warden thinks you should be the one
to escort us on the project.

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,745
I was worried he thought I was an idiot

70
00:03:43,854 --> 00:03:45,808
when he saw me fall out
of that guard tower.

71
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:48,999
I guess when I said,
"I meant to do that," he believed me.

72
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:51,824
<i>While I was trying to help
Randy stay out of trouble,</i>

73
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,370
<i>a very pregnant Joy
was trying to get out of bed.</i>

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,731
Thank God, you're here.
I'm stuck again.

75
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:01,691
This mattress is pressing
against me like a creepy uncle.

76
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,497
<i>Recently, Joy had found out
that Liberty, her lifelong enemy,</i>

77
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:07,670
<i>was also her lifelong half-sister.</i>

78
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,852
<i>And after putting aside
their differences,</i>

79
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,720
<i>Joy agreed to be Liberty
and Ray Ray's surrogate mom.</i>

80
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,419
Baby, I told you
you needed to stay in the middle.

81
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,810
I was in the middle.

82
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,845
That damn monster truck
pulled in next door

83
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,963
and created a wave
that pushed me into the crack.

84
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:23,131
Get me out of here.
I'm-a go sleep on the couch.

85
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,580
You know you're not allowed
to sleep on any furniture

86
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,155
with exposed rusty springs.

87
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,174
We don't know it was the couch
that gave Earl Jr lockjaw.

88
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:32,329
Besides, when I agreed
to be their surrogate,

89
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,843
I didn't realize they were part
of the nazi gazpacho.

90
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,183
<i>Being new to parenting,</i>

91
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:38,639
<i>Liberty and Ray Ray
had a lot of baby rules.</i>

92
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:41,232
No fried foods, no transfat,
no alcohol, no tobacco...

93
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:44,611
You first-timers are way overprotective.
I was that way with Dodge.

94
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:47,491
I switched to Marlboro Lights
and he still came out with asthma.

95
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:50,712
Earl Jr, she smoked cloves.
That's why he likes spicy food.

96
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,439
Also, no soft cheeses,

97
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,336
no canned cheeses,
no antiperspirants,

98
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,316
no hair dye, no G-strings.

99
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:00,147
No G-strings or canned cheese?

100
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,594
How the hell am I supposed
to celebrate new year's?

101
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:06,357
<i>And even though
she agreed to all those demands,</i>

102
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:07,871
<i>9 months and 2 weeks later,</i>

103
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:10,193
<i>her patience was running thin.</i>

104
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,745
<i>Even though Joy was not
at a very good place,</i>

105
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,819
<i>Randy was, by my side,</i>

106
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,256
<i>where he'd be safe
while I have my auditions.</i>

107
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:22,193
Our first two auditioners
are Frank and Paco.

108
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:23,614
Frank's new to performing,

109
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,399
but Paco did once stab a guy
in front of a big crowd.

110
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:29,242
Thanks for coming in.
Frank, why don't you go first.

111
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:30,872
Scare me straight.

112
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,439
Okay. All right. Yo, yo.
When you get in here,

113
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:34,987
first, I'm gonna mess you up.

114
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:36,118
And then...

115
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,483
I'm sorry, I blanked out.

116
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:43,100
You know,
I had it perfectly back in my cell.

117
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,750
You know what? My fault...
Paco should have gone first.

118
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:47,499
Go in the hall and collect yourself.

119
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:51,216
Go for it, Paco.

120
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:52,869
It's not too bad in here.

121
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:55,721
I mean, I made some new friends,
and I even took a computer course.

122
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,784
And last week,
I googled myself... Paco,

123
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:01,875
and I found out
I have unclaimed money in Tejas.

124
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:03,283
That's "Texas" for you.

125
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:05,128
Next!

126
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:06,966
I like to cuddle.

127
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:09,498
Do you like to cuddle?

128
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,138
You're in.

129
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,678
Did you really think
this could possibly work?

130
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,496
I gave it a shot.

131
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:17,312
This is you.

132
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,756
This is you in prison.

133
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:26,660
- Any questions?
- It was confusing, but...

134
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,753
I like your voice. You're in.

135
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,165
Watch this.
This will freak the kids out.

136
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,103
That was impressive, Wilson.

137
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,823
I wish he would have saved that
for the show.

138
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:48,475
And then I'm gonna kick in your teeth
and wrench you out of your cigarettes.

139
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:51,727
And then when I get 100 cigarettes,
I'm gonna stuff 'em all up in your mouth

140
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,745
and make you smoke 'em,
like that dude from the Guinness Book.

141
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:57,305
You know why?
Cause prison is boring.

142
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:59,952
I knew you had it in you.

143
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:02,444
So, did I get the part?

144
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:06,657
<i>I had my scared straight team together
and was excited to show the warden.</i>

145
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,176
Okay, kids.

146
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:15,357
The scariest thing about prison
is that there's violence everywhere.

147
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:16,946
Everywhere, yeah.

148
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,612
Everyone's always trying
to get over on you.

149
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:22,154
And when you think you're safe...

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,426
You're walking along by yourself

151
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:27,490
because you might be walking around...

152
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:32,516
that is such nice work.

153
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,409
- You like that?
- That is so scary.

154
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:36,794
Just had another thought.

155
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:40,829
What if the scared straight show
had a green message, too?

156
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:42,361
I don't follow.

157
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:45,196
Green.
It means environmentally friendly.

158
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:48,239
The thing is, sir,...

159
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:51,554
going green doesn't fit
with the rest of the show.

160
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:53,621
Work your magic. Make it fit.

161
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:56,016
Well, I'd just be wedging it in.

162
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:59,612
But if I told you you had to do
it because I'm your boss...

163
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:03,330
Then I would say I could take
the shower-killing story

164
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:06,242
and turn it into something about
the importance of conserving water.

165
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:08,603
That's good.

166
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,008
And how about if we start the show

167
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:13,513
when the guy bends over
to pick up the phosphate-free soap?

168
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:18,084
<i>I wasn't the only one dealing
with other people's crazy ideas.</i>

169
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,062
PBS?

170
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,014
Ray Ray, how the hell would I get PBS
when I'm pregnant?

171
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:24,882
Oh. It's a channel?

172
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:26,656
Oh. Hold on.

173
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,746
Okay, I found it.

174
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:35,588
He's listening.

175
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,393
Dipstick and Dum Dum
wanting the baby to listen

176
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:42,856
to some stupid show
about the moon landing.

177
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,917
Alleged moon landing.

178
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,962
Keep the receiver covered while I give
this baby the opposing point of view.

179
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,958
Consider this, little man.

180
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:56,348
In the footage, you'll notice
shadows from divergent sources.

181
00:08:57,684 --> 00:08:59,693
This baby's already smart, Darnell.

182
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,399
He just turned around,
so you're talking to his butt.

183
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:06,176
<i>That baby still had a chance
to come out smart.</i>

184
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:08,024
<i>But it was too late for Randy,</i>

185
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,072
<i>who had just been outsmarted
by a pair of handcuffs.</i>

186
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,007
These things close so fast.

187
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,612
Sit down, Randy.
I think we need to have a little talk.

188
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,892
I'm wondering if...

189
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:26,365
you wouldn't be happier working...

190
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,360
in some place like...

191
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,069
the cafeteria.

192
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:31,580
No way.

193
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:35,101
Cafeteria guys don't get
night sticks or cool uniforms.

194
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:36,956
Where is your nightstick?

195
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,302
Oh, I lost it.

196
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,234
I didn't lose it...
I know which prisoner has it,

197
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,090
but he won't give it back, so...

198
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:47,046
Come on. Working in the cafeteria,
they'll let you use the big spoon.

199
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:50,117
That is a big spoon they got in there.

200
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:53,459
Wait.
Do you think I'm a bad guard?

201
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:55,739
No. Not, not bad. Just...

202
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:57,214
too trusting,

203
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:01,120
and I can't look after you in here,
like I can on the outside.

204
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:04,680
What are you talking about?
I look after you.

205
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,391
Randy, that's ridiculous.

206
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:08,967
Is it?

207
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:12,314
Who got your new mattress
when hepatitis Bob had sex with yours?

208
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:13,458
If I hadn't a been here,

209
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,561
you'd have
whatever disease hepatitis Bob has.

210
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:17,460
Face it, Randy,
you only took this job

211
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:19,529
because you couldn't exist
out there without me.

212
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:22,489
Or maybe I knew
you couldn't exist in here without me.

213
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,099
Or maybe you're getting defensive

214
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,868
and saying everything I say
back at me.

215
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:28,704
Or maybe you're just saying what
I'm gonna say before I say it.

216
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:29,859
What?

217
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,914
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

218
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:33,650
Randy, the point is,

219
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,950
you're not cut out
for positions of authority.

220
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:40,515
I see what's happening here.

221
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:43,481
You can't handle me being in charge.

222
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:44,947
- What?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,117
You've been bossing me around
so long,

224
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:49,236
you can't stand
that I'm top dog.

225
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:53,352
Oh, really?
You think you're top dog?

226
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,877
- Come here, top dog.
- Give it.

227
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:01,659
Come get it, top dog.

228
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:03,172
Randy, look.

229
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:05,588
It doesn't matter that
you're a guard and I'm a prisoner

230
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:08,483
'cause when it comes to us,
I'm always gonna be in charge.

231
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,505
Code pink.

232
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:19,243
You'll get your stuff back
at the end of the day.

233
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:22,449
Now get out in the yard.
It's time for mandatory volleyball.

234
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,178
<i>I was trying to get Randy
for my Scared Straight presentation,</i>

235
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:33,220
<i>but me and Randy were still fighting
over which one of us was in charge.</i>

236
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,765
- "Not jail."
- No pointers.

237
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,839
- Anyway, not jail...
- No pointing.

238
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:45,184
<i>I was surprised to see
Randy was staying so mad.</i>

239
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:47,403
<i>But I guess being the little brother,</i>

240
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,140
<i>these feelings had been building up
inside him for years.</i>

241
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,606
Randy, I told you, it's too weird.

242
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:54,592
We can't both have mustaches.

243
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:56,366
And I had mine first.

244
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,892
<i>In fact, I was in charge for as long as
either of us could remember.</i>

245
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,886
<i>Randy didn't just mess
with my rehearsal time,</i>

246
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,383
<i>he also started messing
with my meals.</i>

247
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,091
Half portion.

248
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:16,766
Who's in charge now?

249
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:21,078
Kosher meal.

250
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,840
Enjoy your muslim food.

251
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:28,948
Regular meal.

252
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:35,829
Upside down.

253
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:38,035
- Damn it, you're acting like...
- Code pink.

254
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:43,264
<i>Turns out, me and Joy were both dealing
with uncooperative babies.</i>

255
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,670
And your great-great-great
great-great great grandfather

256
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,802
was sent to asia by a tobacco company
to get the chinese hooked on smoking.

257
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:50,551
And if you ever go there, little one,

258
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:52,423
you'll see
what a first-rate job he done.

259
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:54,643
Damn it, Ray-Ray,
the baby can't see you.

260
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:56,822
You want to show him pictures,
let me induce.

261
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,979
Absolutely not.

262
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:00,408
Inducing's not a part
of our natural childbirth plan.

263
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:01,775
Your body will tell us when it's time.

264
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:05,076
My mouth speaks for my body,
and it's saying it's go time.

265
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,465
My daddy always said
"Don't do business with family."

266
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:09,742
I told you we should've gotten
a written contract.

267
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:10,950
Good luck with that.

268
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,033
Before we were married,
I asked for a prenuptial agreement,

269
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,755
and she burned all my stuff.

270
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,625
But then she did sign it.

271
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:20,196
We don't need a written contract.

272
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:22,712
Joy and I have a verbal agreement,
between sisters.

273
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:25,507
Look, I agreed to carry this baby
for nine months.

274
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,041
So, technically,

275
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:29,008
our agreement expired
two weeks ago.

276
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,262
The only reason I haven't cut
this baby out myself

277
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:33,349
is because a cesarean scar
and my prom scar

278
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:36,138
would make a weird little crucifix
right above my landing strip.

279
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:42,188
Yo, man, I mean, things were going
from worse to even worser.

280
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:45,506
And not only did the cops have
my footprint from the casino vault,

281
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,152
but my carbon footprint
was off the charts.

282
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,346
Great job, guys.
We're leaving in five minutes.

283
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:55,555
Scooby, when you tell that story
about dumping a body in the woods,

284
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,328
say you felt bad about littering.

285
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:00,478
I did. That was the only part
I did feel bad about.

286
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:03,461
You can go back
to your bunk now,

287
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:05,463
you're not involved
in the show anymore.

288
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,339
What?

289
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,508
Your fieldtrip privileges
have been canceled.

290
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,260
I'm only taking these three.

291
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:12,229
I can do that 'cause I'm in charge.

292
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,680
Well, I'll talk to the warden.

293
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,896
The warden's not here.
We're leaving.

294
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,550
You're getting way out of control.

295
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,484
You know what's getting
way out of control?

296
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:21,564
My taser.

297
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,436
My taser hand's way out of control.

298
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:25,428
You know I hate tasers.

299
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:27,790
Come on, guys, we're going.

300
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:36,411
Do me a favor.

301
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:38,788
My brother gets a little mixed up and...

302
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,151
Don't worry, I'll look after him.
Hey, but, Earl...

303
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:44,452
about my performance,
am I doing good or am I pushing?

304
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:47,307
- Yeah, it's good.
- All right.

305
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:49,900
Carbon footprint.

306
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:52,492
<i>Frank didn't want to push, but...
Joy did.</i>

307
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:55,966
<i>She was trying everything she could
to get that baby out.</i>

308
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:06,610
<i>Cause while she promised
not to induce at the hospital,</i>

309
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:09,523
<i>she never promised
not to try and induce at home.</i>

310
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,847
Get out!

311
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:37,099
Great show, guys.

312
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,376
I heard one kid say
"I'll never stab anyone,

313
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:41,065
"or order chilean sea bass."

314
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,894
They are dangerously over fished.

315
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:46,011
Bob, that was really something
how you got the teacher's phone number,

316
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,365
even after telling that story
about killing a teacher.

317
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:50,318
I dig chicks who want to fix me.

318
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:52,978
You know what, you guys did
such an awesome job,

319
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:54,322
we're gonna stop for ice cream.

320
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,600
This is the last time I'll bring it up,

321
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:04,665
but frozen yogurt would be
a lot healthier than ice cream.

322
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,254
Damn.

323
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,836
There's no parking spots.
I don't want to double park.

324
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,170
If I get a ticket in this van,
I'll get in big trouble.

325
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,970
We can run in for you.

326
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,960
Okay, I'm trusting you.

327
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,416
I want half french vanilla,
half rocky road.

328
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:27,780
Sprinkles, not too many,
only rainbow color.

329
00:16:28,357 --> 00:16:30,212
One scoop, chopped nuts,
whipped cream.

330
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,902
Don't screw me on this.

331
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:33,696
Yeah, but what about Frank?

332
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:36,115
Just let him sleep.
But get him something.

333
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,324
Nothing too fancy.
He hates snobs.

334
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,232
Get him a working man's flavor
like rum raisin.

335
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,288
- Or brown.
- Okay.

336
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:56,635
Baby, you've been squatting
for five and a half hours.

337
00:16:57,037 --> 00:17:00,034
That's like five hours longer
than any human should squat.

338
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:01,524
That's it.

339
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,294
I don't care what I promised.

340
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:06,276
We're going to the hospital
and inducing right now.

341
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:07,614
Get your keys.

342
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,802
I'm all cramped up.

343
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:25,799
I feel like B.J. and the bear.

344
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:31,731
Whichever one of you pregnant bitches
thinks you're going next, you are wrong.

345
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,472
I need to get some drugs
to kick-start this delivery.

346
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,138
I forgot you were back there.

347
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,939
Where is everyone?

348
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:46,059
Silly sleepyhead, did you forget?
Ice cream.

349
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,226
- What?
- Don't worry,

350
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:49,001
they're getting you something.

351
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:53,037
You can't just let a couple of criminals
go into an ice cream store.

352
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:56,003
That's like letting a bull loose
in a chinese shop.

353
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,293
That's nuts.

354
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,389
How would you even get
a bull into a store?

355
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,932
The door would have to be huge

356
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:03,764
and then once he was in there,
he'd just go crazy with...

357
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,292
Oh, crap.

358
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,946
Can't believe you didn't trust us.

359
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:13,948
Although now that i think about it,

360
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,463
that was a wasted opportunity.

361
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,097
I'm sorry, guys.

362
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:21,103
I should've known better than to think
one of you would try and run away.

363
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:27,513
An escaped convict

364
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:29,903
and a parking ticket
on a state vehicle?

365
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:33,231
Not the kind of thing that's gonna
get me laid at home, fellas.

366
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:35,023
It's not my fault, sir.

367
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:37,100
Captain Jackass was in charge.

368
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:41,910
You actually took prisoners
for ice cream?

369
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:43,709
Yes, sir.

370
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,414
But I got a receipt.

371
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,453
So if I could just get my 8 $ back...

372
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:48,538
Moron.

373
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:52,041
I hold you both responsible
for this mess.

374
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,028
Look, sir,
I knew frank on the outside.

375
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,589
Maybe I can help the troopers
figure out where he's hiding.

376
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:01,252
No! No, no! No troopers, no press.

377
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:02,866
And the governor

378
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:04,685
can never hear about this.

379
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,765
<i>There was a good reason the warden
didn't want the governor to find out.</i>

380
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:09,417
<i>She was also his wife.</i>

381
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:11,238
So you're trying scared straight again?

382
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,577
Yes.

383
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,895
And this time,
you're going to the school?

384
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:16,592
That's what I said.

385
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,011
With actual prisoners?

386
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:20,603
I know what I'm doing!
I'm a grown man!

387
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,236
You like your job, fella?

388
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,614
Yes.

389
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,520
Do you like your brother?

390
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,499
Not at the moment, sir, no.

391
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,878
Too bad.

392
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,254
You're both gonna go out there,
you're gonna find Frank

393
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,484
and you're gonna bring him back.

394
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,205
- Fine, we'll do it.
- Great.

395
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,338
You've got 46 hours.

396
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,595
And nobody better find out about it.

397
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:48,992
Before we go,
which one of us is in charge?

398
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,060
Will you two figure it out?
