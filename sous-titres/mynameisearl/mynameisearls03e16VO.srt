1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,589
STOLE A MOTORCYCLE

2
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:06,349
<i>When Randy crossed something
off my list and I got better,</i>

3
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:09,554
<i>he realized that, while I may be
out of the reach of modern medicine,</i>

4
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:11,796
<i>I wasn't out of the reach of Karma.</i>

5
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,058
The list.

6
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,407
How's Earl gonna pick
something from the list?

7
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:20,940
- All he does is lay there and drool.
- Then I'll pick for him.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,360
How's that any better?
You just stand there and drool.

9
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:26,024
You're right. Earl should pick.

10
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,115
<i>Randy and Joy were nervous
about me being in a coma,</i>

11
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:31,951
<i>but my mind had a trick
for dealing with the stress.</i>

12
00:00:32,613 --> 00:00:34,557
<i>Back when I was a kid
and things were bad,</i>

13
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:37,808
<i>I would escape into
the comfortable world of television.</i>

14
00:00:38,284 --> 00:00:42,101
<i>Harriet,
what's that kayak doing in the kitchen?</i>

15
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:44,464
<i>And that's what my mind was doing again.</i>

16
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:47,342
<i>So while on the outside,
my body was laying still,</i>

17
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:51,096
<i>on the inside, I had a life with Billie
that was moving along great.</i>

18
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:53,565
I have some exciting news,

19
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,281
but you can't tell Earl.

20
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:57,074
I'm pregnant.

21
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:58,275
I knew that!

22
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:02,029
Delivery boy at the supermarket told me
you didn't buy lady pads this month.

23
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,775
You know what, Randy?
I'm gonna surprise Billie

24
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:07,908
by ordering in
some of this take-out Chinese food

25
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:09,947
that all these celebrities
are talking about.

26
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,470
I'm so glad you met with the guy
I recommended.

27
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,458
He is definitely the guy for me.

28
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,457
His hands are warm,
and he doesn't rush throught it

29
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:23,712
and make you feel like
you're just another number.

30
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:28,429
He's such a catch.

31
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:30,841
The girls are gonna be
so jealous you got him.

32
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,752
I know,
and I was so excited when I left,

33
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:35,806
I forgot to pay his fee!

34
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:37,726
His fee?

35
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:41,007
I think your wife's seeing a gigolo.

36
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:45,942
Come on, Earl, drool.

37
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:48,737
I think his mouth is dry.
Maybe we should spit in it.

38
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:50,280
Shut up. Here it comes.

39
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:55,564
"Stole a motorcycle."

40
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:56,716
Oh, man.

41
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,411
<i>One afternoon, me and Randy
were poking around the neighborhood</i>

42
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,200
<i>scoping out stuff to steal.</i>

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,351
<i>We called it "taking a crime walk."</i>

44
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:06,947
Oh, check out the hog.

45
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:08,487
Dibs. Where is she?

46
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,702
You don't have to worry about it, and
I could care less what you do with it.

47
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:17,182
- You never put anything back.
- You've no respect for anybody's stuff.

48
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:18,735
I know you lost it.

49
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,796
Listen, I didn't lose the gas tank!

50
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,979
You had it last,
because I remember thinking,

51
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,814
"Wow, my father's actually working."

52
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,817
Well, I know it's not up your butt
'cause that's where your head is.

53
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:30,195
Guys, check it out. I'm a speed skater.

54
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:35,226
You think your brother needs
another shot to the head, moron.

55
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:38,494
<i>A motorcycle with the keys in it
was the best thing to fall in our laps</i>

56
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:41,713
<i>since Mitzi the stripper
passed out on us at Club Chubby.</i>

57
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,375
<i>Once we got the motorcycle,</i>

58
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,222
<i>we decided to have some fun.</i>

59
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:49,047
Life is awesome!

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,314
<i>And whenever we were having fun,
we loved to add beer.</i>

61
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:55,460
<i>And rum. And tequila.</i>

62
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,913
<i>And whatever malt liquor was on sale.</i>

63
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:11,053
<i>Next thing we knew, it was morning.</i>

64
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,917
Randy, wake up.

65
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:25,859
We're on a school bus.

66
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,211
What? How'd we get here?

67
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,548
I don't remember
anything from last night.

68
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,082
Probably best if you don't.

69
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,159
Great. Now you just got
to return that motorcycle.

70
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,161
But I have no idea what we did with it.

71
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:46,279
I was blackout drunk that night.

72
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,725
Too bad Earl's in a coma,

73
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:50,171
'cause he was just plain
ol' wake-up-in-the-school-bus drunk.

74
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,470
He'd remember.

75
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,987
Come on. Think hard.

76
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:57,462
Something's coming back.

77
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:58,616
Oh, it left.

78
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:00,838
It's coming back.

79
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:03,802
There it goes again. It's fast.

80
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,442
It's just a naked lady.

81
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:09,438
Oh, it's a dude.
I don't want to do this anymore.

82
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,867
<i>While Randy tried to figure out
where to find the bike,</i>

83
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:16,064
<i>in my coma mind,
I was dealing with problems of my own.</i>

84
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:20,138
So that's the plan.

85
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,063
I'll pretend to go to work tomorrow,

86
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:24,142
and when this gigolo
comes over to see my wife,

87
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,974
he'll get a rendez-vous
with more than just Billie.

88
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,006
Off to work, honey.

89
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,462
Won't be back till 5:00.

90
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,634
Earl, what are you doing?!

91
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:59,274
Surprising you,

92
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:02,847
'cause you were getting all dolled up
expecting some gigolo to come over.

93
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,624
Are you crazy?

94
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:08,101
The only two things I'm expecting
are to see my doctor...

95
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,647
and to have your baby.

96
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:13,191
We're having a baby?!

97
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:15,578
My own baby...

98
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:18,029
who'll be my color
and actually looks like me.

99
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,000
But wait a minute.

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,848
What about Joy saying he's a catch

101
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,414
and the others girls are gonna be
so jealous you got him?

102
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:33,095
Because he's so popular,
he rarely takes on new patients.

103
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,922
I mean, even the smallest thing
can make him say no.

104
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:38,086
I got him, Earl, and he's a real sicko!

105
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:40,092
He said he's been seeing
our mom for years!

106
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,139
<i>The Hickeys</i> will be right back.

107
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:48,991
<i>Randy didn't remember
what we did with the motorcycle,</i>

108
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:50,662
<i>so he went to see Jasper,</i>

109
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:54,636
<i>who'd been in the paper for surviving
more gunshot wounds than 50 Cent.</i>

110
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:57,768
I remember that day.
It was like 2:30 in the afternoon.

111
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:01,264
You and Earl came in
just brain-dead, butt-ugly wasted.

112
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,450
Sorry about saying "brain-dead"
with you brother in the coma.

113
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,851
<i>Turns out me and Randy
had spent about an hour</i>

114
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,686
<i>trying to convince Jasper
to buy the motorcycle that day.</i>

115
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,624
I'm sorry, guys, but I can't resell it.

116
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:14,836
I think it's wrong to sell something
that jeopardizes the customer safety.

117
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:18,589
What? You sold hand grenades
to a high school football team.

118
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:20,591
They said that was for a prank.

119
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,969
Hey, how much is the chicken suit?

120
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:27,598
How's this? You give me the chain
off the motorcycle, and it's yours.

121
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:30,146
I didn't need the chain.

122
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,497
I just didn't want you driving
around Camden all wasted.

123
00:06:32,617 --> 00:06:33,813
I have kids, you know?

124
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,841
I mean, I don't know
who they are or if they exist,

125
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,068
but I used to have
a lot of unprotected sex.

126
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,987
So do you know where we went next?

127
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:43,076
I know you wanted
to wear the chicken suit

128
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:45,004
to nickel wing day at the Crab Shack.

129
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,761
I believe you said, and I quote,

130
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,068
"People would be eating their wings.
Then I would come in and they'd be like

131
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:52,915
'Oh, God, it's a giant chicken
come for revenge!'"

132
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:57,277
That sounds like me.
My comedy always has a message.

133
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:59,300
I have to tell you, Randy.

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,594
Doing Earl's list
to make him better is genius.

135
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,264
That's what Joy said, too.

136
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:05,687
Then she called me "dummy,"
which hurt a little,

137
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,381
but it really made me value the moment
where she called me "genius."

138
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,349
See?

139
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,394
People love it when I call 'em names!

140
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,541
"Buttwipe, douchebag, dummy."

141
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:16,788
It's like sprinkles on the ice cream
cones of conversation.

142
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:20,485
I do remember something
about that night with the motorcycle.

143
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,693
Honestly,
I hoped it would never come up again.

144
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:26,543
I mistakenly believed you
and your brother's silence on the matter

145
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,743
meant you felt
appropriately ashamed of your behavior.

146
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:31,373
<i>As it turns out, that afternoon,</i>

147
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,872
<i>me and Randy pushed
the motorcycle into the Crab Shack</i>

148
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:36,727
<i>and engaged in what my dad calls
"general jackassery."</i>

149
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,902
You're eating my baby!

150
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,675
Earl, you guys have got to stop!

151
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:47,011
The table in the back
just passed out from exhaust,

152
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:49,632
and the giant chicken thing
is freaking people out!

153
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,740
Don't worry, Crab Man.

154
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,220
I'll stop the chicken.

155
00:07:56,587 --> 00:07:58,641
I know how to speak their language.

156
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,659
Problem solved.

157
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:12,662
That explains why that sign is there.

158
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,061
Anyway, when you heard
the cops were coming,

159
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:20,090
you pushed the bike out
and went on the run.

160
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,122
- That's the last I saw of you.
- Man, one clue at a time.

161
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:25,466
This is like what someone told me
reading a book is like.

162
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:27,218
Okay, what'd we do next?

163
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:29,692
I'm not sure,
but we should talk to Homeless Joe.

164
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:33,122
I seem to remember he mentioned seeing
you guys do something freaky that night.

165
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:36,007
Plus, I haven't visited him since
he got married to Shopping Card Kim.

166
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:37,812
I owe him a congratulations.

167
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:42,632
I don'know anything about a motorcycle.

168
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:44,518
I saw you at midnight.

169
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:47,363
You and your brother
were driving a tiny little car.

170
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,478
<i>Homeless Joe was kind of right.</i>

171
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,484
<i>Randy was driving a tiny little car.</i>

172
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,329
<i>But I was driving a tiny little plane.</i>

173
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:57,832
Help! Help!

174
00:08:58,313 --> 00:09:00,487
Damn it, Randy, pull over!

175
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,075
Pull over!

176
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:07,728
<i>And as good as the day had been,</i>

177
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,683
<i>me and Randy were no longer having fun.</i>

178
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,723
<i>Something had gone terribly wrong.</i>

179
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:24,923
Son of a bitch!

180
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:29,530
Time to die!

181
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,774
Earl tried to kill me?

182
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,169
Now, hold on, Randy.
Maybe there's some mistake.

183
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,289
Son, I know what I saw.

184
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:49,107
I can't vouch for what I heard 'cause
there's a beetle living in my ear,

185
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:50,426
but I know what I saw.

186
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:54,135
I can't believe Earl tried to kill me.

187
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:55,782
I'm Randy.

188
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:58,496
Earl wouldn't try to kill Randy.

189
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:01,248
That'd be like peanut butter
trying to kill jelly.

190
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,512
Peanut butter wouldn't kill jam.

191
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:06,400
They're in the same sandwich.

192
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,448
I can't believe Earl tried to kill me.

193
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,244
We've been brother for I don't know
how long and now I find out this?

194
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:19,481
Hold on a second. We only have
Homeless Joe's word on that,

195
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:22,250
and Homeless Joe has been known
to exaggerate the truth.

196
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,878
He's the one who got the town convinced
the Carter sisters were witches.

197
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:27,786
I'm still with Homeless Joe.

198
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:30,024
If they weren't witches,
they should've floated.

199
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:32,946
You got the superstion
backwards, witches float.

200
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,930
Innocent people,
like the Carter sisters, sink.

201
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,526
Whatever. They're gone now.

202
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:39,645
The point is we need more information.

203
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,367
We can't go after Earl
with the same witch-hunt hysteria

204
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:44,681
that sweeps through Camden
every two years.

205
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,351
You know what we gotta do?

206
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:49,066
We gotta work backwards
to find out what really happened.

207
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:50,717
Like when you rewind that videotape

208
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:53,026
to see if Sharon Stone
really flashed her undersmile.

209
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:54,907
She did show her undersmile.

210
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:58,613
Right. I'm sure if we rewind the night
to where you were before Homeless Joe,

211
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:01,789
we'll find out if Earl showed
his undersmile, too.

212
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,833
Metaphorically speaking.

213
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:07,023
<i>While Randy, Joy, and Darnell
went to retrace our steps,</i>

214
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:08,796
<i>well, you know what I was doing.</i>

215
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:35,990
It's time.

216
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:37,408
My water broke.

217
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,202
I'll call a plumber in the morning.

218
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,740
My God, your water broke!

219
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,556
Remember, short breaths.

220
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:57,100
Hurry, Earl!
I think we're getting closer!

221
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,889
Don't worry, we're in the hospital.
Everything's gonna be fine.

222
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,014
<i>Since Edwin the town dwarf had died,</i>

223
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:09,230
<i>the only people around
who wore tiny little hats</i>

224
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,533
<i>and drove tiny little cars
were the Knights of Camden</i>

225
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:14,375
<i>So Darnell suggested they stop by
to ask some questions.</i>

226
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,635
Oh, my God.

227
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:17,521
Kill me when I'm 50.

228
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:19,333
Wake up!

229
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,521
It's you.

230
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,172
<i>They'd come to the right place.</i>

231
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:30,795
<i>It ends up that night
Randy had started his way</i>

232
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:33,285
<i>into the Knights of Camden's
new member mixer.</i>

233
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:34,840
Hey, buddy. Come on in.

234
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,843
We could use a young fellow
like you around here.

235
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:40,137
We're dying off like crickets.

236
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:43,682
<i>Randy was drunk when he got there,</i>

237
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:47,091
<i>but after an hour of limbo and
all-you-can-drink gin Rickies,</i>

238
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:50,241
<i>he was in full party mode.
Then I showed up.</i>

239
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:53,692
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

240
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,580
I got a picture of that night,
right here!

241
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,519
It's between the one
of Dead Louie and Dead Frank.

242
00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:32,264
So he did try to kill me.

243
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:35,776
I'm not even sad about it anymore.
I'm angry.

244
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:38,898
I mean, I'm still kind of sad,
but more angry than sad!

245
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,072
Is there a word for that?
There should be.

246
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:44,742
I'm feeling pretty terr-hurtsible.

247
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:48,741
Really, really terr-hurtsible.
With a touch of sangry.

248
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,130
Okay, just calm down.

249
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,987
Wrinkles, is there anything else
you can tell us about that night,

250
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:56,811
like where they might've come from?

251
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:59,139
Well, the only other thing I know is,

252
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,914
the big guy here had
his foot covered in tar

253
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,805
and he dragged it
all over on our dancefloor.

254
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:10,519
Does this antenna look familiar?
Looks like panties hanging on it.

255
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:14,399
Holy crap.
That's the pantenna!

256
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,527
<i>The pantenna used to be
a tradition in the trailer park.</i>

257
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,321
<i>After girls hooked up with a guy,</i>

258
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,568
<i>they'd shoot their panties
at the antenna.</i>

259
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:24,310
<i>The story was,
if they stuck, it was true love.</i>

260
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,832
<i>If they fell, it was likely the clap.</i>

261
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,191
Damn it!

262
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:36,228
- Bingo!
- Look at that.

263
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:38,951
More tar foot prints.

264
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,122
Great googly moogly.

265
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:46,722
There's the bike.

266
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:57,869
Damn. People sure do have
a lot of sex in this trailer park.

267
00:14:57,989 --> 00:15:00,755
Watch your step.
Those are the clap panties.

268
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,986
I remember what happened.
I remember it all.

269
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:15,376
<i>Suddenly, the whole night
come rushing back to Randy.</i>

270
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:17,717
<i>After Darnell kicked us out
of the Crab Shack,</i>

271
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:20,077
<i>we knew the cops were looking
for the stolen bike,</i>

272
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:22,598
<i>so we decided to hide it
where no one'd think to look.</i>

273
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:24,885
<i>On the roof of Deaf Charlie's trailer.</i>

274
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,915
<i>We took the chain off an old chainsaw
and put it on the bike.</i>

275
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:29,528
<i>It wasn't gonna last long,</i>

276
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,046
<i>but luckily,
we only had to drive 15 feet.</i>

277
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,259
Wish me luck.

278
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:36,166
Be careful.
I didn't build a very wide ramp.

279
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,950
Earl, you did it!
You made it up the ramp!

280
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:50,228
I thought for sure you were gonna...

281
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:03,631
<i>We covered the bike
so nobody would see it from below.</i>

282
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,981
<i>Then, I kicked down the ramp,
and we planned our escape.</i>

283
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,753
The cops are gonna be looking for a guy,

284
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,239
and a giant chicken.

285
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:19,814
but they never looking for
two giant half chickens.

286
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,385
Give me your pants.

287
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:23,014
Cops are dumb.

288
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:31,113
Get down! Get down!

289
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:39,376
They gotta be here somewhere.
There's yellow fellows everywhere.

290
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,522
Fan out.

291
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:48,510
Shut up.

292
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:50,878
I can't help it, Randy.

293
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:54,127
When I'm nervous and drunk, I can't...

294
00:16:56,594 --> 00:16:59,409
Scotty, I think there's somebody
behind the trailer.

295
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,527
Rock, smashes, scissors.
Sucks to be you.

296
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,112
Will you just shut up already?

297
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:32,447
<i>After about 10 minutes,
the cops ran out of stein.</i>

298
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,515
<i>Unfortunately, so did I.</i>

299
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:37,255
All right. They're gone.
Let's get out of here.

300
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,054
Oh, God! I killed him.

301
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:49,780
I gotta think what to do.
Think what to do.

302
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,341
I gotta make like a banana and split.

303
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,096
Aw! Damn it!

304
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:58,826
I finally got to use that word
and Earl's too dead to hear it.

305
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,224
It just keeps getting worse.

306
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:03,519
<i>Randy was scared</i>

307
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:06,380
<i>that now the cops would be out
looking for a murdering half chicken,</i>

308
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,702
<i>so he ditched the suit to go on the run.</i>

309
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,150
Good-bye, brother!

310
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:38,968
That son of a bitch killed me.

311
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,418
<i>That's when I broke off
the pantenna for a weapon</i>

312
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:50,591
<i>and followed Randy's footprints
to the Knights of Camden Hall.</i>

313
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:53,927
No wonder he tried to kill me.
I deserved it. I killed him!

314
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:57,848
I killed him, and I went to a party and
played "Try to walk under the stick".

315
00:18:58,008 --> 00:18:59,515
Everyone grieves differently.

316
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:01,810
No! No! I'm a terrible brother!

317
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,021
I should be the one in the coma!

318
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:11,194
You in a coma?

319
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,492
You wanna go return the motorcycle
so we can get it crossed on Earl's list?

320
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:22,289
<i>Those chopper guys were pretty bad
about to get their bike back,</i>

321
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,477
<i>but Randy was still feeling rotten.</i>

322
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:30,801
That's how they stole.

323
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,707
Which one of you jackasses
left the keys in the bike?

324
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,842
Well, Earl, we found the motorcycle.

325
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:46,306
I also found out
I tried to kill you first.

326
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,012
I'm so sorry.

327
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,401
I'm a terrible brother.

328
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:08,669
How'd you get up there?

329
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:10,671
Oh, I fell a long way.

330
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,267
Well, guest what!

331
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:15,801
You're an uncle!

332
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:25,018
We crossed
"stole a motorcycle" off your list.

333
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:26,562
I hope you forgive me.

334
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,274
Billie and the baby are safe.
Now it's your turn.

335
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,025
Grab hold.

336
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:43,245
He squeezed me!
He squeezed me!

337
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,351
We'd better get the doctor.

338
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:48,903
I'm gonna keep doing list items
until you're all better, Earl.

339
