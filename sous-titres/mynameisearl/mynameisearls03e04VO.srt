3
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:07,419
Why are you touching me?

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,843
Where's that female guard who looks like
the coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers?

5
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,584
She's sick today so they said
I get to frisk all the women,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,791
cause if someone sues,
I got the least stuff to lose.

7
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:27,529
I brought you some cupcakes,
some socks I made, and some magazines.

8
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:29,643
Since they won't let me
bring in nudie mags,

9
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:32,045
I drew naughty parts
on all the people in the TV Guide.

10
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:35,514
How many times do I have to tell you?
You don't have to bring me stuff.

11
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,945
Every day I feel more and more terrible
that you're in here.

12
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:42,932
If you'd never met me, you wouldn't be
sitting here with a bunch of...

13
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:46,965
filthy, no good hop-heads who would cut
your throat if they only had the...

14
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:48,558
Hey, I know that guy.

15
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,714
He used to work at the Crab Shack
back in the day.

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,710
You don't know him, but his name is...

17
00:00:57,687 --> 00:00:59,811
<i>I hadn't seen Frank in over seven years.</i>

18
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:01,443
<i>It was right around the time</i>

19
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:04,682
<i>me and Randy had officially worn out
our welcome living with our parents.</i>

20
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:08,846
<i>Which happened around the same time
Dad got a coupon for a fumigation.</i>

21
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:15,327
Morning.

22
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:16,563
Morning.

23
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:17,916
Listen,

24
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:21,875
your father told me not to bother
waking you guys but... I don't know.

25
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:23,669
I don't feel right about it.

26
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:26,922
You've got 3 minutes to get out of here
before your skin starts to peel off.

27
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,258
<i>And just like that, we were homeless.</i>

28
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:34,233
Where are we going?

29
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,509
I don't know, Randy.
We're just walking.

30
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:38,971
Maybe we should pick up the pace,

31
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,493
try get some of that bug poison
out of our lungs.

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,935
I don't mind the poison.

33
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:45,172
I think I swallowed
a praying mantis the other day

34
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:47,260
and I'm pretty sure
I felt it lay some eggs.

35
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:51,123
Well, I guess everything happens
for a reason, Randy.

36
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:05,405
<i>While me and Randy tried to figure out
where we were gonna call home,</i>

37
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:08,422
<i>a young woman we hadn't yet met
was dealing with her own problems...</i>

38
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,931
<i>You see, a little while back,</i>

39
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,991
<i>Joy had had a one-night stand with a man</i>

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,433
<i>and he didn't leave his number.</i>

41
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,412
<i>But he did leave her
with something else.</i>

42
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:20,882
Damn it!

43
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,567
<i>And when she started to show,</i>

44
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,556
<i>her parents threw her out
of her house, too.</i>

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,109
You're both gonna feel awful bad if this
turns out to be baby Jesus or a tumor!

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,707
<i>That day, the homeless rate in Camden
increased by three point foetus.</i>

47
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,455
Dude, I told you that's not cool!

48
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,135
<i>Eventually, Joy found herself
at Camden's only motel,</i>

49
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:51,017
<i>and as soon as she smelled the room,
she knew she needed a better plan.</i>

50
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:55,546
I'm gonna have
to find you a sugar daddy.

51
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,400
So don't be alarmed
if some company pops are in for a visit.

52
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:03,644
<i>For most people in our neighborhood,
Wednesday was trash day.</i>

53
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:06,045
<i>For me and Randy, it was moving day.</i>

54
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,903
Keep your eye out for
a front yard with a hammock

55
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,227
or a pile of dry leaves.

56
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:22,620
Can you sleep on big, plastic bags
full of garbage?

57
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,616
Cause I keep seeing those everywhere.

58
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:26,789
<i>And then I found our answer.</i>

59
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:29,420
<i>It was right below a flyer
for a missing boa constrictor</i>

60
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:32,130
<i>and above some flyers for
a bunch of missing cats and chickens.</i>

61
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:39,012
So what do you think, huh?
It's not bad, right?

62
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:40,847
You got the stove,

63
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,934
the fridge. I think that thing
over there is the dishwasher.

64
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,165
And the best part about it is...

65
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:49,140
you can spit on the floor,
and I don't give a crap.

66
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:51,269
Anyway, I live in the bedroom,

67
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,026
you guys will live in the kitchen

68
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,667
and Paco lives in the parlor.

69
00:03:57,243 --> 00:03:58,824
What's the other door down the hall?

70
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:00,340
Oh, that's my home gym.

71
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,203
I'm saving up for a treadmill,
but right now I just run in place.

72
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,622
Anyway, it's a great room, right?

73
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,606
The kitchen, I mean.
And it's all yours.

74
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:10,419
Except, I'm going to tell you right now,

75
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:14,339
Pac and I still reserve the right to use
the fridge and the sink/half bath.

76
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:17,843
Earl, I think that means
we get to pee in the sink.

77
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,455
We'll take it.

78
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,497
<i>Me and Randy were getting used
to our new living arrangements.</i>

79
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:31,435
- Can you turn up the heat a little?
- No problem.

80
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,742
Sorry, guys, I just finished my workout.

81
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,412
It's hard to tell,
but I did at least 3 miles.

82
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,582
It's okay.
The light scares away all the cockroacs.

83
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:56,882
Paco, shut up.

84
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,342
The kitchen guys are trying to sleep.

85
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,552
He's all bent out of shape
about this chick from back home.

86
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,239
A little tip:

87
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,255
don't let him catch you coming out
of the bathroom with that picture.

88
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,714
He will lose his mind.

89
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,950
<i>And did I hear you say</i>

90
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:15,871
<i>you were meeting me, Paco, here today</i>

91
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:21,822
<i>to take you
to your mansion in the sky...?</i>

92
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,546
Sorry. Shower's stopped up.

93
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:55,690
I'm still going to get
the sweet spots real quick.

94
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:57,706
<i>I had to admit it,</i>

95
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,668
<i>I really looked up to this guy, Frank.</i>

96
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:03,602
<i>Not just cause I was lying on the floor
and he was washing his spots over me,</i>

97
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,575
<i>but cause he really had
his life together.</i>

98
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:14,777
<i>Not only was he living rent free cause
of this subletting thing he invented,</i>

99
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,732
<i>he also drove a hell of a car.</i>

100
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:20,515
He's got an El-frickin'- Camino.

101
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:23,437
That's like the Cadillac of cars.

102
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:29,909
<i>He even had a cool job
at a place we never been before.</i>

103
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,149
On the house... roomies.

104
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,387
<i>Of course, Frank's job would
eventually become Darnell's,</i>

105
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,628
<i>but he hadn't quite made it
to Camden County yet.</i>

106
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,208
Welcome to Witness Protection,
Orientation and Instruction.

107
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,879
Now what do you say...
we go around the room,

108
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:50,662
introduce ourselves
and tell everyone why we're here.

109
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,994
My name is Harry Monroe,

110
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,838
and I'm here because, when I was
four years old, the U.S. government...

111
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:03,633
Rule n°1:

112
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,822
never tell anyone your true identity
or why you are here.

113
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,139
Rule n°2:

114
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:11,036
no gum in class.

115
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,718
You think I could get
your rent check by the end of the week?

116
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,412
Def Leppard tickets are going on sale

117
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:19,381
and it's getting to the point
where the band notices if I'm not there.

118
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:22,277
That's cool. End of the week is good.
That's when I get my paycheck.

119
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:23,612
That's normal, right?

120
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,781
That's how most jobs do it,
like the job I have, end of the week?

121
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:27,984
That's pretty normal.

122
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,245
Two shots of sake for me
and old Yoshimitsu here.

123
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:33,478
We don't have sake.

124
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,225
Just tear a nabel off a bottle of vodka
and draw a dragon on it.

125
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,792
- He'll never know.
- Earl,

126
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,003
Gary, that's my friend Patty.
She's a hooker.

127
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,342
This is Yoshimitsu.
He's in town on business.

128
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:53,637
He talks gibberish.

129
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:55,181
He don't speak much English.

130
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,437
After a time out,
all he say is "sake" or "sucky."

131
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:58,980
He's pretty rich, huh?

132
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:01,316
Are you kidding me?
Look at this watch.

133
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,568
Those stones are real.

134
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:07,030
I know, cause I used to mule
blood diamonds from Zimbabwe.

135
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,448
Wow, that is nice.

136
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,283
He could afford a much prettier hooker.

137
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,935
But not one that's going to do some of
the jacked-up stuff this dude's into.

138
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:15,156
Right, Yoshi?

139
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:23,206
- Hey, he's talking gibberish again.
- Yeah, I heard him.

140
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:27,077
<i>Selling that watch could probably pay
our rent for the next year.</i>

141
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,128
<i>I just had to figure out how to get it.</i>

142
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:33,027
<i>And I wasn't the only one looking to try
taking advantage of someone with money.</i>

143
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:38,103
So... you're really on TV?

144
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:39,617
I don't recognize you,

145
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:42,190
but my parents' TV only gets
picture on Channel 5 and 7.

146
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,859
Oh, well, that explains it.
I'm usually up in the 60s.

147
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,656
So, you want to get married?

148
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:53,540
Well maybe, but...

149
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,247
I'm not going to buy the cow until
I get a chance... to sample the milk.

150
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:01,047
Oh, well, my milk ain't come in yet
but we can do it if you want to.

151
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,733
<i>Luckily, there was only
one motel in Camden.</i>

152
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,699
<i>So we knew right where Yoshimitsu
and his fancy watch would be.</i>

153
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:11,761
<i>And luckily, he had enough Crab Shack
sake to put him out for the night.</i>

154
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:40,457
What are you doing here?

155
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,542
I'm here to steal Yoshi's watch.

156
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,836
You're kidding me.
I'm here to steal Yoshi's watch.

157
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,254
Get out of here, you steal?

158
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:47,891
Hell, yeah, I steal.

159
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,176
Look, I'm wearing your pants.
Took them right out of the dryer.

160
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:53,644
Oh, man, this one is for the books.

161
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:55,793
And don't tell me,
this must be Randy, right?

162
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:01,737
Sorry. I panicked when he identified me.

163
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,104
- Sorry Randy punched you.
- It's not a problem.

164
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,050
It's the price of doing business.

165
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,857
I don't have to tell you,
right, thief?

166
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,318
Hey, watch who you're calling
a thief... thief.

167
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,670
Hey guys,
I think I killed Paco.

168
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,971
He just knocks out easy.

169
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,480
He may even be playing possum.
Hey, Paquito?

170
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,601
No, he's out.
Good for you.

171
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:29,813
<i>Hey, dummies!
Shut up in there!</i>

172
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,681
You shut up.

173
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,843
God, can you imagine
being married to that bitch?

174
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:40,340
Dummy!

175
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:44,352
Come on, Tim,
hurry up so we can do this.

176
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,308
Sun's almost up and
my morning sickness is about to kick in.

177
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,018
You do not want to be
under me when that happens.

178
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,532
What the hell?

179
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:59,618
Did I not mention this at dinner?

180
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,768
Tim, I don't think
this is going to work out.

181
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:06,162
<i>Some guy Frank knew named Jasper
gave us 1,000 bucks</i>

182
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:08,709
<i> for the watch, and...
we split it between the 4 of us.</i>

183
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,332
All right, that's your half
minus $65 for the rent.

184
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:14,107
Thanks for counting it out.
I like how you did it by twos.

185
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,471
Made it go a lot faster.

186
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,044
I had an uncle who taught me that.

187
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,548
He also had this trick

188
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:20,308
for remembering all the months.

189
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:22,053
I can't remember how he did it so...

190
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,234
I guess that secret died with him.

191
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:26,806
Now that we got some money,

192
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,694
can we get one of them orange,

193
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,757
right-turn Clyde,
Clint Eastwood monkeys?

194
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,602
That way I won't have
to eat bananas alone.

195
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:33,850
I hate that you hate bananas.

196
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,371
I'm sorry about that, Randy, but

197
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,972
I think we should do
something smarter with the money.

198
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,505
What are you guys going to buy
with your share?

199
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,055
- We're investing it.
- Really?

200
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:48,916
Wow, that's pretty smart.

201
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:50,153
We don't want to be

202
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,758
running around stealing watches
for the rest of our lives.

203
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:55,024
- There's no future in it.
- Yeah, it's undignified.

204
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,550
Yeah, makes sense.
So what are you investing in?

205
00:11:58,827 --> 00:11:59,923
Stocks? Real estate?

206
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:02,608
No, guns,
two really big guns.

207
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:04,344
We're going to rob the Indian casino.

208
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:06,665
Tell 'em about Howie.

209
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,410
We're planning the robbery
for the same night

210
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,405
that Howie Mandel is performing
at the place,

211
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:12,654
so it's going to be sold out.

212
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:14,150
That's a lot of spinach, you know?

213
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,450
I sent for my woman.

214
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,976
She's gonna sneak into the country.
Then, after the robbery,

215
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:19,784
we're gonna sneak out of the country.

216
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,050
I know this is more sneaking
than she needs to do,

217
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,438
but she's a really good sneaker.

218
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:25,969
You guys are gonna be rich.
Earl, they're gonna be rich.

219
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:29,744
Hey, listen, uh...
we'd like our lives to be better, too.

220
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:32,085
Any chance you'd be willing to

221
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:34,165
to buy a couple extra guns
with our share

222
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:35,468
of the watch money

223
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,621
and let us help out?

224
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:39,958
I guess, if there's four of us
geing shot at, then...

225
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,191
there's less of a chance that
Paco and I are going to get killed.

226
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:44,625
Sure. Why not?

227
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,284
Yes! If we don't die,
we're getting a monkey!

228
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:51,630
<i>While me and Randy
made plans for a new life,</i>

229
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:53,133
<i>Darnell was doing the same.</i>

230
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,352
Okay, son, go ahead.

231
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,365
You see, without fingerprints,
you'll be one step closer

232
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,334
to eliminating the possibility
for someone

233
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,813
to discover your true identity.

234
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,514
By the way, this is optional.

235
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:11,059
<i>And, in another part of the world,</i>

236
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:13,746
<i>Catalina was learning that
passage to America didn't come cheap.</i>

237
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:37,587
<i>We got our weapons,
but this was a big job,</i>

238
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,651
<i>and we didn't want
to go off half-cocked.</i>

239
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,543
<i>So, we realized we needed a plan.</i>

240
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,035
I mean, like that.
But you know what?

241
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,674
You know, this is, uh...

242
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,554
There's probably better plans,

243
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,487
but this is permanent marker,
so, uh...

244
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,013
let's just stick with this.

245
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,811
So, uh... anybody remember
what that plan was?

246
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,677
<i>It took Frank a while
to remember the plan,</i>

247
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:22,971
<i>but he eventually did.</i>

248
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:25,282
<i>It was cool,
'cause we all had disguises.</i>

249
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:27,940
<i>Frank was a golfer,
I was an old man,</i>

250
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:31,119
<i>Paco was my nurse, and,
since real hostages fight back,</i>

251
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,548
<i>ours was gonna be Randy.</i>

252
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:33,669
This wig is itchy.

253
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,529
It's an Indian casino.
They're not gonna give up their money

254
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,008
unless to save one of their own.

255
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,418
All right!
Now, let's do this!

256
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,644
Everybody put your money
and jewelry in the wheelchair!

257
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:44,425
Otherwise, your homeboy here
gets wasted!

258
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:45,755
Help me, help me!

259
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,718
Someone push
the emergency button,

260
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:50,366
and tell the police they live
in the Pimmit Hills trailer park!

261
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,279
Everyone else, great job.

262
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:01,020
Oh, man. Did I say
everyone's full name again?

263
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,481
<i>The only thing left
was to actually do the job.</i>

264
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,407
<i>Joy had another job:</i>

265
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,833
<i>to find someone
to take care of her baby.</i>

266
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:09,650
<i>And, as the due date grew closer,</i>

267
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:11,189
<i>she was looking everywhere.</i>

268
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,379
So, Doc,

269
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,831
I don't feel a ring on your finger.

270
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,801
I like this. We should shoot
a hole in the closet

271
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:22,275
so we don't have to open
the door to get our coats.

272
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:24,127
Plus, the milk is nice and warm.

273
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:26,879
18 hours to "go" time, guys.

274
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,253
On a big job.

275
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:30,860
Biggest job I've ever had.

276
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:34,109
Guns, casinos, guns...

277
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,763
Big job. Big one.

278
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:38,050
Anybody else throw up twice today?

279
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,257
Hey, Earl,
just try and relax, okay?

280
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,378
Now listen, Paco and I are gonna be
in Nathanville tonight.

281
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,031
If this is my last night on Earth,

282
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,962
I'm going to go try to meet my son.

283
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,019
Plus, his mom's got a van
we can steal.

284
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:50,223
All right!

285
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:52,684
See you guys at the casino
tomorrow, all right?

286
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,811
Oh, God!

287
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:57,410
What's the date on this cereal?

288
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,684
<i>While me and Randy were trying
to chill out before our big day,</i>

289
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:03,708
<i>Joy was realized that she had
to get married quick or she was screwed.</i>

290
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,597
<i>And, after my 12th
upside-down margarita,</i>

291
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,638
<i>Joy had me where she wanted me.</i>

292
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:10,340
<i>And my shotgun casino robbery</i>

293
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,258
<i>was replaced by a shotgun wedding.</i>

294
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,230
<i>So I called Randy
and let him know

295
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,479
<i>that I couldn't get back
in time for the robbery,</i>

296
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:18,446
<i>and he was going
to have to go without me.</i>

297
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,875
No problem.
Congratulations.

298
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:23,120
I'll take the bus
and meet the guys there.

299
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:24,562
<i>Coming up next,</i>

300
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:27,278
<i>a Kroft Superstars marathon.</i>

301
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,526
<i>Two days later, me and Joy
got back to Camden</i>

302
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:32,633
<i>to start our new life
as husband and wife.</i>

303
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,575
By the way,
what's your last name?

304
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:41,697
Well, it was Darville, but I guess
it's whatever your last name is now.

305
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:44,749
Well, nice to meet you, Mrs. Hickey.

306
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,224
Mrs. Hickey. That's funny.

307
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,630
Seriously, what's your last name?

308
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,579
That's what that beeping sound was.

309
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,876
I thought it was Jimmy's magic flute,
I couldn't figure out

310
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:11,996
how come I couldn't find him
on the commercials.

311
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:13,331
How was the robbery?

312
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:15,947
Oh, no. I forgot to go.

313
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,446
And those guys never came back?

314
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:21,536
I don't think so.

315
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,581
Earl, I'm serious.
Tell me your real last name.

316
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,709
I told you. It's Hickey.
Joy, this is my brother Randy.

317
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,510
- Hey.
- You ain't staying here.

318
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:32,915
And I'm not going
to be called Mrs. Hickey.

319
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:34,498
Took my 5th grade
to lose that nickname,

320
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:36,883
and I'm sure as hell
I'm not going back to it now.

321
00:17:37,736 --> 00:17:40,164
Uh... honey,
we live in the kitchen.

322
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:44,408
When you never came back,

323
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:46,733
we moved into the bedroom
and started driving your car.

324
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:48,828
We figured you were living
on a beach somewhere.

325
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:49,935
I wish.

326
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,765
Things didn't really work out
the way we planned.

327
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,411
<i>Frank explained that
the robbery went off without a hitch,</i>

328
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,071
<i>and they had made a clean getaway.</i>

329
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:08,844
Excuse me.

330
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,224
Are you gonna kill me?

331
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:12,982
Damn! You know, I forgot
that you were even back there.

332
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,081
I got to tell you,

333
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,840
we weren't planning
on taking anybody,

334
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,786
but our fake hostage
just didn't show up.

335
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:18,868
Oh. I see.

336
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,265
So where does that leave us

337
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:23,404
with the whole killing me
or not killing me thing?

338
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,700
I don't know. Why don't you...

339
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,219
pop a rubber gloven your head
and see if it makes me laugh,

340
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:28,746
and we'll talk about it later.

341
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,895
As soon as you get out of this van,
you become Darnell Turner.

342
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,285
All the documents you need
are in this envelope.

343
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:47,677
And remember,

344
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:50,640
you can never be Harry Monroe again,
you're a totally new person.

345
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,809
Sorry, sister. I only speak
French, Russian and Arabic.

346
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:17,526
I mean, what up, doll?

347
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,371
An FBI van?

348
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,700
I mean, what the hell was an FBI van
even doing in Camden?

349
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:42,394
They popped us both,

350
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,972
and poor Paco never even got
to see his old girlfriend again.

351
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:47,098
Man! How long you in for?

352
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:49,018
20 years.

353
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:50,452
Wait a second.

354
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:53,238
If I hadn't taken this fool to Vegas
to get married,

355
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,648
he'd be in here for 20 years?

356
00:19:56,784 --> 00:19:57,717
Oh, hell.

357
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,967
And here I am thinking I owe you
'cause you're doing

358
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:01,100
two years for me.

359
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,312
I saved you 18 years in this hellhole.

360
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,589
You owe me.

361
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:07,347
And you owe the library
some clean TV Guides.

362
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:13,041
I think this is the first time

363
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,340
I've ever been glad
she tricked me into marrying her.

364
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,104
Check out the vagina
on Al Roker.
