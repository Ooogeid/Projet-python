Season 1 Episode 13</font>

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,330
hey,earl,I'm glad you got out in time for christmas.

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,470
Yeah,me,too.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,230
I picked the leader of the skinheads as my secret santa.

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,760
And what do you get for the guy who hates everything?

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,490
Oh,earl,I meant to tell you this,but I was unconscious for the last 15 minutes.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,590
But I got your list back from the prison property department.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,260
You may want to add "broke randy's nose" to it.

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,300
Man,it must feel good to have the list back.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,770
Like linus getting his blanket back.

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,580
Of course,he's probably grown up now with kids of his own.

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,260
Now he's the one going "wah,wah,wah,wah,wah,wah."

25
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,650
Yeah,yeah,it's,uh.

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,670
it's good to see this again.

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,420
I said I felt good,but truth be told,I wasn't sure how I felt.

28
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,310
You see,it was doing a good thing for joy that got me thrown in prison.

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,700
Then,doing good things in prison eventually got me thrown in the hole.

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,730
In fact,the only reason I got out of prison was 'cause I was in the middle of doing something bad.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,860
After everything that happened,karma had me pretty confused.

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,570
What number are you going to do next,earl?

33
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,700
I don't know,I think maybe i need to get settled first,

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,550
you know,get my life back in order.

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,220
I thought I'd feel better once I got back in our old motel room,

36
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,150
but unfortunately the mayor decided to start a new christmas tradition--

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,200
hiding the homeless for the holidays.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,800
Whoa,check it out!

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,370
Gary's white!

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,180
Turns out there was only one room left.

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,480
To get my life back on track,I needed a job.

42
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,210
Unfortunately there was only one business in town that would hire ex-cons.

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,890
So I was the new delivery guy for the camden foreign food restaurant.

44
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,000
Damn it,randy,you said you secured ser lo mein.

45
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,510
You know,for the guy who gets to wear the costume and ring all the doorbells,you sure are grouchy.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,370
Let's just get this over with.

47
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,280
Ralph?

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,550
Actually,it's stan johansen.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,040
ralph's life had taken a few interesting turns since he hopped over the prison wall six months ago.

50
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,020
He was so desperate to get away from that prison,

51
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,020
he got in the first car that would pick up a man with no pants.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,970
O-oh,my god,h-hop in.

53
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,290
All right.

54
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,130
And to make you more comfortable,I'll take off my shirt.

55
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,160
Stop the car.

56
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,510
Stop the car!

57
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,320
You're lucky i can't drive a stick or I'd kick your ass and take your car,pervert!

58
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,770
And if you tell anybody what we did,I'll kill you!

59
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,520
Ralph was getting more and more desperate as the days wore on.

60
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,210
But don't ask me what I think of you I might not give the answer that you want me to.

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,750
until finally,he saw a way out.

62
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,940
Oh,my.

63
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,780
You look like you could use some pants.

64
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,870
What good eyes you have,grandma.

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,110
Well,come on in,young man.

66
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,030
Lucky for ralph,doris was one of those widows that never threw out her dead husband's clothes.

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,580
sweet coke bottles.

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,100
Stan?

69
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,230
Stan,is that you?

70
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,650
Sure it is,sweetie pie.

71
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,410
It's stan.

72
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,090
Who else would it be?

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,470
Oh,stanley!

74
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,180
Hey,what's my atm number again?

75
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,470
oh,I got it made,buddy.

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Every wednesday,I get my pension check,

77
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,190
plus he died with a fully stocked medicine chest.

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,480
I don't know what "E.D."Is,

79
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,800
but you won't believe what those pills do.

80
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,280
I don't believe this.

81
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,690
We're living in a laundry room.

82
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,030
Everything okay in here,stan?

83
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,260
Oh,yeah,sugar plum.

84
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,690
Just my food being delivered.

85
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,360
She gets a little nervous when there's strange men in the house.

86
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,890
I can't even take off my glasses or she freaks out.

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,490
Ohi love you.

88
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,140
Okay,you guys gotta get out of here.

89
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,160
I gotta eat,then I gotta give doris her bath.

90
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,020
It ain't all peaches and cream.

91
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,820
I was starting to feel more like life on the outside was worse than it was in prison.

92
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,470
What's the matter,earl?

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,760
Consuela's farting keeping you up,too?

94
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,250
This sucks,randy.

95
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,480
I'm an ex-con,I'm broke.

96
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,920
I got a crappy job.

97
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,120
It's okay,earl,don't be sad.We've lived on floors before.

98
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,270
Not after I spent two years of my life doing good things,we haven'T.

99
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,410
Randy.

100
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,770
things were supposed to be better than this by now.

101
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,870
Hey,maybe you should go ahead and do something on your list.

102
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,720
That always makes you feel better.

103
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,600
I don't know.

104
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,880
Fine,I'll pick something.

105
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,650
Here's a good one: #205: 

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,920
Ruined club chubby's mistletoe.

107
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,140
I like it,it's christmassy.

108
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,760
A couple years ago,randy had stolen what he thought was a laser gun,

109
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,240
but ended up just being a laser pointer.

110
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,940
It's still fun though.

111
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,080
It's like having a tiny green hand i can put wherever I want.

112
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,560
Put your hands together for mistletoe!

113
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,720
you son of a bitch,that was you?

114
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,240
They had to fuse my spine.

115
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,290
I got to wear this thing for two more years.

116
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,780
Listen,I said I was sorry,so.

117
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,910
no,you didn'T.

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,670
Well,whatever.

119
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,700
It's implied.I'm here,aren't I?

120
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,010
Earl,maybe you forgot in prison,

121
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,010
but usually when you talk to people on the list,

122
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,350
you use your nice guy voice.

123
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,830
I told you,I wasn't ready for this.

124
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,390
I had a quarter wedged in this thing for over a year and I can't get the damn thing out.

125
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,430
That sucks.

126
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,110
I've had a candy corn stuck in my ear since I was nine.

127
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,710
Sometimes it attracts ants.

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,810
Okay,life's rough.

129
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,950
Things get stuck places.

130
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,220
We can all agree on that.

131
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,640
Anyway,like I was saying,I got this list,

132
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,200
to cross you off i need to do something to make it up to you somehow,so what can I do?

133
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,780
I get to p?

134
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,490
Yeah,if you calm down a little bit.

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,490
I'm not going to let you pick while you're pissed.

136
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,760
It's like letting you go grocery shopping hungry.

137
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,410
i..

138
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,550
my..

139
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,740
come...

140
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,710
what..

141
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,600
he...

142
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,530
i'm...

143
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,360
a little..

144
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,950
if..

145
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,530
i...

146
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,280
randy...

147
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,510
hey..

148
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,480
it's..

149
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,420
For the second time today,let's put your hands together for earl hickey!

150
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,820
Come on,we're leaving.

151
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,950
What? Why?

152
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,160
What about mistletoe?

153
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,680
What about the list?

154
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,590
I'm not doing it anymore.

155
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,540
That's right.

156
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,940
I'm finished with the list.

157
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,140
You can'T.

158
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,720
Something bad might happen.

159
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,950
Oh,really?

160
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,790
Ralph's an escaped convict who's stealing from an old lady.

161
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,570
Nothing bad is happening to him.

162
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,860
I'm pretty sure this karma stuff doesn't really exist.

163
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,890
I mean,think about it randy.

164
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,990
I got thwhole idea from carson daly,for god's sakes.

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,380
He's a talk show host,who's on after two other talk show hosts.

166
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,880
What does that tell you?

167
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,570
Randy,look how many things i crossed off.

168
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,900
What do I have to show for it?

169
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,900
Nothing.

170
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,170
If karma was real,I'd have something good by now.

171
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,620
Where's my good thing,randy?

172
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,450
Where's my good thing?

173
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,330
Okay.

174
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,360
I had given up my list,and it was no surprise my friends had a strong reaction.

175
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,020
Oh,he's back,my baby's back and he's bad again!

176
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,070
Stan?

177
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Just going to dialysis,schnookems.Don't wait up.

178
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,860
I hope you're here to dance,earl hickey.

179
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,410
Yeah,uh,that's not going to happen.

180
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,700
I kind of lost the list,for good.

181
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,130
Well,hey,catalina seÒorita.

182
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,360
Oh,now that's tight.

183
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,390
No jiggle there.

184
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,810
I slapped that one over there about ten minutes ago,and look,

185
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,240
she's still wiggling.

186
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,860
Oh,ralph,you're so crazy.

187
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,070
Damn,girl.

188
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,190
He just did it.

189
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,340
But you're a better person than him.

190
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,160
I don't expect that kind of thing from you.

191
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,810
Well,I'm sick of people expecting more from me.

192
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,200
How come I always have to act better than everyone else?

193
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,820
I expect you to act like a friend,not a jerk.

194
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,740
I don't like the new earl hickey.

195
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,480
I'm not the new earl hickey,I'm the old earl hickey.

196
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,870
You just never met him.

197
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,170
Even though we weren't too popular with catalina,

198
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,310
some of her coworkers found us amusing.

199
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,240
We just needed a place to take them.

200
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,400
Lucky for us,I knew joy and darnell had taken the kids to see her

201
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,530
parents in nathanville and wouldn't be back until the next day.

202
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,500
y'all feel that?

203
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,780
I think the trailer shifted.

204
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,370
Hey,let me try one.

205
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,820
Rock and roll!

206
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,140
Yeah!

207
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,490
Ralph,ralph,ralph.

208
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,160
Let's get this baby rocking!

209
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,200
Yeah!

210
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,450
One,two,three.

211
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,320
she's going over!

212
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,560
Hey,earl.

213
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,610
hey,crab man.

214
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,150
What's up?

215
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,960
You know,in regards to our home being turned on its side and whatnot?

216
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,090
Oh,yeah.

217
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,390
Sons of bitches.

218
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,590
What the hell did you do?

219
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,110
and talk fast,because I'm going to stab you in the throat once I figure out which one of these is the knife drawer!

220
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,610
Oh,come on,joy.

221
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,880
You got to admit it's a little funny.

222
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,150
Tell her,darnell.

223
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,960
Well,maybe in time,we'll come to find a comic absurdity.

224
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,210
Oh,my god.

225
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,130
How long was he on his back?

226
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,390
Found one.

227
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,660
Damn it!

228
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,840
all right,buddy,it's been fun,but I'ot tt back to doris.

229
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,360
I promised I'd take her coffin shopping today.

230
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,990
Ralph,can we come in?

231
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,350
Oh,I don't know.

232
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,460
Too many moving blobs in the house might make doris nervous.

233
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,960
Oh,well,we'll keep still.

234
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,790
Yeah.

235
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,270
Look,there's no way catalina's letting us sleep in the laundry room anymore.

236
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,830
We're starving,and I haven't showered in days.

237
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,660
Yeah,you do kind of stink,but,uh,you know,if my goose gets nervous,

238
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,330
them golden eggs might stop falling from her wrinkled little bottom there,and I can't risk that.

239
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,520
See you later.

240
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,040
It didn't seem fair.

241
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,020
I was outside,hungry,taking a whore's bath and eating birdseed for breakfast,

242
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,920
all because ralph wasn't willing to share his good fortune.

243
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,950
There's a skeeter on my peter flick it off.

244
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,290
He had it so good,he even had a sponge on a stick.

245
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,740
But all that was about to change.

246
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,360
earl,what are you doing?

247
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,840
Actually,ralph,my name is stan johansen.

248
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,270
Yeah,nice try.

249
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,440
You don't even look like stan johansen.

250
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,760
Is everything okay,stan?

251
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,800
Somebody thinks i look like stan.

252
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,520
Yup.Everything's fine,pudding.

253
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,450
Who's that man in his underwear?

254
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,820
A friend who's just about to leave.

255
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,240
What are you doing,man?

256
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,110
That's my old lady.

257
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,340
Get your own sugar granny.

258
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,290
Too bad,ralph.

259
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,710
I'm looking out for number one.

260
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,250
Now,get off my property.

261
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,860
There's a new stan in town.

262
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,880
Yeah? Or how about die hard ii?

263
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,150
earl,that's ralph.

264
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,990
Maybe you can't see him through those glasses.

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,270
You forgot something,ralph.

266
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,820
Before I started that stupid list,I was the boss.

267
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,020
I gave the orders.

268
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,300
Well,there's no list anymore,so get going.

269
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,590
All right,fine,be doris's husband,

270
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,310
but I ain't going to tell you where she keeps the cookie jar money.

271
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,310
Oh,damn it.

272
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,570
What?

273
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,500
Ralph's been our buddy for a long time.

274
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,570
Oh,he would have done the same to us,randy.

275
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,480
Better off without him.

276
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,200
Just two brothers looking out for each other.

277
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,300
By the way,you can't sleep inside.

278
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,100
What?

279
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,180
Where am I gonna sleep?

280
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,920
There's no room at the motel,and it's christmas eve.

281
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm just like jesus's baby.

282
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,590
Randy,it's just for the first couple nights.

283
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,980
We got to ease into it.

284
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,950
Tell you what.

285
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,440
Next week,I'll let you sit perfectly still in the living room and tell doris you're a new chair.

286
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,360
doris,honey,your highchair fell off the toilet again.

287
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,880
What the hell?

288
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,600
Look,stanley.

289
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,380
The whole family came home for christmas.

290
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,380
Even my sister who died in 1973.

291
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,920
silly bitch put moth balls in my cocoa.

292
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,020
What are y'all doing here?

293
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,430
Get out,now!

294
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,940
Nobody's leaving until you listen to what we have to say.

295
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,160
We're here to save you from yourself.

296
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,500
It's called an invention.

297
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,300
It's called an inter-invention,dummy,and we brought tim along

298
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,600
because he's been through one of these already,right,tim?

299
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,890
Twice,and I'm proud to say it worked both times.

300
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,220
Now sit down and let's get this show on the road.

301
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,350
I ain't got all day.

302
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,740
Got a christmas ham in the microwave that needs to be flipped.

303
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,020
We're all here to tell you why we liked you better nice.

304
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,830
Darnell,go.

305
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,820
Hey,earl.

306
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,930
I've written a poem that best expresses how I feel.

307
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:18,450
Sadness falls on us all like food from a sideways refrigerator.

308
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,770
Next!

309
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,520
Before I came to this country,I never had any male friends

310
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,830
because my mother always taught me men are only interested in one thing.

311
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,130
Raping your mother.

312
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,470
Uh,yeah,can you all come back to me?

313
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,830
I misunderstood this whole thing.

314
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,740
I thought we were here to kick his ass.

315
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,370
Earl,it was an honor to be the first person you crossed off your list.

316
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,580
Without your help,I never would have experienced the love of another man.

317
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,140
Next!

318
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,100
I'd follow you anywhere,earl.

319
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,870
I followed you and karma and your list,

320
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,020
and it took me to all these wonderful people.

321
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,080
And now you're leading me away from them,

322
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,640
and-and we're losing our friends,and I don't like it.

323
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,500
I don't like this feeling i got in my stomach anymore.

324
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,710
It's not like when we were helping people.

325
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,490
So let's just go back to the way it was before.

326
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,660
Because if you do good things,good things happen.

327
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,340
Right,earl?

328
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,270
Right?

329
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,270
Nope.

330
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,770
There is no karma.

331
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,870
I did my list for two years,and the only good things that happened were for other people.

332
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,680
If good things were going to happen to me,

333
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,070
they would have happened by now,but they didn'T.

334
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,780
So screw the list,screw karma,

335
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,510
and screw all of you for ruining my christmas morning.

336
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,570
Doris,baby,everyone's leaving.

337
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,720
Come say good-bye to your dead sister.

338
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,510
I had no idea where I was going to,but I knew where I was going from.

339
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,490
I wanted to get as far away from those people as I could.

340
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,470
but karma came looking for me.

341
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,590
a wrapper.

342
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,040
A cheeseburger wrapper.

343
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,670
There is no karma!

344
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,130
I thought karma was dead,but she was just laying low,

345
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,320
keeping a tally of everything I had done wrong.

346
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,580
Okay,you're there.

347
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,090
I get it.

348
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,440
So you only punish me for being bad?

349
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,690
How about rewarding me for being good?

350
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,370
What about that,huh?

351
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,170
Where's the good?

352
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,360
Earl?

353
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,650
And there it was,good.

354
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,930
Billie?

355
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,830
I had met her a few months back.

356
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,930
She wasn't just pretty.

357
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,320
She was trying to turn her life around just like me.

358
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,450
And ever since I met her,I hadn't stopped thinking about her.

359
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,300
She's really made an impression on me,

360
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,840
and now she's made an impression on my whole body.

361
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,630
Oh,my god,I don't believe this is happening.

362
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,540
You're going to be okay.

363
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,040
I was more than okay.

364
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,770
I was on top of the world.

365
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,920
I passed out knowing karma had brought me my good thing,

366
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,670
and that if I was lucky,

367
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,330
maybe we'd spend the rest of our lives side by side.

368
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,890
Stay still.

369
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,140
I'm going to go get some help.
