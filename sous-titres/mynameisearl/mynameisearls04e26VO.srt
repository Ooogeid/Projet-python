00:00:01,192 --> 00:00:04,978
<i>A week ago, the show</i> Inside Probe
<i>aired part one of an investigation</i>

2
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:07,319
<i>they shot 8 years back
about the disappearance</i>

3
00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:09,315
<i>of Crab Shack owner Ernie Belcher.</i>

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,690
It's on!
Second part is really on!

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,848
I guess
we are in the Central time zone.

6
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:18,100
Sorry for doubting you, Sam.

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,602
<i>Last week's episode</i>

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,470
<i>of</i> Inside Probe
<i>was our highest rated ever.</i>

9
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:25,322
It seems all of America
wanted to know

10
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:27,860
what happened to this man
eight years ago.

11
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:31,280
<i>Camden's popular
restaurant owner Ernie Belcher.</i>

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,723
<i>It seemed like everyone we talked to
in the small town of Camden loved Ernie,</i>

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,624
<i>from dirtbags...</i>

14
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,914
Everyone loved Ernie.
He was funny.

15
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,533
<i>to the mentally disabled...</i>

16
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,788
Ernie taught me how to tie my shoes.

17
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:46,570
I've known him for a long time,
almost two years.

18
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,971
<i>to coworkers...</i>

19
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:49,256
Ernie was a genius.

20
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:50,601
<i>to hot women...</i>

21
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:51,976
Ernie was cool.

22
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,835
<i>to NASCAR drivers.</i>

23
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,764
I met Ernie at an autograph signing,
and we just hit it off.

24
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,961
<i>And even a so-called celebrity.</i>

25
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:00,226
I liked Ernie.

26
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,436
<i>Ernie was a respected businessman</i>

27
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:04,396
<i>and beloved member of the community.</i>

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,099
Or was he?

29
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:10,394
Because on the warm summer night
of April 9, 2001,

30
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:12,677
Ernie Belcher vanished.

31
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:16,111
But how could he
just evaporate into thin air?

32
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:17,827
Was he murdered?

33
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:21,831
The Camden Police sure thought so.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,959
And their investigation
led them to these two men.

35
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:28,212
Angry letters from Randy Hickey
found in Ernie's office

36
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,256
uncovered a motive for murder.

37
00:01:30,738 --> 00:01:33,801
<i>"How dare you stop
providing free toothpicks?"</i>

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,543
<i>"How dare you only serve
my favorite item,</i>

39
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:39,885
<i>"fish wings,</i>

40
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,546
<i>"on Wednesdays."</i>

41
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,828
<i>Had Randy Hickey
murdered Ernie in his outrage</i>

42
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,898
<i>over the lack of toothpicks
and fish wings in the Crab Shack?</i>

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,612
<i>The Camden Police sure thought so.</i>

44
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,783
<i>And after 24 hours of interrogation,</i>

45
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,508
<i>they had
a forced confession to prove it.</i>

46
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,836
Then we did it!
We killed Ernie!

47
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:01,162
<i>Randy Hickey,
town simpleton, had confessed.</i>

48
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,374
<i>He and his brother Earl
were notorious lowlifes in Camden.</i>

49
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:09,253
And the arrest sent
the town of Camden into virtual chaos.

50
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:10,991
I'm freaking out.

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,633
I've seen those boys.

52
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,576
The dancers at the club
call them Mustache and B.O.

53
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,971
I call them B.O. One and B.O. Two.

54
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:22,725
The fact that they murdered someone
is the least of their problems.

55
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,754
I hope those Hickey boys
fry for what they did.

56
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,514
I'm gonna miss Ernie.

57
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,089
He was a gentleman.

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,493
I remember one time,

59
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,329
I was performing a sexual act on him
and it started to rain,

60
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:37,354
and he held his shirt out over my head
so my hair wouldn't get wet.

61
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:42,068
Made me feel
a little bit like a princess.

62
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:46,393
<i>And with the cheapest lawyer
in town at their side,</i>

63
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:49,293
<i>it wasn't looking good
for the Hickey brothers.</i>

64
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:52,592
But the Hickey brothers
were provided with an alibi

65
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,417
from a reliable witness.

66
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,093
<i>Two-time Daytona 500 winner
Michael Waltrip,</i>

67
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,037
<i>whose testimony counts
for as much as three regular Americans.</i>

68
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,314
Fortunately for those guys,
I'm a bit of a shutterbug,

69
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,781
and I had my camera with me,

70
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:09,313
so I got a pretty complete record
of what happened that night.

71
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,009
The police were stymied
and gave up their case.

72
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,090
How is it possible that Ernie Belcher
could simply disappear?

73
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,565
<i>Inside Probe</i> decided to dig...

74
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,861
a little deeper...

75
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:24,605
into the earth...

76
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,680
to find the treasure chest...

77
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:28,104
of the truth...

78
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,551
of this mystery.

79
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:31,396
Tonight on <i>Inside Probe</i>.

80
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,897
INSIDE PROBE (PART 2)

81
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:56,110
I can't wait to find out
who killed Ernie.

82
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,803
I'm just glad it wasn't me.

83
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:01,407
That would've been an awesome twist,
I've always thought I was a nice guy.

84
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:04,304
I bet it was the cheese grater killer
that got Ernie.

85
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:07,955
Remember when we found that big pile
of ground beef with the sock in it?

86
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:10,868
I hope that wasn't Ernie
'cause I ate that.

87
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:13,819
- And I'm wearing that sock.
- We don't even know if he's dead.

88
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:15,717
It could be
a perfectly normal thing, like

89
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:19,425
the government forced him to leave town,
change his identity, marry a hot blonde.

90
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:22,272
Who marries a hot blonde
and doesn't brag about it?

91
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:24,221
You get a trophy,
you put it on a shelf.

92
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,077
Ernie was our friend.

93
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:29,042
If he was still alive, he would've found
a way to get in touch with us.

94
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,936
And if all he did was move away,

95
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,148
he would've said good-bye.
I'm sticking with the cheese grater.

96
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:38,819
<i>So once it was established that
the Hickey boys were not responsible,</i>

97
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:42,389
which came as a shock
to everyone here at <i>Inside Probe</i>,

98
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:45,864
our investigation moved on
to something a little more...

99
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:47,454
out of this world.

100
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,964
Well, Randy's got an interesting

101
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,089
hypo...

102
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:53,959
pot...

103
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:55,252
hyp...

104
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,220
hypo...

105
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:58,395
thesis.

106
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,381
A theory.

107
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:01,476
Aliens.

108
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,117
From outer space.

109
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,163
<i>Stories of alien abduction
are nothing new.</i>

110
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:10,564
<i>Even cavemen recorded
these primitive drawings</i>

111
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:11,831
<i>of the phenomena.</i>

112
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:13,646
You can ask my wife all about it.

113
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,981
She saw some sort of alien thing
right on that very night.

114
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,321
That's a great 'stache, by the way.
Do you put some kind of conditioner?

115
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,438
Yes, but it's very expensive.

116
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,408
It was this strange whooshing noise,

117
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:27,927
then a loud boom.

118
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,745
Then I saw these amazing lights.

119
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,884
For a minute, I thought it was Jesus,
but he would say, "Hey, Joy. What's up?"

120
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,459
So it must have been aliens.

121
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,439
I was coming out of the Crab Shack,

122
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:40,021
fixing to sell Wilfrid Dierkes
some muscle relaxants,

123
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:42,394
which were really
just leftover birth control pills,

124
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,303
when we were both awestruck
by this blinding light from above.

125
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:52,035
<i>While officially the police
discounted the alien theory,</i>

126
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,489
<i>there was one officer who had a...</i>

127
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,677
<i>different point of view.</i>

128
00:05:57,996 --> 00:05:59,733
I remember that night well.

129
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,990
Earlier, the captain
was giving out assignments,

130
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:04,686
and one of us had to go investigate

131
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:06,881
some sort of underground

132
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:09,785
gay homosexual party at the park.

133
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,162
And...

134
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:14,331
I drew the long straw,
so I was forced to do it.

135
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:16,791
Isn't it usually the short straw
that loses?

136
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,813
No, it's the long straw.
The long straw loses.

137
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:25,966
We set up some surveillance cameras
ahead of time.

138
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,783
And then, to make sure that
I would blend in with the gay sexuals,

139
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,066
I went undercover.

140
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,746
Nothing criminal
seemed to be going on.

141
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,815
Just a lot of well-built men
letting off some steam.

142
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:43,124
And then I ended up being the meat
in a dance sandwich.

143
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:45,922
It was terrible.

144
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,382
<i>Where'd you get that shirt?</i>

145
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,155
To stay in character

146
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:53,796
was one of the toughest
professional challenges of my career.

147
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:58,792
Then suddenly there were
these bright lights in the sky.

148
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,670
I didn't know what to think.

149
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:05,131
One of the guys said
it was like being at a Cher concert,

150
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:06,931
but all I could think was...

151
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:08,939
UFOs.

152
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,188
<i>Aliens were spotted all over Camden,</i>

153
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:16,013
<i>including at the Crab Shack
the night of Ernie's disappearance.</i>

154
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,203
I remember that night.

155
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,355
I was working
in the Crab Shack bathroom.

156
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,441
I just finished
pouring the new cement floor,

157
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,860
and I was heading out to my truck
when I saw the flash,

158
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,455
and it about blinded me,
and I was like, "Whoa!

159
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,699
I need to get
some Radnor 6400 welding goggles."

160
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,536
You know what I'm saying?

161
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,955
I saw UFO once.

162
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:38,520
It was like a big silver football.

163
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,709
It was from the planet Goodyear.

164
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:43,294
I tried to shoot it down,

165
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,081
but their force field technology
must have been too strong.

166
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:49,218
<i>It turns out that in Camden,</i>

167
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,658
<i>it's harder to find
someone who had not seen a UFO</i>

168
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:54,093
<i>than somebody who had.</i>

169
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:55,057
Next!

170
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,705
I believe in alien life.

171
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,490
I've seen some freaky-deaky things
in my day.

172
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,471
And just when you think
you've seen it all,

173
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:05,046
along comes a guy
with a green wiener.

174
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:06,961
Explain that.

175
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,990
Aliens.

176
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:12,626
Listen, don't believe too much
of what you hear around here.

177
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:16,613
40% of the town, including the mayor,
claim they've seen a leprechaun.

178
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:19,120
Trust me,
Ernie wasn't abducted by aliens.

179
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,926
I'll tell you what I think.

180
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,538
What was Darnell Turner about to say

181
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:27,413
before we realized this would be
a good dramatic breaking point?

182
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,872
If it wasn't a UFO that took Ernie,

183
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:31,400
then where is he?

184
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,928
Is it possible
that Ernie's disappearance

185
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:35,889
is a result of the Civil War?

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,242
<i>We'll stick the probe
even deeper inside</i>

187
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,311
<i>when</i> Inside Probe <i>returns.</i>

188
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,130
What the hell were you about to say?

189
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:05,794
Darnell, what were you
about to say on that TV show?

190
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,177
I don't remember what I said.
Eight years is a long time ago.

191
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:21,746
<i>The mystery of Ernie Belcher
was raising more questions than answers.</i>

192
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,270
Was it murder?

193
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:26,604
Was it alien abduction?

194
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:31,621
Or could it have been
something of historic proportion?

195
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:34,218
History.

196
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,820
During the Civil War,
Camden was reluctant

197
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:39,198
to make a commitment
to the North or the South.

198
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:41,371
So they decided
to create a neutral country,

199
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,729
a tiny nation
they would call "the Central."

200
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:46,772
Even though it was
over a hundred years ago,

201
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,842
Ernie was profoundly loyal
to the Central.

202
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,797
Even flew the Central flag
on the roof.

203
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,467
Central is number one!
Central is number one!

204
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,221
My great,

205
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,346
great,

206
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:58,646
great,

207
00:09:58,892 --> 00:09:59,892
great,

208
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,061
great... That's too many.

209
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:04,255
He was my great,

210
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:05,832
great...

211
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,517
Anyway, he was around
during the Civil War

212
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,292
and he led the Central.

213
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,878
<i>General Jefferson Washington Hickey,</i>

214
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:16,118
<i>leader of the Central.</i>

215
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:18,141
<i>We shall not be forced to pick sides</i>

216
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,704
<i>between the North's
industrial economy</i>

217
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,129
<i>or the South's tradition of slavery.</i>

218
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,988
<i>We deserve and demand
and shall have both.</i>

219
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,343
It's sad, you know,

220
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,214
'cause my great, great...
whatever,

221
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:35,656
he just wanted to get North and South
to come to an agreement.

222
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:38,644
<i>And the North and South
did come to an agreement:</i>

223
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,219
<i>that they need
to massacre the Central.</i>

224
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:44,439
The Central was formed
at 3:30 on March 10, 1861.

225
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:46,812
By 3:45, it was gone.

226
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,064
Like I said, Ernie insisted on

227
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,033
flying the flag of the Central
on the roof,

228
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:53,610
even though people thought it was
an embarrassment to the town.

229
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:55,321
It's not an embarrassment!

230
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,865
When Civil War II starts,
the Central will rise again.

231
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,271
Rise again!

232
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:03,537
People get pretty worked up.

233
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,125
If you really want to talk
to somebody about Central pride,

234
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,000
you should talk to Ernie.

235
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:13,277
He's missing, isn't he?

236
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:15,397
That's the whole reason you're here.

237
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:18,672
I just got carried away
with all that Central stuff.

238
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:24,528
Hey, man, can't you see
I'm doing an interview with "Girardo"?

239
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,739
Sorry about that.

240
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,024
So, was it overzealous loyalty
that lead to the end of Ernie

241
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,203
or was it something darker?

242
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,683
Could it have been Ernie's
involvement in the world

243
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:37,558
of underground kinky sex?

244
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:42,791
I'd bet on the sex.

245
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,204
He had an Internet business

246
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,861
that gather a clientele
of straight-up freaks.

247
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,701
Just how freaky was Ernie Belcher?

248
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,293
Pretty freaky.

249
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:53,302
<i>We will be right back.</i>

250
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,576
All right, everybody,
I got $20 that Ernie was that torso

251
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,386
they found floating
in the Camden swamp.

252
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,012
And I got $20 that he was torn to shreds
by that half-dog half-coyote

253
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:06,850
that hangs out
behind the truck stop.

254
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,011
You think Dogote did it?

255
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:11,563
You can't take bets
on what happened to Ernie.

256
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,077
Why not? We took bets

257
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:15,734
on what was wrong
with that blue kid we found at the park.

258
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,778
But this is different,
Ernie was a friend.

259
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,780
He was part of our everyday lives.

260
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,824
I don't know about you guys,
but that matters to me.

261
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,535
Hush up, princess.
It's coming back on.

262
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,958
<i>If Ernie Belcher's
mysterious disappearance</i>

263
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,418
<i>was not a result
of anti-Centralist zealotry,</i>

264
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:35,045
could it be because

265
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,744
this pillar of the community
had a secret, darker side?

266
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,504
For anyone out there
who is not aware

267
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,846
of the vast array
of pornography on the Internet,

268
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,641
you're about to become
far less productive.

269
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,638
Ernie had a little side business
where he shot fetish videos

270
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:52,572
and sold them on his website.

271
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:55,797
I starred in some.
Made a little money on the side.

272
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,151
Got a little weird.

273
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:04,563
<i>Who's been a bad boy?</i>

274
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,577
<i>Me, right-right here.
I- I've been a bad boy.</i>

275
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,326
Yeah, I was in some
of Ernie's videos.

276
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:22,009
He told me I could have
all the free crabs I could eat forever.

277
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,960
Of course, Ernie's missing now,

278
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:27,285
and apparently, he never told
anyone else who works here about it!

279
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,650
So, I'm a little pissed about that.

280
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:36,132
<i>Oh, man.</i>

281
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:40,249
<i>It's a size 11 from, like, 1988.</i>

282
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,893
<i>And, look, it's filled
with macaroni and cheese.</i>

283
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,686
<i>This is going to be so good.</i>

284
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:55,755
<i>Wow, this is good.</i>

285
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,586
<i>Do I really get
to eat the whole shoeful?</i>

286
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,129
No, I didn't appear
in any of Ernie's sex videos.

287
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:06,943
<i>Are you pretty?</i>

288
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,540
<i>Yes, I'm pretty.</i>

289
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,717
Yeah, I did
some kinky videos for Ernie.

290
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:24,732
I mean, how often is it that you
get to work with a real TV star?

291
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:29,764
<i>Nice.</i>

292
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,883
I don't remember
doing any fetish videos.

293
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:36,147
Of course, I'm told I was on a show

294
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:39,122
called <i>Parker Lewis Can't Lose</i>
for three years

295
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,129
and I don't remember that, either.

296
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,341
Can you think of anyone
who might have wanted Ernie gone?

297
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,508
Oh, hell, anybody who
might have found out

298
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,553
about his hidden cameras
in the bathroom.

299
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:52,039
He had secret hidden cameras
all over the women's bathroom.

300
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:54,309
When I found out,
I almost killed him my own self.

301
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,144
Why didn't you say
anything about this?

302
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,349
He paid me off
not to tell the other girls.

303
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:00,190
That's why I always peed
in the alley.

304
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,399
Can you show me?

305
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,736
Well, I don't really have
to go right now.

306
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,779
Buy me a beer
I'll see what I can work up.

307
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,739
I meant, can you
show me the hidden cameras?

308
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,786
Well, buy me a beer
and I'll show you.

309
00:15:13,104 --> 00:15:14,690
<i>Inside Probe</i> went to work

310
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:17,207
and found
all of Ernie's hidden cameras.

311
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,206
Yeah, they're all still here.

312
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:21,795
There's overheads one...

313
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,583
two...

314
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:25,045
three.

315
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,956
And there's
the behind-the-mirror cam.

316
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,138
And the pee-pee cam.

317
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:38,751
And we probed a little deeper

318
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,626
and found something else.

319
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:55,091
A video tape, just as I suspected.

320
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:58,906
Could Ernie's sick,
perverted hidden bathroom tapes

321
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,626
finally shed some light
on his disappearance?

322
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,027
Sure, there were innocent things,

323
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:05,855
like a drunken Randy Hickey

324
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,380
stealing tampons
and sanitary napkins.

325
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,390
A local stripper trying to hide
the shame of her secret eating.

326
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,142
A daytime prostitute
having a working lunch.

327
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,563
Earl Hickey hiding in the bathroom

328
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,559
after snatching a bottle of booze
from behind the bar.

329
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:35,513
The hidden cameras even caught
an icon of American television

330
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,376
putting on his game face.

331
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:39,938
Never show weakness.
Never show weakness.

332
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:42,626
You're a rock star.
You're Geraldo Rivera.

333
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,129
This is what they pay you
because you're worth it.

334
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,654
Someone's in here.

335
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:49,227
It's not Geraldo.

336
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,500
Hidden cameras, historical grudges,

337
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,887
lights in the sky,

338
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:58,276
a bathroom that was being remodeled.

339
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,637
Four seemingly random events,

340
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:03,350
until we revisited an interview

341
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:05,848
we had done with the black
co-worker who, at the time,

342
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:08,151
we assumed was giving us
a fake alibi.

343
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,383
Every night at closing time,
I had to go up on the roof

344
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:13,121
to take down the flag of the Central

345
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,464
or else someone would snatch it
and destroy it.

346
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,032
I saw some malcontent
trying to pull down the flag

347
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:19,720
and, while I agreed with him,

348
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,915
it was my duty
to protect Ernie's property.

349
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,454
So, I attacked him
with lethal precision.

350
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,814
He was a worthy opponent,

351
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:28,989
and our fight caused us
to fall into the flagpole.

352
00:17:29,243 --> 00:17:30,875
The flagpole hit the power line,

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,200
and it was a pretty big explosion.

354
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:37,680
This would explain the UFO
that several people saw that night.

355
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,047
You might be asking,

356
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,961
"What does any of this
have to do with Ernie?"

357
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,520
Well, we're about to show you.

358
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:47,073
These were victim
Ernie Belcher's final moments.

359
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:50,076
Here you see Ernie
enter the bathroom.

360
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,488
It's awkward because
he's avoiding the wet cement.

361
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:57,759
He's presumably going to change
the tape in his hidden VCR

362
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,710
when suddenly, he is startled
by a commotion on the roof.

363
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,810
As the battle on the roof raged on,

364
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:06,924
the power went out,

365
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,255
and, unable to see,
Ernie lost his footing.

366
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:13,800
And, for the semi-conscious
Ernie Belcher,

367
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:15,992
the harsh reality

368
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,804
was sinking in,

369
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:20,502
as was his body.

370
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,870
Wow. I always thought
that was a nose-shaped doorstop.

371
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:44,664
I can't believe it.

372
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,239
Ernie's been right here
in the Crab Shack for eight years,

373
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:50,620
- and nobody knew it.
- You know what's so funny?

374
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:54,090
For years, I've been using that thing
to clean gum off the bottom of my shoes.

375
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,543
Well, Ernie, the Crab Shack
was always a part of you.

376
00:18:57,996 --> 00:19:00,513
Now you will always be
a part of the Crab Shack.

377
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:04,519
We can finally give you
a real good-bye.

378
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,312
Good-bye, friend.

379
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:09,566
You got a little...

380
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:12,555
I got it.

381
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,543
Well, boss,

382
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,930
you died like a hero
from the Central,

383
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:24,955
quickly and in the bathroom.

384
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:29,869
Later, Ernie.

385
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,094
Say hey to Grandma Nancy for me.

386
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:35,286
Unless, by some miracle,
you ended up in heaven.

387
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:40,745
Good-bye, pal.

388
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,287
Just in case there's some chance

389
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:44,182
you're alive
breathing through your nose,

390
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,975
I want you to know that I
forgive you for the toothpicks,

391
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:50,505
but I will never forgive you
for the fish wings.
