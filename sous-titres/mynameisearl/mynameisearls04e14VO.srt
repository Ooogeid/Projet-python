1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,210
GOT THE BABYSITTER PREGNANT

2
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:06,072
<i>One of the great things
about the Crab Shack</i>

3
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:08,981
<i>is people come by when they got
something exciting to share.</i>

4
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:10,640
Great news!

5
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:13,930
My stalker just got hit by a bus.
He's paralyzed from the waist down.

6
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,375
Congratulations.

7
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:19,336
Good news! Saw the new family.

8
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:21,479
I'm still the hottest mom
in the trailer park.

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,944
Congratulations.

10
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:27,104
Good news! I'm not pregnant.

11
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:28,581
Congratulations...

12
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:31,281
congratulations, congratulations.

13
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:35,132
<i>Hearing about a pregnancy
reminded me of something on my list:</i>

14
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:37,240
<i>"Got the babysitter pregnant."</i>

15
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:41,988
<i>When I was growing up,
Fridays were square dancing night.</i>

16
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,257
<i>The first week, I lit a bale
of straw on fire, so I'd get banned.</i>

17
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:48,049
<i>I did it for two reasons.</i>

18
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,564
<i>First,
because square dancing is lame,</i>

19
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:53,551
<i>and second,
'cause we had a hot new babysitter:</i>

20
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:54,837
<i>Rachel McGann.</i>

21
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,432
What do you want for dinner?

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,803
How about we just grab a bottle of wine
and sit outside?

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,220
<i>I desperately wanted Rachel to like me,
so I used my best moves on her.</i>

24
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,187
Hey, Rachel. Forgot you were here.

25
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:13,573
Probably 'cause I was working out
so hard in my bedroom.

26
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,496
<i>She was my first love,</i>

27
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,806
<i>but I didn't know
if she liked me back.</i>

28
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:24,625
What are you listening to?

29
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,432
It's this band, Lynyrd Skynyrd.

30
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:28,163
You have to hear this.

31
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:37,197
<i>Now that our ears had touched,
I knew it was time to make my move.</i>

32
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,190
Time for bed, Earl.

33
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:50,639
I brought <i>Risky Business</i>.

34
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,278
I love that movie.

35
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:56,586
And maybe afterwards,
a little frisky business.

36
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:02,637
<i>That son of a bitch
ruined my chances,</i>

37
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,670
<i>so I was gonna make him pay.</i>

38
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>Really pay.</i>

39
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,413
<i>After that, Rachel changed.</i>

40
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:38,539
Well, look on the bright side.

41
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:41,327
We already know
you're a good babysitter.

42
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:50,745
You just saw something that made
you think of your list, didn't you?

43
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,517
- It's got...
- No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

44
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,564
Is it
"threw up in the pickled egg jar"?

45
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,950
"Threw up on the electric crab"?

46
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:06,227
I give up.

47
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,354
It's "got the babysitter pregnant."

48
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:12,775
Darnell, <i>uno margarita, por favor</i>.

49
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,195
Now that a Democrat's in office,
we all better learn Spanish.

50
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,342
Didn't you say
you were bringing Mr. Turtle?

51
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:21,117
I got the dishwasher
to the perfect temperature for his bath.

52
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,363
I forgot him back at your trailer.

53
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,291
<i>Joy wasn't exactly lying,</i>

54
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,085
<i>but she wasn't telling
the whole truth, either.</i>

55
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:35,478
Damn it, Eugenia!

56
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,577
Duncan chewed
through his leash again.

57
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:39,820
Come here.

58
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:48,020
Your mama's gotta learn
to pay attention.

59
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,747
<i>I tracked down Rachel and was surprised
to find she was still with Daniel.</i>

60
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:03,776
We are just as happy
as two peanuts in a shell.

61
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,433
I used to think it was fate,

62
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:08,529
but I guess we should thank you
for saving us all those wasted years

63
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:10,165
of searching for the right one.

64
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,502
In fact, you are responsible
for this wonderful day.

65
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,091
And it gets better.

66
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:24,680
I guess it looks
like everything turned out okay.

67
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:27,380
But...

68
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:30,102
I still feel
like I did something wrong.

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,535
Don't be silly.

70
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,899
You brought
a new life into this world.

71
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,774
How could that ever be wrong?

72
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:39,884
Could you guys possibly make
any more noise?

73
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,686
It's not like I'm trying
to sleep or anything.

74
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:46,410
I guess I have to make my own breakfast,
since I don't hear any bacon sizzling.

75
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:49,854
That's our boy.

76
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:52,772
Skim milk?

77
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:54,690
Really?

78
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,043
Skim?

79
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:58,130
Unbelievable.

80
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,884
Who wants to see more pictures?

81
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:06,703
<i>While I sat with Rachel and Daniel,</i>

82
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,767
<i>Joy was trying to correct
a past mistake of her own.</i>

83
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,810
Where the hell is Earl?

84
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,146
How should I know?
I'm his maid, not his secretary.

85
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:17,483
You foreigners have
a weird way of bragging.

86
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,209
Do me a favor...

87
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,363
Which one
looks more like Mr. Turtle?

88
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,156
What did you do to Mr. Turtle?

89
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:25,851
I didn't do anything.

90
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:27,861
He slid off the roof of the Brat.

91
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:30,458
Ironically,
I had just Turtle-Waxed it.

92
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,737
Don't you judge me.
You don't know what kind of lies

93
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:36,082
one has to perpetrate
to keep a marriage afloat.

94
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,897
What am I supposed to do,
tell him the truth and break his heart?

95
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,167
I don't want Crab Man to be sad.

96
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:42,746
Just pick.

97
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:47,131
Mr. Turtle always reminded me
of Richard Dreyfuss.

98
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,541
This one looks
like Richard Dreyfuss.

99
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,985
But this one acts
more like Richard Dreyfuss.

100
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,748
I'd go with this one.

101
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,152
This album is
from Ronnie's high school graduation.

102
00:05:58,277 --> 00:06:00,901
We didn't know he wasn't graduating
until they didn't call his name,

103
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:03,199
so that was a surprise.

104
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,404
You're gonna need to get a ride
to work tomorrow. I need the car.

105
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:07,491
What for, sugar?

106
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:10,261
Does everything have to be
a debate with you, Rachel?

107
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:12,290
Just give me the stupid car!

108
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,376
If you don't mind me asking,

109
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,586
what the hell is going on
with Ronnie?

110
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:22,217
You know, kids and their phases.

111
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,736
Where's my pee bottles?

112
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,096
Sorry, honey.
They're in the dishwasher.

113
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,337
We've been meaning
to put a bathroom down there.

114
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:32,551
It is a lot of steps
for him to take.

115
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:33,802
Kids.

116
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,811
What are you gonna do?

117
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,689
Kid? He's a grown man.
Shouldn't he be out on his own?

118
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:41,350
We told him to look for an apartment.
We gave him a month's rent,

119
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:45,112
but he blew it all one night
taking a call girl to Ultimate Fighting.

120
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,196
Cool.

121
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,487
And she was a doll.

122
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:50,803
We hoped they'd go out again, but...

123
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,689
couldn't afford it.

124
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:55,382
I think this is
why Karma brought me here.

125
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:58,242
I'm responsible
for Ronnie becoming your baby,

126
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,253
maybe I should be responsible
for Ronnie becoming a man.

127
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,355
But what if he's not ready
to become a man?

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,551
You know,
it's a dangerous world out there.

129
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,874
We're not seals, Earl.
We don't just...

130
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,799
throw our babies in the water
to see if they live.

131
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:14,234
You're being too emotional
about this.

132
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,648
In your head, you know
if you want Ronnie to grow up,

133
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,786
you need
to throw him out on his ass,

134
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,706
but your heart won't let you do it.

135
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,984
This kid needs tough love.
Let me do it for you.

136
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:26,578
I think the cops might be coming.

137
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,697
The neighbor just saw me
peeing out the window.

138
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:34,253
Help! Abuse! Abuse!

139
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,697
Don't worry. My brother's good
at teaching people stuff.

140
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:41,036
Mom!

141
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,381
He taught me that.

142
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:51,316
<i>I was determined to make Ronnie
independent by doing the hard thing:</i>

143
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:54,807
<i>staying tough and giving him
the discipline he never got at home.</i>

144
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:57,393
You are lucky
I dropped out of karate, man.

145
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,936
I paid rent on this room for three days.
You got that long to get a job.

146
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:02,648
After that, you're on your own.

147
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:05,234
- When do I get my allowance?
- Fridays.

148
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,528
There's no allowance.

149
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:08,821
Just find a job.

150
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,531
Something's wrong with Mr. Turtle.

151
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,209
Crap.

152
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,254
By now, he's usually spun
this thing a whole quarter turn.

153
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:29,341
Well,
maybe you worked him out too much.

154
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,108
I mean, he's already got
a six-pack on his belly.

155
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,677
He must have tried
to hump his heating rock again.

156
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:38,183
The rejection always depresses him.

157
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,296
You know, Randy...

158
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:50,253
I've always wondered
how good I'd be raising a teenager.

159
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:53,282
I got to say,
I think I'd be pretty good at it.

160
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,795
I like this "tough dad" thing.

161
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,368
I don't know, Earl.

162
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,391
I'm a nervous wreck.

163
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:01,999
No wonder Mom drank.

164
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,655
I'm gonna check the bullet hole

165
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,827
and see if my no-nonsense parenting
has fixed Ronnie yet.

166
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:09,673
<i>Unfortunately, he wasn't fixed.</i>

167
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:12,679
<i>He was just lying there
like a big slug.</i>

168
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:17,572
You just lost your TV privileges.

169
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:18,829
I hate you!

170
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,685
<i>That's when I knew
I was being a good parent...</i>

171
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,738
<i>A tough parent...
But the next day,</i>

172
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,134
<i>Ronnie still hadn't done anything.</i>

173
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:29,651
Got two days left. Better get a job.

174
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,623
I hate you!

175
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:36,797
<i>But, even with nothing in the room,
Ronnie still found a way to waste time.</i>

176
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:38,738
Now you lost your zipper.

177
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,707
Tomorrow, you're out.
Hope you're ready.

178
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,968
I hate you more.

179
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,994
<i>Me and Joy were both trying
to motivate someone,</i>

180
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,834
<i>but she took a more loving approach.</i>

181
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,745
Come on. Walk, stupid.

182
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,773
What do you need, some incentive?

183
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:04,405
There you go.

184
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:08,867
You want some more of that?
You better get to walking.

185
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,624
<i>After three days
of not trying to get a job,</i>

186
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:13,899
<i>I let the motel kick Ronnie out.</i>

187
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,595
<i>I was hoping a night in the parking lot
had finally made him a man.</i>

188
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:21,578
Son of a bitch.

189
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,692
Homeless Mom,
these eggs are amazing.

190
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:29,081
- Can I have some more?
- I'll see if I can find another nest.

191
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,256
I can't believe you.

192
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:34,998
You're just mad I figured out
how to feed myself.

193
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:36,432
You didn't feed yourself.

194
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:39,136
You just talked a homeless woman
into cooking baby birds for you.

195
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,889
You're pathetic.

196
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,683
For God sakes, act like a man.

197
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,852
It's not my fault they kicked me out.
You only paid for three days.

198
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,140
You're too old to be living
in a motel room

199
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:49,672
someone else is paying for.

200
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:51,373
Not now.

201
00:10:51,498 --> 00:10:53,713
You got no job, no skills,

202
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:55,701
all you do is
mooch off other people.

203
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,638
I said not now, Randy.

204
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:01,159
You're 22 years old, man.
Have some self-respect.

205
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:02,619
You're just sad.

206
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,414
I'm 31, and all that stuff
describes me.

207
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:07,416
Why don't you wait
in the motel room?

208
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,435
Who, me? The guy with no job,
who has no skills,

209
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,005
go wait in the motel room
you pay for?

210
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,549
This isn't about you.
It's about this loser.

211
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,802
If you think he's a loser,
then you must think I'm a loser, too.

212
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,443
- He does think you're a loser.
- I didn't say that.

213
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,640
Do you think
I could take care of myself?

214
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,510
Yeah, sure. Of course.

215
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:30,647
Well, at least now I know the truth.

216
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:32,441
Where are you going?

217
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:34,073
I'm going to prove to you

218
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,111
that I can live on my own
like a grown-up.

219
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:37,301
Cool.

220
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,741
I'm gonna follow you around now,
and probably live off you.

221
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,261
Looks like I got myself a Randy.

222
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,007
- Aren't you worried about Randy?
- Randy? My brother?

223
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:00,529
He'll be back
as soon as he gets hungry

224
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,296
or forgets he's running away.

225
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:05,016
Either way,
I'm not gonna get emotional about it

226
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,933
'cause that's what
they want you to do.

227
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,936
You picked the wrong one, dummy!

228
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,065
No, other dummy.

229
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,888
You picked the stupid turtle
and Darnell's getting suspicious.

230
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,152
Where's the other one?

231
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,738
He's in the pool with
all the other animals people dumped.

232
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:22,917
I think there's a Shetland pony
at the bottom.

233
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,565
I'm conflicted.

234
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:26,902
I would love to rat
Joy out to Crab Man,

235
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:28,386
but I don't want him to worry

236
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,817
about his poor little buddy
out there on his own.

237
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,505
I think he'll be okay.

238
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,836
I don't know.
Anything can happen.

239
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:38,048
It's a dangerous world out there
for a helpless guy like that.

240
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,094
It is a dangerous world out there.

241
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:43,595
Bad things happen all the time.

242
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,139
I mean, he's slow.
He's vulnerable.

243
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,518
He sure is. He doesn't look
before he crosses the street.

244
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,771
You touch him and don't wash your hands,
you could get salmonella.

245
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,439
He eats anything people give him.

246
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,691
When he falls on his back,
he can almost never get up.

247
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:59,379
I know,
I gotta roll him over all the time.

248
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:05,615
I screwed up.
Our boys might be dead.

249
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,314
I can't believe this.

250
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,461
You made me have a little boy
and now you made me lose him!

251
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:18,832
I know, I know.
I lost mine, too.

252
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:20,590
This tough love
isn't so easy, is it?

253
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,842
It's horrible.

254
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,225
How can you not be emotional
about somebody you love?

255
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,555
He's out there in 67-degree weather.

256
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,598
- Did you pack light sweaters?
- No!

257
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:29,724
Oh, God!

258
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,345
Ronnie, it's Mommy!

259
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,684
Randy, I got rainbow sugar bits!

260
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,896
Oh, thank God.

261
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,249
"Sars."

262
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,484
Must've been a Norwegian guy.

263
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,382
All right, we should keep looking.

264
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:59,239
The only thing down there
is a Shetland pony.

265
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,236
Oh, that's my jam.

266
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:22,022
Hey, baby!

267
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:23,445
What's going on?

268
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,864
Mr. Turtle died this morning.

269
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,301
He went quietly.

270
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:37,040
I am so sorry.

271
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,497
I can't believe this is happening.

272
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:42,122
Typically,
his species lives to be 150.

273
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:46,497
I guess his love of butter lettuce
finally caught up to him.

274
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,373
Too soon.

275
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,228
That's not Mr. Turtle.

276
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,696
I lost the real Mr. Turtle.

277
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:09,003
I was bringing him to the Crab Shack
and I accidentally drove off

278
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:10,700
with him on the roof of the car.

279
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:12,911
Who's this son of a bitch, then?

280
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:16,802
I found him in the pond,
trapped in a six-pack ring.

281
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:22,088
You could've gotten away with this.

282
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,048
I would've buried this bastard
and never been the wiser,

283
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:27,133
but you told the truth.

284
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,770
You looked so sad.

285
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:35,057
Couldn't put you through that
just to protect myself.

286
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:40,500
That means Mr. Turtle's
out there somewhere.

287
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,435
If any reptile can make it home,

288
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
it's him.

289
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,279
<i>While Darnell was gaining hope,</i>

290
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,838
<i>after searching all night</i>

291
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:51,123
<i>in every place we could think of,
we gave up.</i>

292
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:52,871
Don't worry, we'll find them.

293
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:56,224
Everyone knows that cops say
"probably dead" all the time.

294
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,292
You're alive!

295
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:06,122
Yeah, that's my brother.
No, I gotta go.

296
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,634
Okay. Send me the link.

297
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,295
Okay, buddy, yeah.
I gotta jump.

298
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:23,387
Earl, you're not gonna believe
what happened.

299
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:26,638
<i>After Randy and Ronnie left,
they started walking</i>

300
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:29,681
<i>and since Randy
now had a Randy of his own,</i>

301
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:31,573
<i>he started feeling more responsible.</i>

302
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,870
And I'm gonna start
growing a mustache.

303
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,724
You watch out for aliens and birds.

304
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:37,496
That's what the number two does.

305
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,331
Most people don't understand
how important that is.

306
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:44,572
Sweet! A wallet.

307
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:46,622
There's probably money in it.
Let's try crack.

308
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:49,481
No! It doesn't belong to us.

309
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,132
Excuse me, sir.

310
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:53,303
I think you dropped your wallet.

311
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,639
<i>The man was so shocked
by Randy's honesty</i>

312
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:59,410
<i>that he let the boys pick anything
they wanted from the thrift store.</i>

313
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:00,996
Check it out.

314
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,871
My suit had a note in it.

315
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,223
"Don't forget to buy milk."

316
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:08,151
Ronnie, don't let me forget
to buy milk.

317
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,281
So, what do we do now?

318
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,415
Let's follow those guys.

319
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,664
<i>It turns out, when they started
looking like grown-ups,</i>

320
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:23,742
<i>people started treating them
like grown-ups.</i>

321
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,117
Hello, gentlemen.

322
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,176
Welcome to the
American Flange Stoppers

323
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:30,507
and Fastener Manufacturers Trade
Association Annual Convention.

324
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,184
Where all your dreams
can come true...

325
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:35,887
as long as they're flange stopper
or fastener related.

326
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,371
As you can see,
domestic flange production

327
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,462
has declined sharply
over the past two quarters.

328
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,090
Looking forward...

329
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,148
Where are you gentlemen going?

330
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:51,503
This is boring.

331
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,531
I don't even know why we're here.

332
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,995
Oh, for God's sake, he's right.

333
00:17:58,182 --> 00:18:00,632
Why are we dancing
around the obvious?

334
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:05,542
The American flange used to be
the envy of the world.

335
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,045
FDR once said,

336
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,529
"The pipes of freedom
are held together

337
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:13,399
by the American flange."

338
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,720
Those pipes are leaking, damn it,

339
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:18,722
but these boys are right.

340
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:22,058
It is high time
we did something about it!

341
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:28,869
<i>By the end of the day,</i>

342
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:31,318
<i>Randy and Ronnie were
the hit of the convention.</i>

343
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:33,903
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

344
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:35,590
for the close of what has been

345
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,243
the most exciting flange
convention in years,

346
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,241
we're giving away a golf cart

347
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,016
to the winner
of our annual dance contest.

348
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:48,759
Oh, no, they didn't.

349
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:50,739
Follow my lead.

350
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:52,365
We got this.

351
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,278
- I was worried sick!
- Why?

352
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:07,270
I just did the things
I learned by watching you.

353
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,678
When you have something important to do,
you put on a suit.

354
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:14,305
I was honest when I found that wallet,
just like you would have been.

355
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,112
Plus, I took care of my Randy.

356
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,021
<i>That's when I realized
all you can do is</i>

357
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:21,576
<i>teach them the best you can
and trust they'll find their way.</i>

358
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,552
It was amazing!
There was free food and drinks

359
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:27,489
and people were having fun at work.

360
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:29,099
And someone called me "Sir"

361
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:31,202
and it wasn't followed by
"you have to leave."

362
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,429
<i>And after feeling
that kind of respect,</i>

363
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,366
<i>Ronnie decided to go back to school</i>

364
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,801
<i>and even move out
of his parents' house,</i>

365
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:41,176
<i>even if it was just to the garage.</i>

366
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:44,349
<i>Everyone's motivation for getting
their life together is different.</i>

367
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,177
<i>For some people,
it takes tough love.</i>

368
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,687
<i>For Ronnie,
it took hope for the future.</i>

369
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,301
You didn't think I could
take care of myself.

370
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,568
I was wrong.

371
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:58,467
Being a grown-up's easy,
but it's just not my thing.

372
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:01,875
Boss man breathing
down your neck 24/7.

373
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,452
You're only as good as
your last idea, Earl.

374
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:06,538
I hear that.

375
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:10,426
In case anything
ever happens to you,

376
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,552
and I need to take care of myself,

377
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,413
I'm gonna take extra-special care
of this suit.

378
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,827
Good night, Randy.

379
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,452
Good night, Earl.

380
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,582

381
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,166
Relax... No turtles were harmed
shooting this episode.

382
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,850
So, please, no letters, crackpots.
