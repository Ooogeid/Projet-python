1
00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:03,149
<i>Emergency personnel
would like to reiterate</i>

2
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:06,613
<i>that the mudslide in question
is a natural disaster,</i>

3
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:09,406
<i>not a giant alcoholic beverage.</i>

4
00:00:09,848 --> 00:00:12,929
<i>They ask that citizens
please stop driving toward it.</i>

5
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:15,321
<i>And in lighter news,</i>

6
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:18,720
<i> it's time to turn our spotlight
on a local loony.</i>

7
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>Let's meet Joy Turner,
Camden's Loser of the Week.</i>

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>There was a reason why Joy was
on the Camden Loser of the Week segment,</i>

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,176
<i>and it was all my fault.
It started a few years back</i>

10
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:31,822
<i>when Joy was making
an audition tape for</i> Fear Factor.

11
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:36,452
<i>Unfortunately, I was responsible
for sending the tape in and...</i>

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,371
<i>it didn't quite make it there.</i>

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,125
<i>So I got her another shot
at being famous</i>

14
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:47,046
<i>on a game show where people can
challenge Erik Estrada to anything,</i>

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,633
<i>but instead of becoming famous,
she looked like a psycho,</i>

16
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:53,787
<i>and even worse,
I wound up blowing Darnell's cover</i>

17
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:55,513
<i>in the witness protection program,</i>

18
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:59,433
<i>which meant the family had to pack,
except for one member.</i>

19
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,518
As you all know
from the fliers I put up,

20
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,050
Mr. Turtle remains lost.

21
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:05,495
The good news is:
I gave him plenty of survival training,

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,273
so I expect his imminent return.
So here's his food,

23
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:11,487
his favorite scarf,
and his lip balm for the dry season.

24
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,812
<i>Next thing we knew,</i>

25
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:16,367
<i>the government snatched
Joy, Darnell and the boys away.</i>

26
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:22,231
<i>And even though me and Randy were woozy
from the needles stuck in our necks,</i>

27
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:24,375
<i>I still knew what I had to do.</i>

28
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,877
I promised Joy
I'd make her dream come true.

29
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,701
We got to find them.
<i>Which wasn't going to be easy</i>

30
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:33,361
<i>'cause the Turner family was already
in a witness relocation facility.</i>

31
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:36,470
I know it's small,
but it was good enough for Tupac.

32
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:39,611
You didn't hear that.

33
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,896
DARNELL OUTED (PART 2)

34
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,359
<i>Joy, Darnell and the kids
were waiting to start their new lives.</i>

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,495
We have been locked for hours...

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,703
No idea where we are
or what happens next...

37
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:59,660
and I still don't know what you did to
get in the program in the first place.

38
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,832
Nobody does, except for Mr. Turtle,

39
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:03,765
and it's not
like he's telling anybody,

40
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,958
for one, because he's lost,
and for two,

41
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,085
you know, he's a turtle.

42
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:11,964
Mr. and Mrs. Turner,
sorry to keep you waiting so long.

43
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,615
Inside this packet you will find
your new family identity.

44
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:18,080
I'll give you a little time
to look it over.

45
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,266
The Rosensteins?

46
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:24,185
I do speak Hebrew.

47
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,668
We're from Columbus... We bowl.

48
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,774
Other hobbies include
designing clothes for our pet collie.

49
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,109
We got to get
something better than this.

50
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:36,401
We're trailer park underachievers
with two hyperactive, pre-diabetic kids.

51
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:37,990
How is this not better?

52
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,786
<i>Since we didn't know where to start,</i>

53
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:42,817
<i>we combed the trailer park,
looking for any clue we could find.</i>

54
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:44,951
<i>Then, one walked right by us.</i>

55
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,588
Sorry, I didn't see you over there.
You're on my bad side.

56
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,156
Bad side? No way.

57
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,439
The side with the eye patch
kicks ass.

58
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:58,135
Any mail for the Turners?

59
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,138
They must have moved because
all their mail is being forwarded.

60
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,682
- Any idea where their mail's going?
- Don't know.

61
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,559
Just know it's being forwarded.

62
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:07,266
<i>That got me thinking.</i>

63
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,689
<i>If Joy and Darnell's mail
was finding them, I could, too.</i>

64
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,406
You know, you spend years
hoping for an excuse

65
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,889
to mail yourself somewhere
in a cool wooden crate,

66
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:19,865
but when you actually get in the crate,
it's not so glamorous.

67
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:23,398
All this complaining,
and you guys are in a first-class box.

68
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,443
Americans are so spoiled.

69
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:28,586
<i>While me and Randy
were trying to get to Joy,</i>

70
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,731
<i>Joy was trying to get
to the life she wanted.</i>

71
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:33,396
So you're not happy
with the name you've been given.

72
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,463
That's right.

73
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,091
You'd like your name to be
Goldie Crystal.

74
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,981
My full name would be Goldilocks,

75
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:41,790
it's pronounced "Cristal"
like what Diddy drinks.

76
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:45,506
Sorry. New identities are worked out
in a top secret wing of the Pentagon.

77
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:49,395
The names are the result
of complicated mathematical algorithms.

78
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,063
Phyllis and Marty Rosenstein?

79
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:54,506
Look at this face.
Do I look like a Phyllis to you?

80
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:57,236
No, I look like the woman
Marty leaves Phyllis for.

81
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,904
I'm just trying to help.

82
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,865
They don't have this in Columbus.

83
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,118
I got to be from some place classy
like Panama City Beach, Florida.

84
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:07,663
And one more thing: a lady like me
don't make clothes for dogs.

85
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,791
Only thing I ever sewed was
my stab wound on prom night.

86
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:13,869
With all due respect,
Mrs. Rosenstein,

87
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:15,991
things don't work that way.

88
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:17,876
This is who you are now.

89
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:19,884
Give it some time.
You'll get used to it.

90
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:23,906
Not now.

91
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,101
He wouldn't let me change
one mouse-farting thing.

92
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,530
I guess I'm really going to be
Phyllis Rosenstein

93
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:33,305
for the rest of my life.

94
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:36,650
It's just a name.
We're still the same people,

95
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,017
except we're Jewish

96
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:40,067
and they're considering
changing my blood type.

97
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,274
O positive.

98
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,223
Mommy, did you get
our new names changed?

99
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,480
Ira, Lenny,

100
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,367
I did all I could.

101
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:50,991
This is exciting.

102
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,334
Yeah, it kind of is, Randy.

103
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,212
We haven't taken a trip
together in a long time.

104
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,913
That's if you don't count
my dreams every night

105
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,375
where we visit
all the great places in the world.

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,273
Last night we were on a safari.

107
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:05,050
You made love to a hippo.

108
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:06,805
You always make love in my dreams.

109
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,101
Someone's coming.

110
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:17,316
If that's you in there,
have a good vacation.

111
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,605
<i>We were on our way
to get to Joy and Darnell,</i>

112
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,193
<i>and we weren't the only ones
looking for 'em.</i>

113
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:32,581
<i>While we were heading out
to find the Turners,</i>

114
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,147
<i>the Turners were turning
into the Rosensteins.</i>

115
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:38,022
Dag, I can't believe
it took me into my 30s

116
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:40,297
to find out
I look this good in tweed.

117
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:41,715
Shalom, Dad.

118
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:43,183
Shalom, boys.

119
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:46,178
Baby, come out. Let's see who
Marty gets to cuddle with tonight.

120
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,393
Oh, man.

121
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,522
Perfect. No one will pay
any attention to you,

122
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,815
especially men.

123
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,981
I know.

124
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,990
How could you do this to me?

125
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:04,321
It's like you took an episode
of <i>The Swan</i> and ran it backwards.

126
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,715
Oh, my God. I'm a before.

127
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,617
We all got to sacrifice.

128
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,704
They're going to surgically take
my hair off and graft it to my face.

129
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,504
It's a new process,
we're very proud of it.

130
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,052
Here's a picture
of what he'll look like.

131
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,964
And we plan
on you gaining 30 pounds.

132
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,757
Double-stuffed tater skins?

133
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,198
You're trying
to turn me into a fatty.

134
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:28,497
You're trying to mess with this?

135
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,555
Hell, no.

136
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:34,343
Where is she going?

137
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:37,521
Does she know we're in a bunker
half a mile under the Mall of America?

138
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,230
Baby, you in here?

139
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,488
It's hard to track her
when she's not chewing gum.

140
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:49,374
I usually just follow the scent
of strawberry-kiwi Hubba Bubba.

141
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,676
Listen, you got
to get her under control.

142
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,203
She's a risk, Harry.

143
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,657
That's why you were advised
to leave Camden,

144
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,750
so you wouldn't get mixed up
with people like her.

145
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,001
That's my wife.

146
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,962
You were only supposed
to be in Camden for six months.

147
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,738
Now, if you'd taken that job
we had for you in Tokyo,

148
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:07,718
you would have been the one
who invented <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i>,

149
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,137
but you wanted to waste your life
in a trailer park.

150
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,414
That wasn't a waste.
That was the best decision of my life.

151
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,686
You could have left Camden?

152
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,217
They wanted you to leave Camden

153
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,569
and go off to the glamorous beaches
of Tokyo, and you didn't do it?

154
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,563
I couldn't leave my baby.

155
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:32,659
I love you, Marty Rosenstein.

156
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,891
I'll hold up my end of the deal,

157
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,999
no matter how much it hurts.

158
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:40,600
I hear you.

159
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:43,462
They're going to snip off
the tip of my penis tomorrow.

160
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,801
<i>Being in that box was fun at first,</i>

161
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:48,237
<i>but 6 hours
and 3 truck changes later,</i>

162
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:49,760
<i>the fun was wearing off.</i>

163
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,589
This is horrible.

164
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:55,599
I'm starving, and I already ate
the emergency jerky I keep in my cheek.

165
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:59,685
All right, I was going
to save this for later, but...

166
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:03,122
I caught a cricket.

167
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,067
- You want to split it?
- Yes, please.

168
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,861
What do you want...
breast or thigh?

169
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,030
Breast.

170
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,706
This must be a female one.
I taste a little milk.

171
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:22,751
I got to taste something else
to make the flavor go away.

172
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,545
You're not licking me.

173
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,598
Don't you see what's happening?

174
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,767
Getting shocked, eating bugs.

175
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,657
These are things Joy did
on her <i>Fear Factor</i> tape.

176
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:44,481
Karma's punishing us
for ruining her dream.

177
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:47,527
We're stopping.

178
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,739
- I think we're here.
- What do we do now?

179
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:54,908
Wait for them to open us.

180
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,099
<i>Knowing all Darnell
sacrificed for her,</i>

181
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:00,040
<i>Joy decided to be
the best Phyllis Rosenstein ever.</i>

182
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,167
We're going to start
with a grocery store.

183
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:06,503
Excuse me, Miss,

184
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,381
you look so familiar.
Do I know you from somewhere?

185
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,510
I don't know.
See if any of this rings a bell.

186
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,846
I was raised in Columbus, Ohio,
but I was born in Sandusky.

187
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,338
I was bat-mitzvahed
at Temple Beth Torah.

188
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:19,433
What a party.

189
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:22,614
Had my first dance
with Shmokey Bernstein.

190
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:24,837
He grabbed my tucchus.

191
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:28,244
<i>So she memorized
everything about Phyllis.</i>

192
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,110
I've been designing for 8 years.

193
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:32,912
My company is called
"Collie want a cracker."

194
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:36,575
I have to say my signature piece
is the puppy peacoat.

195
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,355
<i>She even learned to speak Jewish.</i>

196
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,290
That cricket breast isn't settling
very well in my stomach.

197
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:08,171
Joy threw up, so Karma's going
to make you throw up, too.

198
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,760
Don't worry, Earl.
I'm not going to thr...

199
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:14,016
Damn it, Randy,
now I'm going to throw...

200
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:21,865
What the hell?

201
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,088
We're in a dumpster.

202
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:33,930
We covered Joy in garbage
on her audition tape.

203
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,895
This one's to Peter Dick Johnson,

204
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,096
that guy who used to live
in the trailer park.

205
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,557
Remember how much we used
to make fun of his name?

206
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,767
Those were some fun times.

207
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,019
I heard he jumped
in front of a train.

208
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:48,618
All this stuff
has been stamped, "Forward."

209
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:50,744
Must be mailed for people who moved.

210
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:52,526
The post office isn't forwarding it.

211
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:55,369
Oh, man, and there are
so many letters in here

212
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:57,429
for Santa Claus and God.

213
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,037
They're gonna be pissed

214
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:01,055
when they find out
they didn't get their mail.

215
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,745
And those are two guys
you do not want to piss off.

216
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,058
I can't believe Karma would put us
through all this just to punish us.

217
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,992
I mean, the bugs and the box
and the throw-up.

218
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,879
And all for nothing?
What the hell is going on?

219
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,032
Son of a bitch.

220
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:30,230
It's a letter from <i>Estrada or Nada</i>.

221
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:36,987
Joy could get another chance
to be on the show. Listen.

222
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:39,104
"Send in this application,

223
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:42,239
"a check for $50 made out
to Erik Estrada,

224
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:45,579
"and get your friends to text
message their vote for you."

225
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,683
That's it, Randy.
That's why Karma brought us here.

226
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:50,725
If we can get Joy
on that show again,

227
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,086
she'll come back from anywhere
in the world to be on it.

228
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,679
That's great, Earl.

229
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:56,113
Where can we find a check

230
00:11:56,238 --> 00:11:58,383
that's already made out
to Erik Estrada?

231
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,179
<i>In order to get to Joy,
we started at Jasper's.</i>

232
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,056
Somebody left a tooth
in this retainer.

233
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,867
Yeah, that's a nice tooth.

234
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,517
It's nicer than yours.

235
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,771
If you pulled out your front tooth,
that thing would fit perfect.

236
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:12,178
Good idea.

237
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:16,360
- I'll take these.
- Why you need all my cell phones?

238
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:17,680
For text voting.

239
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,871
One of the Camden contestants
on<i> Estrada or Nada</i>

240
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:22,407
had some bad mayonnaise
and died for three minutes.

241
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:25,120
He's alive now,
but in no shape to compete.

242
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,913
Now they're having a contest
to see who's gonna replace him.

243
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,117
That's messed up.

244
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:31,917
Your one shot at fame
undone by a condiment.

245
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,428
I feel smarter already.

246
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:39,007
I'll be right back.
My money's in the car.

247
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,181
Oh, buddy.

248
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,008
<i>I passed out the cell phones
to everyone I knew</i>

249
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,862
<i>and asked them
to text their vote for Joy</i>

250
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:51,283
<i>to get a chance to compete
against Erik Estrada.</i>

251
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,312
Sure, I'll text for Joy.

252
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:56,378
Maybe if she comes out of hiding,
the bad guys will kill her.

253
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,613
<i>Everybody spent the next two days
texting votes</i>

254
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,270
<i>and crank-calling each other.</i>

255
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,177
<i>By the time
they announced the winner,</i>

256
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,577
<i>we had the whole Crab Shack
rooting for Joy.</i>

257
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,710
<i>Now it's time for the results
of the text-in vote</i>

258
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:12,833
<i>to see who will replace the victim
of the mayonnaise tragedy,</i>

259
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:16,052
<i>go head-to-head with me
and find out if they're...</i>

260
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:20,674
Estrada or Nada.

261
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:22,491
<i>And the winner is...</i>

262
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:24,493
<i>Joy Turner.</i>

263
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,036
<i>And we weren't
the only ones watching.</i>

264
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:30,391
<i>Joy Turner.</i>

265
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,266
Did you hear that?

266
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,716
America has spoken,
and they've spoken for me.

267
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,053
Baby, I feel terrible.

268
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:41,990
I always wanted to make you happy,
and I'm keeping you from your chance

269
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:44,531
to be famous and possibly
be in <i>Parade</i> magazine.

270
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:46,568
Are you kidding me?

271
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,988
I'd rather becPhyllis Rosenstein,

272
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:51,921
keep wearing these granny panties
and have my family

273
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:54,958
than to whup Erik Estrada
and have nobody to share it with.

274
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,794
Besides, we ain't allowed
to work today anyway.

275
00:13:57,992 --> 00:13:59,171
It's Shabbat.

276
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,176
Marty, time to change
your blood type.

277
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,724
- Let's go.
- Okay.

278
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,022
I love you, baby.

279
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,809
What the hell?

280
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,815
You got the rest of your life
to be Phyllis Rosenstein.

281
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,817
You deserve one more chance
to be Joy Turner.

282
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,150
Time to find out
if you're <i>Estrada or Nada</i>.

283
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,120
Where the hell is Joy?
Maybe she didn't see the commercial.

284
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:36,124
Maybe she's here, but we don't know it
because they changed her identity.

285
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,028
She could be anyone.

286
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:40,056
She could be a Chinese dude.

287
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,576
She could be that Chinese dude.

288
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:52,635
It's not her.

289
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,245
I'm out of ideas.

290
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,776
<i>I was starting to think
this whole thing was a waste of time,</i>

291
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:01,777
<i>but at least I wasn't on stage
getting humiliated.</i>

292
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,027
Alas, poor Yorick.

293
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:05,652
I knew him, Horatio.

294
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,605
A man of infinite jest

295
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,545
and excellent fancy.

296
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,667
To be... or nada to be!

297
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:26,496
Coming up next was supposed
to be Camden's Joy Turner

298
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,731
going head-to-head
against Erik Estrada

299
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,588
to see who has the better
circus variety act,

300
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:35,183
but unfortunately,
it looks like Joy is a no-show.

301
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:38,562
- I guess that means that Erik...
- Does this look like a no-show to you?

302
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,077
Erik Estrada, your ass is mine!

303
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:43,776
It is on now, people.

304
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,901
It is on!

305
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:47,740
<i>And it was on.</i>

306
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,838
<i>Joy did a weird stretchy,
sing-y thing.</i>

307
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:03,169
<i>But Erik Estrada matched</i>

308
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,810
<i>Joy's amazing musical circus
stunt with one of his own.</i>

309
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,504
<i>They were both so good,</i>

310
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:23,440
<i>the judges decided
it would go into a...</i>

311
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:24,929
Tiebreaker!

312
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,491
<i>Joy got to pick
the first tiebreaker,</i>

313
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:36,283
<i>so she chose the body part
she used to win every fight:</i>

314
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:37,440
<i>her mouth.</i>

315
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:42,463
<i>But to her surprise,</i>

316
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:44,836
<i>Erik Estrada's nickname
wasn't Hot Tongue</i>

317
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,671
<i>just 'cause he was a good kisser.</i>

318
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,259
<i>And when breathing fire
didn't break the tie,</i>

319
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,803
<i>Erik Estrada chose
his secret weapon:</i>

320
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,922
<i>playing music on wineglasses.</i>

321
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,902
<i>But it turns out,
Joy was just as good.</i>

322
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:03,149
They're going again!

323
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:07,668
<i>That's when Joy came up</i>

324
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,236
<i>with the one thing she knew
no one else could beat her at:</i>

325
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,338
<i>a combination of all her new skills.</i>

326
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:14,897
<i>She called it dressing a dog
while talking Hebrew</i>

327
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:17,150
<i>with a follow-up trivia
question about Ohio.</i>

328
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:34,211
Okay, here we go
with our trivia question

329
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:36,615
about the great state of Ohio.

330
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:38,884
Everyone knows

331
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:42,435
that East 105th Street and
Euclid Avenue in Cleveland

332
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,084
was the location of the first
pedestrian button

333
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:47,509
for the control of a traffic light.

334
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:51,979
Name the boy chosen
for the 1948 newsreel

335
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,514
to demonstrate its operation.

336
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:11,923
Okay, time's up.
Your answers, please.

337
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:17,409
The correct answer is...

338
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:21,143
L-O-

339
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,833
U- I-S. Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!

340
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,199
Joy is right!

341
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,731
The great one has fallen.

342
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,426
Congratulations, Joy Turner.

343
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:45,272
I gotta tell you.

344
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,209
You remind me of a young me.

345
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,134
Full of drive and passion.

346
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,774
And an esoteric knowledge of Ohio.

347
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:53,715
Get ready, Joy Turner.

348
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,684
You're about to be famous.

349
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:11,274
You made this happen, didn't you?

350
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,650
I knew you weren't a nada,

351
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:16,381
and I wanted to make sure
everybody else knew it, too.

352
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,402
We better go.

353
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:31,753
Soon thousands of agents
will be swarming down on us.

354
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,272
While it's cool in movies,

355
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:35,589
it's not so cool when you're
the one being swarmed up on.

356
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:38,551
I guess this is it.

357
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:42,872
I know I might have divorced you,

358
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:45,335
and kicked you out
of your own house,

359
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,060
and tried to kill you,

360
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:48,802
multiple times...

361
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,106
but it all came out of love.

362
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,061
I know, Joy.

363
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:57,004
I'm gonna miss you, guys.

364
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,447
We've had a good run, Randy.

365
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,291
Some of the stuff you've said
will stay with me forever.

366
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,202
Like "What if dogs had legs
like shrimps."

367
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,166
- Shrogs.
- Or drimps.

368
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,747
Shrogs.

369
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,624
- Or drimps.
- Shrogs!

370
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,293
Let's not do this again.
Good-bye, Randy.

371
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:13,795
Bye, Darnell.

372
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,609
Good-bye, Earl.

373
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,582
<i>After everything me and Joy
had been through,</i>

374
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:33,205
<i>and after all the things we'd yelled and
screamed at each other over the years,</i>

375
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,521
<i>I was surprised to find
there was one thing I couldn't say.</i>

376
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:39,656
You didn't say good-bye.

377
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:43,078
I'll tell them next time.

378
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:45,535
