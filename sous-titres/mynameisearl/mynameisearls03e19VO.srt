1
00:00:01,964 --> 00:00:04,891
<i>It was nice being out of my coma
and back where I belonged,</i>

2
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:07,202
<i>but I couldn't get Billie off my mind.</i>

3
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:09,405
<i>I was pretty sure
Karma wanted me to find her.</i>

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:13,229
It's official, there's only
two Billie Cunninghams in the phone book

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,998
and neither of those guys
thinks he's my soul mate.

6
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:19,022
Billie... Don't you want to hear
what's been going on with us?

7
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:22,009
Randy was our town crier
while you were comatose.

8
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:24,036
That's actually a clever play on words,

9
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:26,948
in that he both recorded
the town happenings and cried a lot.

10
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,406
Read the list, dumb-dumb.

11
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,076
I got a notepad,

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,912
I got a paper cut,

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,789
Fire Marshal kicked Joy and family
out of their sideways trailer.

14
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,637
That's right, Dip Van Winkle,

15
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:40,126
the trailer's still on its side
since you knocked it over,

16
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:42,066
so now we live in the Crab Shack.

17
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:44,730
I'm telling you,
you gotta carry the three.

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,095
This is my spelling homework.

19
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:49,723
I promise I'll get your trailer
tipped right side up

20
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,846
as soon as I get enough money
to rent a crane.

21
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:54,207
A raccoon fought a opossum

22
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:56,138
for half a bag of french fries

23
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:58,103
in the motel parking lot.

24
00:00:58,263 --> 00:00:59,833
A fry got left behind.

25
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:01,022
I ate a fry.

26
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:02,982
Oh, and I'm a lesbian.

27
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:04,818
Catalina, it's not your turn yet.

28
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:07,653
Did I just hear Chiquita Bana say
she isn't into bananas anymore?

29
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:09,280
What happened, a bad banana?

30
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,283
It wasn't the bananas,
it was the trees who waggle them around.

31
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:14,800
In <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>,
the trees threw apples.

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,621
- Trees are bastards.
- All men are bastards:

33
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,866
my father, who gambled me away
in a foosball game,

34
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:22,313
and my childhood sweetheart,
who convinced me to come here

35
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,654
only to abandon me...

36
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:27,298
Thanks to him, I live a fairy tale life
of a maid and a stripper.

37
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,738
Oh, please, I know what you're up to.

38
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:32,798
Pretending to be a lesbian will double
your business at Club Chubby.

39
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:34,280
When I was in high school,

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,147
I told my gym teacher
I was a lesbian just to get a "B."

41
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,908
If she hadn't called my bluff
in the shower, I would've gotten an "A."

42
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,563
I'm a real ChapStick lesbian.

43
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:45,024
The only person I want to strip for now
is Miss Right.

44
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,944
Well, good luck,
I'm looking for my Miss Right, too.

45
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:51,040
Damn, Earl, you got Frank's car,
you got Frank's trailer.

46
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,491
Now you want Frank's ex?

47
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,805
Why you gotta sleep
inside everything that's Frank's?

48
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:57,202
<i>Joy's little insult gave me an idea.</i>

49
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:59,048
That's how I'll find Billie:

50
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:01,041
Frank.
Let's go, Randy.

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,027
Finish up your homework, boys.

52
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:07,422
The crab water's almost cool enough
for your bath.

53
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,966
LOVE OCTAGON

54
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,388
<i>We found out,
because of prison overcrowding,</i>

55
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,346
<i>Frank had been sent to a halfway house.</i>

56
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,518
<i>I wasn't looking forward
to talking to Frank,</i>

57
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:23,285
<i>seeing how he used to date Billie
and he's crazy,</i>

58
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:25,246
<i>but he was my only chance
of finding her.</i>

59
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:26,232
My God.

60
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,027
My God, it's good to see you.

61
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:32,113
- So how are you?
- Hungry... really hungry.

62
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:34,532
They put tranquilizers in our food
to keep us down.

63
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:42,016
I'm starving.
I actually ate a bar of soap yesterday.

64
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:43,666
This morning, I pooped bubbles.

65
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,650
Guys were running around popping them.

66
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,087
- Hey, it's crazy in here.
- You want a little fruit?

67
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,672
I carry apple slices in my pocket now.

68
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,166
We haven't gotten to that page yet.

69
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:59,849
I gotta say, you're looking good, Frank.

70
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,434
Strong, healthy.

71
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:03,019
Beautiful necklace.

72
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,141
No, this is not just a necklace.

73
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:07,277
I learned that the hard way.

74
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:11,126
Ice cream! Ice...

75
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:19,608
Hey, Paco.

76
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:21,525
Saludos, Earl, Randy.

77
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:24,238
I used to deliver
for Camden Foreign Foods.

78
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:26,292
Being Señor Lo Mein sucks, doesn't it?

79
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:28,456
Yes, but if you have a job,

80
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,339
they take your collar off and let you
out of here for eight hours a day.

81
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,423
Why don't you get a job like Paco?

82
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:36,678
I refuse to dress like a bullfighting
yoler and dance like a monkey.

83
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,598
Keep eating soap, genius.

84
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,305
So we just came by
to find out how you were doing.

85
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,938
I thought we were here
to find Billie, remember?

86
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:49,482
You said you were scared
because Frank used to date her.

87
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:52,896
You also said that one of us
should do all the talking...

88
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:54,988
It was you. Go ahead, Earl.

89
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,948
You want to date Billie?

90
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,577
Yes, and I just want you to know
that Karma's on my side,

91
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:03,079
so if you attack me,
something bad will happen to you.

92
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:06,791
You know what, don't worry about it.
I'm over her anyway.

93
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,960
Really? You're really over her?

94
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,478
Plus she's living a good life now,
like you.

95
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:15,840
It'd be like if Mother Theresa started
dating that bald guy in the diapers.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,392
What's his name?

97
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:19,554
Gumby!

98
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,432
Thanks, Frank, that means a lot.

99
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:24,182
So, can you help me find Billie?

100
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,914
Yeah, yeah, I can do that,
but you gotta help me first.

101
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,365
I need a job,
so I can get out of here every day.

102
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:31,816
Maybe we can get him a job
as a bikini inspector.

103
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:35,028
I've seen that uniforms
are on sale at the mall.

104
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:38,798
Or he could be a beaver hunter,
but you might need a license for that.

105
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:41,523
<i>I knew I needed Frank's help,</i>

106
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:44,084
<i>so I went to see
if Darnell would be willing to hire him.</i>

107
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:47,843
He won't even be around to bother you,
'cause he'll be helping me find Billie.

108
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,600
Are you sure the boys are okay?

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,376
I told them were bunk beds,
and they believed me.

110
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,551
Starting to realize there's no point
in saving up for college.

111
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:00,511
I'll hire Frank if it's okay with Joy.

112
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:03,765
The man did point a gun at her belly
when she was delivering a baby.

113
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:05,934
It wasn't my baby,
I don't give a crap.

114
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,204
Oh, come on...

115
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:12,148
Who calls a bar after 7:00?
We got kids sleeping!

116
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:16,075
<i>The next day,
Frank was officially employed</i>

117
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:18,757
<i>and pretty excited
to get a little taste of freedom.</i>

118
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,625
<i>Frank thought the best place to look
for Billie was her cousin, Jocelyn's.</i>

119
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,058
You have a lot of nerve

120
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:35,005
thinking you can walk in here
and ask me for a favor, dirtbag.

121
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:39,201
Did I mention that we may have had sex
while me and Billie were on a break?

122
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:40,385
No, you did not.

123
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:43,596
Because he's too much of a gentleman.

124
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,102
I'm gonna go for a run.

125
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,066
So have you heard from Billie?

126
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:56,609
I may have.

127
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:58,611
Come on, Jocelyn, baby,
don't be pissed.

128
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:00,612
Besides, me and Billie are over,

129
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:03,366
and you are looking so fine, girl.

130
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,494
She has the most incredible feet.
Go ahead, show him your feet.

131
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:07,928
Let him see them.

132
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:12,646
She stayed here for a while

133
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,209
after she got kicked out
of nursing school for cheating.

134
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:16,587
Mmm, there they are.

135
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:19,007
There is the stuff right there, girl.

136
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,394
Cheating?
Billie was living a good life.

137
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,470
My diabetic ass...
That girl's been going nuts.

138
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,972
She stole my rent money,
siphoned my gas,

139
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,382
and then robbed a liquor store
on Christmas Day.

140
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:32,312
I mean, who holds someone
at gunpoint on Jesus's birthday?

141
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,321
Billie hit me on Christmas Day.

142
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,539
She was probably running
from the liquor store.

143
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:39,030
Sounds like your girl's gone back
to the dark side.

144
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,779
Take a look at these little sausages.
They're fantastic.

145
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:45,366
Joceylyn, do you have any idea
where Billie is now?

146
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:48,189
She called a week or so ago,
needing help.

147
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:49,621
Same old story.

148
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,998
You can check my caller ID if you want.

149
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:54,000
This little piggy went to the market,

150
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,493
this little piggy stayed home.

151
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:59,738
Jocelyn, you remember
where this little piggy went?

152
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,632
<i>We didn't know how to trace
the caller ID number,</i>

153
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:05,949
<i>so we went to the only person we knew
who had access to the World Wide Web.</i>

154
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,140
Yeah, it seemed like Karma
was bringing Billie to me as a reward,

155
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:12,060
but now I realize Karma
was also bringing me to Billie.

156
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,645
I think I'm supposed to help her
get her life back on track.

157
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:16,689
Karma wants her to be our girlfriend.

158
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,693
That couldn't be more romantic
if Manilow sang it in a bubble bath.

159
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:24,380
Oh, here's the number.

160
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,365
Oh, looks like it's a pay phone.

161
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,993
Hey, what's this website
you got covered up?

162
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:31,336
What's a DILF?

163
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:33,895
That's <i>Dads I'd Like to Find</i>.

164
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,677
I've lost touch with the fathers
of some of my childhood friends.

165
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:39,385
Let's check and see
if our dad's on there.

166
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:43,549
Is that really what Dad is doing
when Mum is not around?

167
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:47,636
<i>Kenny gave us
the address for the pay phone,</i>

168
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:50,332
<i>so we went there and waited,
hoping we'd see Billie.</i>

169
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,849
<i>We decided that me and Frank
would watch to the south,</i>

170
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,019
<i>Randy would keep an eye on the north.</i>

171
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,064
What does Billie like?
Any tips you can give me to help me out?

172
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:00,233
She was really into my musky scent.

173
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:03,120
Yeah, I used to drive her crazy
with this move.

174
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:08,991
Women are complicated.

175
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:10,860
Stuart?

176
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:12,495
Oh, hey, Earl.

177
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:15,121
That's Stuart Daniels,
former cop, current bowler.

178
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:16,600
He was on my list.

179
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,128
Hey, I remember you.
Your mother's the police chief, right?

180
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:22,709
And your sister's
that fiery little redheaded cop

181
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:25,324
that likes to frisk
all the way up to the sack.

182
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:26,884
Is she seeing anyone?

183
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,178
No...
So what are you doing on my street?

184
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,597
We're looking for a girl,
Billie Cunningham.

185
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:34,085
- She hit me with her car.
- Haven't seen her.

186
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:37,270
<i>Turned out Stuart knew more
about Billie than he was saying.</i>

187
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,481
<i>Stuart first met Billie
when he hit her with his car.</i>

188
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:46,576
Oh, crap.

189
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:51,421
<i>He started visiting her,
because he was feeling guilty.</i>

190
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:58,882
<i>But as he spent more time with her,
he started to feel other things.</i>

191
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:03,174
<i>Stuart had once hit a dog, brought it
home and nursed it back to health,</i>

192
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:06,496
<i>and he thought, if the dog grew
to love him, why couldn't Billie?</i>

193
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,426
<i>And finally, Billie woke up.</i>

194
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:11,387
So, no one knows who hit me?

195
00:09:11,547 --> 00:09:12,615
Total mystery.

196
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:15,589
And since you don't remember,
I guess we'll never know.

197
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,660
No, the only thing I remember
is hitting Earl.

198
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:19,979
Is he okay?

199
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:23,024
I'm the one who found you.
I've been watching over you.

200
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,401
Do you need a place to stay?
I've got my own room.

201
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:26,746
Is Earl okay?

202
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:29,906
What if he was?
I mean, how would you feel?

203
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,324
Happy.

204
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,451
But me, how would you feel about me?

205
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,121
- Would you stay with me?
- I don't even know you.

206
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:38,903
Right.

207
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:41,918
Earl's dead... you killed him.

208
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:45,213
Oh, God.

209
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,083
Oh, my God.

210
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,873
<i>Stuart told Billie she was in trouble</i>

211
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:51,886
<i>and the cops had been coming every day,
waiting to ask her questions.</i>

212
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:54,741
<i>And, believing him, she let him
sneak her out of the hospital.</i>

213
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,804
He squeezed me, he squeezed me!

214
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,998
<i>Eventually, she got away from Stuart
long enough to make a phone call.</i>

215
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:01,708
Jocelyn, you gotta help me.

216
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:03,978
I'm sure the cops have been there
looking for me.

217
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,537
I'm staying with this really creepy guy.

218
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,905
He wears swim trunks
in the shower...

219
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,279
and a baseball hat.

220
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,669
Good luck finding that girl.
I'll keep an eye out for her.

221
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:16,095
Sorry I have to go, I have some lettuce
I gotta put in the crisper.

222
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,537
The cops are outside looking for you.
We gotta move.

223
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:27,412
<i>After two long days
of staking out Billie's pay phone,</i>

224
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:28,881
<i>we finally caught a break.</i>

225
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,926
<i>Unfortunately, it was a bad break.</i>

226
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,633
<i>While we were figuring out
what to do next,</i>

227
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:39,612
<i>Stuart and Billie had already settled
into their new hiding place.</i>

228
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,335
Hello.

229
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,662
Did someone order... towels?

230
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:48,859
You can just put them right there.

231
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:55,032
I'm Catalina.

232
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:56,436
And you are?

233
00:10:58,535 --> 00:10:59,480
Roxanne.

234
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:04,005
You look like you have
some tangles in the back.

235
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,826
Would you like me to...

236
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,757
This is nice.

237
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,729
Two girls hanging out,

238
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,269
brushing each other's hair,

239
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:17,897
like God intended.

240
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:27,615
- Did you just lick my neck?
- Yes. No. Maybe.

241
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,802
It was a bug.
Did you like it?

242
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:33,187
I think I'm just gonna go
get my clothes on now.

243
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:35,197
I'm probably coming on too strong.

244
00:11:35,357 --> 00:11:37,700
I'm a new lesbian.
Please call.

245
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,300
You're that balding guy
my friend Earl helped.

246
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,665
He lives two doors down.
I'll let him know you're here.

247
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,629
I just saw the cops outside.
We got to move!

248
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,975
- Do I have time to get dressed?
- Yes.

249
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,425
But no bra and panties.

250
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,899
<i>I didn't know what to do next.</i>

251
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,519
<i>But I'd never been more sure</i>

252
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,697
<i>Karma wanted me and Billie
to be together.</i>

253
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:03,919
She's robbing liquor stores
on Christmas?

254
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,355
I got to find her, not just for me.
Her life's out of control.

255
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:10,858
Very interesting, Earl.
How's that crane rental coming?

256
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:12,708
Hook me up, Darnell.

257
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,992
Damn it, Darnell!
You hit the tonic button.

258
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,506
Now I got to add some gin
just to make it taste right.

259
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,828
What are we gonna do now?
Where are we gonna find her?

260
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:25,456
- I don't know.
- Why don't you ask Karma?

261
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:32,235
What do I do now, Karma?
How do I find her?

262
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:38,625
Crab Shack/Turner residence.

263
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:40,805
It's for you.

264
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,520
I've got your girl,
get over here fast.

265
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,811
<i>Stuart and Kenny
had a unique friendship,</i>

266
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,817
<i>and apparently, Stuart felt like Kenny's
would a safe hiding place.</i>

267
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:56,362
Hi, Stuart.
Who's your ugly friend?

268
00:12:56,522 --> 00:12:57,976
This is, uh, Roxanne.

269
00:12:58,096 --> 00:13:01,699
<i>Stuart told Kenny he was doing
some undercover police work for his mom</i>

270
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:04,912
<i>and Roxanne was a witness
in an upcoming murder trial.</i>

271
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:13,481
<i>Just say something.
We're live on my blog.</i>

272
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,506
<i>- Hello, Kenny's friends.
- See? I told you he was funny.</i>

273
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:19,385
<i>Mom's here.</i>

274
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,194
Is this really the plan?

275
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:25,057
Am I supposed to just sit around
while you two blog each other?

276
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:28,519
What a little mouth on her.

277
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:30,354
Can you keep a secret?

278
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:34,183
Is it about something
you tried in college?

279
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:37,987
<i>So Stuart told him about Billie
and Kenny couldn't pass up</i>

280
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:40,949
<i>the chance to make
their threesome a twosome.</i>

281
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:43,868
There she is.

282
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,545
How's my breath?

283
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:51,306
Really warm.

284
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:54,839
<i>Seeing Billie took
my "really warm" breath away.</i>

285
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:58,774
<i>Unfortunately, seeing Billie seemed
to have the same effect on Frank.</i>

286
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:01,683
<i>I should have known as soon as
he heard Billie was bad again,</i>

287
00:14:01,803 --> 00:14:03,095
<i>he'd want her back.</i>

288
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:05,681
Come on.

289
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:08,184
- Let's go get that woman.
- For me.

290
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,352
Of course for you.

291
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:11,608
If you're nervous,

292
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:13,793
I could go in there
and talk to her first.

293
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,399
That's really nice of you.

294
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,653
Yeah, well, I'm a really nice guy.

295
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:24,617
You know I just realized,
I can't talk to Billie now.

296
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:27,087
I got to go home,
get cleaned up,

297
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:29,330
maybe write down
what I want to say.

298
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:32,501
That, sir, is a great idea.

299
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,242
We'll come back tomorrow.

300
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:40,424
Well, I guess I should be getting you
back to the halfway house.

301
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:42,802
And again,
thank you for your help,

302
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:45,602
my loyal, honest friend.

303
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:49,081
Fire him,
fire the bastard now.

304
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:53,142
<i>The next morning,
Frank waited to be released for work,</i>

305
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:54,915
<i>but nobody unlocked him.</i>

306
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:58,880
- Don't forget to unlock me.
- You got fired, champ.

307
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,278
Now who looks ridiculous?

308
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,658
Okay, still me,
but at least I, Paco, get to leave.

309
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:06,547
Bye.

310
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:13,624
<i>I thought about going to Billie's
right after I dropped Frank off,</i>

311
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:17,586
<i>but I realized I only had one shot
to convince Billie she was my soul mate.</i>

312
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,366
<i>I wanted to make sure I got it right.</i>

313
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,679
And even though most of
those words were written

314
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,688
by Bret Michaels in the '80s,

315
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:26,720
they're coming straight from my heart.
What do you think?

316
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,098
I think she's gonna lo... Bird!

317
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,364
<i>It's not every day you tell a woman
you're meant to be together,</i>

318
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:39,442
<i>but I felt surprisingly calm.</i>

319
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:42,278
<i>Everything in my life
was finally coming together.</i>

320
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,348
Billie's mine!
You can't have her.

321
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:47,532
Karma wants us together, Frank.

322
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:49,118
You can't stop this.

323
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:50,891
Eat poo, backstabber.

324
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:54,401
<i>While I had my hands full outside,
Billie was in a battle of her own.</i>

325
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,209
I need to go on the run by myself,
and I'm gonna need money.

326
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,777
So I'm robbing you, Kenny.
I wanna be a friend about that.

327
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:03,480
Billie, please, let's be reasonable.
Think about all I've done for you.

328
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,634
Just like a woman.
I'll bet she's on her period.

329
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:08,111
- Tie yourselves up.
- Oh, I'll do it.

330
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,800
Where are you gonna find a guy
who cares about you as much as I do?

331
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,520
I don't need anyone to care about me.
I can take care of myself.

332
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,064
There's not a lot of rope here.
I know, I'll tie us together.

333
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,609
Face-to-face is probably safest.

334
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,361
- Billie, please, let's think...
- She is over you!

335
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,640
Can you put in that
Moby CD on your way out?

336
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,033
You can't go outside,
the cops are after you.

337
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:30,978
You murdered Earl Hickey.

338
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:35,664
- Earl?
- Not my day.

339
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:39,594
- I thought I murdered you.
- I was just in a coma.

340
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:41,298
But it was beautiful there.

341
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,527
In my mind,
I saw you every day

342
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:45,674
and we had a kid
and a theme song.

343
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:50,129
Why are they tied up?

344
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,001
Billie, I love you.

345
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,236
Before you decide
who you want to kiss,

346
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:58,604
you should know that about 5 min ago,
Earl ate poo right outside.

347
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,168
What is going on?

348
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:03,683
Karma brought us together,
that's why you hit me.

349
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:05,277
We're supposed to be together.

350
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:07,404
I hit her, too.
Maybe Karma brought us together.

351
00:17:07,564 --> 00:17:10,083
- You're the one that hit me?
- I was going to tell you.

352
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,032
Shut up and press tighter against me.

353
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:13,911
It's the only way we're gonna survive.

354
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:16,622
There's even $100,000 insurance
settlement waiting for you.

355
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,567
All you have to do is sign a form.

356
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:21,251
I thought we could use it
to get married and buy a house?

357
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:23,115
Hello, lover,
your getaway car is here.

358
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:25,339
- I don't believe this.
- What are you doing here?

359
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,230
I'm here because
I'm in love with her.

360
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,670
I'm in love with her.
So am I. Yeah, me, too.

361
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,799
Look, Billie, this isn't how
I wanted things to go.

362
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,903
I came here wearing a clean shirt
and holding flowers.

363
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,813
And I was supposed to be the only person
in the room who loved you.

364
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:43,737
Whatever. I'm the only person
in the room who really knows you.

365
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,488
Who was there
when your Aunt what's-her name died?

366
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,278
- You mean my mom.
- Yeah, her.

367
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:52,408
Billie, Karma brought us together
for a reason.

368
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,922
I went back to my old ways,
you went back to your old ways.

369
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,164
We both got hit.
Karma wants us to be good,

370
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:01,500
I think we're supposed
to be good together.

371
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:03,866
Or... we could be bad together.

372
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:07,575
I learned things in prison
that will blow your mind.

373
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:09,967
How else can you explain it?

374
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:13,178
When we both lost our way,
we found each other.

375
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:18,308
Sorry, Frank.

376
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,501
I can't go with you.

377
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:23,147
Or you.

378
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:25,691
And certainly not you.

379
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:31,989
Because I'm supposed to be with you.

380
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:41,293
Fine.

381
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:43,213
Fine, well...

382
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,294
You know, you should know

383
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:48,871
that you're gonna be saying bye
to the best thing you ever had.

384
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,872
Oh, who am I kidding.
Even I don't believe that.

385
00:18:52,992 --> 00:18:55,382
Hey, best of luck to yous, all right?

386
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:59,344
This isn't the way
I thought it would end.

387
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:01,796
I thought it would end with
our naked breasts pressed together,

388
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,687
our long,
smooth legs intertwined.

389
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:04,938
Barf.

390
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:13,197
You smell great.

391
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:16,867
Frank must have sweated on me
when we were fighting.

392
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:19,816
It's not him.

393
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:23,535
It's you.

394
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,483
<i>Me and Billie
had finally found each other,

395
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:29,254
<i>but we weren't the only ones
Karma was looking out for.

396
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:32,716
I'm gonna die alone
in my mother's house.

397
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,225
Or we could die
in each other's arms as old men

398
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:37,888
living in Boca Raton surrounded
by Jack Russell terriers.

399
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,946
I love Jack Russell terriers.

400
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:49,091
<i>And Karma wasn't only
connecting new lovers,</i>

401
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:51,193
<i>it was reconnecting old ones.</i>

402
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:08,575
<i>Like Catalina
and her childhood sweetheart.</i>

403
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,881
<i>And a convict
and his plus-sized lover.</i>

404
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:17,742
<i>And Billie did use that $100,000
from Stuart's insurance to get married.</i>

405
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,399
<i>But not to Stuart.</i>

406
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:23,360
<i>For the third time, I got hitched
to a woman I hardly knew.</i>

407
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,401
<i>But much like fifth grade,</i>

408
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:28,012
<i>I think the third time,
I got it right.</i>

409
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:40,045
<i>Finally, life was just
where Karma wanted it.</i>

410
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,033
<i>And where I wanted it, too.</i>
