1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:02,585
MY NAME IS ALIAS

2
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:08,860
<i>I got a chance to see Joy and Darnell
after they went into witness protection,</i>

3
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:12,235
<i>but Randy hadn't
and he was really missing his friend.</i>

4
00:00:14,418 --> 00:00:16,118
Hey, Scarecrow Crab Man.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,987
<i>As the days went by, I tried
to keep a brave front up for Randy,</i>

6
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:24,912
<i>but when he wasn't around,
I found myself missing everybody, too.</i>

7
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:32,448
- I'm looking for Darnell Turner.
- Sorry, but he's not...

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,410
I don't know anyone
named Darnell Turner.

9
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:38,788
Isn't that Darnell Turner?

10
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:40,831
Who, this?

11
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:44,753
Got me.
This was here when we moved in.

12
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,907
The previous tenant
probably left it behind.

13
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:49,632
Isn't that you?

14
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:53,711
He does kind of look like me.

15
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:56,713
But if he calls that mess
a moustache...

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,816
Still... Crazy world.

17
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,442
My mistake.

18
00:01:01,252 --> 00:01:02,952
Thank you for your time.

19
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:07,329
This isn't the first time
I've been cuffed to something,

20
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:09,402
so if you're trying
to freak me out...

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,363
There's a bomb in the briefcase
attached to your wrist.

22
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:16,233
If you don't want your neighbors
to pick up you out of their azaleas,

23
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:18,953
you'll tell me
where Darnell Turner is.

24
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,604
What are azaleas?

25
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:27,706
<i>While I was imaging myself
as azalea fertilizer,</i>

26
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:30,831
<i>Darnell was coming home
to a surprise of his own.</i>

27
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:44,486
Hey, baby,
I didn't hear you come in.

28
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:46,889
Boys,
I know shooting hookers is fun,

29
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,816
but it's too loud. Headphones on.

30
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,860
So when did the boys get an <i>Xbox</i>?

31
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:53,047
I'm sorry, Darnell,

32
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:55,303
but I had to get it for 'em.

33
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,908
They're not making any friends
based on their personalities.

34
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,537
You've seen that routine
where they pick each other's noses.

35
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,372
And it's our bad for laughing
so hard the first time they did it.

36
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:06,459
But you know
we can't afford luxury items.

37
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,818
We can't afford not to fit in.

38
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:11,556
You just worry
about selling more insurances

39
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,215
and leave everything else to me.

40
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:17,094
- I'll try, baby. What's for dinner?
- We already ate.

41
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,228
I miss us eating dinner as a family.

42
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,476
You think this is easy on me?
I'm working my butt off.

43
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,197
I had to come up with 3 disguises

44
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:34,868
to make people think we got
a maid, a nanny and a gardener.

45
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:36,363
Now, if you'll excuse me,

46
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:38,945
time for Carlos to mow the lawn.

47
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,659
I'm telling you,
I don't know who you're talking about.

48
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:50,600
Me and fake Darnell had a blast.
We played darts.

49
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:52,725
I let him drive the El Camino.

50
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,590
He scratched the back fender.

51
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,200
Tell me where Darnell is.

52
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:58,251
He doesn't know where Darnell is...

53
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,596
I swear.
Just leave my brother alone.

54
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,098
It would kill me
if anything happened to him.

55
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,765
That's good to know.

56
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:13,576
I know how I always make you say
you love me before we go to sleep,

57
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,612
but if someone's threatening to torture
or even kill the thing you love,

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,572
that's when you can keep it
to yourself.

59
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:21,951
All right, you got about five minutes
before this bomb goes off.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,205
You let my brother go,
and I'll tell you what I know.

61
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:27,727
Fair enough.

62
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,125
Think about Joy,
Darnell and the kids.

63
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:33,114
You can blow us up.
We're not afraid.

64
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,222
Don't worry, I got a plan.

65
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:37,974
Call me if you want to live.

66
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,386
I'm on "speed dial two."

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,810
What's your plan?

68
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,896
All we have to do is open up the bomb,
say "I hope this works,"

69
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:54,984
close our eyes and cut the blue wire.
I seen it a million times on TV. Easy.

70
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:04,618
- What do we do now, Randy?
- I think that we go to commercial.

71
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:07,079
- I'm calling Thomas.
- I need a beer.

72
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,888
Now what do we do?!

73
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:13,316
- I don't know! I can't reach the phone!
- We're ready to talk!

74
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:15,212
Thomas, we're ready to talk!

75
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:16,881
We're ready to talk, Thomas!

76
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,435
There are a few things I need
to get off my chest before we die.

77
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:33,016
First,
your teeth are not whiter than mine.

78
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:36,754
All right, that's it.

79
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:39,004
Is there anything
you need to say to me?

80
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:42,197
And if it's that your teeth are whiter
than mine, we have a big problem.

81
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,074
Randy, we're not going to die.

82
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,702
We just need
to knock this pole down.

83
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,078
Come on, push.

84
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:52,471
We need something heavy.
Something with a lot of weight.

85
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:53,792
How about a...?

86
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,421
- Jerk!
- Sorry, I'm just trying to...

87
00:04:58,943 --> 00:04:59,943
Jackass!

88
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,981
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

89
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:20,718
We're brothers.

90
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,096
Let's not turn on each other

91
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,908
in what could be
the last few moments of our lives.

92
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,076
You're right.

93
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:30,663
That one was just to make us even.

94
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:32,027
Fair enough.

95
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,399
I guess this is good-bye, brother.

96
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,941
I can't say good-bye. Hug me.

97
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:41,716
Maybe then after the explosion,
our bits will be mixed up

98
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,093
and God will have to take us
to Heaven together.

99
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:06,991
It didn't go off. We're alive.

100
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,819
One of the blue wires
must've got loose.

101
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:12,621
It's not broken.

102
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,107
It's not a real bomb.

103
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:18,970
I thought by handcuffing you
to fake explosives,

104
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,245
you'd give up Darnell's location.

105
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:23,207
You didn't crack.

106
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,260
You guys would make good soldiers.

107
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:30,014
That's what the guy in the Wal-Mart
parking lot is always telling us.

108
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:32,850
He says that because we...

109
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,852
Sneak attack!

110
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Gentlemen,

111
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,025
let's just be done
with the violence.

112
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:42,708
What do you say?

113
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,195
Sure.

114
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:46,864
Good.

115
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:50,358
I'd hate to have to kill
a couple of my son's friends.

116
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,285
Wait...

117
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,998
You're Darnell's dad?

118
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,498
Tell us some embarrassing stories
about him.

119
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,661
How do we know you're not lying?

120
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,841
Can't you see the ressemblance?

121
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:10,262
Darnell always told us his dad died
in the American-Canadian War.

122
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,417
You guys ought to read more.

123
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,703
I'm not surprised
Darnell didn't tell you about me.

124
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,354
I wasn't a great dad.

125
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,387
<i>Darnell's dad wasn't
must of a father,</i>

126
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,170
<i>but he was one of the best
covert government agents,</i>

127
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:30,531
<i>which meant having drinks after work
had a whole different meaning.</i>

128
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:31,806
To Communism!

129
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:40,148
<i>So he didn't have much time
for day-to-day parenting.</i>

130
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:43,723
It's your son. He fell down
some stairs and broke his arm.

131
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:47,098
Tell him this telephone number's
for emergencies only.

132
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,806
<i>In fact, sometimes he nearly forgot
he had a family at all.</i>

133
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:57,059
Wait a second...

134
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,228
What day is it today?

135
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:01,396
I think it's the 14th.

136
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:02,926
Crap!

137
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,483
Run out to Walgreens
and get me a belated birthday card.

138
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,210
We're in Angola.
I don't know where Walgreens is.

139
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,656
- Where's Walgreens?
- What is Walgreens?

140
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,950
- Tell me where Walgreens is!
- I don't know!

141
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,914
So you were in the CIA or the FBI?

142
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,958
Even more secretive than that.

143
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,417
Don't tell me... IRS.

144
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,461
PBS?

145
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:25,671
TCBY?

146
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,714
- Actually, it was...
- BYOB.

147
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,759
Son...
You're getting on my last nerve.

148
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,100
So because you're
in some secret organization,

149
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:38,016
that's why Darnell has to be
in the witness protection program?

150
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,894
It's complicated,
but, basically, yes.

151
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:45,858
I want to trust you,
but you did just handcuff us to a bomb.

152
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,484
A fake bomb.

153
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:49,361
And when you gonna let it go?

154
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,617
Just take the picture to Darnell.

155
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:54,342
He'll verify who I am.

156
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:57,452
I just want to get right by my son.

157
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,039
No matter how difficult
our relationship has been in the past,

158
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,292
every boy needs

159
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:05,710
to know that his father loves him.

160
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:08,213
How do I know that's a real tear?

161
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:14,344
Taste.

162
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:23,509
We're going.

163
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,815
<i>So we left Thomas at the trailer</i>

164
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,552
<i>and took the picture to find out
if it really was Darnell's dad.</i>

165
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:31,168
You told me that your daddy died
in a Ferris wheel accident.

166
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:32,863
That's why you'll never ride 'em.

167
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,782
I don't ride them because you refuse
to obey the "no rocking" sign.

168
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,744
Plus, I didn't want to talk
about my dad. Two birds.

169
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,867
Darnell, I've missed you so much.
You've got to come back to Camden.

170
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:44,791
You'll never believe it...
We've got a black president now.

171
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,159
Zip it, dummy.

172
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,962
The truth is, my father and I have
a long complicated history

173
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,673
that I didn't want to delve into.

174
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,512
<i>That's when Darnell told us the story
about his entire life as Harry Monroe.</i>

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,250
<i>From an early age,
Thomas saw that his son was exceptional.</i>

176
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:05,102
<i>So like any good secret agent would,</i>

177
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:07,397
<i>he shipped his son off
for spy training.</i>

178
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:14,363
Shaken, stirred.

179
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:20,087
<i>And, eventually, Darnell went
from special training to special ops.</i>

180
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,384
Dad! What a surprise.

181
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:32,297
It's been so long.
How's everything at home?

182
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:35,217
All your grandparents are dead
and we painted the kitchen.

183
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:38,720
Here are you orders.
Your flight leaves in 45 minutes.

184
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,381
There's about to be a Donkey Kong
kill screen in the game tent,

185
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:51,608
if you're interested.

186
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,661
<i>Darnell was the agency's best,</i>

187
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:05,769
<i>until one day the agency
asked him to go too far.</i>

188
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,416
I wondered how long
it would take the Americans

189
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,227
to send someone to kill me.

190
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:16,800
Why is it you are so threatened
by a pediaocracy?

191
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:19,556
Are you Wang Wa,
king of the Opti nation?

192
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,350
At least I lived longer
than my father.

193
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:26,916
Fire when ready.

194
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,489
You were successful.

195
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:36,611
No, there must be
some kind of mistake.

196
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:38,322
He's a nine-year-old kid.

197
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:42,491
He's a nine-year-old Socialist who wants
to nationalize the diamond mines.

198
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,986
He saw Veggie Tales about sharing,

199
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:47,164
and it's turned his head all around.

200
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,791
<i>Thinking about that little boy
made Darnell start to question</i>

201
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,975
<i>all he had given up for the agency,</i>

202
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,304
<i>which made him question</i>

203
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,590
<i>why the agency was asking him
to do all this to begin with.</i>

204
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,383
<i>And though he wasn't in the Navy,</i>

205
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:01,481
<i>Darnell testified before something
called a subcommittee</i>

206
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:04,353
<i>and nearly brought down
his father's entire agency.</i>

207
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:07,146
My father never forgave me
for testifying.

208
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:08,746
The whole agency wanted me dead.

209
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:10,937
That's why I had to go
into witness protection.

210
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,005
So your dad turned you
into a trained assassin.

211
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,235
My dad would make me hold the flashlight
when he'd work under the sink.

212
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:21,198
Sometimes dads suck,
but you gotta get past it.

213
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:24,204
Look, he even gave me
a belated birthday card for you.

214
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:32,125
- What's the big deal?
- Wake up, he didn't like the card.

215
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:42,594
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, son.

216
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:44,182
Let's do this.

217
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,146
<i>Darnell hadn't seen
his father in years, </i>

218
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,649
<i>and it wasn't
the happiest of reunions.</i>

219
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:59,047
- Stop blocking. I'm your father.
- You weren't a father.

220
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:01,029
If so, you would have coached
my archery team

221
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,489
or taught me stalkery

222
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,825
or at least given me a hug
once in a while.

223
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,210
I knew what kind of life
lay ahead of you,

224
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:12,673
and I didn't want you
to be soft like your brother.

225
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,212
- What brother?
- That's not important.

226
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:26,221
You robbed me of a childhood and,
apparently, of a brother.

227
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:37,441
This is a waste of time.
I trained you too well.

228
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,360
And neither one of us
is gonna land a punch.

229
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:41,732
You're right.

230
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,324
Learned some things in the streets.

231
00:13:46,638 --> 00:13:48,832
I'm getting too old for this crap.

232
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,957
Look, if I can find you,

233
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,915
so can anyone at the agency.

234
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,512
Your two friends...

235
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,756
They're brave, but they're idiots.

236
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:01,885
The tall one can't tell the difference
between a tear and saline solution.

237
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,976
- What do you want?
- I want to give you a chance

238
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:06,928
to make up
for what you did to the agency

239
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,430
and so you can stop running.

240
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,307
You can go back to your old life.

241
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:12,100
What would I have do?

242
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,810
One last mission.

243
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:16,414
Then I'm out.
No strings attached.

244
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,032
Uncle Sam has agreed
to wipe the slate clean.

245
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,320
The government or your freaky brother
who used to pay me $100 to rub his feet?

246
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,739
The government.

247
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,835
<i>Darnell knew working for the agency
could get him killed.</i>

248
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:36,074
<i>But, to Darnell,</i>

249
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,899
<i>eating TV dinners alone
was no life at all.</i>

250
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:43,173
<i>He'd do anything so they could be
the family they used to be.</i>

251
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,103
I'll do it.

252
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,120
Where am I?

253
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,737
What's going on?

254
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,712
Helicopter. Secret mission.

255
00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:12,102
My father brought you along
to make sure I cooperate.

256
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,477
He has trust issues.

257
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:16,560
I promise no long-term harm will come
to you unless harm comes to me,

258
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:18,291
in which case, you wouldn't survive.

259
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:21,262
But I prefer
to focus on the positive.

260
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,341
I'm gonna knock you out, you won't see
anything you're not supposed to.

261
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,269
But if you need to cry,
now would be a good time.

262
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:30,494
Thank you...

263
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:44,872
Hey, Pat.

264
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,115
Thank you for taking the boys.

265
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:54,119
I'll be happy to take yours
next week, if you want.

266
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:01,429
"Dear Baby,

267
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,940
"Sorry about laying all this on you
in written form..."

268
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,062
Randy, they're gone.

269
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:16,834
Don't move.

270
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,777
Do not move.

271
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,303
Thank you for this artifact.

272
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:32,616
P. Diddy will pay a pretty penny once
I hammer it into the hood of a Bentley.

273
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:35,410
Here. You will find
the man you seek.

274
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:38,168
He's awake.

275
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,642
Don't worry.
We'll get out of this.

276
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:55,038
It's cool.

277
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,938
My contact lens popped out.

278
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:15,210
You don't tell me what I want,
I'll kill your wives, one by one,

279
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,850
- starting with the hot one.
- Fakira!

280
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,079
I will tell you!

281
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,783
The anthrax will be released
from the AC duct

282
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,336
in the northwest corner
of the building.

283
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:36,482
This might be a bad time,
but I need to use the bathroom.

284
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,546
You're wearing a diaper.

285
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:53,227
Is it over?

286
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,157
I'm sure you have
a lot of questions.

287
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:58,454
No, just the one: is it over?

288
00:17:58,653 --> 00:17:59,953
Yeah, it's over.

289
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:03,399
And we're sorry we had
to knock you out so many times

290
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:04,824
45, to be exact.

291
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,293
You're gonna want
to drink a lot of water today.

292
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,512
Will there be any side effects?

293
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:13,152
Just that.

294
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:17,143
The engine's failing!

295
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,407
We're going down!

296
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:28,969
Not enough parachutes!

297
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,069
You get the first parachute
'cause you're a civilian,

298
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:36,072
and, more importantly,
cause you're a friend!

299
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,588
Thanks, Crab Man.

300
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,491
Just in case I never see you again,

301
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,201
I just want to say...

302
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,956
I feel the same way!

303
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:58,968
Here, take it.

304
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,765
This is an order, Agent Monroe!

305
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:03,767
You're no longer
my commanding officer!

306
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,985
But I'm still your father
and I love you!

307
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:11,191
I've waited so long for you to say that!
I'm not leaving without a hug first!

308
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,860
- There's no time!
- I'm not accepting that excuse anymore!

309
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:25,798
Darnell speaks seven languages

310
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:29,043
and has a black belt in three styles
of fighting that end in "do."

311
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,618
He's gonna be fine.

312
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,903
And Earl has a real nice smile

313
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,240
and can play "Wipeout"
on his stomach.

314
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:36,758
He's gonna be fine, too.

315
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,480
We just gotta be strong.

316
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,814
That's Earl!

317
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:58,530
<i>Everyone was safe, </i>

318
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:02,691
<i>Crab Man'd never again have to pretend

319
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,313
