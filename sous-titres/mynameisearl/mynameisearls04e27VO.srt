1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,463
<i>Every year, Dodge's school had a day</i>

2
00:00:02,588 --> 00:00:05,579
<i>where a few of the parents came in
and talked about their careers.</i>

3
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:07,230
<i>They called it Career Day.</i>

4
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:10,446
<i>This year was Darnell's turn
and he was a little nervous.</i>

5
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:12,542
When you work
at a seafood restaurant,

6
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,973
you have to go
to the fish market every morning.

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,904
The high-end sushi establishments
get there at 5:00 a.m.

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,477
to purchase the best crabs.

9
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:24,482
Your all-you-can seafood buffets
and such

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,068
arrive around 7:00
and select crabs like this one.

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,490
I roll in around 11:30

12
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:33,991
and buy crabs like this.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,525
In conclusion,
crabs are as different as you and me.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,168
And that's why
I like my job as a Crab Man.

15
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,896
And I used to work
for a clandestine government agency.

16
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:50,166
I'm the only reason you kids
aren't speaking Russian right now.

17
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,778
- What'd you think?
- I learned a lot.

18
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:55,763
I didn't know there were crabs
that looked like that first one.

19
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:57,264
It was too long.

20
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:59,196
Don't be offended.

21
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,435
Randy's wearing a watch
for the first time.

22
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,229
He's timing everything.

23
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,394
I got it from some old guy
at the Crab Shack

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,490
that wanted to trade me
for one of my molars.

25
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:09,615
I think
I got the better end of the deal.

26
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,863
The under part of my tooth
was all black and it smelled awful.

27
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,086
Baby, we gotta talk.

28
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,786
We got a little bit
of an awkward situation with Dodge.

29
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,185
We should go.

30
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,164
I need to talk to you, too.

31
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,589
Dodge was too afraid to tell you,

32
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:26,688
but he wants his old daddy
to go Career Day.

33
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:29,755
Why would he want me?
I don't know Darnell's job.

34
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,383
Dodge said everybody
is gonna have their real daddies there

35
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,129
except for that kid with two mommies

36
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:36,451
but both they look more
like daddies anyway.

37
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:39,140
You still haven't told Dodge
I'm not his real father?

38
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:42,435
How can I? I'm trying to give him
a solid foundation in life, Earl.

39
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,270
How can I go chopping away at it now

40
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,731
telling him it's all been
nothing but a web of lies?

41
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,065
We could try honesty.

42
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,484
Honesty's what got
your sister Pam killed.

43
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:52,028
That's true.

44
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:54,268
Come on, Earl.

45
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:56,441
You gotta do this, period.

46
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:57,855
You owe Dodge.

47
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,034
<i>Joy was right.</i>

48
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,038
<i>#174 on my list was
"Ruined Dodge's Career Day."</i>

49
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,287
<i>Back when I was
still married to Joy,</i>

50
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:08,001
<i>I was one of the parents
who went to speak about my career.</i>

51
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:11,171
I am a world-famous
highly paid doctor.

52
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:15,301
I make close to $27,000 a year.

53
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,180
This over here is an x-ray machine.
And this...

54
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,953
is an x-ray of my patient's tummy.

55
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:27,374
I see the car and the yo-yo, but where's
the little Lego construction guy?

56
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:28,898
I had a joke.

57
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,442
Sorry, Earl.
I think he's still stuck right here.

58
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:32,974
Listen.

59
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:39,533
<i>All units, hospital burglary report.</i>

60
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,266
<i>Suspects are two white males.</i>

61
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:43,487
<i>May be traveling
with a stolen x-ray machine.</i>

62
00:02:43,612 --> 00:02:44,914
They're on to us.

63
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:48,334
Stop! Come back!

64
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,637
- Let me in!
- Come over here!

65
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,285
Hi, I'm Billy's dad.

66
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,910
And as you probably guessed,
I'm a cop.

67
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,899
DOGDE'S DAD

68
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:16,487
<i>I never really enjoyed
pretending to be Dodge's dad, </i>

69
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,816
<i>but it was a lot easier
than telling a little kid</i>

70
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,827
<i>that his real father was a random loser
from a Ronnie James Dio concert.</i>

71
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,706
... made fun of people with accents,

72
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,657
snatched a kid's Halloween candy
when he came to trick-or-treat.

73
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:33,379
Excuse me, Mr. Hickey,
but I believe that was me.

74
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,006
The accent or the candy?

75
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:39,262
Tell you what,
come see me after class.

76
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,587
Any questions?

77
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,514
Dodge's mom is married to a black man.
I've seen him.

78
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,310
Where you going with this?

79
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:51,355
Why don't you have Dodge every weekend
like all the other divorced dads?

80
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,955
Because last weekend,

81
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,483
Dodge came to my birthday party
and the black guy dropped him off.

82
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,864
Why don't I live with you on weekends?
Don't you like me?

83
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:01,799
Yeah, I like you!

84
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:03,065
Of course!

85
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,190
I just don't wanna get
in Darnell's way 'cause...

86
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:09,373
he's your stepdad
and he really, really likes you.

87
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:11,709
Plus, you already live with him.

88
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,379
So, maybe you should start
shifting your love in that direction.

89
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:17,312
Burn.

90
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,421
Joy, this isn't fair to Dodge.

91
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:23,596
He was embarrassed.
I was embarrassed.

92
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,432
You should be embarrassed.
Where'd you buy that sweater, JaCrew?

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,908
I'm serious, Joy.

94
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:31,231
You should have seen the looks
from those two mommy-daddies.

95
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:34,231
And the British kid
said my parenting was "bollocks."

96
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:37,364
- You have to tell Dodge the truth.
- You think he'll feel better

97
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:40,966
when he finds out his daddy's
some drunk at a Molly Hatchet concert?

98
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,891
You mean Ronnie James Dio.

99
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:46,452
You've always said
it was a Ronnie James Dio concert.

100
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,169
Molly Hatchet, Ronnie James Dio...

101
00:04:49,294 --> 00:04:51,395
All I remember is
we were in the men's room.

102
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,084
It was crowded, and it was hard to get
my leather pants off in that stall.

103
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,704
Hold on. You said it happened
under the concession stand

104
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:00,925
while you were kneeling on a box of cups
and he continued selling nachos.

105
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,635
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did. Remember, I asked you

106
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,555
if a parent-teacher conference was
an appropriate place to tell this?

107
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:10,851
Joy, you're lying.
Did it even happen at a concert?

108
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,520
Do you know
who Dodge's real father is?

109
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:15,511
Fine!

110
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,523
It's Little Chubby. Okay?

111
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,486
Little Chubby is Dodge's dad.

112
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,620
<i>If we looked surprised,
it was because we were.</i>

113
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:26,649
<i>The Chubbys were
the most powerful family in Camden.</i>

114
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:28,676
<i>Little Chubby's father, Big Chubby</i>

115
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,776
<i>owned nearly every business in town</i>

116
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,199
<i>from the dry cleaners...</i>

117
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,954
<i>You wouldn't clean your body
with discount chemicals,</i>

118
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,377
<i>so why should you treat
your clothes any differently?</i>

119
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:39,584
<i>- To the restaurants.
- The taste of slow-cooking</i>

120
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,607
<i>with the sloppiest sauce around.</i>

121
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:44,885
<i>Then when Chubby Senior died,
his empire went to his son.</i>

122
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,155
<i>Introducing the Chubby SAT Prep.</i>

123
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,488
<i>Help your child
to achieve his dreams.</i>

124
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:52,361
<i>And dads,
while your kids study the SATs,</i>

125
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,272
<i>why don't you come down and,</i>

126
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,847
<i>study a little T&A?</i>

127
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,480
<i>Chubby Tutorials is to SAT Prep...</i>

128
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,255
<i>As Club Chub is to...</i>

129
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,380
<i>erections.</i>

130
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:08,867
Little Chubby is Dodge's Dad?

131
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:15,524
That explains why Dodge's mustache
is starting to grow in already.

132
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,090
Joy,
Little Chubby owns half this town.

133
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:20,296
The Chubbys were
the first to have two cars.

134
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:21,965
This is a gold mine.

135
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,091
Dodge is the heir
to the Chubby Empire.

136
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,177
It's a fool's gold mine, Earl.
So, you better keep your mouth shut.

137
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,596
Why didn't you tell
Little Chubby about this?

138
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:33,951
I went to tell him when I found out,
but I saw something there that scared me

139
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:37,776
into doing the sign of the cross,
even though I'm not catholic.

140
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:44,635
<i>Joy said she made a list of things
she was gonna buy on QVC,</i>

141
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,110
<i>then went to notify
the man who was gonna pay the bills.</i>

142
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,930
- Is Little Chubby here?
- He should be back any minute.

143
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:53,855
Cool. I'll wait.
Give me a bottle of champagne.

144
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:57,374
I'm not gonna drink it.
I just wanna pour it all over myself.

145
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:00,831
One of my ovaries laid a golden egg.

146
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,252
- Somebody here pregnant with my baby?
- Well, I...

147
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:14,872
You're damn right
someone here is pregnant with your baby.

148
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:16,727
And I expect you
to do something about it.

149
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,290
I will.

150
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,483
In this hand, I have a bus ticket,
and in this hand, I have a gun.

151
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,943
Pick a hand.

152
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,366
Better hurry up.
Might have a bus to catch.

153
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:34,745
I decided that I was gonna
raise Dodge 100% on my own.

154
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,064
By tricking me into marrying you?

155
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:40,042
And then never working,
never cooking, never cleaning,

156
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:41,976
making me support you?

157
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:45,005
I spent ten days in jail
for stealing you a diaper genie,

158
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,787
which, by the way,
there's nothing magic about it.

159
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:49,259
It's just crap in a bag.

160
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,011
It's always about you, isn't it?

161
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,945
You need to tell Little Chubby.

162
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,863
I know he used to be
a psycho like his late father,

163
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:58,634
but after I kicked him in the nuts
and disrupted his hormones,

164
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,859
he became a kinder, gentler guy.

165
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:03,524
Until his reconstructive
ball surgery,

166
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,859
after which he became a psycho again

167
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:08,751
but when he realized
he liked his nice self better,

168
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,440
he reracked himself.

169
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:13,784
I can't believe you don't remember this.
You love ball stories.

170
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,802
I'm not taking any chances.

171
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:18,532
But this could make Dodge's life
so much better.

172
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:22,042
It could make all your lives easier.
And Dodge deserves to know.

173
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,212
I'm not telling Little Chubby, okay?

174
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,810
And you need to leave it alone.

175
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:29,032
Get out.

176
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,977
<i>Even though Joy told me
to leave it alone,</i>

177
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:34,131
<i>Little Chubby was Dodge's father,</i>

178
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:37,474
<i>and I knew there were ways
he could make Dodge's life a lot better.</i>

179
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,570
<i>He could certainly hook him up
with a hotter date to the prom.</i>

180
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:42,896
<i>And maybe it could make
Little Chubby's life better.</i>

181
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:46,900
How'd you know it was us?

182
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,068
<i>Look up.</i>

183
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,324
Hey, Hickey boys.
You know, I wouldn't eat those.

184
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,445
The shrimp come from Camden Lake.

185
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,413
If you turn out the lights,
I'm not gonna lie to you, they glow.

186
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,216
All these shows are boring.

187
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,246
They're not real TV shows.

188
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:18,182
They're security footage.
I have cameras all over town.

189
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,516
I'll show you.

190
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,436
Let's take a look at what's going on
at Chubby's Pulled Pork.

191
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:32,506
That guy's putting
his wiener in a hot dog.

192
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:34,540
- His real wiener.
- Yeah, that's my cook.

193
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:37,844
Every once in a while he tricks somebody
into putting mustard and relish on it.

194
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:39,769
Do not change the channel.

195
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,862
Why don't you sit down?

196
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,043
This is quite a room
you built for yourself.

197
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,359
It was a butcher shop.

198
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:51,058
But we shared a wall with the club
so I bought it,

199
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:54,092
tricked it all out like this,
and this is where I spend my time.

200
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:56,413
Please, let me out!

201
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,848
I didn't change everything.

202
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,288
Sometimes the refrigerated locker
comes in handy.

203
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:03,963
It's so cold in here!

204
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:07,714
Maybe next time
you'll think twice before deciding to,

205
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:09,608
lean against my car.

206
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,705
- Little Chubby?
- What?

207
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:16,143
You're thinking why am I acting
like a douchebag again.

208
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:18,762
There's a simple explanation
to that.

209
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,246
I'm a douchebag again.

210
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,736
<i>Little Chubby told us</i>

211
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:25,618
<i>he discovered that his business
was no place for a nice guy.</i>

212
00:10:26,014 --> 00:10:28,764
I'm not trying to be
disrespectful, but...

213
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:32,464
I think your best dancing days
may be over, ma'am.

214
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:35,884
<i>Hello, my baby!</i>

215
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,405
<i>Hello, my honey!</i>

216
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,471
<i>Hello, my ragtime gal!</i>

217
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:42,684
Now, this is where
I drop my bloomers

218
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,459
and let people see
all the way to Florida.

219
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:51,576
Great. Well, I guess
you could start Monday.

220
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,389
That old prune
slipped off the stripper's pole

221
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:56,768
and shattered her pelvis.

222
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:58,740
I swear to God
I think her vagina fell off.

223
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:01,763
As you can well imagine,
the customers fled in terror.

224
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,728
Anyway, it's no way
to run a business.

225
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:05,872
Certainly, it's not the way
the old me would do it.

226
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,536
So, you just started acting mean?

227
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,911
No, I tried that, but I was...

228
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,987
I was hormonally incapable.

229
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,549
So I got a ball transplant.

230
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,843
- Get out.
- Yeah, it's true.

231
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,386
You can get any type you want.

232
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,596
I got bull balls. They're huge.

233
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,367
Huge. You know.
It's cool. It's a lot of fun.

234
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:28,061
Occasionally, a cow will lift its tail
and all hell'll break lose,

235
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,354
but, you know...

236
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,247
What's freezing, guys?
32 degrees, right?

237
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:34,312
For the love of God!

238
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,953
- So, what brings you fellas over?
- Who, us?

239
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:41,948
We just came by
to show you my new watch.

240
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:43,118
It's a Timex.

241
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,187
- Okay, Earl, time to go now.
- Not yet, Randy.

242
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,571
I need to tell you something.

243
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:51,752
And with all that new plumbing,
this may even be good news.

244
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:54,884
In case you were worried
you'd never be able to have a kid,

245
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,308
well, you do.

246
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:59,424
First of all, as far as
my plumbing goes, it's just fine.

247
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,948
If I want to have a kid,
I'll have a kid.

248
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:04,681
Might turn out to be a Minotaur,
but I'll love it none the same.

249
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:08,018
Secondly, that woman said
she was on the pill.

250
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,978
But I haven't even told you
who it was yet.

251
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,447
Doesn't matter.
I'll tell you what I'll do.

252
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:15,275
If you leave this alone,
I'll leave you alone.

253
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,859
If you don't leave this alone...

254
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:22,946
That's a flask.

255
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:24,634
You're showing me a flask.

256
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:27,632
Sorry about that.

257
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:34,138
Oh, I get it now.

258
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,260
Someone sneezed on that?

259
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,279
Catalina, you got to help us.

260
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:47,391
We want to prove
Little Chubby is Dodge's father,

261
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:49,638
and we need something
with his DNA on it.

262
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:50,813
What's DNA?

263
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,757
That's what makes up
your spit, your blood, and your boogers.

264
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,755
No two people's boogers
are exactly alike.

265
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,172
They're like snowflakes.

266
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:58,447
I can't help you.

267
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,905
Little Chubby will ruin my life
if he found out I was tricking him.

268
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:04,058
He has cameras everywhere.

269
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:06,704
Make it like you're my customer.

270
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,496
I'm gonna sticky hand down your pants,
then you hand me a 20.

271
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:21,007
I don't have any cash on me.

272
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,942
<i>Since Catalina was too afraid
of Chubby to help,</i>

273
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,822
<i>me and Randy were going to have
to dig in and help ourselves.</i>

274
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,257
Let's get out of here.

275
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,514
We just need to find
a cigar butt or some hair,

276
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,978
anything that might have
Little Chubby's DNA.

277
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:37,182
All I see are a bunch of little balloons
with mayonnaise in them.

278
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,318
Little Chubby! Run!

279
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:49,769
<i>I was determined to prove that
Little Chubby was Dodge's dad.</i>

280
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:52,769
<i>And even though he was powerful,
he wasn't above the law.</i>

281
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:56,211
Oh, hey, Earl. Randy.
You know what the bitch of this is?

282
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,297
I don't know if this is
an attack on me as a cop

283
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,699
or as a person of size.

284
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:02,549
Hoyne, we need to report a crime.
We just got shot at.

285
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,838
Oh, God, well,
we'll get right on it.

286
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:06,460
Come back to the station with me.

287
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:08,511
We'll look at some mug shots,
have some cocoa.

288
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,734
No, we know who it was.
It was Little Chubby.

289
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,172
But we still want the cocoa.

290
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:13,771
Jeez, I can't help you guys.

291
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,270
Little Chubby bought off
the chief of police and the mayor.

292
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:18,690
In fact, there's an actual
city ordinance now that says

293
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,836
if anybody accuses Little Chubby
of a crime,

294
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,736
I got to trump up
charges against 'em.

295
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,405
- So you're going to arrest us?
- I have to.

296
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:30,872
Can't you just write me a ticket
for a busted light or something?

297
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:34,664
Ah, what the hell.
We're friends.

298
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:39,022
<i>Okay, maybe Little Chubby
was above the law,</i>

299
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:41,058
<i>but I had science on my side.</i>

300
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:43,822
<i>If a father and a son
have the same DNA,</i>

301
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,147
<i>and the father of the son
is also the son of a father...</i>

302
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:50,122
<i>anyway, the plan was
to dig up Chubby, Senior.</i>

303
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,095
You know how Dad has that,

304
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,519
"I'd rather be fishing"
license plate frame?

305
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,895
I've never gotten it until now.

306
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,936
Let's forget this
and just go fishing.

307
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,082
No, I'm not letting him win this time.
Flick on your lighter.

308
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,531
I can't see what good pieces
of Chubby are left.

309
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,994
<i>Unfortunately, I had forgotten
about Chubby's final ritual.</i>

310
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,456
Let's get out of here.

311
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,706
<i>Everybody took turns pouring
Wild Turkey Whiskey into his coffin.</i>

312
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,083
Daddy.

313
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,971
I can't get the smell of burnt Chubby
out of my nose.

314
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,877
Little Chubby bought the motel.
You don't live here anymore.

315
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,582
Ooh, I'm impressed.

316
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:44,257
<i>You bought the motel.</i>

317
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,652
<i>Oh, and I see
you've changed the name to</i>

318
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,391
<i>"Earl's A Homo Inn."</i>

319
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,850
<i>Well, that doesn't bother me.</i>

320
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,413
<i>I figured all I really needed
was a few bucks</i>

321
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,971
<i>to pay for a place to sleep</i>

322
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:00,996
<i>and a few beers to drink
our way to a solution.</i>

323
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,267
Okay, I get it.

324
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:09,913
You own the whole damn town
and everyone in it.

325
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,930
They're all so scared of you,
they won't even help me.

326
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,505
You win. You happy?

327
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:22,254
So, that ATM machine.

328
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,616
What a jerk, huh?

329
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,707
<i>I was out of moves.</i>

330
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,232
<i>Little Chubby won.</i>

331
00:16:28,357 --> 00:16:30,607
Little Chubby didn't win this time.

332
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:32,539
You did.

333
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:35,952
<i>Turns out Joy might not have been
listening to me, but Darnell was.</i>

334
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,515
But this could make
Dodge's life so much better.

335
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,498
It could make all your lives easier.

336
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,266
And Dodge deserves to know.

337
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:45,337
I'm not telling Little Chubby, okay?

338
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,515
So you just need to leave it alone.

339
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,827
<i>Darnell thought Dodge
deserved to know, too.</i>

340
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:58,230
<i>He realized that Little Chubby's money
could help them afford luxuries.</i>

341
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,019
There you go.
Now they fit again.

342
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:05,327
<i>Like new shoes.</i>

343
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,632
<i>Having been in the CIA,</i>

344
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:11,050
<i>the circus, and the plumber's union,</i>

345
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,392
<i>Darnell was able to accomplish
what I couldn't.</i>

346
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,954
<i>Pluck a hair.</i>

347
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:23,667
Probably nothing.

348
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,200
I had to do the same thing
to Castro.

349
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,296
This was a walk in the park
compared to that.

350
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:32,456
Thanks, Crab Man.

351
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,847
You see this?
You didn't win. I won.

352
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:39,808
Me and my friends won.

353
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:43,186
<i>I got your hair.
So, screw you, Little Chubby!</i>

354
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,438
<i>Screw you!</i>

355
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,134
Bastard pulled a Castro on me.

356
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:54,500
<i>Crab Man distracted Joy
while I got a sample of Dodge's DNA.</i>

357
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,367
<i>I wasn't thrilled to see him
using my move,</i>

358
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,335
<i>but I had to stay focused.</i>

359
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,284
The toothbrushes look the same,
so I had to grab all four.

360
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:14,464
I also stole
some antibacterial cream.

361
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,502
You got something
on your back that you can't see,

362
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:20,949
and I didn't want to say anything
until I had something to put on it.

363
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:27,023
<i>I took all the DNA samples
to the Camden County labs,</i>

364
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:30,547
<i>and when the results came in the mail,
Catalina brought 'em to us.</i>

365
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:37,991
<i>But the results were not
what I expected.</i>

366
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:41,734
- You lied to me again, Joy.
- What the hell are you talking about?

367
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,122
I went and had Dodge's DNA tested.

368
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,340
I told you to stay out of this!

369
00:18:47,437 --> 00:18:49,878
How the hell did you get
Little Chubby's DNA?

370
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,755
- Not important.
- What is important,

371
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,510
is Little Chubby is not
Dodge's father.

372
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,509
- Of course he is.
- No, he isn't.

373
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,303
Says right there. Doesn't match.

374
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:02,699
This test is wrong.
It's impossible.

375
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:05,324
I remember everything
that happened that night.

376
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:08,547
<i>Joy said it all happened
at a Halloween party.</i>

377
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:12,692
So, Lewinsky, you want a bone?

378
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,434
I like a little more meat on mine.

379
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:19,350
<i>But as the night wore on,</i>

380
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,509
<i>the pickings got slimmer
and slimmer.</i>

381
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,134
I wasn't clear
which costumes were for men,

382
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,775
and which costumes were for women.

383
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,427
<i>Then the pickings got older,
balder, and nakeder.</i>

384
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:40,762
Hey, baby.

385
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,351
Let me ask you something.

386
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:47,144
Is it Halloween?

387
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:50,612
<i>And, eventually,</i>

388
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,125
<i>Joy went for any bone in the storm.</i>

389
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:58,898
Let's do this.

390
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,258
Joy, was that the Halloween party

391
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:09,634
where Fat Steve dressed up
like the Kool-Aid guy

392
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,882
and broke his nose trying to run
through the wall?

393
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:15,255
I wore a skeleton costume
to that party.

394
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,633
What?

395
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,886
- Earl, did you do me?
- If anything, you did me. I was drunk.

396
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:29,769
I don't remember anything
after Fat Steve going through the wall.

397
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,479
- Sweet Jesus!
- I know.

398
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,242
I'm Dodge's father.

399
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:39,183
That explains why Dodge's moustache
is starting to come in already.

400
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:42,615
- We've got another problem.
- What?

401
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,446
These three DNAs match.

402
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:48,257
That means it's you and the boys,

403
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:51,457
which makes this one mine,
and it doesn't match any of those.

404
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:53,543
What does that mean?

405
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:56,005
It means I'm not Earl Jr.'s father.

406
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:07,276
Now, everybody just calm down.

407
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:10,059
<i>Feygnasse Team</i>
Jarick & loky

408
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,427
End of season 4!
