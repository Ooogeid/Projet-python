1
00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:03,184
<i>With Joy and Darnell
in the Witness Protection Program,</i>

2
00:00:03,309 --> 00:00:04,992
<i>me and Randy were back
in the trailer</i>

3
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:07,506
<i>and enjoying the luxury
of getting our own beds.</i>

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,360
Damn it, Randy.

5
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:15,933
Every night you're climbing into bed
with me. You got your own room now.

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,867
There's a scary,
scratchy noise out there.

7
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:21,357
Like "a bush rubbing against the door"
scratching

8
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:23,522
or like "the shower cap killer"
scratching?

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,397
No one's ever heard
the shower cap killer and survived,

10
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:28,842
except for that one woman,
and he cut out her tongue,

11
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,231
and until she learns
to use the fake one, it's all just...

12
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:34,450
"The shower cap killer,
he took out my tongue."

13
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,752
Wait, that could be us.
Grab a weapon.

14
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:49,982
I can't see anything.

15
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:53,557
That makes sense.
Some say the shower cap killer is a kid.

16
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:04,016
Ready?

17
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,241
<i>Ever since Joy lost
Mr. Turtle off her car roof,</i>

18
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,516
<i>he'd been on a long journey home.</i>

19
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,469
<i>He escaped from pet loving nudists.</i>

20
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:26,094
<i>He participated
in his first marathon.</i>

21
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,254
<i>He got into a little trouble
with drugs and alcohol.</i>

22
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,057
<i>And he saw some things
he shouldn't have seen.</i>

23
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,482
<i>He even took a lover for a few days.</i>

24
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,184
<i>But now he found his way back.</i>

25
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:44,488
Welcome home.

26
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,111
I don't know
how to break the news to you,

27
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:49,086
so I'm just going to spit it out.

28
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:52,097
Joy, Darnell, and the kids
were put into witness protection

29
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:54,272
and we'll never see them again.

30
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,879
He's freaking out.

31
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,037
Let's put him in his fish tank
till he calms down.

32
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,240
Hold on, Earl.

33
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:05,666
As long as Darnell's not here,
I've got some unfinished business.

34
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,370
That was for ruining my chances
with the girl

35
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,321
at the Crab Shack Christmas party.

36
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,508
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS

37
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:19,128
<i>Ever since Darnell was taken away
by witness protection,</i>

38
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,362
<i>the Crab Shack got a little more...</i>

39
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:22,487
<i>festive.</i>

40
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:24,546
Coasters, please.

41
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,712
I just waxed the bar.

42
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,606
I still can't believe
you work here now.

43
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:31,377
Just picking up a couple of shifts
while Darnell's gone.

44
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:33,152
My IRA's in the dumper.

45
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:36,781
What you and Ira do behind closed doors
is none of my business.

46
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,800
You should try something off
Kenny's new Martini menu.

47
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:42,243
He named the drinks
after <i>Sex and the City</i> characters.

48
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,895
Earl, I'll bet you're a Carrie.

49
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,482
I don't want to sound conceited,

50
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,961
but Mr. Turtle just looked at me
and licked his lips.

51
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:53,007
He's probably just hungry.
We haven't fed him yet.

52
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,578
Hold on there, little fella.

53
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:56,234
I got your food right here.

54
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:57,523
Darnell...

55
00:02:57,648 --> 00:03:00,554
or as you know him, Mr. Human...
left that for you.

56
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,058
The hell?

57
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:07,482
"Dear Earl,
if you're using this food I left you

58
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:09,633
"that means you found Mr. Turtle.

59
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,108
"Please call me."
And there's a number.

60
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,632
Kenny, let me use the phone.

61
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,337
And I told the jerk,

62
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:22,442
"Endless bread sticks and salad
means endless bread sticks and salad."

63
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,021
Excuse me, folks.

64
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,104
So I'm gone for a week
and there's no "Hey, Crab Man"?

65
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:39,802
Well, I guess life goes on.

66
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:46,892
So did you find Mr. Turtle or did
Randy just get into the turtle food?

67
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,323
<i>I told Darnell
about finding Mr. Turtle,</i>

68
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:56,887
<i>so he gave me his new address
for me to ship the little guy to him.</i>

69
00:03:57,012 --> 00:04:00,656
<i>Then he asked me to destroy the paper
I wrote it down for all of our safety.</i>

70
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,326
Don't worry, I won't give
anyone else this phone number.

71
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,944
This phone is dead now anyway.
Good-bye, Earl, and thanks.

72
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,967
You can't just ship a turtle, Earl.
It's not like a vase or a person.

73
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,510
You have the address. Why don't you just
drive Mr. Turtle down there yourself?

74
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:24,472
Bruce!

75
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,375
<i>As I sat there, I wondered:</i>

76
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:28,838
<i>was Kenny right?</i>

77
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:32,301
<i>Was sending a turtle
via snail mail a snafu</i>

78
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:36,377
<i>or was I just talking myself
into making me the priority now?</i>

79
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:38,360
Screw this. I want a beer.

80
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:41,562
<i>So the next morning,
me and Mr. Turtle hit the road.</i>

81
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,951
<i>I didn't take Randy
'cause long drives made him carsick</i>

82
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,852
<i>and the medicine for that
made him hungry.</i>

83
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:49,415
<i>It was an endless cycle
we both wanted to avoid.</i>

84
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:50,998
I miss Earl already.

85
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,735
I know in my heart
it's better that he left me behind,

86
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,694
but it's still weird sitting here
at the bar by myself.

87
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,084
If you want company,
the Camden Men's Glee Club

88
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,517
will be performing
a <i>Top Gun</i> tribute at the air show.

89
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,792
They're holding auditions.
I am hoping for Maverick.

90
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,097
Thanks anyway,

91
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,370
but I have to go home
to that empty trailer at some point.

92
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,487
I know
what it's like to miss somebody,

93
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,308
especially when the two of you
have been living together,

94
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:26,803
but it gets easier, I promise you.

95
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:28,247
I'm Jim.

96
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,998
Maybe I can take you to a movie later,
help get your mind off things.

97
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,494
Sure, and I'll try not to fill up
on junk food here

98
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:38,269
so I can eat
a good dinner at the theater.

99
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,227
<i>After driving all night</i>

100
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:47,096
<i>and convincing the guard
at Joy and Darnell gated community</i>

101
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:51,249
<i>that I was an exotic pet delivery boy,
I finally made it to their house.</i>

102
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,820
<i>Barely.</i>

103
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,768
What the hell?

104
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,989
You look like the weather lady
from <i>Channel Four</i>.

105
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:07,116
My name is Goldie now.
Get inside.

106
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,916
I'm sorry, I don't want to ruin
your witness protection identity, but...

107
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,278
Our lives are in constant danger...
I have got bigger fish to fry.

108
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:21,380
<i>Joy wasn't as concerned
about my presence threatening her life</i>

109
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,049
<i>as she was worried
about it threatening her social life.</i>

110
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,912
<i>She was having trouble
being accepted by the local women.</i>

111
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:30,189
This is my signature
Swiss Colony cheese ball.

112
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,059
And for dessert,
I've got a Ritz mock apple pie.

113
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:36,663
You'll swear it's got real apples in it,
but it's just wet crackers.

114
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:39,732
No offense, Goldie, but we're really
not used to eating like this.

115
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,902
- What do you mean?
- It's a little high-fat.

116
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,864
Come on, ladies,
live a little, it's a party.

117
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,407
In a trailer park.

118
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,540
You guessed the theme.
It's a white trash party.

119
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:59,543
That is funny.

120
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,338
And that explains
all the tacky crap in your hair.

121
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,170
That's right, anything for a laugh.

122
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,742
I try to be friends with these women,
but they can smell Camden on my skin.

123
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,890
You spent a decade living
by the hog-rendering plant.

124
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:16,758
- It's going to get into your pores.
- I lived upwind from Porkweiser.

125
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:19,689
That's not it. Snobs like that
have always looked down on me.

126
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:23,960
In high school, my mom gave me
a rabbit fur jacket for Christmas.

127
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,267
I was so proud to show it off

128
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:29,865
till one of those rich girls pointed out
it was a coat she'd given to <i>Goodwill</i>.

129
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:33,916
She showed everybody
where her pet rabbit had humped it.

130
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,100
I thought it was an elbow patch.

131
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:37,957
I hear you. In high school,

132
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,377
the rich kids would make fun of me
for wearing the same two shirts.

133
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:45,470
I swore when I grew up, I'd have
a flannel for every day of the week...

134
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,046
and I do.

135
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:48,648
By God, I do.

136
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,999
I still have a chance with these women.
They haven't decided if I'm in or out.

137
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:56,000
If they see somebody like you here,
I'm definitely out.

138
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,732
Look here, drifter, I don't care
if you were in the Vietnam War.

139
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:06,152
I'm not giving you any soup.
Now, beat it, Rambo.

140
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,038
<i>Since this was important to Joy,
I knew I had to sneak out of there</i>

141
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:11,866
<i>before I did anything
that would ruin her chances.</i>

142
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,421
What was that noise?

143
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,827
I think I blinded
one of your neighbors' dogs.

144
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,274
Joy, I think I blinded him.

145
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:48,283
What if he's
somebody's <i>Seeing Eye</i> dog?

146
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:49,582
I got to get help.

147
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:52,091
He's obviously a stray.
Look how dirty his cardigan is.

148
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:55,246
Just take that thing back to Camden.
Give it to Catalina, she can dust with.

149
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,200
I do not have
any leftover mouthwash you can drink.

150
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:01,377
Get out of here, you drunk bum.

151
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,242
<i>While I figured out
how to help that dog,</i>

152
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:07,016
Randy had a new friend
looking after him, too.

153
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:11,273
Good idea renting a video
instead of going to the movies.

154
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:15,207
I can't believe there's a Patrick Swayze
movie I've never seen before.

155
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:16,896
<i>To Wong Foo</i>.

156
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:20,536
That sounds like
it's got a lot of ass-kicking.

157
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,477
Taste.

158
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,462
What do you think?

159
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,588
Spaghetti sauce.

160
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:34,568
Sarcastic.

161
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,347
I like that.

162
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:38,160
You got a little...

163
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,331
Earl used to clean food off me.

164
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,420
You talk about Earl quite a lot.

165
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,963
- How long were you two together?
- Forever.

166
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,590
I know how that feels.

167
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:53,843
The hardest part is going to be sleeping
in that big bed without him.

168
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,698
If you let me,

169
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,641
I can be your Earl.

170
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:03,978
Awesome! Sleepover!

171
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:11,667
<i>I took the dog to the vet,</i>

172
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,123
<i>and because it had eaten
something called a tracking chip,</i>

173
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,147
<i>she could tell me that its owner lived
a few doors down from Joy.</i>

174
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,923
<i>She also said it would be a few days
before the dog got its sight back.</i>

175
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,227
Do you own a dog named Gooky?

176
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,826
Oh, my... Gucci.

177
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,114
Gucci, baby, what happened to you?

178
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,357
<i>I was nervous
how Carol was going to react</i>

179
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:55,163
<i>since I knew how much
rich ladies love their tiny dogs,</i>

180
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,477
<i>so I explained to her
all about my list</i>

181
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,602
<i>and how I was going
to make it right.</i>

182
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,396
The vet says Gucci's gonna be fine,

183
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:03,788
but I'd really like
to make it up to you.

184
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,581
Tell me more about this Karma.

185
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,208
Excuse me?

186
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,253
<i>Turns out, she was more
interested in me than her dog.</i>

187
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,728
<i>Carol and her rich friends
couldn't sleep.</i>

188
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:15,035
<i>It's like their minds
just wouldn't shut off.</i>

189
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,846
<i>They tried sleeping pills,</i>

190
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:18,414
<i>they tried martinis,</i>

191
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:21,287
<i>they even considered having sex
with their husbands,</i>

192
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,765
<i>but nothing helped.</i>

193
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,850
<i>They couldn't quite
put their finger on it,</i>

194
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,851
<i>but something
was making them restless.</i>

195
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:29,599
<i>Even though during the day
they looked very put together,</i>

196
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:31,924
<i>at night, they were falling apart.</i>

197
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:35,278
<i>In trying to fill that void
and get some peace of mind,</i>

198
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,100
<i>they were always chasing
the latest spiritual fad.</i>

199
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:40,975
<i>They tried some kind
of hot and sweaty yoga.</i>

200
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,329
<i>They tried something called
primal scream therapy.</i>

201
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,535
<i>They even tried some kind of fast
where they only drank shakes</i>

202
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,360
<i>made out of creek water
and lawn clippings.</i>

203
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,347
<i>Even though none
of those things worked,</i>

204
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:00,867
<i>they weren't about to stop
looking for one that did.</i>

205
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:03,627
My friends are going to love you.

206
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:06,976
Everyone,

207
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:08,975
this is Earl.

208
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:12,189
He has this amazing
new program called

209
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:13,983
The List.

210
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,409
It's just Karma.

211
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,284
You know, do good things,
good thing happen.

212
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,531
Isn't that just a fabulous mantra?

213
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,778
Good things happen.

214
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,167
<i>That's when Joy realized</i>

215
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,845
<i>I might be her ticket
to the inner circle.</i>

216
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:30,625
It's very spiritual.

217
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,369
Earl is actually an old friend...

218
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,033
guide.

219
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:36,559
Friend guide.

220
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,958
He is my spiritual guru.

221
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,927
Goldie, you have to share him.

222
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:42,667
Of course.

223
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,972
Why don't you all come
to my place tomorrow for a little...

224
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,644
talky party,

225
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,286
and he can throw
some guru stuff at you?

226
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:54,406
"Do good things." "Stitch in time."

227
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:56,848
"Everybody walk the dinosaur."
Crap like that.

228
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,120
You'll see.

229
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,893
I'm really glad you asked me
to spend the night.

230
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,033
Me, too.

231
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,493
Now I can finally get some sleep.

232
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,333
I get it.

233
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:16,754
Sleep.

234
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,592
You're right.
Things are going too fast.

235
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,067
We should just...

236
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,562
slow everything way down.

237
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,833
Good night, Jim.

238
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:37,024
Good night, Randy.

239
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,344
<i>Even though me and Joy prepared
a pretty fancy presentation,</i>

240
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,969
<i>I was still nervous.</i>

241
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,656
<i>Standing up there in front
of all these rich women,</i>

242
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,843
<i>I finally understood what Joy felt.</i>

243
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,562
Welcome. Karma.

244
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,215
The Webster's Dictionary

245
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:54,735
defines Karma

246
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:58,379
as, "the force generated
by a person's actions

247
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,519
"held in Hinduism and Buddhism

248
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,718
"to perpetuate transmigr..."

249
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,490
Transmi... something.

250
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,265
<i>Things started out shaky.</i>

251
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,659
<i>But when I ran out of stuff
to read off my hand</i>

252
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,467
<i>and just started talking
from my heart, it got easier.</i>

253
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:22,049
So then I helped
the two army buddies make up,

254
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:24,155
and everyone lived
happily ever after.

255
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,458
<i>And it wasn't long before
I had them eating out of my hands.</i>

256
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,714
Not only did me and Randy
do that cheerleading routine,

257
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:33,839
we nailed it.

258
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,995
<i>So the woman decided
to give Karma a try,</i>

259
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,150
<i>and number one on all their lists
was mistreating their maids.</i>

260
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,525
I'm so sorry that I made you
walk all the way down

261
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,463
to the gas station whenever
you need to use the bathroom.

262
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:53,998
From now on, Lupe,
<i>mi toileta es su toileta</i>.

263
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:56,754
I'm sorry I made you dress up

264
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,673
like Dora the Explorer
at my niece's birthday party.

265
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,130
I didn't think you'd get bitten
as much as you did.

266
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,947
I'm so sorry
I made you work on Christmas,

267
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:09,484
but the kids kept crying
for Brown Mommy.

268
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:15,027
- The rich people like us.
- I know.

269
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:19,221
Carol let me borrow her lip gloss

270
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,545
and didn't even wipe it off
when I gave it back to her.

271
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:24,403
Who would have guessed
we would be sitting

272
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,595
in a swanky house with an icemaker

273
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,971
drinking fancy rich lady drinks
and eating baby egg pies?

274
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:32,765
Egg pies?
Earl, they're called "kweeshes."

275
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:35,044
Try to hold it together here.

276
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,085
Earl, this is fantastic.

277
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,522
You know what?
I'm going to get you on Oprah.

278
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:40,800
- Oprah?
- Sure.

279
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:43,024
I go to the same teeth
whitening guy as Steadman.

280
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,460
The minute you walk in
on that stage,

281
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:48,114
every woman in America
is going to fall in love

282
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:50,074
with Earl Hickey and The List.

283
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,369
<i>Everything was happening so fast.
Steadmans, baby kweeshes.</i>

284
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:55,421
<i>I never felt so important.</i>

285
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:58,291
How do I let Karma know
I want my pool before Memorial Day?

286
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,126
I want a jet, but a little one.

287
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,278
I want my boobs to get fixed.
I want to even these puppies out.

288
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:05,256
She's got a football
and a golf ball in there.

289
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,174
How quickly does Karma happen?

290
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,399
Because that is gonna be
Oprah's first question.

291
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:11,900
That is gonna be
everyone's first question.

292
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,725
Super fast. Like a week.

293
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:20,960
A week?
What the hell were you thinking?

294
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,648
I don't know.
I got swept up.

295
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,362
They were coming at me
with Oprah and kweeshes.

296
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:28,404
You're not the only one who had issues
with rich people in school.

297
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:31,275
What are you gonna do?
They want to see Karma work its magic.

298
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,410
They want to see a pool just appear,
find a jet in their garage,

299
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:37,842
wake up to find that their boobs
have just evened out overnight.

300
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,728
Look, I'll think of something.

301
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,037
<i>I spent the night
trying to figure out</i>

302
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:46,112
<i>how to make due on my promises
to Joy's friends.</i>

303
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:50,486
<i>I was thinking and thinking
and coming up with nothing.</i>

304
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:53,022
<i>Then the nothing started
to make me nervous.</i>

305
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:55,765
<i>Then being nervous and sleep-deprived
started to make me desperate.</i>

306
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:58,350
<i>Then the desperate started
to make me crazy.</i>

307
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,549
<i>Then the crazy started
to make me crazy.</i>

308
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,313
<i>Once you start repeating yourself,</i>

309
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,330
<i>you know you're in trouble.
By morning, I had lost it.</i>

310
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:08,091
- What the hell are you doing?
- I got it all figured out.

311
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:10,681
- What do you think?
- I think you lost your mind.

312
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:13,232
- What the hell does all this mean?
- It's simple.

313
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:15,722
We have Darnell get that stuff
Witness Protection

314
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:17,411
put in our necks to knock us out.

315
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,665
- Then we shoot it into Janine's neck.
- You want to knock out Janine?

316
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,123
I don't want to,

317
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:25,002
but it's the only way we can get her
to a boob doctor without her knowing it.

318
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:28,396
It's all right here.
We got to get creative, Joy.

319
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:31,902
That must be the backhoe
I rented to dig Carol's pool.

320
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:33,227
Right on time.

321
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,516
Ladies.

322
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:41,769
Not to worry.

323
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:44,689
Karma's working on
getting you all that stuff.

324
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:47,275
- But we still got six days, but...
- It's okay.

325
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:49,151
We don't need those things.

326
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:54,969
<i>Turns out, Karma had already
given them something better.</i>

327
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:59,485
<i>Last night, the women were expecting</i>
<i>to once again toss and turn,</i>

328
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:01,455
<i>but something strange happened.</i>

329
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,954
<i>For the first time in years,</i>

330
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,275
<i>they didn't need sleeping pills
or midnight martinis.</i>

331
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:10,099
<i>They just closed their eyes and
drifted peacefully to sleep.</i>

332
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:12,524
<i>And they stayed like that all night.</i>

333
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:18,257
<i>Karma had found something
to reward them with.</i>

334
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:19,582
<i>Peace of mind.</i>

335
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,206
I guess I don't need my own jet.

336
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:26,063
And Carol doesn't need a pool.

337
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:29,358
I'm always drunk, and I can't swim.
Probably not a good idea.

338
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,323
I'm glad everything worked out.

339
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,076
I can't wait to get back
to doing nice things.

340
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:41,735
One of which

341
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,373
is being a little less
judgmental of you,

342
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,830
Goldie.

343
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,711
Have you been judgmental?

344
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,844
For the life of me,
I had not noticed.

345
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,164
I had not noticed.

346
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:58,971
Would you like to come in
for some mimosas?

347
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,717
I have some champagne...

348
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,143
in a bottle.

349
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:07,068
<i>Joy found some friends,</i>

350
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:10,107
<i>and I was reminded of the best benefit
of doing good things.</i>

351
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:15,155
<i>That having a clear conscience
helps you sleep through the night.</i>

352
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,954
<i>Yesterday, after lying about Karma,</i>

353
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,779
<i>I couldn't sleep a wink.</i>

354
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:21,576
<i>Now that I was guilt-free,</i>

355
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:23,801
<i>it was time to reap the rewards.</i>

356
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:39,512
- Good night, Jim.
- Randy, wait, wait.

357
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,941
I don't want to rush you, all right?

358
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,788
But we've been sharing
the same bed now for three nights,

359
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,563
and all we do is sleep.

360
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:52,775
- I want to do more.
- There's tons of fun things we can do.

361
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,986
Me and Earl used to do
some crazy stuff.

362
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:58,864
Really? Crazy stuff?
Like... like what?

363
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,951
Sometimes,
we'd get drunk and wrestle.

364
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:07,248
Okay, but we're...
we're going to need a safe word.

365
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:15,102
That's Earl! He came back!

366
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,700
Damn it, Jim.

367
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,373
When are you gonna learn
you're not a surgeon?

368
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,648
You just can't fix broken hearts.

369
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:29,356
Just promise me
you won't let him hurt you again.

370
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,484
