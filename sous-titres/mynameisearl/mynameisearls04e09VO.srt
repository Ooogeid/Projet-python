1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,258
<i>Living at the motel,</i>

2
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:07,427
<i>we've had our share
of annoying neighbors.</i>

3
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:09,888
Hello, neighbor folks.
Working hard or hardly working?

4
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:12,641
<i>Like this guy, most of them
drove me crazy and wouldn't shut up.</i>

5
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:15,390
Did I ever tell you about the time
my dog ate a whole bag

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,001
of Halloween candy?

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,762
I come home from work one day.

8
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,067
I walk in the door...
at least I think I was at work,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,568
but as it occurs to me,

10
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:26,780
it was a Sunday in October,
and I do not work on the Lord's day.

11
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,615
During football season!

12
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:29,776
The Lord's day!

13
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,660
Write that down.
That's a good one.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,703
Wait. It wasn't October.
It was February.

15
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:38,458
And it was a box of chocolates
I purchased for my sweetheart, Gertie.

16
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:39,535
I got to pee.

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,295
Cappy, talk real loud
so I don't miss anything, okay?

18
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:44,547
So, anyways Gertie was

19
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:46,613
from Bismarck.

20
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:48,085
<i>So, I was stuck.</i>

21
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:51,119
<i>But fortunately,
whenever I had a neighbor I didn't like,</i>

22
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:53,348
<i>Catalina would always find
a way to move him.</i>

23
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:55,063
So, I says to myself,

24
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,935
- "Cappy!"
- Excuse me, sir.

25
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:59,479
We just discovered
toxic mold in your room.

26
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:01,106
Oh, bummer.

27
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,733
We had toxic moles
in our old room.

28
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:07,570
They burrow in,
and they have turf horse with the rats.

29
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:10,658
I'll be moving you
to a great room in the East Wing.

30
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:12,946
When it's windy,
you can get HBO.

31
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:14,474
Keep in touch!

32
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,612
Or not.

33
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:18,915
SOLD A GUY A LEMON CAR

34
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,255
You want to tell me
why I just saw Cappy in the East Wing?

35
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,591
I don't know, Randy.
Something about toxic moles.

36
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,216
It wasn't toxic moles.

37
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,776
You got rid of him
like you do with all the cool neighbors.

38
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,682
Even that guy
with the illegal penguin.

39
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:37,243
That penguin was a jerk.

40
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:38,582
All day long.

41
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:43,940
Plus, he kept him in the ice machine,
I could taste it.

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,608
Well, I miss Cappy.

43
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,403
Trust me,
we're better off without him.

44
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,462
Can I help you?

45
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,241
What are you doing in my room?

46
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:10,049
Oh, you must be
in the room next door.

47
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,177
But my key opened this door.

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,946
That's 'cause the manager bought
all the locks in bulk at a swap meet.

49
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,268
They could also be opened
with a potato peeler

50
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:21,025
and those things that you use
to hold corn on the cob.

51
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,479
Welcome. I'm Earl.

52
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:33,252
Way to go, Earl.

53
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:36,201
I bet that guy's got
the least funny stories in the universe.

54
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,287
I don't want stories in a neighbor.
I want quiet in a neighbor.

55
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:43,728
Let's see how you like
quiet in a brother.

56
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:49,823
So, how do you like it?

57
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,167
Give me a few hours to find out.

58
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,521
You know who didn't
make noise at night? Cappy.

59
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:08,358
I'm sure the new guy just
doesn't realize how loud that is.

60
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,245
I'll go talk to him.

61
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:24,164
It's...

62
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,591
3:00 in the morning.

63
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,627
Just wondering
if you could keep it down.

64
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,078
I heard some noise in there.

65
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,270
Maybe you could...

66
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,398
not...

67
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:38,770
work...

68
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:40,139
so late?

69
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:42,809
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was sleeping.

70
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:51,591
- How'd it go?
- Pretty good.

71
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:54,627
He's actually a pretty nice guy
once you get to know him.

72
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:02,245
I'm sure he'll be done real soon.

73
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,832
- You miss Cappy, don't you?
- Yeah, I miss Cappy.

74
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,084
What is he doing in there anyway?

75
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:09,752
Look through the bullet hole.

76
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:11,379
You look through the bullet hole.

77
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,322
Why should I?
This is your fault.

78
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:15,842
If it'd been up to me,
we'd still have Cappy and not...

79
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:17,454
Not it!

80
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,971
Damn it,
why do I ways forget "not it?"

81
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:24,809
<i>Go look.</i>

82
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:37,363
What do you see?

83
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,130
It's sort of a big,
almond-shaped,

84
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:42,241
white thing with sort of a...

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,654
round, blue-greenish thing
in the middle.

86
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:47,338
It blinked.

87
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:50,375
It's an eye.

88
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,087
He's looking at us.

89
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,007
His name is Lloyd,
and, no, I am not moving that guy.

90
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,455
I saw him this morning, and he said
if I ever step foot in his room,

91
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,721
something bad will happen
to my pretty little face.

92
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,788
You should have him thrown out
of the motel for acting psycho.

93
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:07,097
Are you kidding?
If I can't go in his room,

94
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:09,505
I can't clean his room.
Plus, he thinks I'm pretty.

95
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,397
I hope he never checks out.

96
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:14,917
I guess if he's not moving,
we have to.

97
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,327
Then, somebody's got
to go pack our stuff,

98
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:19,027
and I think it should be you.

99
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,919
Number one,
because this is all your fault.

100
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,492
- Number two...
- Not it!

101
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:23,796
Damn it!

102
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:29,644
Hey, <i>dimkoff</i>.

103
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,373
That's German for dummy.

104
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,379
- Heard Colonel Klink say it to Hogan.
- What are you doing here?

105
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,870
Catching a fish
for Dodge's science project.

106
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:39,166
<i>It turned out there was a reason
Joy was excited</i>

107
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,177
<i>about this particular science fair.</i>

108
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:43,453
<i>Normally,
Joy didn't believe in science,</i>

109
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:46,975
<i>but she did believe in the $500 prize
and what it would buy her.</i>

110
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,633
<i>... A symbol of hope and love.</i>

111
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:50,482
<i>Because if your heart is open,</i>

112
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:52,230
<i>love will always find its way in.</i>

113
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,857
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

114
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:56,732
<i>Those diamonds got ahold of Joy,</i>

115
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,089
<i>and she couldn't stop thinking about
how to get her hands on that necklace.</i>

116
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:03,908
- Jane Seymour?
- Hello, Joy.

117
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,535
How'd you know my name?

118
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:07,704
I've been reading
your prescription bottles.

119
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:10,027
I have something for you.

120
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:16,421
- What the hell!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

121
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:19,465
You'll have to win the science fair
if you want to get the necklace.

122
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,957
But how, Jane Seymour?

123
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:24,105
I never understood science
or chemistry or biology.

124
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,321
You want to hear
something funny?

125
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:29,891
First time I used birth control pills,
I put them inside me.

126
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:32,353
We all change, Joy.

127
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:35,898
I mean, I started as a dancer,
and I evolved into an actress.

128
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:38,551
And then I evolved into an artist.

129
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,945
It's all about evolution.

130
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,081
Evolution.

131
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:46,784
Jane Seymour wants me
to disprove evolution.

132
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:50,062
It's not porn
if it's on regular TV.

133
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:53,079
Jane Seymour came to me in a dream
and told me how to win the science fair.

134
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,863
I'm going to prove
that evolution's a bunch of bull crap.

135
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,476
How are you going to do that?

136
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,802
I'm gonna fill this up with water
and put a fish in it,

137
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:05,140
but its food is gonna be on this rock.
When the fish gets hungry,

138
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:07,391
he's gonna have to grow legs
and walk up here to eat.

139
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,058
If he doesn't,
that proves there's no evolution.

140
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:15,980
Tampon, condom, pacifier...

141
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,407
fish!

142
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,354
Kind of small, don't you think?

143
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,490
Maybe for eating,
but not for science.

144
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:32,195
Y'all got homeless
coming through here now?

145
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:35,291
That's why I tell Darnell to break
bottles before to throw them away.

146
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:38,454
Word gets out,
they'll stop pawing through your trash.

147
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,018
Hold the phone!

148
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,176
I know that guy!

149
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:47,310
<i>I was surprised that Joy knew Lloyd,</i>

150
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,884
<i>but I was even more surprised
to find out that</i>

151
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,843
<i>in a way, I knew him, too.</i>

152
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:54,227
<i>Shortly after me and Joy
got married,</i>

153
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:57,489
<i>I realized I couldn't just rely
on stealing to support a new wife</i>

154
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,474
<i>and someone else's unborn baby.</i>

155
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,006
<i>So, I tried my hand
in the auto industry.</i>

156
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:05,530
<i>For 50 bucks,
I'd haul away your old junker.</i>

157
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:14,918
<i>Then I took the 50 and gave it
a hillbilly tune up to get it running.</i>

158
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,009
I stapled the seatbelts
back together,

159
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,829
painted over the check engine light,

160
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,049
and I wrote "airbag"
on the steering wheel in Sharpie.

161
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:27,249
That should raise the price.

162
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,988
<i>As soon as we found a nice house
that was vacant during the day,</i>

163
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:34,350
- <i>the car was ready to sell.</i>
- So, why are you selling it?

164
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,477
We're buying a minivan.

165
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:37,932
I know, barf.

166
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:41,149
Next thing you know, I'm gonna be
playing soccer like all the other moms.

167
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,864
I'm going
on a cross country trip and...

168
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:47,822
I've never bought a car before.
I don't even know what questions to ask.

169
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:49,228
I hear you.

170
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:51,367
Lord knows I'm no car salesman.

171
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,618
Tell you what.

172
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:56,024
Just give me the 900 bucks,
drive it around for a couple days.

173
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,332
If you don't like it,
come get your money back.

174
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:01,169
You know where we live.
It's not like we're going anywhere.

175
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:03,792
That sounds fair.

176
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:07,842
Let's do it!

177
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,510
I'm buying a car!

178
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:11,282
You're buying a car.

179
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,472
He looked so nice and sweet
when we ripped him off.

180
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:19,854
Now he looks like that guy
who used to collect road kill

181
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:22,127
to make those creepy
nativity scenes.

182
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:25,116
Anyway,
I'd stay away from him if I were you.

183
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,320
I can't now.

184
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,097
He's on my list.

185
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:33,174
<i>I had a lot of experience
telling psychos I screwed them over,</i>

186
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:35,703
<i>but this guy was the psychoest.</i>
Hey, there, buddy.

187
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:37,872
I'm not your buddy.

188
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,125
Fair enough.

189
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:43,794
Listen,
I just heard the craziest story.

190
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:47,227
It's not the one about the dog
eating the candies, is it?

191
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,896
'Cause I already walked away
from that story once.

192
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:53,471
Listen. It's...
It's about the lemon car I sold you.

193
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:58,349
<i>I told him I was the one
who sold him that lemon car</i>

194
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:00,744
<i>and all about my list and Karma.</i>

195
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,560
<i>Then I waited
for the crazy to come out.</i>

196
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,970
<i>But it didn't.</i>

197
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,444
You don't owe me anything.

198
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:10,313
You showed me the way
of the world.

199
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:13,615
<i>That's when Lloyd told me
the rest of what happened.</i>

200
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,672
<i>Lloyd packed his bags and headed off
on a cross-country trip.</i>

201
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:20,569
<i>It took me four days
to hitchhike from Saginaw</i>

202
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:24,032
<i>I've gone to look for Ame...</i>

203
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,128
<i>... rica...</i>

204
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:32,720
<i>But the car we sold him
wasn't even up for a cross Camden trip.</i>

205
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,055
<i>All gone look for Ame...</i>

206
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,357
<i>... rica.</i>

207
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:42,539
<i>Lloyd was happy Joy gave him
that money-back guarantee,</i>

208
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:45,873
<i>until he found out the house
really belonged to the Yangs.</i>

209
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:46,998
Damn.

210
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,856
Damn, damn, damn!

211
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:53,539
<i>He gave that car a hillbilly
tune-up of his own</i>

212
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:55,394
<i>and passed it on
to the next sucker.</i>

213
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,295
Why is it shaking?

214
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,369
That's not the car,
that's you.

215
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,251
Well, why... why is smoke
coming out from under the hood?

216
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:09,462
Oh, that's the steam feature.
Keeps the engine clean.

217
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:10,758
Fancy.

218
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:13,153
I'll take it.

219
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:17,590
Finally, I'll have one nice thing
before I die.

220
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:20,191
I feel terrible.

221
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:23,068
I'd really like to make up
for what I did.

222
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:25,651
Why?
You opened my eyes.

223
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:28,231
You taught me
that people are scum.

224
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,943
But I won't have to worry
about the scum of the Earth much longer.

225
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,918
That's kind of a weird thing to say.

226
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:37,806
- No offense.
- Oh, no, that's okay.

227
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:41,255
'Cause soon, I'm gonna have
all my materials.

228
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:44,372
And I won't have to worry
about people offending me.

229
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:48,543
See, there you go again.

230
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,036
You're the one
from the eye hole.

231
00:11:58,438 --> 00:11:59,438
Stay tuned.

232
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:05,001
I think I created a terrorist.

233
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,316
I really think this guy
is gonna blow something up.

234
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,194
- What do we do?
- You're asking me?

235
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,405
Oh, God, this is
really bad, isn't it?

236
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,314
- I don't know, maybe call the cops?
- No, that won't help.

237
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,508
They'll lock him up

238
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,745
and let him back out
even more angry at the world.

239
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,208
We could chop his hands off
so at least he can't light fuses.

240
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:30,795
You put me in charge,
and now you shoot down all my ideas?

241
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:32,879
We're not chopping off
Lloyd's hands.

242
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,881
My hands?

243
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,134
Oh, that...
that different Lloyd.

244
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,909
Uh, I've got a cousin...

245
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,467
named Lloyd who has...

246
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,433
uh, hand cancer.

247
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:46,716
Listen, Lloyd,

248
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:50,320
I feel responsible for you thinking
everybody is scum.

249
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:52,690
And I believe
I already thanked you.

250
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:54,789
I don't want to be thanked.

251
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:58,105
I just want to make it up to you
so that you're not so...

252
00:12:58,782 --> 00:12:59,782
negative.

253
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,608
Show me somebody
who isn't negative.

254
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:04,393
Katie Couric.

255
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:07,256
Look...

256
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,916
not everybody is scum.

257
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:11,503
Think about it.

258
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,631
People are only good
till they get screwed over.

259
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:15,880
You screwed me.

260
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:19,134
I screwed the next person,
and I'm sure they screwed somebody else,

261
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:22,025
and it just kept
going down the line.

262
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:26,558
But what if it didn't?

263
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:28,739
What if somebody,

264
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:31,941
broke the chain
and was honest about the car?

265
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:32,981
Impossible.

266
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:35,984
- You don't know that.
- How much you want to bet?

267
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,106
I'll bet you $500.

268
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:43,003
I'm kind of on a fixed income
right now and, uh...

269
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:44,689
it's all going to my project.

270
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:46,161
Look, how about this?

271
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:48,941
If one of those people
was honest and...

272
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,116
and didn't screw
somebody else,

273
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,461
will you give your
fellow man another chance?

274
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,376
<i>The next day, Joy saw something
that undid years of Sunday school.</i>

275
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:05,347
Sweet Jesus, the fish grew feet.

276
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,057
What does that mean, Mommy?

277
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:10,563
I think it means we don't got
to go to church no more.

278
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:14,269
Baby, that's a tadpole.

279
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:17,066
All you proved is that tadpoles
turn into frogs.

280
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:20,028
- Do people already know that?
- Yes, Joy.

281
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,447
That would fall under the heading,
"common knowledge".

282
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:23,665
Damn.

283
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:26,993
Now I'm not gonna get my hand-designed
Jane Seymour Open Hearts necklace.

284
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:28,574
Stupid fish frog.

285
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,814
Hello, my name's Darnell.

286
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,566
I'm gonna call you Mr. Frog.

287
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:40,216
<i>I didn't want Lloyd
to blow anything up,</i>

288
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:43,201
<i>so I made him take me to
the little old lady he sold the car to.</i>

289
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:46,180
Of course I remember
that shaky car.

290
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,267
I wasted $1,000 getting tested
for Parkinson's.

291
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,817
I don't suppose
you still have the car, do you?

292
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:53,854
<i>She didn't.</i>

293
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:55,855
<i>She spruced it up
with a racing stripe</i>

294
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:57,941
<i>and sold it to a guy
who was new to town.</i>

295
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:01,123
That sneaky little bitch
ripped me off,

296
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:04,098
with her face like a wrinkled yam
and her lies.

297
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:06,062
What she did was wrong.

298
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:07,437
Evil and wrong.

299
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:11,315
- What did you do with the car?
- I sold it to the next sucker.

300
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,090
Hey, welcome to America.

301
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:17,216
<i>And Escobar gave the car
something he called a Nairobi tune-up</i>

302
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:18,754
<i>and sold it to a hillbilly.</i>

303
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,682
I wrote "turbo" on the side

304
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:23,309
and sold it to a black fella
named Pookie Johnson.

305
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,552
I remember 'cause
my mom's name is Pookie.

306
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,178
Hey, is that a three-position switch
with a built-in timer?

307
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,650
- Can I buy it?
- Don't do it, don't do it.

308
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:33,393
I think he's building a bomb.

309
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:34,972
We've already established

310
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:37,212
that scruples are not
a big part of my nature.

311
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,991
<i>I wasn't getting closer
to finding an honest man,</i>

312
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,868
<i>but Lloyd seemed to be getting
closer to finishing his bomb,</i>

313
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:45,363
<i>so I had to get creative.</i>

314
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,591
Yeah, it conked out
in the Chubby Burger drive-through line.

315
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:51,954
That's when I said to myself,

316
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:55,457
"Pookie James Johnson,
you have been hoodwinked."

317
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,792
What did you do then,
Pookie James?

318
00:15:58,227 --> 00:16:01,034
I melted it down and made
a jungle gym for orphans.

319
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:03,400
Only wish I could have melted
something down

320
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:05,884
to make those kids
some moms and dads.

321
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,902
Well, we do what we can.

322
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,389
You really did that?

323
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,266
Orphans?

324
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:16,099
That's impressive.

325
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:20,465
<i>I knew I wasn't exactly honest
with Lloyd, but...</i>

326
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,296
<i>it seems it's okay
to bend the rules</i>

327
00:16:22,421 --> 00:16:24,310
<i>when it comes to dealing
with terrorists,</i>

328
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:26,451
<i>so I figured Karma
wouldn't mind.</i>

329
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:28,537
<i>Apparently, I figured wrong.</i>

330
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:36,246
People are scum!

331
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,790
You're scum

332
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:40,615
for lying to me, and I'm not
putting up with it anymore.

333
00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:44,589
Lloyd, wait.
You're not even on my insurance.

334
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,758
Really?
You had to drive by right now?

335
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:01,704
<i>I hadn't done much running
since I gave up stealing,</i>

336
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,432
<i>so I was a little out of shape.</i>

337
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,372
<i>But it's amazing
how fast you can move</i>

338
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:07,612
<i>when the fate of half a county
is in your hands.</i>

339
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:10,332
Stop!

340
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:15,897
I know there's
some bad people out there,

341
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,747
but there's some good people, too,

342
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:20,124
and neither one deserves
to be blown up.

343
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:22,244
Lloyd, open up!

344
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:27,295
Please don't set off the bomb.

345
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,718
- What bomb?
- That bomb right there.

346
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:32,601
It's not a bomb.

347
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,260
It's my rocket ship.

348
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:38,643
What makes you think
I was building a bomb?

349
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:41,352
I don't know, uh,
all the talk about...

350
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:44,232
how you wouldn't have to put up
with the scum of the Earth anymore.

351
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,628
Yeah... 'cause I'm launching
myself into outer space

352
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:49,433
in my man made rocket ship.

353
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:52,377
Bomb?

354
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:54,575
What do you think,
I'm crazy?

355
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:56,953
I don't know
how to answer that.

356
00:17:57,114 --> 00:17:58,315
Wait a minute.

357
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:03,797
You actually thought
I was gonna set off a bomb.

358
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:06,629
You ran toward the danger.

359
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:10,842
I wondered about that myself
a few times while I was running.

360
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:13,845
I mean, you could have run
to safety.

361
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,273
Instead, you risked
your own life to...

362
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,039
to save other people?

363
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:24,487
Hey, you build rockets,
I run towards bombs.

364
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:27,567
Let's just agree we're both
a little crazy, okay?

365
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,631
That was completely unselfish.

366
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:35,158
You are a good person.

367
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:39,235
I guess that means
everybody isn't scum.

368
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:45,992
Congratulations.

369
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:50,181
I think you won your bet.

370
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:54,887
<i>It wasn't how I planned
on doing it,</i>

371
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:58,102
<i>but I helped Lloyd regain his faith
that people can be good.</i>

372
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:06,778
<i>Years ago, Lloyd thought
I had opened his eyes</i>

373
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:08,323
<i>to all the bad in the world,</i>

374
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,400
<i>but really,
I did something worse.</i>

375
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,709
<i>I made him close his eyes
to all the good.</i>

376
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,174
<i>Both are all around.</i>

377
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,532
<i>You just have to decide
which one to focus on.</i>

378
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,515
<i>And just like Lloyd,</i>

379
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,537
<i>I realized I was only seeing the bad
in people around me,</i>

380
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:24,165
<i>when I needed to be like Randy
and see the good.</i>

381
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:28,200
What are you guys
talking about?

382
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,929
Cappy's telling us
about going to bingo night.

383
00:19:31,054 --> 00:19:32,674
He almost had all the I's.

384
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,739
And then, he almost
had all the corners,

385
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:36,614
but then, someone else
called bingo,

386
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:39,432
so on the next game,
he started out with B-3.

387
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,265
- B... B-7.
- B-7, I meant.

388
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:43,990
Hold on, I want to come down
and hear all about it.

389
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:50,257
<i>Now that Lloyd could see
the good in the world,</i>

390
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:53,486
<i>he finally took that cross-country trip
to see more of it.</i>

391
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:00,907
<i>And it turns out</i>

392
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,313
<i> all the work he did on his rocket
didn't go to waste.</i>

393
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:05,832
That's right, my son's
a scientifical genius.

394
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,701
That's why he won...

395
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,627
What the hell is this?

396
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,134
A savings bond, Joy,
in Dodge's name.

397
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,465
I figured if I told you,
you wouldn't go through with it

398
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,010
and Dodge wouldn't have
this unearned feeling of success.

399
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:20,106
- What about my feelings?
- I thought about that, too.

400
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:24,714
Oh, my God,

401
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:28,052
it's a Kay Jewelers Jane Seymour
Open Hearts necklace.

402
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,392
Do you know how those diamonds
were formed?

403
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,778
Millions of years ago,
there were dinosaurs who died,

404
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,269
and the carbon in their bodies
was compressed...

405
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:40,652
Darnell, don't be a turd
in the sandbox.

406
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:44,875
