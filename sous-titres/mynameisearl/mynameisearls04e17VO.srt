1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,444
<i>You know the kind of guy
who does nothing but bad things,</i>

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,211
<i>and then wonders why his life sucks?</i>

3
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:05,463
<i>That was me.</i>

4
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,548
<i>Every time something good
happened to me,</i>

5
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,759
<i>something bad was waiting
around the corner.</i>

6
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,248
<i>But then while I was laid up,</i>

7
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:14,847
<i>I learned about a thing called Karma
from watching Carson Daly.</i>

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,473
<i>So, I made a list
of all the rotten things I've done,</i>

9
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>and one by one,
I'm gonna make up for 'em.</i>

10
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,854
<i>I'm just trying
to be a better person.</i>

11
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,398
RANDY'S LIST ITEM

12
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,513
<i>After Joy, Darnell and the boys
were snatched</i>

13
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:29,445
<i>by the Witness Protection Program,</i>

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,635
<i>we took advantage of the free rent,
and moved back to the trailer.</i>

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,659
I think
we should have left the plastic.

16
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:38,496
So we wouldn't have to get up to go pee.
Like Mom and Dad did with my bed.

17
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,367
They put that plastic on
because you peed the bed,

18
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:43,084
not so you could pee the bed.

19
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,503
Chicken and the egg, Earl.

20
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:48,563
Your mail was finally released
from police evidence,

21
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:51,375
but they still haven't caught
that mailbox sniper.

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,136
It's one of the girls
at Club Chubby.

23
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,875
"Happy Presidents' Day,

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,224
"and congrats again
on freeing the slaves."

25
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,363
It's from our Great Aunt Leela.

26
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:03,242
Ten years ago, she started thinking
Randy was Abe Lincoln.

27
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,405
Now she sends him a gift
every Presidents' Day.

28
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,149
Awesome! A Lotto ticket!

29
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,878
Scratchers are fun,
'cause even if you don't win anything,

30
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,863
you still get to eat
all the silver candy you scratched off.

31
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:24,583
I won!

32
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm rich!

33
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,058
Are you okay?

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,103
Karma hit me, Earl. Just like you.

35
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:47,397
I never should have scratched
that ticket.

36
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:55,242
I'll be damned.

37
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,318
<i>While Karma was turning
Randy's life upside down,</i>

38
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:01,316
<i>the FBI was doing
the same thing to Joy and Darnell.</i>

39
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,604
Where the hell are you taking us?

40
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,793
Thanks to your little stunt,
on <i>Estrada or Nada</i>,

41
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,170
we are now forced
to terminate your identies.

42
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,672
You're no longer
Phyllis and Marty Rosenstein.

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,259
And we're no longer taking you
to Cincinnati's Little Israel district.

44
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:16,595
Thank God!

45
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:19,263
The thought of cooking
my first Passover Seder

46
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,462
was giving me
all kinds of Shpilkiss.

47
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:23,837
By the way, I'm big into slow jams.

48
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,736
Getting chickward
just listening to 'em.

49
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:28,564
Baby, this is serious business.

50
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,132
We're sorry for causing you
inconvenience and whatnot,

51
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:35,071
but my grateful wife and I are happy
to do or be whatever you say. Right?

52
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,282
I have told you.
I want my name to be Goldie Crystal.

53
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,356
I want to live somewhere
with skyscrapers and Cosmopolitans

54
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:44,747
and gay men who are your best friends.
What is so hard about that?

55
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:48,482
Welcome to New York.

56
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:52,588
This place is a dump.
Goldie Crystal wouldn't live here.

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,258
She doesn't. Your new name's are
Lorba and Wilma Grunelbutt.

58
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,219
It's not that bad.

59
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:17,706
There's an unexpected perk.
Whenever the train comes through,

60
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,731
we can lay on the floor
and get a free massage.

61
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,830
We're gonna be so relaxed!

62
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:27,647
<i>While Joy was upset
about her new life,</i>

63
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,822
<i>Randy was excited to start his.</i>

64
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:33,562
To make you feel better,

65
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:35,116
I made some Space Beer.

66
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,424
Just don't chug it.
I used the last of the Tang.

67
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:40,605
No time for Space Beer!
I'm watching Carson Daly

68
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,680
so he can tell me
what Karma wants me to do.

69
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,516
<i>So, this whole thing is crazy
with the celebrity baby pictures...</i>

70
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,747
Did I do something to a celebrity?

71
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:49,943
Or babies? Or a picture?

72
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,263
<i>The money is gigantic...</i>

73
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:54,293
I've done stuff to pictures.

74
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,599
- Bad stuff.
- Okay, this is nuts.

75
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:59,954
Not everything Carson Daly says
is a message from Karma.

76
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,324
Or if it is, it's probably not for you.
It's for me.

77
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,076
So you own Karma?

78
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:07,253
Carson Daly is
on national television.

79
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:09,221
He's talking to hundreds of people,

80
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,823
and one of them's me,
except when I'm being interrupted.

81
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:14,258
<i>... controversial comedians
working today, as well.</i>

82
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:15,462
<i>Andrew Dice Clay.</i>

83
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:17,794
Dice Clay! That's the list item.

84
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,842
I told you Karma was talking to me.

85
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:27,057
This is where I kept stuff
when we lived here.

86
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:29,129
For a while,
it's where I hid dollar bills,

87
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:31,396
until someone found out
and started replacing them

88
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,064
with little green balls of goo.

89
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,651
It's your Andrew Dice Clay
belt buckle.

90
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,868
What the hell?
I thought that guy Zeke stole this.

91
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:44,433
<i>A few years back, when me and
Randy first lived in the trailer park,</i>

92
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:47,454
<i>and were looking for beer money
in our secret hiding place,</i>

93
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,679
<i>we got some new neighbors,
Zeke and Arlo Cavanaugh.</i>

94
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,378
Welcome to our new home,
little brother.

95
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,796
Hi, neighbor.

96
00:04:58,369 --> 00:04:59,569
Nice mustache.

97
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,050
Are you Burt Reynolds' cousin?

98
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,167
You should be.

99
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,005
<i>I liked Zeke right from the start.</i>

100
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:10,254
<i>And he didn't just have
good taste in mustaches.</i>

101
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,297
<i>He also loved doing crazy things
for free T-shirts</i>

102
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:17,348
<i>like the ones they gave for drinking
a glass of Fry-o-Fat at the Crab Shack.</i>

103
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:20,913
Drink! Drink! Drink!

104
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:28,953
Onion ring.

105
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,747
<i>And pretty soon,
me and Zeke were best friends.</i>

106
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,364
They're giving away

107
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,763
I Took A Punch From Yukon Jack
T-shirts down at the gas station.

108
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:39,259
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

109
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,404
- Wait. Let me get Joy's camera.
- All right, let's go, buddy.

110
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,085
I've always wanted
a picture of me getting punched.

111
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,763
But you don't usually know
when it's gonna happen.

112
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:53,769
<i>I didn't realize it at the time,
but Randy was getting jealous.</i>

113
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,483
<i>So, he came up with a plan
to break up the friendship.</i>

114
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,070
<i>A plan that was brilliant,</i>

115
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:07,995
<i>complicated and elaborate.</i>

116
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:10,039
<i>At least for Randy.</i>

117
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,454
<i>He knew Zeke chewed tobacco,</i>

118
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,301
<i>but he just didn't quite know
how to do it himself.</i>

119
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,790
<i>And by the next morning,
the trap was set.</i>

120
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,419
What the hell?!

121
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,841
Randy, wake up.

122
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:25,541
What'd they steal?

123
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,929
Someone broke in and stole
my Andrew Dice Clay belt buckle.

124
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:32,901
Look,
somebody spit tobacco everywhere

125
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,726
and threw it up
down the front of my shirt.

126
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,483
You know who's going to be really upset
about that belt buckle being gone...

127
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,358
Zeke.

128
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:45,698
He would chew tobacco
and stare at that belt buckle for hours.

129
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,340
<i>And that night, I was so mad at Zeke,
I decided to get back at him</i>

130
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,437
<i>by destroying the memories
we made together,</i>

131
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:04,612
<i>and burned his favorite shirts.</i>

132
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:11,347
Now I have to add
Zeke Cavanaugh to my list.

133
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:15,016
The worst part is,
I have no idea how to spell his name.

134
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,310
But it was my fault.

135
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:19,109
You never would have burned those shirts
if I hadn't tricked you

136
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:21,273
by stealing your belt buckle
and stuff.

137
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,893
We both did him wrong.
We should put him on both our lists.

138
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:25,819
Awesome.

139
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,002
We both got lists,
we both get to cross the same guy off,

140
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:31,658
we both got
that Jay Leno gray patch on our pubes.

141
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,828
Sometimes
it's just plain good to be a Hickey.

142
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:41,904
<i>Me and Randy were making up
for the same guy on our list,</i>

143
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,729
<i>and since this was Randy's first time,
I let him take the lead.</i>

144
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,927
My name is Randy.

145
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,653
His name is Earl.

146
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:53,628
We are here to cornflake...

147
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,783
It's a cornflake.

148
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,933
<i>Eventually Randy explain
about our lists,</i>

149
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,708
<i>and Zeke invited us in.</i>

150
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:07,409
Man, I loved those shirts.

151
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:10,364
You and me did some cool stuff together
to get those shirts.

152
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,242
Saw <i>Quiet Riot</i>
in concert at the mall.

153
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,119
Signed up for an credit card.

154
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,290
Sang "I Got You, Babe"
at the Crab Shack

155
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,124
on guys-sing-romantic-songs-
to-each-other karaoke night.

156
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:23,569
The worst thing that happened
wasn't losing all my shirts.

157
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:25,944
It was that we stopped hanging out.

158
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:28,590
Oh, my God,
that's my real list item.

159
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:31,875
I need to get you two
to hang out like you used to.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,138
You should go win
those shirts again,

161
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,933
and then I'll cross you off my list
and make that face like you do.

162
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:41,852
- What do you say, Zeke?
- I'm in.

163
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:45,231
I get my cholesterol tested next week.
And if I drink a glass of fryer fat,

164
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:46,733
my doctor will freak.

165
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,115
Let's see Mr. Harvard
try to figure that one out.

166
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:53,913
How's it going?

167
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:56,285
I'm watching my scabs-
that-look-like-people collection.

168
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,411
Hell, yes.

169
00:08:57,994 --> 00:08:59,371
Too bad you can't.

170
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:02,541
Which sucks for you,
'cause I just picked off a Pam Anderson.

171
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,879
Then I guess I won't be showing you
my mole that looks like Susan Sarandon.

172
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,674
<i>While Randy was stuck with Arlo,</i>

173
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:14,042
<i>Joy, Darnell and the boys
were stuck somewhere worse.</i>

174
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:18,307
Mommy, which side of the sink
is the toilet again?

175
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:19,766
Left.

176
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,103
<i>And it didn't help that their place
was directly above a dry cleaner.</i>

177
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:32,154
Take a break already, Lee Ying!
We're dying up here!

178
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,989
Baby, I know it's hot,

179
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,238
but on the bright side,
my tank top is virtually wrinkle-free,

180
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:39,463
and your pores look fantastic.

181
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:40,606
That's it...

182
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:42,289
I can't take it anymore.

183
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,187
- Listen up, New York!
- What are you doing?

184
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:47,701
Playing a hunch.

185
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:50,281
- My real name is Joy Turner.
- Baby, no!

186
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:54,186
My husband is Darnell Turner,
aka Harry Monroe.

187
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:55,719
We're in the witness...

188
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,144
... protection.

189
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,851
Damn it! You blew your cover!

190
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:06,188
- We'll have to relocate you again.
- Good.

191
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,232
How'd y'all get here so fast?

192
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:10,609
We keep a close eye on things
the first week.

193
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:12,791
- How close?
- Close enough to know

194
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,790
you're wearing the same thong
as yesterday.

195
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,448
Just turned inside out.

196
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,782
<i>So me and Zeke set out
to restart our friendship...</i>

197
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:22,911
<i>and replacing his trophy T-shirts</i>

198
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:24,854
<i>turned out
to be just the way to do it.</i>

199
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:25,979
Shrimp.

200
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:30,379
<i>And lucky for us,
Yukon Jack was out on parole</i>

201
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,004
<i>and back in the punching people
for T-shirts business.</i>

202
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,326
<i>We even entered the</i>

203
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:37,302
<i>"I sang a romantic duet
with a dude" challenge</i>

204
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,339
<i>at the Crab Shack, and I got to say</i>

205
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,470
<i>we pretty much crushed it.</i>

206
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,214
A lumberjack camp?
Really?

207
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,253
Remember the accents, eh?

208
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:04,335
I know you don't like
being punished,

209
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,040
but if you think you can play dirty,
the FBI can play dirtier.

210
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:09,474
Trust me, we should quit
while we're ahead.

211
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:11,549
Ahead?

212
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:14,103
We live in a pop-up camper
with four Canadian dudes

213
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:17,205
who don't help us with the chores
'cause they're all missing fingers.

214
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,927
I'm sick of cutting their steaks.

215
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,764
Oh, no, I'm begging you,
don't do this.

216
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,641
Listen up, you human beavers.

217
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,183
My black husband's name

218
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:29,187
is not Lars Nordvich.

219
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,891
I know, mindblower.

220
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,735
His name is Harry Monroe

221
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:36,850
and I'm Joy Turner.

222
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,525
All right, let's go.

223
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:40,182
Oh, thank God.

224
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:48,582
- Which shirt are you getting today?
- "I climbed the Camden landfill."

225
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,626
It's gonna take a little while
'cause it's 60 feet higher now.

226
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,040
But a lot of that's from
the stair factory that collapsed,

227
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:55,797
so the last part could be easier.

228
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:57,346
Well, have fun.

229
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:02,599
<i>That's when Randy realized
me and Zeke were friends again,</i>

230
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:05,166
<i>and he could finally cross Zeke
off his arm.</i>

231
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,783
<i>Well, almost cross him off.</i>

232
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,354
Arlo, what'd you do that for?

233
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:14,608
Zeke'll think Earl burned his shirts
and I can get my brother back.

234
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:17,217
I'm sure that sounded like
a good plan in the beginning,

235
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:18,601
I've had lots of those.

236
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:21,036
Like when I tried to breed
wiener dogs with cats

237
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:22,334
to make wiener cats.

238
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,352
But you don't get long, skinny cats.

239
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,371
You get one dead cat and a dog
with lots of scratches.

240
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,375
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is:
your plan is worse than that one.

241
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,338
I wouldn't even need a bad plan
if it wasn't for you.

242
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:40,308
You're the one who got Earl and Zeke
back together again, and now I'm just...

243
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:42,969
alone and miserable.

244
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,889
Wait, I get it.

245
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:47,891
Oh, you Karma.

246
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,110
You got me.

247
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:51,289
This always happens to Earl.

248
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:53,288
He handles one problem
only to discover

249
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,649
that another problem is
the real list item.

250
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,359
I should have known.

251
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,612
The neediest, most annoying guys
are always the real list items.

252
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,959
<i>Randy knew that his list item
had gotten more complicated.</i>

253
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,645
<i>He just didn't know how to solve it.</i>

254
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:13,269
We both had three beers each.

255
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,707
We should be able
to finally think now.

256
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:17,671
What could Karma want me
to do for you?

257
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,709
Do you know you have a scar that looks
just like Pamela Anderson?

258
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:22,676
I'm gonna go get my camera.

259
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:25,019
I understand you being jealous.

260
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:26,897
I used to get jealous, too.

261
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:30,334
It's hard when your brother makes
a friend, stops spending time with you.

262
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,726
To be truthful,

263
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,312
Zeke has never spent
that much time with me,

264
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,506
except when Mom locked us
in the closet

265
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:38,200
so she could go out to drink,

266
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,865
but I wish we were
more like you and Earl.

267
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,529
Earl loves to hang out with you.

268
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,049
He didn't always like
hanging out with me.

269
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:48,744
It was only four years ago that
we started sleeping in the same bed.

270
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:50,412
We had to work up to it.

271
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,748
I had to become the best
little brother ever.

272
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,636
I think I'm a pretty good
little brother.

273
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:58,174
Excuse me, but you're annoying
and boring and you smell like onions.

274
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,839
Don't get me wrong, I like onions,
but a lot of people don't.

275
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:04,501
But now at least
I know how I can help you.

276
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,251
<i>Big brothers like to think
they're the funny ones,</i>

277
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,805
<i>so it's important
to laugh at all their jokes...</i>

278
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,104
What happens when two snails
get into a fight?

279
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,374
They slug it out.

280
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:22,610
Slug it out. That's a good one.

281
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,985
<i>... no matter how unfunny they are.</i>

282
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:28,117
<i>And it's important to take care
of your big brother</i>

283
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,861
<i>when he doesn't groom himself.</i>

284
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,299
<i>And you need to put yourself
in situations</i>

285
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,373
<i>where your big brother
can be the hero.</i>

286
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,110
Nice dumper, baby girl.

287
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,674
What the hell did you say?

288
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:44,285
I thought this dude was a lady

289
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,426
on account of his girly butt,
and now I'm in danger.

290
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:47,928
Tough guy, huh?

291
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,112
Now, if you mess with Randy here,

292
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:53,087
I'm gonna tell you
what's gonna happen to you.

293
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:01,444
So back off, and P.S.,
your butt wasn't that good anyway.

294
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:05,031
That's all you got to do,

295
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,171
pick up the slack
on your little-brother duties.

296
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:10,408
You're right.
Help me practice my fake laugh.

297
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,625
Here's what I've got right now.

298
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,134
No, no, God, no.

299
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,199
You got to start with surprise

300
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:22,617
and then let it chuckle itself out.

301
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,816
<i>So while Randy had taught Arlo
some lessons about being a brother,</i>

302
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,193
<i>the FBI were about to teach Joy</i>

303
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,292
<i>some lessons
about opening her mouth.</i>

304
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:49,980
So... we're Eskis now?

305
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:53,042
Actually, your people prefer
to be called Inuits.

306
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,544
Go ahead, try to out
yourself in this place.

307
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,832
I'm sure the caribou
would be most intrigued.

308
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:01,293
And, uh, stay warm.

309
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,630
Oh, my God.

310
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,924
<i>The FBI might've been better
at playing dirty,</i>

311
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,564
<i>but there was one thing
Joy was better at than anyone:</i>

312
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,513
<i>knowing how to have an affair</i>

313
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,600
<i>and recognizing the clues of an affair
when she saw one.</i>

314
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,100
<i>She knew if Luther Vandross
was a-rockin',</i>

315
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,562
<i>you don't come a-knockin'.</i>

316
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,665
<i>And how easy it is
to lose an earring</i>

317
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,899
<i>when your own knee
keeps banging against it.</i>

318
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,040
<i>And how your necktie
can get a little crooked</i>

319
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:28,987
<i>when you use it
to tie a woman to a bedpost.</i>

320
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:31,823
You and Agent Scoley
have been boning.

321
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:33,700
Talk about the X Files.

322
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,069
More like Triple-X Files.
Kablam!

323
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,790
Are we gonna figure out
a new place for me to live,

324
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,915
or do we need to involve
supervisors and spouses?

325
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,915
Were you thinking of something
in split-level or ranch-style?

326
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:48,798
<i>And just like that,</i>

327
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,941
<i>Joy had blackmailed the FBI
into making her dreams come true.</i>

328
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,216
Palm trees...

329
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:55,936
real grass...

330
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,643
and you can't hear
the sizzle of power lines.

331
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,427
Goldie Crystal is finally home.

332
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,900
<i>Things were falling into place
for Joy and her family, but...</i>

333
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,160
<i>things were falling apart
back at the trailer park.</i>

334
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,036
Wasn't Randy.
He knows he can't play

335
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:12,847
with matches unless I'm home.

336
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:14,741
Well, then, who was it, then?

337
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:17,118
I did it. It was me.

338
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,371
But you said
you weren't jealous anymore.

339
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,921
I'm not jealous.

340
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:23,625
I'm just sick of having to hang around
with this loser,

341
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,044
B.O. factory, three-balled jackass

342
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,046
from the state of Douche-achusetts.

343
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,464
That's not even a state.

344
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,372
Shut up!
This is your chance.

345
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:33,716
Be the little brother
that needs protecting.

346
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:35,748
What are you gonna do? Cry?

347
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:38,098
Or run home and smell your own B.O.?

348
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,433
Hey, come on! Leave me alone!

349
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:43,826
Leave him alone!

350
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,481
Leave my brother alone.

351
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:49,158
You're the one who's acting
like you're from Douche-achusetts!

352
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:52,904
Well, you're acting
like the mayor of Ass-ylvania!

353
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:55,773
You're gonna stick up for him
after he burned my shirts?

354
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,692
What about your precious list?

355
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:00,033
If I have to choose
between a list and my brother,

356
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:01,955
my brother's gonna win every time.

357
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:05,854
Well, if I got to choose
between a friend and my brother,

358
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:07,919
then my brother's
gonna win every time!

359
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:09,423
Come on, Arlo!

360
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:14,134
<i>I actually didn't mind
seeing Zeke leave for Arlo,</i>

361
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,761
<i>'cause I'm the one
that pushed them together.</i>

362
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:19,034
You know, next time
we should bring Randy and Arlo.

363
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,119
I want to see them take
a shot at "Endless Love."

364
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:23,035
Yeah, I don't know.

365
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,393
Arlo and I don't really
hang out that much.

366
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,204
We just don't click
like you and Randy.

367
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:29,482
You guys are like
Venus and Serena Williams.

368
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,492
No. I know one of those is a planet,

369
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:35,738
but I don't know
who that other dude is.

370
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:38,969
Anyway, two brothers clicking
doesn't just happen.

371
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:42,362
If you want a good little brother,
you got to be a good big brother.

372
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,105
<i>I explained to Zeke
that little brothers like jokes,</i>

373
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,433
<i>so I make sure I always have
lots of good ones to tell Randy.</i>

374
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,732
What happens when two snails
get into a fight?

375
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,135
They slug it out.

376
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:03,406
<i>You also need to make
little brothers feel important.</i>

377
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,708
<i>Act like you need
their help with stuff.</i>

378
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,780
<i>And you always protect
your little brother</i>

379
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:14,405
<i>when he gets
into dangerous situations.</i>

380
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:16,993
Nice dumper, baby girl.

381
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:20,243
- What the hell did you say?
- Tough guy, huh?

382
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,028
If you mess with Randy here,

383
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:24,037
I'm gonna tell you
what's gonna happen to you.

384
00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:26,970
Please don't hurt him.
I'm very afraid of you.

385
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:30,351
I'll give you $20 to leave us alone.
$30 if you act a little scared.

386
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,424
You do these things,
Arlo will change, I promise.

387
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,135
Like a caterpillar into a butterfly.

388
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:41,262
Maybe something less girly.

389
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:44,983
Like a Transformer car
into a Transformer robot.

390
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:49,103
I like Transformers.
So I'm gonna take your advice on this.

391
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:52,315
I'm just sick of having
to hang out with this loser,

392
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,734
B.O. factory, three-balled jackass

393
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,532
from the state of Douche-achusetts.

394
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,154
That's not even a state.

395
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,984
Now is your chance.
Go protect your little brother.

396
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,076
Leave me alone!

397
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,493
Leave him alone!

398
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:08,949
<i>So Zeke got all protector-ish,
and I got all protector-ish.</i>

399
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,208
<i>It was a good show.</i>

400
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:11,733
Come on, Arlo!

401
00:20:13,216 --> 00:20:14,815
<i>And it all worked out.</i>

402
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:18,007
<i>And Earl and Zeke never had
a clue we'd set 'em up.</i>

403
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:23,092
Sorry for making you
lose your friend again.

404
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:24,318
That's okay.

405
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:27,797
Maybe Zeke and Arlo were the ones
meant to be friends.

406
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,478
Maybe you're right.

407
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,108
Lotto's back.

408
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,427
You know what, buddy?

409
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:42,198
That eyebrow raise is...
kind of my thing.

410
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,467
That's cool.

411
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:47,466
One time,
this pirate walks into a bar.

412
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:51,090
He's got the ship's steering wheel
attached to the crotch of his pants.

413
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,278
Bartender says, "Hey, pirate,

414
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:55,779
"you got a steering wheel
coming out of your pants."

415
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:59,454
And the pirate nods and says,
"Arrgh! It's driving me nuts!"

416
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:05,015
That one was actually funny.

417
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:07,692
What do you mean, "actually"?

418
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,204
