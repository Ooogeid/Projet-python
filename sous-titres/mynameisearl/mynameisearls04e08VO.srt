1
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:05,207
I do think being a sunburned guy
is a good costume for Halloween.

2
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:07,173
We can't both do the same thing.

3
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:08,102
Come on.

4
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:10,898
Two sunburned guys
is way funnier than one.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,977
Come on, do it with me.

6
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:22,478
Maybe you're right.

7
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:29,324
Oh, perfect timing.

8
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:32,319
I can't figure out
how to get this coffin lid on right.

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,813
Can y'all help me?

10
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:37,707
We're not stupid.
What's gonna pop out and scare us?

11
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,055
Nothing.

12
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:43,755
How about we just
stand back over here

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,091
and you show us
how the lid works?

14
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,065
I told you
that was a bad idea, Joy.

15
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,526
Don't worry,
the kids won't punch that hard.

16
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:06,653
Is this why you called us over here?

17
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:09,594
Course not. If I just wanted
to see you scream like a little bitch,

18
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:11,993
I'd make you sit
through Pumpkin head again.

19
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,703
You're here because you need
to give the boys a good Halloween.

20
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:17,497
<i>Joy was talking
about #94 on my list:</i>

21
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:20,150
<i>"ruined Dodge
and Earl Jr.'s Halloween."</i>

22
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:22,946
I thought you were taking
the kids trick-or-treating.

23
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,671
You wanted me
to go with them?

24
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:26,892
Fight! Fight!

25
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:35,785
You need to throw
a party for the boys

26
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:38,365
and everybody else
who spent all night looking for 'em,

27
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:40,934
not to mention me.
My hands were shaking so bad,

28
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:43,386
I could barely put my makeup on
for the news crew.

29
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:45,106
Fine, I'll throw a party.

30
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:47,916
But you got to admit you loved it
when they let you drive the speedboat

31
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:49,769
when they were dragging the lake.

32
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,710
I had that thing humming.

33
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,868
LITTLE BAD VOODOO BROTHER

34
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:01,541
Willie let me borrow his glass eye
for Dodge and Earl Jr.'s party.

35
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:04,732
I thought we could float it
in the witches' pot,

36
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:07,393
but I can't find
any of that spooky ice to go with it.

37
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:09,630
We tried pouring hot water
over regular ice,

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,634
- but you know what happened?
- It melted?

39
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:13,261
You tried that, too, huh?

40
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:20,494
Who's that with Catalina?

41
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:22,818
That's her nephew "O-Scar."

42
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:25,701
O-Scar,
like Oscar but with an "O."

43
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:28,067
Her sister sent them
to America for a vacation.

44
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,965
He arrived yesterday.

45
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,769
I swear I didn't order this.

46
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,579
Wait, are you a dishwasher?

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,248
We didn't order this.

48
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:43,931
The really sad part is

49
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:47,341
the way bill said
"bananas, magazines, and little boy."

50
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,048
I can't help but think someone
at customs wasn't doing their job.

51
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:51,800
I wish I had a little brother.

52
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:53,213
Thanks, Earl.

53
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:55,290
Randy, you know it's on my list.

54
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,055
"Cost Randy a little brother."

55
00:02:57,215 --> 00:02:58,431
How'd you do that?

56
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,097
Dad made Mom get fixed
after he caught Earl

57
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:03,603
playing a game of "Watch Randy
in the washing machine."

58
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:07,043
I swallowed a lot of bleach.
That's why I can't taste salt.

59
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:10,568
I put it on the gentle cycle.
You never tell that part of the story.

60
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:12,945
If you're interested
in getting a brother,

61
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:15,448
you can try the local office
of <i>Big Bros, Little Bros</i>.

62
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,125
Oh, yeah, I've seen their sign.

63
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,626
I always thought
it was a hip-hop clothing store

64
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:21,204
with a huge range of sizes.

65
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:24,741
No, they match up needy young boys
with older, mostly unmarried men

66
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,628
looking to take someone
under their wing.

67
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,379
Surprisingly enough,
usually it works out just fine.

68
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:32,507
<i>So me and Randy cleaned up,
put on our Sunday clothes,</i>

69
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,918
<i>and went down
to </i>Big Bros, Little Bros.

70
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:37,178
So, tell me a little bit
about yourself, Randy.

71
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:40,682
Well, I'm 31 and I live in a motel.

72
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:44,326
I have three pairs of pants
and five shirts,

73
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:45,652
and...

74
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:47,971
that pretty much sums me up.

75
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,817
Oh, and this is my brother Earl.
We're very close.

76
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,610
We even sleep in the same bed.

77
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,614
But not in a weird way,
just in a "there's only one bed" way.

78
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,700
Yeah, and we sleep facing out,

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,870
so if anything touches,
it's our butts and not our wieners.

80
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:06,656
<i>Since there were way more
little bros than big bros,</i>

81
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:09,072
<i>the counselor tried
to give Randy a shot.</i>

82
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:12,906
You guys...

83
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:16,016
this kid is a part
of our hot potato game, too.

84
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,948
Now, just because he's going
to be sitting in this chair

85
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:22,575
for the rest of his natural life

86
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,893
with those bright white shoes
that'll never get dirty,

87
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,605
doesn't make him any different
from me or you.

88
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,046
Go ahead, throw him the ball.

89
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,985
There you go.
Way to include everyone.

90
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:36,779
Now who wants to play kickball?

91
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:41,743
Wait for me.

92
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:47,309
<i>I was starting to have my doubts about
whether Randy'd be a good big brother.</i>

93
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:48,485
Duck.

94
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:49,561
Goose.

95
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,545
You're still it.

96
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:54,375
<i>But the people at the program
didn't have any doubts at all.</i>

97
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,663
<i>They were sure.</i>

98
00:04:56,832 --> 00:05:00,286
<i>I was actually kind of relieved
he didn't get accepted as a big brother,</i>

99
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:03,014
<i>but I could never tell him that.</i>
They screwed up, man.

100
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,200
They don't know
what an awesome big brother is,

101
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,048
because an awesome
big brother is you.

102
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:09,505
I don't know where I went wrong.

103
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:10,646
You didn't.

104
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,191
You were perfect.
Those people are stupid.

105
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:15,778
A little brother
doesn't have to be a person.

106
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,070
You could get a pet.

107
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:19,121
Well, not a pet.

108
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,949
Maybe... a plant.

109
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,992
I hate plants! Plants suck!

110
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:26,282
I'm sorry, plants. I'm just mad.

111
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,414
Earl, could you give me a hand?

112
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:31,510
There's a customer at Club Chubby
who thinks he's hilarious.

113
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:35,106
None of the other strippers
will help me get it off.

114
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,006
They're jealous
'cause they never get 5.

115
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,563
Do they get little brothers?

116
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:41,355
'Cause then they should stop bitching
and shut the hell up!

117
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,885
I'm sorry, other strippers.
I'm just mad.

118
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:46,346
What's wrong with him?

119
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:49,412
Randy wanted a little brother,
but we couldn't find one, so,

120
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,145
now we've moved on to plants.

121
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:54,357
What about O-Scar?
He could use a male influence.

122
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:57,382
When he was a baby,
his dad left to join the Rebels.

123
00:05:57,502 --> 00:05:59,696
They're a very popular singing group
in my country.

124
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:02,683
Yeah. I've seen their tapes
on sale at the car wash, but...

125
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:05,543
He could really use
a good male role model.

126
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:08,871
I'm no male model,
but I'd be a darn good big brother.

127
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:11,058
What do you think, Earl?

128
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:14,836
O-Scar's definitely an option.

129
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,503
We'll keep him in mind
if it doesn't work out with the plant.

130
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:19,425
No, I said I hated plants.

131
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:20,818
Wait a minute.

132
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:23,136
You don't think
I can be a big brother, do you?

133
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:27,659
Are you crazy?

134
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,810
Of course I think
you'd be a good big brother.

135
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,896
You're talking
in the high-pitched lying voice.

136
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:35,523
No, I'm not.

137
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,860
Then tell me in your normal voice
you think I can do this.

138
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:40,632
Randy, are you crazy?

139
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:46,075
I'll do it.

140
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:50,020
<i>I was worried about Randy
taking care of O-Scar,</i>

141
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,656
<i>but I had my hands full
of important party business.</i>

142
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:54,803
How are they gonna play
"Pin the Tail on the Mummy,"

143
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:57,336
if the first pin makes her pop?
That's not realistic.

144
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:00,465
Realistic?
Mummys don't have tails.

145
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,551
Were you alive back then?
Are you Brendan Fraser?

146
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,054
Get me a mummy
I can stick a damn pin in.

147
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:08,681
Well, leave this one.

148
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,871
I know two-ply when I see it.

149
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,044
Darnell will be thrilled.

150
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:19,432
How's it going?

151
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,778
O-Scar lost a finger
in the Ferris wheel.

152
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:24,447
- Randy, what the...?
- I'm just kidding.

153
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:25,863
He's fine.

154
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:28,785
'Cause I'm a great big brother,
no matter what you think.

155
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,412
We got that bandage
from a car wreck we passed.

156
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,706
- I'm going to the rest room.
- You gonna drop a <i>dos</i>?

157
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:34,666
<i>Si.</i>

158
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:37,737
"<i>Dos</i>" means "poo" in Spanish.

159
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:49,050
I saw it, Earl.

160
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,540
I'll take care of it.

161
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,886
<i>Randy waited for O-Scar
to finish his </i>dos,

162
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:58,095
<i>then took him somewhere
more private to have their talk.</i>

163
00:08:06,638 --> 00:08:08,863
Earl and me saw you
steal those tips,

164
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:10,566
and stealing's wrong.

165
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,527
I want you to go back there,

166
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,769
return the money,
and apologize,

167
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,583
and you'll feel better
about yourself.

168
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,929
Huge relief.

169
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,758
That was a doozy,
but we got through it, little bro.

170
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,511
How about we just head back
to the Crab Shack...

171
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,054
Don't tell me what to do.

172
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:30,972
What?

173
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:36,936
What are you doing?

174
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,133
Satan.

175
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,405
Randy, check it out.

176
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:58,499
Me and Magnum PI
made a sign for the El Camino.

177
00:08:58,659 --> 00:08:59,711
Pretty cool sign.

178
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,253
If you don't want it shredded by Satan,
I'd leave it out here.

179
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:03,421
What?

180
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:05,819
O-Scar got upset
about the stealing thing,

181
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:08,426
and now he's just a little bit
completely possessed.

182
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,806
Randy, calm down.

183
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:12,388
He's probably just trying
to get out of trouble for stealing.

184
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,738
Hey, O-Scar, we need to...

185
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,299
Come on out, O-Scar.

186
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,882
Acting possessed doesn't scare me.

187
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:25,552
I got a cousin with Tourette's
who's really religious.

188
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:27,111
It's very similar.

189
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:31,618
Randy, it was just the wind.

190
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:34,159
Come on, O-Scar.

191
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,518
You're not going to freak me out.

192
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:13,345
Holy Moses!

193
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:18,578
Oh, my God,

194
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:21,958
those are voodoo dolls of you
and a fat guy with stains on his shirt.

195
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:30,045
Cute.

196
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:31,838
Look, O-Scar,

197
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:35,584
you need to return the money you stole
and quit trying to freak me out.

198
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:37,974
There's nothing you can do
that I haven't done be...

199
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:39,138
Oh, God!

200
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:40,810
Never did that.

201
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,894
I'll just be a minute.

202
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,402
We need to talk
about your freaky little nephew.

203
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:07,837
Sorry, Nick,
we'll be out in a second.

204
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:09,056
<i>That's okay.</i>

205
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,173
O-Scar's a little cutie, isn't he?

206
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,144
He sucks.

207
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:14,188
He's got Randy convinced
he knows voodoo,

208
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,554
and he blew dust in my eyes.
It's still burning.

209
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:18,712
You told him what to do, didn't you?

210
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:20,941
He hates that.
By the way, it wasn't dust.

211
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,073
It's the ground bones
of a graveyard sparrow.

212
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:25,934
They say it blinds you
to the dangers that lie ahead.

213
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:27,690
It's also a great exfoliant.

214
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,131
I got to go
throw a party for Joy's kids.

215
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:32,945
I don't have time for this.
You need to take your freak back.

216
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:34,363
No, I'm his big brother.

217
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,061
You're not acting like it.
You can't take care of him.

218
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:38,701
You said that
about the goldfish.

219
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,653
- You ate the goldfish.
- You dared me.

220
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:42,176
O-Scar can't stay with me.

221
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:44,787
Every time I tell him what to do,
he channels my dead grandmother,

222
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:47,251
and then she tells me what to do.
I can't live like that.

223
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:49,045
Then, box him up
and send him home.

224
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:51,172
You said you'd take him,
so he's yours.

225
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:58,031
<i>I didn't think a crazy little kid
should be at the motel alone,</i>

226
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,857
<i>and Randy didn't want to be left alone
with a crazy little kid at the motel,</i>

227
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:03,833
<i>so we all headed over to Joy's.</i>

228
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:06,950
Great decorations, Crab Man.

229
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:09,774
That dead body in the front
of the trailer park looks real.

230
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,902
- What dead body?
- The one the kids are jumping on.

231
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,695
I'll be right back.

232
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,833
Who are you supposed to be?

233
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:20,457
Barbie.
Can't you tell?

234
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:22,536
Taped my nipples down
so my boobies are smooth.

235
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,956
Hey, it ain't goodie bag time.

236
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,156
Don't tell me what to do.

237
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,316
Maybe kids talk back from Guatelatucky
or wherever you're from,

238
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:34,411
but you must be El Pollo Loco
if you think you can sass me like that.

239
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:43,599
What the hell?

240
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,891
Oh, my God.

241
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:48,791
I seen this before.

242
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:51,273
He's doing voodoo.
He's evil.

243
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:55,972
<i>Joy had seen these signs before
with her baby-sitter.</i>

244
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:15,214
What the hell?

245
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:17,072
Never again, child,

246
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,594
will you steal cigarettes
out of my pocketbook.

247
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,854
You are cursed.

248
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,740
You will become pregnant

249
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:26,467
before you are married.

250
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:31,443
Oh, snap.

251
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,137
He's full of voodoo.

252
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:37,400
You get him out of here
before it starts raining blood

253
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,280
or he forces us
to eat jerk chicken.

254
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,781
Joy, he's just a kid.

255
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:44,989
As was <i>The Omen</i>, <i>The Exorcist</i>
and all them <i>Children of the Corn</i>.

256
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:46,749
The devil likes them young.

257
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,248
Probably gets in
through that soft spot on their skull.

258
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,737
Come on, O-Scar, let's go.

259
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,923
And you can forget
crossing the boys off your list.

260
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,954
Your freak child ruined the party!

261
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:02,559
I'll see you Halloween '09, dummy.

262
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,814
No, I'm not gonna drop it, Randy.

263
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:09,501
He's messing with people's heads
with all that fake voodoo,

264
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:11,498
and now he's messing
with my list.

265
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,605
Because of him,

266
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:15,675
I can't cross off Joy's kids
until next Halloween.

267
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:17,485
Karma's not gonna like that.

268
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:20,189
How come when you talk
about voodoo it's always fake,

269
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,741
but then you run around scared
of this silly, made-up magic Karma?

270
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:26,160
'Cause Karma's real.
I've seen it work.

271
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:28,907
I haven't seen proof
that voodoo can do anything.

272
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,128
Earl, that's a Randy doll.

273
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:38,422
- He's got a Randy doll.
- It's just a doll.

274
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,762
What's he doing?
I don't like it!

275
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:46,472
Nothing's gonna happen,
it's fake.

276
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,641
Nothing's happening, O-Scar.
Give it up.

277
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,333
I'm putting a curse on your brother
that will make him scared,

278
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:52,520
nervous and uneasy.

279
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,228
My God, it's working.

280
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:56,575
I am scared,
nervous and uneasy.

281
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,983
Randy, it's not voodoo.

282
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:01,278
It's just power of suggestion.
He's messing with your mind.

283
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:03,660
Then it shouldn't matter
if I do this.

284
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:07,785
Oh, God!
Voodoo's making us gay!

285
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:10,699
You better kiss, or I'll make
these dolls do something worse.

286
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,375
Put your tongue in my mouth.
I don't want to do something worse.

287
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:16,919
He's just messing with your mind.
It's not real.

288
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,921
Then, how come
I'm trying to kiss you?

289
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:22,310
I would love to have
a leisurely conversation

290
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,655
where I say "Hey, Earl,"
you say "Hey, Crab Man,"

291
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:26,762
but no time for that.
You got to get out of here.

292
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:27,846
Why?

293
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:31,281
Joy's worried about what Randy's progeny
is gonna do with her hair,

294
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:34,045
so she formed a witch hunt posse,
and they're headed this way.

295
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,502
<i>Since the mob was
on their way to the motel,</i>

296
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:39,439
<i>we doubled back to buy some time.</i>

297
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,047
<i>Also, Darnell had some stuff
in the trailer to help us get away.</i>

298
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:49,910
Why do you already have fake passports
with our pictures on them?

299
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,382
I'm trained to think three steps ahead.
I saw this coming last December.

300
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,833
What do these pills do?

301
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:58,524
They're cyanide,
they'll kill you in 30 seconds.

302
00:15:58,866 --> 00:15:59,697
What?

303
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:02,632
Just kidding. I saw you take yours.
It's multi-vitamin...

304
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,801
it's important to keep your immune
system up when you're on the run.

305
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,206
Crap, somebody at the motel
must've tipped them off.

306
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:24,820
Earl and Randy are your friends.

307
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,739
And that little boy
hasn't hurt anyone.

308
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,199
Now let them go in peace!

309
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:32,494
That little voodoo rikki freak
cast a spell on my husband!

310
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:38,860
Sorry, baby,
but it's for your own good.

311
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:41,621
Reverend, sprinkle some
of that holy water on him.

312
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,590
Keep if off his hair.
You know black people.

313
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,759
It gets all crazy
when it gets wet.

314
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:51,096
We're screwed.
Unless we give 'em O-Scar.

315
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:53,212
<i>O-Scar was in a bad spot.</i>

316
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:56,254
<i>For the first time,
he really need a big brother.</i>

317
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:57,978
We're not giving 'em O-Scar.

318
00:16:58,379 --> 00:16:59,480
Look at 'em.

319
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,231
We're not sending him out there.

320
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,923
Don't worry, buddy.
Everything's gonna be all right.

321
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,945
O-Scar's my little brother.

322
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:09,832
And I'm gonna stand by him
the way a big brother's supposed to.

323
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:11,617
The way you always have for me.

324
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,768
Besides,

325
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:15,682
you know I've always wanted
to fight 30 people at once.

326
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,477
You've got one hell
of a big brother, kid.

327
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:31,484
<i>And as long as people were defending
their little brothers...</i>

328
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,442
Come on, you punks!
Give me your best...

329
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:40,523
<i>It was a fairly one-sided fight.</i>

330
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,364
<i>By that, I mean they stuck mostly
to stomping the left side of my head</i>

331
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:46,568
<i>and the left side of my ribcage.</i>

332
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:54,118
Remember, Reverend,
disco's bad.

333
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:56,946
I'll be your alibi, you be mine.
We were at the library.

334
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:00,386
<i>It didn't look good.
Me and Randy were stuck</i>

335
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:03,283
<i>and there was nothing left
to stop Joy and her angry mob.</i>

336
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:04,883
<i>Then I saw it.</i>

337
00:18:07,944 --> 00:18:09,526
<i>And standing up for O-Scar,</i>

338
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:12,656
<i>Randy had finally got to feel
what it's like to be a big brother.</i>

339
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:16,515
<i>If I crossed him off the list,
maybe Karma would save us.</i>

340
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:23,591
My God, he made a doll of me.

341
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,498
And she's got no boobies.

342
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:29,319
Please don't stab my doll.
Don't kill me.

343
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:32,239
Kill him.
If he dies, he knows where he's going.

344
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:35,234
I'm not gonna kill anyone.
The knife is to cut the pumpkin pie

345
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:37,494
for the Halloween party
your dolls are having.

346
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:41,061
I just want you
to stop hurting my big brother.

347
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,892
And I want everyone to be happy.

348
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,450
<i>Karma's a powerful thing.</i>

349
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,322
<i>Apparently, seeing the good me and Randy
made O-Scar want to be good, too.</i>

350
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,032
<i>And lucky for O-Scar,</i>

351
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:54,135
<i>the power of suggestion
is also a powerful thing.</i>

352
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:03,261
<i>People must've liked seeing themselves
having fun at that doll party because</i>

353
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:06,212
<i>before you knew it,
that was exactly what was happening.</i>

354
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:09,142
<i>Turns out, I wasn't gonna have
to wait until next year</i>

355
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:11,714
<i>to cross off Dodge and Earl Jr.
after all.</i>

356
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:13,989
This is the best Halloween ever!

357
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,070
Even if I can never
straighten my arm again.

358
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,870
I'm gonna go ask Big Joe
to give it a pull.

359
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,623
Now, Karma got us
out of that one, huh?

360
00:19:22,783 --> 00:19:24,583
- What?
- My list item.

361
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:26,077
I crossed it off in time

362
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:29,004
and Karma made you stop freaking
everybody out with your fake voodoo.

363
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:32,132
I didn't stop doing voodoo.
I saved you guys with voodoo.

364
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:35,042
You would've gotten killed
if I didn't put a party spell

365
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:36,678
to keep them from hurting you.

366
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:38,076
Party spell?

367
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:39,883
You made their dolls have a party

368
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:42,022
'cause Karma wanted you
to do something good.

369
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:45,312
If you wanted to help us with voodoo,
you would've stuck pins in their dolls.

370
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:47,486
I couldn't find any pins.

371
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:52,844
Maybe Karma didn't want you
to find any pins.

372
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:55,893
<i>Seeing everyone
finally getting along,</i>

373
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,325
<i>I started to realize
that it didn't matter.</i>

374
00:19:58,782 --> 00:19:59,919
<i>Call it Karma.</i>

375
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,364
<i>Call it voodoo.</i>

376
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,047
<i>Whatever works for you works.</i>

377
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,672
<i>And there's no use
arguing about it anymore.</i>

378
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,379
Good thing me and the minister scared
the devil out of that little freak.

379
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,714
Reverend Heinzworth thinks
I've got great leadership skills.

380
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,843
Said that God wants me
to run for mayor.

381
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:17,186
Good for you.

382
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:20,009
<i>Like I said,</i>

383
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:22,039
<i>there was no point arguing.</i>

384
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:27,477
