3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:10,416
I can't believe
you're getting out today.

4
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:13,791
You could earn some time off too,
if you did good things for the warden.

5
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:15,384
I'm in here for 20 years.

6
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:18,746
That would mean I'd have to spend
ten straight years doing good things.

7
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,523
Who's got that kind of time?

8
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:25,167
Hey, Earl, Frank and I, Paco,
made this for you.

9
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:27,081
So you don't forget your time in here.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,553
Thanks, guys.

11
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:37,535
Don't tell me you're here
to pick up Earl, too.

12
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,052
You don't even have a car.

13
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:41,225
What's he going to do,
ride bitch on your donkey?

14
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,658
If he wanted to ride bitch,
he'd climb on your back.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,978
You look sweaty.
Is that from cleaning or stripping?

16
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:48,760
Maybe if you had as many jobs
as you do illegitimate children,

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,495
you wouldn't live in a camper.
No offense, Darnell.

18
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:53,555
This is between you two ladies.

19
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:57,302
Are you all here to watch me and Earl
do one of them super-slow run and hugs,

20
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,339
like they did in that movie
<i>Cherries of fire</i>?

21
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,751
I've been practicing.

22
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:12,802
That's sweet.
I wish our boys would bond as brothers.

23
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,041
They keep playing
this game called "eye pok."

24
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:17,322
It's all fun until one of them
gets poked in the eye.

25
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:19,445
Hey, there he is.

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,454
<i>Finally, it was the moment
I had been working for all those months.</i>

27
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:26,141
<i>I was going to be free.</i>

28
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:31,103
Randy, calm down,
you're going to piddle on the rug.

29
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:32,527
Hey, guys.

30
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:36,696
Hey Ron. Open up.
I'm getting out today.

31
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:39,996
I brought you a caramel apple cause
all the sweet stuff is on the outside.

32
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:42,906
I've really been getting
into food metaphors lately.

33
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,084
A lot's changed
since you've been on the inside.

34
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:48,187
We got a problem.

35
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,707
You're not on the list of prisoners
getting out today.

36
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:53,074
- What?
- I hate to kick you when you're down,

37
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:55,507
but you're also not
on the extra pudding list.

38
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:59,397
- What's the holdup?
- I gotta talk to the warden.

39
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:02,596
He's not on the pudding list.

40
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,219
Earl, nobody loves pudding more than me,

41
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,224
but you gotta pick your battles!

42
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,321
You shredded my certificates?!

43
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,867
I thought you might be cheesed off.
That's why I had them shackle you.

44
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:16,551
I'm sorry, but I'm not letting you out.

45
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,538
I know I should've said
something earlier,

46
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,656
but I tend to ignore problems.

47
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,613
You'd be surprised
how often they go away.

48
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:25,415
We had a deal!
We shook on it, remember?

49
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,837
Both our hands were a little damp, so
it made that farty noise and we giggled.

50
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:29,893
I know!

51
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:33,433
But all the help you've been giving me,
has made me look so competent.

52
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:35,034
Even my wife is impressed.

53
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:38,303
She is talking about letting me
get my own bank account.

54
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:41,388
I've done everything you asked me to!
I'm supposed to go home today.

55
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,497
Come on!
How about this for a deal?

56
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,847
You scratch my back and...

57
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:48,909
My back won't hitch.

58
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,575
Plus, I won't throw you in solitary.

59
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:52,633
Deal?

60
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,404
Okay, deal.

61
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:00,839
Deal with that!

62
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:05,907
What's the point of shackles
if he can do that?

63
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,857
You can't do this!
I'm supposed to be free!

64
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:13,128
Look, I'll let you out of solitary
when you agree to help me.

65
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:18,698
What good is shackles if he can do that?

66
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:23,321
Man, we haven't stood
outside of prison this long

67
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:26,050
since we went tailgating
at that guy's execution.

68
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:27,868
For the record, I was protesting.

69
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:31,088
Whatever...
This is clearly not happening.

70
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:33,002
Let's just get out of here.

71
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,318
Wait! You guys can't go!

72
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,491
We were going to build
a human pyramid for Earl.

73
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:40,968
Now, it's just gonna be two people
kneeling in a parking lot.

74
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,594
That doesn't say welcome home!

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,913
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go, too.

76
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,591
If I don't get a seat on the bus,
I'm gonna have to stand.

77
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,231
It just feels like work.

78
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,019
He's going to hate this pyramid!

79
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,219
<i>The point of solitary confinement is
to break down a prisonner's mental state</i>

80
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,057
<i>by keeping him alone
in a box 24 hours a day.</i>

81
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:11,829
<i>Fortunately state law said that,</i>

82
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:14,145
<i>each week, I had the right
to a weekly prayer service.</i>

83
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:15,446
Please kneel.

84
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:18,494
<i>Unfortunately,
the warden found a way around that law.</i>

85
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,340
Amen.

86
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:22,907
<i>I was also allowed a daily shower...</i>

87
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,001
<i>And an hour of exercise.</i>

88
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,948
Charging!

89
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>After a while, I decided
it was better to just stay in my cell</i>

90
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,216
<i>and find other ways to fill my time.</i>

91
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:41,514
And reverse.

92
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:45,646
Double time.

93
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:51,504
<i>I tried to keep my sanity
by developing new hobbies.</i>

94
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:52,781
Three words.

95
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:54,886
Movie.

96
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:56,849
First word.

97
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,828
Eyes.

98
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,348
Owl.

99
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:04,805
S-sleep, uh...

100
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,025
Uh, sleepless...

101
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:08,421
<i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>!

102
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:09,930
<i>But that didn't work.</i>

103
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,944
<i>And, after a few weeks,
my mind just took off on its own.</i>

104
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,375
Don't want it!

105
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,150
You're just trying to fat me up
for Thanksgiving!

106
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:22,046
Well, no one eats Earl J. Turkey.

107
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,416
Hey, flutes, just once,
could you wait for my cue?

108
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:01,572
You ready to play ball?

109
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,274
Yeah, but you might have to carry me.

110
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,056
I've traded my legs in for magic beans.

111
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:11,924
I've disguised them as legs.

112
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,856
You broke just in time.

113
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,371
I need help getting this place
ready for Christmas.

114
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,657
Just because the prisoners can't be
with their families for the holidays

115
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:31,273
or get gifts
or have a big christmas dinner,

116
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:33,542
doesn't mean
they shouldn't have Christmas spirit.

117
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:37,143
- It's Christmas already?
- Yeah, Christmas 2010.

118
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,408
I was just kidding.

119
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:44,443
Did you lose
your sense of humor in there?

120
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,400
You want to lie down?
You want to go stand in the yard?

121
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:52,421
I wish I could give you more options,
but you are in prison.

122
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:55,030
Not for long.

123
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:55,992
What?

124
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:59,975
It's time to bust out of this place.

125
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:03,732
<i>I knew breaking out of prison
was going to be hard,</i>

126
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:05,586
<i>so I got the old gang back together.</i>

127
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:07,941
Sure, I'll help you
think of a way to escape

128
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:11,761
as long as you don't seek a dog on me
and drag me back in like last time.

129
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:15,386
- Frank, again, we're sorry about that.
- I'm just kidding. I'm over it.

130
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:17,144
I really don't how how to break out

131
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:19,718
but if you want a list
of stuff that doesn't work,

132
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:20,989
I'm your guy.

133
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:23,414
<i>Frank had a lot to teach us.
Things like:</i>

134
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:26,117
<i>if you're going to disguise yourself
as an infirmary nurse,</i>

135
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:29,151
- <i>make sure you don't look too pretty.</i>
- Female!

136
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:38,576
<i>Also, don't try to sneak out when
they throw away the old mattresses.</i>

137
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,264
Got one.

138
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,809
<i>Or if you do get over the fence,
don't take time to celebrate.</i>

139
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,641
<i>We knew what didn't work.
Now, we had to find a plan that did.</i>

140
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:01,627
<i>So, while I was stuck
doing the warden's errands,</i>

141
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:03,913
<i>I kept my eyes open for weak spots.</i>

142
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:05,717
<i>I looked for loose drains...</i>

143
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,655
<i>I even checked to see if the fire alarm
could create a useful distraction.</i>

144
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:15,569
<i>But that wasn't going to work.</i>

145
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,502
<i>Finally, I found a little opening.</i>

146
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:28,683
<i>Now, I had to figure out
where that opening went.</i>

147
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,930
<i>It wasn't hard
to find the prison blue prints.</i>

148
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,714
<i>The warden got lost so much,
he had them laminated,</i>

149
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:39,207
<i>so he could take them with him
on the way to the bathroom.</i>

150
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:42,521
<i>The problem was gonna be getting
them back without anyone noticing.</i>

151
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:47,114
So if we go into that air duct,

152
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:50,380
we'll have a direct path from
that storage closet to the loading dock.

153
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:51,911
And then, boom, we're outside.

154
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,355
But getting to the dock
is only half the battle.

155
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:58,433
We still have to get
through the front gate.

156
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,741
Then they search everything,
and I mean everything... even coffins.

157
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:04,633
I once spent seven hours
spooning a dead guy for thing.

158
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:07,777
If we can't get past the front gate,
we're back to square one.

159
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:10,610
But Earl, they don't search everyone.

160
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:14,749
<i>Though Randy sometimes just says things
to be a part of the conversation,</i>

161
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,702
<i>this time, he knew
what he was talking about.</i>

162
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:19,408
Let them through.

163
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,254
I frisked a nun one time,
got the runs for two weeks.

164
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,069
It could have been God,
it could have been a bad meatball.

165
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,725
Can't take any chances.

166
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:33,439
<i>Since the prison had a mess
every wednesday, I had a plan.</i>

167
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,422
<i>And the guys thought
it was a good one.</i>

168
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,222
I think this escape is
the one that's going to work.

169
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,332
Well, I always say that,
but this time I really mean it.

170
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:44,310
Yeah, just in case
we need a little insurance...

171
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,691
I made a zip gun.

172
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:50,440
But I only have one bullet,

173
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,590
so hopefully, all the guards will be
standing in a line at some point.

174
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:57,055
Man!

175
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:02,269
<i>After Frank melted down
all my bed springs,</i>

176
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:03,781
<i>we had another bullet.</i>

177
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:06,158
<i>And before we knew it,
it was wednesday...</i>

178
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:07,608
<i>Time to break out.</i>

179
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:10,443
- You're cheating!
- What?!

180
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,532
No one calls me a cheater!

181
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:14,074
Now, I'm going to push you!

182
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,366
That's it! Knock it off!

183
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:19,007
You and you...

184
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,830
and you,
are coming with me.

185
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,710
<i>Things were in motion
inside the prison,</i>

186
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:28,381
<i>but we still needed
some help on the outside.</i>

187
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:32,033
<i>Luckily, my friends were so mad
about the warden screwing me over,</i>

188
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,677
<i>they were willing to help.</i>

189
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,805
I need a ride
to Planned Parenthood,

190
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,806
or some spiritual guidance
on whether or not

191
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:39,498
to keep my baby.

192
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:47,565
Where's Father Tadone?

193
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:49,228
He called in sick.

194
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:50,611
Where's Sister Bernadette?

195
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,518
She called in sick too.

196
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:55,098
We're a little suspicious ourselves.

197
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:08,705
<i>Usually, when a guard leads you
do a deserted hallway,</i>

198
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,055
<i>it's a bad thing.</i>

199
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:11,214
<i>Today, it wasn't.</i>

200
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:16,468
This is it.

201
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,263
I'll see you
on the outside, Randy.

202
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,194
- You just called me Randy
- I'm nervous.

203
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:24,352
Not everyone's made out of steel
like you, Randy.

204
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:25,730
Damn it!

205
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,817
<i>From that moment on,
there was no turning back.</i>

206
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:34,488
<i>Everything was working out,
but we still had to get</i>

207
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:36,948
<i>into the air vent
that would lead to the loading dock.</i>

208
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:38,116
There it is.

209
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:39,626
Is everyone here?

210
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,250
What are you doing here?
You're going to get in trouble.

211
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:48,723
Why? I'm allowed to go home.

212
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:50,545
They never said
what route I had to take.

213
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:53,341
They're starting up,
let's go.

214
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:54,674
Brothers and...

215
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,229
Brothers dressed as sisters.

216
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,323
God's up there thinking, sure,
"I am all-powerful,

217
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:07,258
"but I could still use
a little encouragement."

218
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:13,557
And if you give the Lord
just one little tiny hey,

219
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,842
he'll give you
100 hellos in return.

220
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:22,033
When I say holy,
you say ghost!

221
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:25,980
When I say butter,
you say toast!

222
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,863
When I say Springer,
you say host!

223
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:35,281
<i>Now that things were loud,
we could make some noise of our own.</i>

224
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:37,358
Oh Jesus, you're so fine,

225
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,467
you're so fine,
you blow my mind.

226
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,679
Hey, Jesus!
Sing it with me!

227
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:19,120
Put the phone down.

228
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:20,760
I should've gone for the gun.

229
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,094
Oh crap!
What do I do?

230
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:28,270
This is huge!
Think, Hickey.

231
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,566
Oh, that's what that does.

232
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,604
You're probably looking for this one.
It says "alarm".

233
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:39,966
Everybody, be still,

234
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:42,074
let me figure out
what to do with our hostage.

235
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:43,222
Hostage?

236
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:46,286
What happened to us?
We used to be friends.

237
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:49,205
You shredded my certificates,
and threw me in solitary.

238
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:51,490
If it makes you feel any better,
I missed you.

239
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:54,274
I used to peek through the slot
and watch you sleep sometimes.

240
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:55,745
Shut up!

241
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,386
<i>While I was trying
to come up with a new plan,</i>

242
00:13:58,486 --> 00:14:01,219
<i>Joy and Darnell were still busy
exuting the old one.</i>

243
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,102
<i>And their next step
was getting rid of the guard.</i>

244
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:14,621
Where the hell
did you learn do that?

245
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,871
It doesn't matter.

246
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,721
We have 14:36 minutes
before he wakes up.

247
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,825
Wait a second.

248
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:23,896
Did you use that
on me the other night

249
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:26,618
when I was begging for round 2
and then mysteriously passed out?

250
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,328
Sorry, baby,
I'm not a machine.

251
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,209
That's been 10 minutes.
Have you thought of anything yet?

252
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:37,361
I almost had an idea,
but now I lost it. Thanks a lot.

253
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,464
That happens to me all the time.

254
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:41,849
Maybe I could scare it back.

255
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,128
- No, that's hiccups.
- I stand on my head and drink water.

256
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,763
That's neat. Try that, Earl.

257
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:48,640
That's for hiccups, too.

258
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:51,419
Don't you have hiccups?
What are we talking about then?

259
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,092
Thought of something.
Take your clothes off.

260
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,930
God, where the hell are they?
They should be here by now.

261
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,854
I'm going to go climb in the vent
and look for them.

262
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:08,491
Really?

263
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,702
No one went in
to save my uncle Clyde

264
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:14,066
when he was unfairly incarcerated
for taking Licorice from a candy store.

265
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,793
Licorice was his daughter.
He had every right to take her.

266
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:23,089
Be careful, baby.

267
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:29,931
Hey, Frank, where's Earl?

268
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,207
He and Randy fell
through the ceiling.

269
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,082
Poor kid tried
flapping his arms,

270
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:36,070
but it just kept him
from protecting his face.

271
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,568
Never leave a man behind.

272
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:39,213
Civilians.

273
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,778
I can't do it, Randy.
I just can't do it.

274
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:47,577
We can't pretend you're the warden
if you have a moustache.

275
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:51,034
So what's the big deal?
Mustaches are so 20 years go.

276
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,415
By the time you get out off of here,
they'll be 40 years ago.

277
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:58,336
Yeah? Well, you might not
even see the next 40 years.

278
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:00,796
<i>I'd been holding in my anger
for a long time,</i>

279
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:02,964
<i>but in that moment,
something just snapped.</i>

280
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,122
Don't move!

281
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:12,994
Any of you!

282
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,961
That's the fax.

283
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,040
Oh, thank God.

284
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:42,670
Uh, excuse me.
Where's my husband and ex-husband?

285
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:45,831
They're pretty screwed, but don't worry,
me and Paco could still escape.

286
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,425
Let's go.
You're driving.

287
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:50,262
I'm wearing a nun dress, and
I'm justly powered by the wrath of God!

288
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,380
Damn, I'm even talking in Bible.

289
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,398
You know,
you're a strong woman,

290
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:56,034
and I admire that.

291
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:58,603
And I'm sorry for
what I'm about to do.

292
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,516
Holy crap!
You need to do some grooming.

293
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:23,308
Looks like a thimble wearing
a clown wig down there.

294
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:26,187
You know, Earl,
all you had to do is play along.

295
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:28,633
You would have been
out of prison in less than 2 years.

296
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:31,427
You gonna to be stuck behind bars
for the rest of your life.

297
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,417
Richard Jammer?

298
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:48,314
<i>Turns out the warden had another life
before he married the governor.</i>

299
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:54,758
I'm the cable repairman.
I'm here to turn on your box.

300
00:17:55,355 --> 00:17:59,100
Well, that's great, 'cause
I'm tired of using my rabbit ears.

301
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,850
<i>And part of that life was
in Darnell's old apartment.</i>

302
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:06,546
<i>Cut! Who's this guy?</i>

303
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:09,285
Hey, hairy, they'll give you
500$ to film this in here.

304
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:13,955
But let me put a cover
over Mr. Parrot's cage.

305
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:16,681
I don't want to have to hear him
talking about this all night.

306
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,562
Warden, you okay?
What's going on?!

307
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:21,811
<i>What was going on was</i>

308
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:24,938
<i>the warden was thinking about how
his past could ruin his wife's career,</i>

309
00:18:25,091 --> 00:18:26,381
<i>and his marriage.</i>

310
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,443
Nothing. Just a drill.

311
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,698
You know, you fellas could shave
a few seconds off your response on it.

312
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,998
These gentlemen are just installing,
uh, some skylights.

313
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:39,149
And as for my clothes, well,

314
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:41,623
you happen to have caught me
in a moment of self pleasure.

315
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:45,256
I would appreciate your discretion.
That will be all.

316
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:55,730
Nobody needs to know
about what you did today, son,

317
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:58,939
as long as nobody finds out
what I did in the '80s,

318
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:01,363
and that little comeback in the '90s.

319
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,403
- Deal?
- Yeah.

320
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:07,013
<i>It didn't add up.</i>

321
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:10,076
<i>What I deserved and
what I got were two separate things.</i>

322
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:11,778
Still fine.

323
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,615
Good hustle, though.

324
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,905
<i>To keep me quiet,
the warden honored my certificates.</i>

325
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,076
<i>Of course,
I was happy to get out, but</i>

326
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:21,870
<i>I couldn't shake the feeling
that something just didn't make sense.</i>

327
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:24,291
<i>All of us had done bad things,</i>

328
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,363
<i>but only two of us
were paying for it.</i>

329
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:53,072
<i>I didn't understand.</i>

330
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,196
<i>Karma should have been
kicking my ass,</i>

331
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,159
<i>and instead,
it was rewarding me.</i>

332
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:58,879
<i>I couldn't explain it.</i>

333
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:00,300
<i>All I knew was...</i>

334
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:02,326
<i>I was free.</i>
