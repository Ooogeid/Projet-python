1
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:03,718
Good morning, Earl.

2
00:00:04,907 --> 00:00:06,405
Good morning, Randy.

3
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:09,407
You know what team
I've always wanted to join?

4
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:10,879
The debate team.

5
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:13,757
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.

6
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:18,438
No offense, but I don't think
you'd be very good at that.

7
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:19,757
Yes, I would.

8
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:22,251
I think debating

9
00:00:22,376 --> 00:00:25,399
is more than just saying the opposite
of what the other person says.

10
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,484
No, it isn't.

11
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:28,527
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

12
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,623
This is stupid.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

13
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,666
I win.

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,960
EARL AND JOY'S ANNIVERSARY

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,191
<i>There were a few things on my list that
I'd actually done to the Crab Shack.</i>

16
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,706
<i>One of them people had gotten used
to working around.</i>

17
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:52,969
Beer coming.

18
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:01,019
<i>But it was still something
I wanted to fix.</i>

19
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,896
I'm fixing the dent, Darnell.

20
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,146
That's good to hear.

21
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,732
I tried to build a ramp over it
with disastrous results.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,756
Why would you slide it to me?

23
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:10,319
Who slides wine?

24
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,590
<i>There was a reason
why I was fixing this today.</i>

25
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:15,009
<i>'Cause it was the anniversary
of the day I dented it,</i>

26
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:18,160
<i>which was also the anniversary
of the day I married Joy.</i>

27
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,305
<i>Joy's situation forced her to be
a new wife and mother all at once.</i>

28
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,173
Damn it, baby!

29
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:27,026
You keep kicking my kidney,
and I'm gonna hold my breath again!

30
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:32,657
All right, you asked for it.

31
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,746
- What's your name again?
- Joy.

32
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,855
You got a baby in there?

33
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,392
That my brother's baby?

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
It is now.

35
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:47,669
Mrs. Hickey,

36
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:51,026
I believe you requested
I steal one of these?

37
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,404
Oh, Earl, you did it!

38
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,197
I knew we were meant for each other

39
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,225
the first time I met you
the other night.

40
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,446
Where'd you get it?

41
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,411
You walk into a bakery
wearing a hairnet,

42
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,872
you can walk out with
pretty much anything you want.

43
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:05,541
Randy?
I got you a bag of sprinkles.

44
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,771
Shut up!

45
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:08,586
It's going in the freezer.

46
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,749
If you eat it
on the one year anniversary,

47
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:12,462
you'll have good luck.

48
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:13,864
Saw it on Oprah.

49
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,256
She don't know much about marriage,
but she sure knows something about cake.

50
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:20,059
<i>That first year didn't go
the way Joy had hoped.</i>

51
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:23,434
<i>And a few days before our anniversary,
she hit rock bottom.</i>

52
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:26,751
Our belly button fuzz balls
are about the same size.

53
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,593
How do we pick a winner?

54
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:30,245
That's it.

55
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:33,757
I can't wait to eat that cake.
I need my luck now.

56
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,677
Is that skin or a piece
of Frosted Flake in yours?

57
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:43,606
- Skin.
- What the hell?

58
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,123
Somebody switched my cake
with a pile of dog turds.

59
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,459
Either one of you
know anything about this?

60
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,512
Actually, they're cat turds.

61
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,450
But I don't know anything about it.

62
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:55,479
<i>A couple days
after I stole that cake,</i>

63
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:58,653
<i>me and Randy had
a drinking contest at the Crab Shack.</i>

64
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,348
<i>I never made it home,</i>

65
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,696
<i>but unfortunately for Joy,
Randy did.</i>

66
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,485
<i>Here comes the stomach...</i>

67
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,206
Don't think I don't hear you
out there, Sasquatch!

68
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:10,477
You better not be getting
into my food in the fridge!

69
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:13,602
I hate you, too,
you bitchy old screech owl.

70
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,959
<i>Randy knew he couldn't just put
empty foil back in the freezer,</i>

71
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:22,080
<i>and that's when he realized
he could have the best of both worlds:</i>

72
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:24,508
<i>eat Joy's cake and feed her poo.</i>

73
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,874
You think this is funny?

74
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,335
Why are you getting so mad
over a little thing like this?

75
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:34,123
So, my brother replaced
our wedding cake with cat poo.

76
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,090
I'm sure it happens
in a lot of marriages.

77
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,717
It's not a little thing.
That cake was a symbol.

78
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,969
Of what?

79
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,109
I don't know. Something!

80
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:44,206
Like, that you cared about me.

81
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:47,351
And then dummy ruins it,
and you just sit there and laugh.

82
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,311
That means something, too.

83
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:55,029
I'm really sorry
I made Joy mad at you, Earl.

84
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,820
If you need a place to sleep tonight,
my couch is your couch.

85
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,030
Your couch is my couch, Randy.

86
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:01,407
So, we agree.

87
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,737
<i>Randy felt guilty for days.</i>

88
00:04:06,862 --> 00:04:08,801
<i>So, on our actual anniversary,</i>

89
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:11,110
<i>he did something
to put an end to it.</i>

90
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,140
"Dear Earl and Joy,

91
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:16,314
"I'm sorry for eating your cake

92
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,202
"so I'm going to kill myself

93
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:20,739
"at the Crab Shack at 3:00.

94
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:23,639
"I'll probably shoot myself
in the face.

95
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,672
"Stay cool. Love, Randy."

96
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,727
Surprise!

97
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,478
Happy Anniversary!

98
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:32,897
Oh, my God.

99
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:35,465
Oh, my God, Randy,
did you do all this?

100
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,277
Are you kidding me?
Earl's been planning this for weeks.

101
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,613
Why do you think
he's been such a jerk lately?

102
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,406
He was setting you up for this.

103
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,742
You did this?

104
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:47,388
I did this.

105
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:48,954
Me.

106
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,100
Thanks, Earl.
I really needed a lift right now.

107
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,301
I thought I might get it
from Randy killing himself,

108
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:55,953
but this is even better.

109
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,446
Thanks, Randy.

110
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,843
You made life better for both of us.

111
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,346
You're welcome, Earl.

112
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,639
I felt bad.
When this marriage ends,

113
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,321
I want it to be
because you and Joy hate each other,

114
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:10,796
not because of me.

115
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,105
It's been fun chatting.

116
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,983
You want to get out and go have sex?
'Cause I do. Real bad.

117
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,425
No, Donny.

118
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,403
Quit staring at me
with your crazy eyes.

119
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,552
I'll put a bag over my head
like you made me do last time we banged.

120
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,684
The reason you got lucky that night

121
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,223
was 'cause I had cramps,
and sometimes that helps,

122
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:30,454
And no hard feelings,

123
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,556
but when you're naked, you look
like you got kneecaps everywhere.

124
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:38,957
Oh, my God.

125
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,922
Mr. Stevens!

126
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:44,356
I haven't seen you
since Missy's wedding.

127
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:46,303
What's that, like, five years ago?

128
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,345
Seven.

129
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,265
And aside from my daughter,
you were the most beautiful girl there.

130
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:51,934
You are so sweet.

131
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,522
You didn't tell anybody
that we slept together that night?

132
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,004
Hell, no.
I wasn't in a rush to tell my friends

133
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,807
about humping someone's red-faced,
baldheaded, out-of-breath dad

134
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:03,958
in the back of a catering truck.

135
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,787
I'll tell Missy you said hi.

136
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:09,685
Looking good, Joy.

137
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,162
Pickup's out back, Joy.

138
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,512
- Long time, sweet cheeks.
- Shake that thing!

139
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:17,637
Hey, babe!

140
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:22,673
Who exactly
did you invite to this party?

141
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:26,343
Randy was more in charge
of the guest list.

142
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:28,220
Who'd we invite?

143
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,439
People me and you know.
Plus all of Joy's friends.

144
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,358
From her address book.

145
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:35,583
"Guys I've phoned."

146
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:39,596
Randy, it says "Guys I've boned."

147
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:41,499
That's a "B"?

148
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,895
- I thought it was an "F."
- How could you let this happen?

149
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,995
I didn't.

150
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,364
I didn't have anything to do
with this stupid party.

151
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:50,993
Wait. Yes, I did.
I did everything.

152
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,564
No, I did nothing!

153
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,122
What are you more mad about?

154
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:57,624
You didn't throw this party.
Dummy did.

155
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,329
I know.
I'm a terrible husband who never...

156
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:03,047
You're no prize, either.

157
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:06,300
What kind of wife keeps an address book
full of guys she banged?

158
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,011
The kind of wife that wants to keep
her options open for the future.

159
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,805
What? You think you're going
to find someone better than me?

160
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,119
Go for it, baby.
But keep in mind, this is Camden.

161
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:16,737
I own my own car.

162
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:18,902
I almost graduated high school,

163
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:21,647
and I have a huge collection
of cassette tapes.

164
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:23,067
So, good luck to you.

165
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,820
<i>Back then, Mr. Turtle was still young
and need to take walks,</i>

166
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:33,025
<i>and since Darnell
hadn't met Joy yet,</i>

167
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,035
<i>he had plenty of free time.</i>

168
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:37,604
<i>But that day,
thanks to some hateful bees,</i>

169
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,739
<i>their leisurely walk
turned into a run for cover.</i>

170
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,288
<i>And Darnell wasn't
the only new Camdenite</i>

171
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:46,100
<i>that the bees decided to pester.</i>

172
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,759
Quick! In here!

173
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:59,158
I just got to this country, and already
I'm invited into someone's house.

174
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,030
You must be rich.
You have a phone.

175
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:10,529
This is Phil.

176
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,449
He does mortgages down at the bank.

177
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,599
You know, 30-year balloon loans.

178
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:18,497
Has a gold pinky ring,
white shoes, brand name socks.

179
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,121
I know Phil.

180
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:23,168
We went high school together.
How's it going, buddy?

181
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,839
Oh, God!

182
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:30,092
How did I not notice that
when we slept together?

183
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,511
No wonder he didn't want to cuddle.

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,390
All the ladies
in the house say, "Ho!"

185
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,978
<i>And that's right about
when the fun ended for me.</i>

186
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:42,980
<i>Blake was my cousin,</i>

187
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,029
<i>and I'd hated him
since we were kids.</i>

188
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:47,386
<i>It all started
when our moms took us to audition </i>

189
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,422
<i>for a local backpack catalog.</i>

190
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,991
<i>I knew I could make
the Little Explorer look good,</i>

191
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,951
<i>but I just couldn't
keep my eyes open.</i>

192
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,336
<i>From that day on,
I've never measured up to cousin Blake.</i>

193
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:09,808
Cousin Blake?

194
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:12,685
That's right, Earl.

195
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,191
Blake's here 'cause he's in my book.

196
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:18,639
<i>For a while there, I didn't think
Joy could do better than me,</i>

197
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,094
<i>and now I knew she could.</i>

198
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,567
You want to know what she wrote
next to his name?

199
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,013
Absolutely not.

200
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:25,544
Gimungo!

201
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,068
You look a little surprised
to see me.

202
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,709
You must have just found out
I boned your wife.

203
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,073
It's a look I get a lot.

204
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:40,459
Still a loser and a thief,
I'll assume.

205
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:44,041
And I'm still rocking
the model thing.

206
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:51,006
<i>Blake was better than me
at everything,</i>

207
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,050
<i>so I had to do something fast.</i>

208
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,517
<i>Back then my motto was,</i>

209
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:58,101
<i>"When in doubt,
set something on fire."</i>

210
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:00,584
Oh, my God!

211
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,462
Fire! Run for your lives!

212
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,574
The whole place is going up!

213
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:07,025
<i>Nothing can keep people in a bar
when it's on fire.</i>

214
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:10,570
Killer bees! Killer bees!
Don't go out there!

215
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,532
<i>Except killer bees.</i>

216
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:15,784
Don't worry, Joy.
I'll protect you.

217
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,335
<i>So, while killer bees
were invading Camden,</i>

218
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,552
<i>I was stuck inside</i>

219
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,959
<i>having to watch my wife
canoodle with my cousin</i>

220
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,209
<i>and his backpack that was worth
more than my car.</i>

221
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,563
Nobody worry.

222
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,140
I come prepared like a Boy Scout.

223
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:40,744
A Boy Scout, that's...

224
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,110
a handsome, professional
backpack model with his own condo.

225
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,473
You worry about everyone else.

226
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,733
I'll take care of my wife.

227
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,524
All of a sudden
you care about me.

228
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:55,860
- Looks like you're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

229
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,077
I'm just doing what a husband does,
protecting his family.

230
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:02,184
So, what you going
to protect me with?

231
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,769
I got a piece of gum
and a corn dog stick.

232
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:12,465
Why the hell are you carrying around
a corn dog stick?

233
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:14,459
There's still a little
corn dog on it.

234
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,845
Sometimes, if you wait,
it loosens up.

235
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:22,851
It's not ready.

236
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,283
I've been working at Club Chubby
for a couple of weeks now.

237
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,480
So, I'm trying to figure out
my signature move.

238
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:29,482
Cinnamon slaps her ass
with a ruler.

239
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:31,679
Chantelle lets people
put gum in her hair.

240
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:34,720
I just need something to...
help me stand out.

241
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:37,618
Have you ever thought
of jumping?

242
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:43,089
That'll work.

243
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:51,209
Hey, bees just swarmed me
and my John.

244
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:53,411
I didn't have time to untie him
from the tree.

245
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:54,949
I hope he's okay.

246
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:57,769
If they're swarming people,
it means these bees are Africanized.

247
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:59,844
Those brothers mean business.

248
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,959
I don't know who you are,
but you better not be hooking

249
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:05,082
because you are
much prettier than me

250
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:08,113
and I got a teenage son to put
through hairdressing school.

251
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:11,274
We're inside a phone booth
trapped by killer bees.

252
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,361
If that's Clarence,
ask him how his ma is.

253
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:16,378
I call emergency nine times a day.
It comes with the job.

254
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,366
They got me on hold.
There's a lot of callers.

255
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,723
Good!
Barry got his ropes untied.

256
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:28,079
I got nothing on this guy, Randy.

257
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:29,334
He's beaten me again.

258
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:33,346
Just like he did with modeling
and staying cavity free.

259
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:36,016
I'm sorry about all this, Earl.

260
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,525
I didn't even get a chance

261
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,886
to show the anniversary video
I made for you guys.

262
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:43,332
You made a video
about me and Joy?

263
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:45,266
About our love
and crap like that?

264
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:46,428
Yeah.

265
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,578
I hid the camera
around the trailer for a while.

266
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,329
I got the idea off that show

267
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:54,486
where the guy catches perverts
in his kitchen every week.

268
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:55,889
He should really move.

269
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:58,017
Anyway, I took the tape
to that lady

270
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:00,532
that makes wedding videos
and breeds Taco Bell puppies.

271
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,390
Randy, that's perfect.

272
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:04,515
Put it on.

273
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,288
Excuse me, everyone.

274
00:13:08,268 --> 00:13:11,543
I made a little video I think
some of you would like to see.

275
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:13,455
It's called "Earl and Joy",

276
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:16,367
high dot, low dot,
"A Love Story."

277
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:18,818
Honey, this is for you.

278
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,450
Blake,

279
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,263
one of these fingers is for you.

280
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:55,009
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

281
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,323
<i>What happened?</i>

282
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:18,076
<i>Just 'cause
you leave me a note</i>

283
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:20,247
<i>saying I got to do something
with a bird in a freezer</i>

284
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:24,010
<i>doesn't mean I gotta drop everything
that's important to me and do it.</i>

285
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:25,885
<i>Is my name "note-reader"?</i>

286
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,337
<i>Is my name "bird-defroster"?</i>

287
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:30,412
<i>No, my name...</i>

288
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,790
That was, uh,

289
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:38,546
- clearly the blooper reel.
- Hey, cousin.

290
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,633
It looks like you're gonna need
a place to crash for a while.

291
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,344
You can stay at my pad.
I won't be there.

292
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:46,445
'Cause even though
we're 4 months from Christmas,

293
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,113
it looks like I'm gonna
be busy spreading Joy.

294
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:51,977
Son of a bitch!

295
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,940
Wait, you're from La Paz?

296
00:14:57,218 --> 00:14:58,566
Near the river of blood?

297
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:00,777
I did my Peace Corps year
down there.

298
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,215
- Small world.
- Small world.

299
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:07,323
Let me in!

300
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:13,822
Thank you.

301
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,583
Those bees are such bitches.

302
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,134
You laugh,
but that statement is factual.

303
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,071
Most of the colony
are actually female.

304
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:21,342
There're a few males

305
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,258
and their job is
to have sex with the queen.

306
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:24,419
Ick!

307
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:26,010
Worst job ever.

308
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,585
If we're the only 4 survivors
left on the planet,

309
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,183
I call the black guy.

310
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:36,343
Cut it out!

311
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:38,825
You're gonna break the bar.

312
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:40,968
That's right.

313
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,737
You might know "fujitsu,"

314
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:45,738
but my head can break things.

315
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:49,284
What do you think of that,
Mr. I'm-Better-Than-Earl-At-Everything?

316
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:52,036
Bet you can't do this.

317
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,356
Son of a bitch!

318
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:57,751
Oh, God.

319
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:00,920
Blake, go get me some cigarettes
from the vending machine.

320
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:02,082
Yeah, sure.

321
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,301
I'll just be... over there,

322
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,218
at the vending machine.

323
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,112
And I'll be waiting right here.

324
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,509
Excuse me.

325
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:20,816
Earl, this isn't right.

326
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,943
Isn't this what you wanted?
For me to get jealous?

327
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:25,624
You're jealous of your cousin.

328
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,279
It ain't got nothing
to do with me

329
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,490
or else you'd be jealous of
all these other guys, too.

330
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,910
I don't know
what you want from me.

331
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,716
Look, I'm not trying
to criticize you,

332
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,758
but jealousy,
throwing me a party,

333
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:40,491
making me a nice video,

334
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,857
those are all ways
to show you care.

335
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:45,633
And you don't do stuff like that.

336
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,570
Well, I pretended
to do all those things.

337
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:50,303
Doesn't that count
for something?

338
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:51,915
Who are we kidding?

339
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:55,136
You saw the video.
This isn't a marriage.

340
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:59,319
What did I expect, I mean,
I tricked you into marrying me.

341
00:16:59,444 --> 00:17:01,444
You didn't care about me
when you agreed to that,

342
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:04,318
and I don't think you ever will.
I wouldn't.

343
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:07,654
I'm sorry, Earl.

344
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:11,904
I think it's time we just end it.

345
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:19,152
<i>In a whole year, I had never
stopped to think about</i>

346
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:21,307
<i>whether or not
I cared about my wife.</i>

347
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:25,121
<i>In those days, I never really
stopped to care about anything.</i>

348
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,444
<i>While I was facing
the end of my marriage,</i>

349
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,819
<i>everyone else was facing
the end of their lives.</i>

350
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,129
They're gonna get in!

351
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:33,066
I can't believe
I'm gonna die today.

352
00:17:33,191 --> 00:17:35,131
I have four outstanding books
from the library.

353
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:36,940
What if that's all
it says in the paper?

354
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,515
I can't believe
I'm gonna die a virgin.

355
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:45,626
I was saving myself
for marriage.

356
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:47,529
I hope you're impressed!

357
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,482
And that you exist!

358
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,362
I can't believe I'm gonna die
without giving it up for free.

359
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:55,887
Just once
I should've done that.

360
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,413
I've always wanted
to try a threesome.

361
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:03,338
I've never kissed a man
and I want to.

362
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:06,815
Bad.

363
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:13,428
What kind of man doesn't know
if he cares about his wife?

364
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:15,562
A man in a coma.

365
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,871
Or a man who got married
over the Internet

366
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,477
and he hasn't met his wife yet 'cause
she's being shipped here on a boat.

367
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:23,903
The only person
I've ever really cared about is you,

368
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:26,868
and you're my brother.
I don't have a choice.

369
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:30,286
What if I'm just a lazy jerk
who's gonna live his life

370
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:31,946
never caring
about anybody else?

371
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:35,624
Bee!

372
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:48,922
<i>Before my list,</i>

373
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:50,607
<i>when I didn't have time
to think,</i>

374
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,064
<i>it always ended
with me doing the wrong thing,</i>

375
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:55,439
<i>like stealing
or peeing in public.</i>

376
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:58,389
<i>But not on that day,</i>

377
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,011
<i>not in that moment.</i>

378
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,045
You okay?

379
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,687
<i>I can't say that moment turned me
into a perfect husband,</i>

380
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:30,631
<i>or that Joy didn't have
to drive my drunk ass home</i>

381
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,062
<i>later that night,</i>

382
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:35,737
<i>but that was the day I knew
I could care about someone else.</i>

383
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:39,264
<i>I did care about someone else
and she knew it, too.</i>

384
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:53,344
<i>I guess you learn
what you're capable of</i>

385
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:55,241
<i>when you stare death
in the face.</i>

386
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:57,685
It's all okay!
They are gone.

387
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,826
The bees are on their way
to Texas.

388
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:04,585
This never happened.

389
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,999
<i>And when you have history
with people,</i>

390
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:14,674
<i>you'll always remember
those meaningful days.</i>

391
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,310
I think it's ready, Darnell.
Give it a shot.

392
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,812
Beer coming.

393
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:31,932
I'm sorry, Darnell.

394
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:34,652
I just got so excited, I forgot
I was supposed to catch it.

395
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,325
Happy Anniversary.

396
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,537
That was two dollars and tax.

397
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:47,957
You don't have to pay me back.
I just wanted you to know.

398
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:49,715
You're welcome.

399
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,684
I know this sounds crazy,

400
00:20:57,868 --> 00:21:00,918
but of all your wives,
I think Joy was my favorite.

401
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:02,621
Mine, too.

402
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:04,608
