1
00:00:00,374 --> 00:00:01,988
<i>Number 83 on my list was</i>

2
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:05,296
<i>"Never took the time to teach Randy
how to blow a bubble."</i>

3
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:07,924
That was closer.

4
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:09,581
This is impossible!

5
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:13,109
Come on now, I know you can do this.
I've seen you do it once before.

6
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,201
Remember when you were dating
that Camdenite girl?

7
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:18,225
Whatever happened with that girl?
I thought you were going to be an item.

8
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:22,605
I accidentally killed her.

9
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:31,197
That's cool, I guess.

10
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:38,037
I'm kidding. She is dead, though.
A terrible car wreck.

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,914
They never did find her head.

12
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:43,960
Sorry to hear that.

13
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,856
I'm just kidding.

14
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,798
We just broke up.
She's in truck driving school.

15
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:54,929
You never told me that.
You just told me the car wreck thing.

16
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,266
I've been thinking she was dead
and headless for the last five months.

17
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:01,811
Yeah, sometimes I like to let
my jokes age like fine wine.

18
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:06,564
Did Uncle Roger really get killed
by a bear last year?

19
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:09,207
Wait for it.

20
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:12,113
PINKY

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,910
That was better.
You didn't fall off your stool.

22
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,790
You go stand and face the claw machine
and think about what you've done.

23
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,257
- What was that all about?
- Blatant disrespect.

24
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,472
I told that boy to stay away
from Eugenia's daughter Tiffany,

25
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:36,851
and I come home from getting
a mole burned to find them

26
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:39,974
sitting on the Anderson's
old fridge holding hands.

27
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,019
Come on, Joy, he's got a girlfriend.
That's sweet.

28
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,523
No son of mine is gonna date something
that fell out of Eugenia's devil chute.

29
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,843
That woman is evil.

30
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:50,610
If there's a Lord above,
he'll punch her with double eye cancer.

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,573
We have reason to believe
Eugenia's been stealing our ValuePak.

32
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,727
What if I want
my closet's remodeled?

33
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:02,078
Custom blinds, air duct cleaning,
concrete resurfacing?

34
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,155
We might want
to take the family to the dentist.

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,881
Do you know how expensive that is
without a coupon?

36
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:10,880
Damn it!
Who gave him a taco?

37
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:13,564
There are no tacos in time-out!

38
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:18,387
- I feel bad for Dodge.
- It's probably for the best.

39
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,026
That little girl will just
break his heart anyway.

40
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:24,050
Build him up full of hope
with her...

41
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:26,925
sweet little smile
and pretty little eyes...

42
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,695
and then pull the rug of love
out from under him,

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,438
sending him crashing to the floor

44
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:34,663
with nothing to catch him
but the cold, cold world.

45
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,221
Bitches...

46
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:38,465
Little ten-year-old bitches.

47
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,271
<i>Randy was a little bitter.</i>

48
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:43,954
<i>His first love wasn't as great
as the '80s ballads made it out to be.</i>

49
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,789
<i>One summer, as punishment,</i>

50
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:49,042
<i>our parents sent us to the lake
for a month with your Aunt Gail.</i>

51
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:53,570
When you're finished with my laundry,
I need you to get in here.

52
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,258
I feel a rash creepin' on.

53
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,690
I need one of you
to hold up my back skin

54
00:02:57,873 --> 00:03:00,512
while the other one gives me
a good once-over with the fan.

55
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,848
I call the fan.

56
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,474
<i>After we finished our chores,
we went out and spent our allowance.</i>

57
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,249
<i>Unfortunately,
Aunt Gail paid us in rocks.</i>

58
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:16,720
<i>Randy was a master
at skipping rocks.</i>

59
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,741
<i>And I stunk at it.</i>

60
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,604
My cousin wanted me
to bring you this note.

61
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,959
Sweet. She must have noticed
I'm growing out my 'stache.

62
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:32,747
It's for the Skipper.

63
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:35,840
We call you the Sinker.

64
00:03:37,456 --> 00:03:38,456
"Skipper,

65
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:41,012
"do you like me,

66
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:43,764
"cause if you like me,

67
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:46,641
"then I like you, too.

68
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,010
"Heart, Pinky."

69
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:59,540
<i>Pinky was the first girl
who "like" liked Randy,</i>

70
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:02,115
<i>and he took full,
full advantage of it.</i>

71
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,073
She said she's gonna let me
kiss her tonight on the bridge.

72
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,889
I'm gonna try to go
under the shirt and over the bra.

73
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:47,536
I bet she stuffs her bra
with some really nice tissue.

74
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:50,990
<i>Randy waited on the bridge
for three hours that night,</i>

75
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:52,499
<i>but Pinky never showed up.</i>

76
00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:14,079
I looked for her for the rest
of the summer, but she was gone.

77
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:15,773
I never saw her again.

78
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,359
You should look Pinky up.
Find out what happened to her.

79
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:21,112
Can we, Earl?
Can we find Pinky?

80
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:24,240
That was 20 years ago.
You don't even know her real name.

81
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:25,527
So what?

82
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,539
Remember that guy I found sleeping
in the El Camino the other morning?

83
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:30,913
I didn't know his name
and he was easy to find.

84
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:33,583
It's a bad idea.
It'll end badly, I know it.

85
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,835
But knowing something's gonna end badly
has never stopped us before.

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,797
Like driving with our feet
or drinking an entire fish aquarium.

87
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:42,966
Pinky was the only girl
who ever loved me.

88
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,802
It might be crazy,

89
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,469
but Darnell's right...

90
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:49,056
I should try and find her.
Please?

91
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:53,023
Fine.

92
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:57,271
<i>It only took us 45 minutes
to get to the lake,</i>

93
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,991
<i>but it felt like 3 hours
'cause Randy changed the lyrics</i>

94
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:03,529
<i>of every song on the radio
to "Pinky, Pinky, Pinky, Pinky."</i>

95
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:07,369
1984...

96
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,871
Of course, that's a long time ago.

97
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,996
In 1984, I could lift

98
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:13,856
both arms over my head.

99
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:15,531
Now I can do is this.

100
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,228
If my nose itches,

101
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:25,300
I got to rub my face
against the side of a tree.

102
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:28,944
Anyway, her name was Pinky,
and she called me Skipper.

103
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,766
We rented a boat here once.
She used her father's credit card.

104
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,861
Well, I guess I can check
the old receipts for you

105
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:37,146
to see if I can find something.

106
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:39,482
And she had pink hair.

107
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,013
Wait...

108
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,041
Pink hair?

109
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:48,949
She's dead, son.

110
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:50,325
What? No!

111
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:51,786
Just kidding.

112
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:58,290
That is my kind of guy.

113
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:03,005
How cool is this?
It's a beautiful day,

114
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,171
I've got your best pair
of underwear on

115
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:07,640
and we're gonna find
my first love again.

116
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:10,930
That old guy's been looking
through receipts for six hours.

117
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:13,572
Just promise me
you won't get your hopes up.

118
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,779
Even if we find her, which I doubt,

119
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:17,978
she could be married
or not even remember you.

120
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:19,953
I won't get my hopes up.

121
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:22,821
But I'm sure we'll find her,
and she's going to remember me.

122
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:26,398
And if she's married, she'll divorce
so we can move to "Conncectikit"

123
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:29,258
and live together
in a little yellow house on Maple Street

124
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,993
with our three children...
Brent, Tyler and Lizzie.

125
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,995
How's that not
getting your hopes up?

126
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:37,373
Lizzie has cerebral palsy, Earl.

127
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:40,904
Well, I found her.

128
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,029
Seriously?

129
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,823
Took a few phone calls,

130
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:48,301
but I got ahold of her
a few hours ago.

131
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,927
I told her a guy named...

132
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:52,138
Skipper was looking for her.

133
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,557
She got all excited.

134
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,809
She remembers me.
Earl, she remembers me.

135
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,185
I heard, Randy.

136
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,703
She's on her way.

137
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:02,365
Said she could be up here around...

138
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,316
4:00.

139
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:07,403
And told me to tell you
to meet her on the bridge.

140
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:12,533
Oh, my God, we're late.
We're gonna miss her!

141
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:19,371
Well, what's wrong with you?

142
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:22,376
I'm just worried
it's going to end badly.

143
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:24,462
What did she sound like?

144
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:29,410
She sounded like
a real ride on the A-train.

145
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,730
Not that I could do
anything about it now.

146
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,598
My penis lost all feeling in 1993.

147
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,851
A couple of years ago,

148
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,519
I lit a match to it.

149
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:41,929
Nothing.

150
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,516
People are living too long,
I tell you.

151
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,135
Too damn long.

152
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,699
There she is.

153
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:56,827
Wait... How am I?

154
00:08:58,853 --> 00:08:59,853
Not great.

155
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,416
Boogers?

156
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:03,655
Three mediums...

157
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,628
and a large.

158
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,172
Breath?

159
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,083
Fritos, and I'm gonna say...

160
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:14,343
olives.

161
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:18,502
Let's do this.

162
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:24,878
Pinky?

163
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:35,632
Oh, snap!

164
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,425
Oh, snap!

165
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:42,552
Oh, snap!

166
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,529
Oh, snap.

167
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:50,993
What the hell is going on?

168
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,930
Are you guys playing
some kind of joke on me?

169
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,680
- Where's Skipper?
- I'm Skipper.

170
00:09:58,013 --> 00:09:59,015
Shut up.

171
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:02,727
I am. I'm Skipper.
I still have that note you gave me.

172
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:05,052
I keep it in my wallet
in that plastic sleeve

173
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:07,440
where grown-ups keep
their credit cards.

174
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,686
How come you didn't
show up that night?

175
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:15,948
What are you talking about?
You broke up with me.

176
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,050
- I didn't.
- Of course you did.

177
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:20,286
- It was in your note to me.
- What note?

178
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:22,684
The note your brother gave me.

179
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,249
The note he gave me.

180
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:28,867
<i>Though it didn't occur to me that Pinky
would turn out to be Joy in a wig,</i>

181
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:31,047
<i>this is what I meant
when I said it would end badly.</i>

182
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:34,611
<i>You see, I hadn't been
completely honest with Randy.</i>

183
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:36,239
<i>Every day Randy spent with Pinky</i>

184
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:39,817
<i>was another day I was stuck
doing chores for Aunt Gail by myself.</i>

185
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,612
<i>While Randy was having
the time of his life,</i>

186
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:49,837
<i>I was wishing my life would end.</i>

187
00:10:57,939 --> 00:10:59,929
<i>I was both miserable and jealous.</i>

188
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,742
<i>While Randy was having fun,</i>

189
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:05,564
<i>I was being forced to look at
my almost naked Aunt Gail in such detail</i>

190
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:08,167
<i>that I can still close my eyes
and paint her today.</i>

191
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:10,145
<i>By the time
my little brother told me</i>

192
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,547
<i>he was going to get to kiss
a girl before I did,</i>

193
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,022
<i>I had had enough.</i>

194
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:16,363
<i>I decided to get there early
and end it.</i>

195
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,680
"Dear, Pinky, I found someone else.

196
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:22,819
"If this upsets you,

197
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:25,154
"go cry into one of your boots.

198
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,341
"I hate you, Skipper."

199
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:29,989
Sorry.

200
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:34,161
<i>That's when I decided I might be able
to kill two birds with one stone...</i>

201
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:37,363
<i>I could have Randy back and
make sure I kissed a girl before he did.</i>

202
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:42,221
Pedophile! Pedophile!

203
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,294
How could you do that?
She was my first love.

204
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:53,452
Love? Please.

205
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:55,965
It was chilly on the lake
and you blocked the wind.

206
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,094
It was 20 years ago, I was a kid.

207
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:06,644
I had to hold Aunt Gail's
back fat all by myself.

208
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,029
It was slippery, I needed you.

209
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:17,511
- Can I have a ride?
- Whatever.

210
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,674
So, I've been dreaming about
kissing Randy all these years?

211
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,499
Now I'm questioning
my taste in everything.

212
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,018
Like, is Darnell really hot?

213
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:29,468
Are Christians really the best?

214
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,985
Maybe I don't even like Sinbad.

215
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:33,903
Oh, God, I feel sick.

216
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,599
What are you doing?

217
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,328
I'm not sleeping
next to you anymore.

218
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:50,098
And good luck cutting
your own toenails

219
00:12:50,223 --> 00:12:52,438
and clipping your own nose hairs
from now on, too.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,483
I can't wait to have a front row seat
to that train wreck.

221
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:57,735
Come on, Randy.
You're being crazy.

222
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:00,029
You think I'm crazy?

223
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,199
- I'll show you crazy!
- Buddy, brother!

224
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,456
Remember? You're my brother.

225
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:06,581
Same mom.

226
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,722
I'm the only one who knows
how to write a check.

227
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:10,923
I've read your list.

228
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:13,042
I take it in the bathroom
when there are no comics,

229
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,293
this isn't on it!

230
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:17,713
Why would you spend so much time
teaching me how to blow a stupid bubble

231
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,749
when you could have been
making up for this?

232
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:22,093
Because I was too ashamed
to put it on the list.

233
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,178
But, look, it's on here, now.

234
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,669
#277: Broke up Randy and Pinky.

235
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:31,494
I'm not going to do another list item
until I make up for this.

236
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,588
Let's figure this out.

237
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:38,024
How can I make this right?

238
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,606
I want to make out with Pinky.

239
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,109
You can't really want
to make out with Joy.

240
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:43,834
She's horrible to you.

241
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,921
You took away my opportunity
to share a kiss

242
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:47,795
with the one girl
that ever loved me.

243
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,231
I know on the outside, Joy looks mean
and on the inside, she is mean,

244
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,488
but somewhere inside that is Pinky,

245
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:55,793
and I want to touch
that part of her with my tongue.

246
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,796
If you want to cross me off your list,
you need to make it happen.

247
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,392
<i>Getting Joy to make out with Randy</i>

248
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:05,428
<i>was gonna be
the hardest thing I ever had to do.</i>

249
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:08,941
<i>But, out of respect,
before I even asked her,</i>

250
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,267
the 1st thing I had to do
was get permission from Darnell.

251
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:13,686
Fine with me.
Skipper was part of Joy's prenup.

252
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:21,317
Oh, my God.

253
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:27,729
I will spend the rest of my life
with you, Darnell Turner.

254
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,866
Let's figure out our freebies.
Mine's my first love, guy named Skipper.

255
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:31,996
What's a freebie?

256
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,863
We pick one person we can have sex with
if we get the chance,

257
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:36,232
and anything goes.

258
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:38,958
You don't even have to use a condom
if you don't want to.

259
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,283
Oh, my God. We're getting married!

260
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:45,746
I still can't believe
her freebie is Randy.

261
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:48,508
Makes me feel better
about picking Anna Nicole Smith.

262
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:51,265
Yeah, she got pretty fat,
didn't she?

263
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,299
- She's dead.
- No.

264
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:55,875
She's dead, man.

265
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:59,017
Come on. You're kidding.
You're trying to get me back

266
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:01,692
for me and Randy messing with you
about the Camdenite girl.

267
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:05,029
I'm not kidding. She's dead.
A couple years now.

268
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,119
To Anna Nicole.
One of the good ones.

269
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:13,989
Damn straight.

270
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,443
<i>With Darnell's permission,
I was clear to try and seal the deal.</i>

271
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,166
You got to be out of your mind.

272
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,353
Come on, Joy, it's just one kiss.
What's the big deal?

273
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,679
- Darnell's cool with it.
- No means no, Earl.

274
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,515
My body, my choice.
Hear me roar. Kiss my grits.

275
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:42,787
Son of a bitch.

276
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:45,225
The more I tell him he can't
hang out with Eugenia's daughter,

277
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,348
- the more time he spends with her.
- He won't listen to you.

278
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:51,284
No kid takes dating advice
from their parents.

279
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:55,227
Fine, you break up my son
and that future street walker,

280
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:58,133
and I'll allow Randy
to kiss me with his slimy,

281
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,833
Cheeto-covered, cow-sized tongue.

282
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:04,880
You sure you gonna do this?

283
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:07,425
Yeah. I've had worse things
in my mouth.

284
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:11,539
<i>I normally don't do
mean things to children,</i>

285
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,913
<i>but I was going to have
to put Tiffany on my list</i>

286
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,412
<i>to cross Randy off it.</i>

287
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:18,976
"Dear Tiffany,
I never want to talk to you again.

288
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:22,473
"If you ask me about this note,
I will say I never wrote it,

289
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,609
"but I did, so don't even ask me.

290
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:26,902
"I hate you. You smell like poo."

291
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,731
I'm sorry, I'm just the messenger.

292
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:37,998
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.

293
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,087
And you shouldn't tell
anyone about this.

294
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:42,721
Nobody needs to know.

295
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:45,159
- It can be our little secret.
- Pedophile!

296
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:56,093
I'm not a pedophile.

297
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,725
<i>With Dodge and Tiffany broken up,</i>

298
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,623
<i>Joy agreed to keep good
on her promise</i>

299
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:02,274
<i>to tongue down my brother.</i>

300
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:10,279
Hello, Pinky.

301
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,200
Skipper.

302
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,785
So, I thought we'd start
with a little orange soda.

303
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,724
Your favorite,
if I remember correctly.

304
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,582
Then we could listen to Bobby Brown,

305
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,535
also your favorite if memory serves.

306
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,623
And we could play tic-tac-toe.

307
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:28,714
I believe our record stands
at Pinky 87, Skipper zero.

308
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:30,549
It's been 20 years.

309
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,599
I traded in orange soda
for strawberry wine when I was 13,

310
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:35,408
and I stopped listening
to Bobby Brown

311
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:37,598
once he started picking doody
out of Whitney Houston.

312
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,098
Let's just get this over with.

313
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,850
Swish this around in your mouth
like you're washing your mouth with it.

314
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:44,657
- It's called mouthwash.
- I know what mouthwash is.

315
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:48,082
We used to drink it
when Dad would lock up his whiskey.

316
00:17:50,596 --> 00:17:52,196
Yuck, that's not mouthwash!

317
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:55,657
Nope. It's rubbing alcohol,
bleach and green food coloring.

318
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:57,844
I didn't think Scope alone
would kill whatever lives

319
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,997
inside that disgusting petri dish
you call a mouth.

320
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:02,284
All right.

321
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,860
Let's do this.

322
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:16,973
This is stupid.

323
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,474
No, come on.
Just get it over with.

324
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:24,186
If you don't do it within 10 seconds,
you gonna have to take another swig.

325
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,826
It's not about the kiss.

326
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,962
I want to feel something
I felt when we were kids,

327
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,407
and it's not gonna happen.

328
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,360
It's never going to happen again.

329
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:40,155
<i>Ever since Joy found out
Randy was Skipper,</i>

330
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,080
<i>she stopped remembering Skipper
and could only think of Randy.</i>

331
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:46,846
<i>But something about seeing him
skip those rocks made her go back,</i>

332
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:51,592
<i>back to a simpler time
where two kids, full of innocence,</i>

333
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,617
<i>spent their summer together.</i>

334
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:58,973
Oh, snap.

335
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:09,783
Oh, snap.

336
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:13,853
<i>She remembered
how sweet Randy was...</i>

337
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:17,966
Oh, snap.

338
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,576
<i>... and how much he loved her.</i>

339
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:26,779
<i>No matter how crazy it was
to Joy now,</i>

340
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,717
<i>Randy was her first love,</i>

341
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:31,529
<i>and I didn't just rob Randy
of what he had that summer,</i>

342
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:33,054
<i>I robbed her, too.</i>

343
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:41,639
Do you still like me?

344
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:23,299
I forgot how nice that was.

345
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:25,665
Me, too.

346
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,877
I think I should let Dodge
spend some time with Tiffany.

347
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:33,765
You should.

348
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:36,535
Everyone deserves to feel like that.

349
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,310
Even if it's just once.

350
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,877
You have that with Crab Man
all the time, huh?

351
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,794
You're lucky.

352
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:48,464
I know.

353
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:52,919
I think I'm going to have that
with someone one day, too.

354
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:55,888
So do I, Randy.

355
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,501
So do I.

356
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,805
Oh, what the hell?
You're my freebie.

357
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,305
