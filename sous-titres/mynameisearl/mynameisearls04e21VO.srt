1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:02,501
WITCH LADY

2
00:00:05,156 --> 00:00:06,690
<i>On a slow day at the Crab Shack,</i>

3
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:10,427
<i>me and Randy liked to bet on who
was gonna come through the door next.</i>

4
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:13,468
I think it's gonna be
a Chinese guy named Townsend.

5
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:16,993
Randy, no Chinese guy
named Townsend's ever come in here.

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,899
I'm feeling pretty confident.

7
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:21,062
I already called a black chick
named Henrietta.

8
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:25,835
Chinese Townsend.

9
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:34,313
Crazy Witch Lady!

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,982
I heard that
if her shadow falls on you,

11
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,652
your blood freezes
and your heart falls out your butt.

12
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,327
I've heard that, too,

13
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,781
but I got to go talk to her.

14
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:51,842
<i>She was #186 on my list:</i>

15
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:54,308
<i>"Was mean to the Crazy Witch Lady."</i>

16
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:57,848
<i>Every town has a spooky old lady
who lives in an even spookier old house.</i>

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,893
<i>In Camden, ours happened to be
on my way to school.</i>

18
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:04,058
<i>But every time
I tried to cut across her lawn,</i>

19
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:05,991
- <i>she would chase me away.</i>
- Get away!

20
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:07,983
My birds are buried there!

21
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,319
<i>So I came up
with a plan to get even.</i>

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,601
<i>A plan that involved
superglue and food coloring.</i>

23
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>A plan that I'm ashamed to say
I still think is pretty awesome.</i>

24
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:21,789
<i>When everything was ready,
I sprang my trap.</i>

25
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:23,441
<i>911.</i>

26
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:25,497
There's a Crazy Witch Lady
trying to eat a kid

27
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,753
at the corner of Fourth and Pine.
Come quick.

28
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:38,062
I have no respect for your property!

29
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,016
I'll get you.

30
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:46,313
You're trampling my hemlock!

31
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:51,736
Help! Crazy Witch Lady's
trying to kill me.

32
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,532
Sweet mother of God,
drop the broom, Witch Lady.

33
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:01,287
- I can't!
- Do it now, kid eater!

34
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:12,824
So, I just want to say
how sorry I am.

35
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:14,223
Mrs...

36
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,094
Sorry. I don't know your real name.

37
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:19,902
Young man, you are the first person

38
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,725
who has bothered
to ask me my name in years.

39
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,227
Griselda Weezmer.

40
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,144
I know.
It doesn't help things much.

41
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:32,359
There's got to be something I can do
to make is up to you.

42
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:34,004
I do get lonely.

43
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,907
Maybe you could come over for tea
tomorrow afternoon.

44
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,243
I'd like that.

45
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:43,572
I hear good things about tea.

46
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:50,580
Look at that cross-eyed old goofball.
God broke the weirdoes stick on her.

47
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,465
- That's not very...
- Hold on. I got more.

48
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,166
She's creepier than babies with glasses.
She smells so bad,

49
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,099
when she sits in the sand,
the cats try to bury her.

50
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,632
Listen. I've been waiting
for a time to bring this up

51
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,492
that wasn't premenstrual,
menstrual or postmenstrual,

52
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:07,238
but I think I'm gonna jump in.

53
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:09,806
Why do you always have
to say those kind of things?

54
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:13,178
Here we go. Always sticking up
for nearsighted babies.

55
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:16,237
It's not just nearsighted babies.
You say mean things about everybody.

56
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,863
It's not mean if people laugh.

57
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:20,574
What about when they cry at it,
like Eugenia did yesterday?

58
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,967
She set me up.

59
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,137
She said she thought
she could be a plus-size model.

60
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:26,872
I had to say,
"Yeah, plus-size model home."

61
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,085
One person cried, six people laughed.
That's all I'm saying.

62
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,991
<i>The next day,
me and Randy drove over</i>

63
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:35,341
<i>to Mrs. Weezmer's house
so I could have tea with her.</i>

64
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,133
Come on. I need you in there
to keep the conversation popping.

65
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,825
You like talking
about the same things old ladies do,

66
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,099
- like socks and joint pain.
- Say, that reminds me.

67
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:48,082
Last week, my sleeping socks
came out of the dryer so damn fluffy,

68
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:49,645
my knees didn't hurt all day.

69
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,814
See? This is great stuff.
She'll eat it up.

70
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:53,161
No, she won't,

71
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:55,358
'cause I'm not going in there,
it's suicide.

72
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,861
She'll lop off your head,
make pudding out of your blood

73
00:03:57,986 --> 00:04:01,984
and trick people like me into eating it,
and I'll do it, because I love pudding.

74
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,535
Even if she doesn't give me a spoon,
I'll find a way.

75
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,127
Fine. I'll go by myself.

76
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:08,956
I'll see you in an hour,
'cause my head will still be on.

77
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:16,062
<i>When I was kid, there was no way
I'd have been caught dead</i>

78
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,304
<i>having tea with Griselda Weezmer,</i>

79
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:21,329
<i>but as a grown man,
I saw that I misjudged her.</i>

80
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,904
<i>Sure, she was a little odd.</i>

81
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,972
These are my mother's teeth.

82
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,684
<i>Okay, a lot odd,
but she was harmless.</i>

83
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,202
Your mom's teeth?

84
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,664
That's quite a...

85
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,380
Rise and shine.

86
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,006
What's going on, Griselda?

87
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:52,541
This is a little weird.

88
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:55,044
Last week,
I would have agreed with you.

89
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:58,631
Truth is, I haven't thought about
what you did in years,

90
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,925
but your big apology
brought it all back.

91
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:03,092
In a good way?

92
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:08,849
And then I got thinking about the things
that people have done to me.

93
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:13,103
That angry mob that tried to drown me
in the lake to see if I'd float.

94
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,489
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

95
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:18,359
I was just drinking beers
and watching from a house boat.

96
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,388
And then, yesterday,
when you went blabbing on,

97
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:23,263
I thought, "Griselda,

98
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,753
you know what you should do?

99
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,534
"Lure him to your house,

100
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:29,327
"drug him,

101
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,114
"and then stick him
in the basement."

102
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,703
So that's just what did.

103
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:36,854
Well, it worked.

104
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:39,254
I'm totally freaked out.
This is a...

105
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,873
real pants-crapper.

106
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,797
I guess we're even, huh?

107
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:45,715
You little scamp.

108
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,401
You'll never see daylight again.

109
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,518
<i>When I didn't come back out
to the car,</i>

110
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,236
<i>Randy worked up his nerve to go
knock on the Crazy Witch Lady's door.</i>

111
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,320
I'm looking for my brother

112
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,941
or any parts of him you
haven't made into pudding.

113
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,994
Goodness.
I didn't turn him into pudding.

114
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:11,787
We just had some tea.

115
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,605
He's in the video game room

116
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,817
playing with my wrestling action figures
and watching naughty movies.

117
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:19,169
And what other things
do boys like you enjoy?

118
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,547
I think you've hit everything
except for peanuts.

119
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:23,799
And there's a big bowl of peanuts.

120
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,217
I'm coming in.

121
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:41,508
Come on, lady.
Just please let me and my brother go,

122
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,599
and we'll forget
all this ever happened.

123
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,954
Let you go?

124
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:46,453
Don't be silly.

125
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:49,658
I couldn't possibly.
I'm having such fun.

126
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:53,287
You know what you could have
even more fun with? Money.

127
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:56,065
Thank you, but no amount of money

128
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,189
can beat the look of terror
in a fresh victim's eyes

129
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:01,253
as he takes a header
into the coffee table.

130
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,837
The feeling is exquisite!

131
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:08,343
It's what I always imagined
an orgasm might be like.

132
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:20,229
Where am I?

133
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:23,025
Locked up
in Mrs. Weezmer's basement.

134
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:25,487
We're gonna die!

135
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,193
And it's gonna hurt!

136
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,999
I guess this is good-bye, head.

137
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,049
Thanks for all your hard work.

138
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:37,814
<i>Apparently, Mrs. Weezmer
had a reason to be mad at Randy, too.</i>

139
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,798
<i>A few years ago,
he'd come up with a plan</i>

140
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,686
<i>to get rid of the Crazy Witch Lady
once and for all.</i>

141
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:48,578
Why aren't you melting?

142
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,459
Come on, melt, bitch!

143
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:52,688
Okay, so she's mad at both of us.

144
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:55,641
Let's just stay calm
and think of a way out of this.

145
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,108
Sorry.

146
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,552
Stopped breathing
for a second there.

147
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,987
<i>Meanwhile, above ground,
Joy was still ticked off</i>

148
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:23,612
<i>that Darnell didn't think
she was nice.</i>

149
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,410
Hey, loser...

150
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,589
If you had to describe me
in one word...

151
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:28,714
Mean.

152
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:30,278
Let me finish.

153
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,050
... and it couldn't be "hot,"

154
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,429
- what word...
- Mean.

155
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:37,349
Not "hilarious"?

156
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:42,897
Here's one.

157
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:46,108
If you had to describe Darnell
in one word,

158
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:48,531
and it couldn't be "black,"

159
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,576
what word would you use?

160
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:53,853
Can't use "black"?

161
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:56,548
It's a toughie.

162
00:08:58,315 --> 00:08:59,665
How about "nice"?

163
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,773
I'm gonna go with "great."
Or "marvelous."

164
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:06,545
I'm really going back and forth
between great, marvelous and nice.

165
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:09,459
All right, fine.
You can use "black."

166
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,313
<i>After an hour of trying
to come up with an escape plan,</i>

167
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:14,234
<i>Randy thought he had something</i>

168
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,221
Step 1: we catch a mouse.

169
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,999
Step 2: we teach him sign language.

170
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:19,975
Step 3:

171
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,603
we throw him as hard
as we can up that chimney.

172
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:25,564
Someone's up there.

173
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:29,535
- We should yell for help.
- Okay, let's yell on three.

174
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:36,998
Damn it.

175
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,369
Since when does everybody like tea?

176
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,377
So you're telling me her MO is to kidnap
people she want revenge on?

177
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,123
Yeah,
but she's not just going after Mos.

178
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,216
She's taking straight guys, too.

179
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:55,385
I've never seen this woman before,
let alone done anything to her.

180
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:58,027
And I'm sure you haven't, either.

181
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,933
<i>Kenny shouldn't have been so sure.</i>

182
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:04,897
My fault?! How could this
possibly be my fault?

183
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:07,579
Look, ma'am,
I don't want to offend you, but, uh,

184
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:11,026
you fit a certain profile that we,
in law enforcement, call a whackjob.

185
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:12,861
But I'm not hurting anybody.

186
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:15,072
Yes, but you're different,
and that's bad.

187
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:19,371
We all have parts of ourselves
that are wrong and weird and shameful,

188
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:22,308
but it's our responsibility
to bury those parts very deeply

189
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,831
and go bowling
with our straight friends.

190
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:27,858
Good day, madam.

191
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:37,219
Don't give me that look.
You are turning into your mother.

192
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,013
Guys, blaming each other
isn't going to help us.

193
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:42,975
You were a cop. How do people
get out of this kind of thing?

194
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:44,338
They don't.

195
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:48,146
We used to find mutilated skeletons
chained up in basements all the time.

196
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:51,185
We never saved a single person.

197
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,651
No tears.
We've got to be strong, Bear Cub.

198
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:19,802
<i>Back at the Crab Shack,</i>

199
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:23,588
<i>Joy was getting desperate to prove
she was as good a person as Darnell.</i>

200
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:27,298
See, what people don't realize
is I got tons of, like,

201
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:28,562
secret inner niceness.

202
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:32,065
Well, niceness really is best
when no one ever gets to see it.

203
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,236
You're just trying to get me
to snap at you, but I won't,

204
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:38,922
because I am full of super niceness.

205
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:43,311
How can I help...

206
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:44,624
Witch!

207
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:47,504
Sorry.

208
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:49,523
- Hello.
- Pardon me.

209
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:52,836
I wondered if you could come
to my house and do me a favor.

210
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,759
Of course, I will do you a favor,
ghoulish old lady.

211
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:03,273
Because I am a nice person,

212
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:05,337
and favors are what nice people do.

213
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:15,388
Oh, my God, it's Joy.

214
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:16,985
This one's nasty.

215
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:20,155
She took a swipe at me
on her way to the floor.

216
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:22,839
<i>I wasn't surprised to see Joy.</i>

217
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:26,777
<i>A few years ago, somebody told her
it was good luck to push over a witch.</i>

218
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,253
Idiots, idiots.

219
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:38,173
If just one of you butt-nuts had been
man enough to stop the biddy,

220
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,021
she wouldn't have gotten to me.

221
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:42,337
Are you just down here
waiting to starve to death?

222
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,673
No, Joy.
We tried screaming.

223
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,886
And Randy's got a great mouse plan
we can pull out if we ever see one.

224
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:49,935
If you have a better idea,
we'd love to hear it.

225
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:53,211
Nope. Seems like you guys
covered every reasonable base.

226
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,816
All that's left for me
is to be an idiot and call 911.

227
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,193
She's got a cell phone!

228
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:00,445
Can I check my e-mail?

229
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:03,448
This is what I was talking about.
You have a media disease.

230
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,993
What the hell?
They put me through to voice mail.

231
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:09,371
It's 3:30 on a Friday.

232
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,624
Sharon's probably knocked off.
Her boyfriend got a house on the lake.

233
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,021
I'm calling Darnell.

234
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,521
He was a government assassin,
and he takes vitamins.

235
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:19,685
You might want to watch and see how
a real man handles this kind of thing.

236
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:27,725
Crap.

237
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:31,105
That sack has the same
ring tone as Darnell.

238
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:34,633
I wouldn't drink the tea,

239
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:37,230
so she whacked me in the head
with a giant ceramic rooster.

240
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:41,409
If you're here, then you must have done
something nasty to the old biddy, too.

241
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,115
See, y'all, Mr. Perfect can be
just as mean as anybody.

242
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,294
Who's the black calling
the kettle pot now?

243
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,821
Tell what you did.

244
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:50,405
Actually...

245
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,086
Hey, Darnell.
You see that lady over there?

246
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,090
- Which lady?
- That crazy lady over there.

247
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,225
- Which lady?
- That lady.

248
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,429
- Which lady?
- That lady!

249
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:08,828
Which lady?!

250
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,263
Son of a bitch, Darnell.

251
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:22,276
It's like I married Jesus nicer brother.
Makes me want to kill somebody.

252
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:24,779
Let's start with the woman
that locked us up.

253
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,855
That's a good idea.
I learned on the force

254
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,392
that if you punch an old person's head
from the correct angle,

255
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:31,431
their skull pretty much
turns to powder.

256
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,365
Let's do this!

257
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,840
She's coming.
Tell me the angle!

258
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,586
Hi, everybody.

259
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,963
How did you find us?

260
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,301
What are you doing?

261
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,834
Mrs. Weezmer lured me over here
and tried to drug me,

262
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,365
but I've had so many roofies
slipped in my drinks,

263
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,228
I've developed quite a tolerance.

264
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:57,501
She was trying so hard,
and she looks a little like my aunt.

265
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,668
Anyway, here I am.

266
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:03,790
<i>Like Joy, Catalina had grown up with
a lot of superstitions about witches.</i>

267
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:06,823
And just when the little blind boy
turned to the tree and said:

268
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,450
"Mommy, why is the floor so cold?"

269
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:12,213
The frozen lake cracked under him...

270
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:14,579
and he drowned.

271
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:17,749
That is so sad.

272
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:23,164
I did it!
I captured the tear of a witch.

273
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,839
I shall live forever!

274
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:32,928
Seriously, what the hell is
with sticking people in burlap sacks

275
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,601
- before you kick them down the stairs?
- It's more dramatic.

276
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:41,349
She's right. It is dramatic.

277
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,412
No, I never did anything bad to her.

278
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,563
The old bitch is just crazy.

279
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:49,880
I can't tell you the number of times
I've been out working

280
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:52,728
and she's been standing there
and staring at me.

281
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,649
It's creepy is what it is.

282
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:58,706
And she wonders why I took
Dad's side in the divorce.

283
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,169
She's my mom.

284
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,130
Hookers have moms?

285
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:09,592
Patricia!
As long as you are under my roof...

286
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,350
and my kitchen floor,

287
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:13,512
there will be no smoking
in this house.

288
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:15,932
What are you going to do, ground me?

289
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,643
If grounding worked, you wouldn't be
sleeping with men for money

290
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,850
and food and gasoline.

291
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,692
Now, what was I here for?

292
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,817
Oh, yes.

293
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,485
- I'm going to kill one of you.
- What?

294
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:32,490
I have a lot more people to kidnap,
and we're running out of space.

295
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,284
Now,

296
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:36,037
I'm not a monster.

297
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:40,149
I'm going to let you folks decide
which one of you I stab and stab

298
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,767
and stab until you're dead.

299
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:46,813
Not it!

300
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:49,473
Good luck, suckers.

301
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,540
<i>It's bad enough being kidnapped
and chained in a basement,</i>

302
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:57,619
<i>but when the kidnapper tells you
to pick somebody to get stabbed,</i>

303
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:00,001
<i>relationships show the strain
pretty fast.</i>

304
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:01,995
Everybody, calm down.

305
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,568
- We got to figure out what to do here.
- We know what to do.

306
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:08,318
We decide who we'll miss the least,
and the others get on with our lives.

307
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,360
Good idea.
I say we give her the bitch.

308
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,430
You better be talking
about your boyfriend.

309
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,432
That's the kind
of mindless hate speech

310
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:16,980
that proves the world would
be better off without you.

311
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:19,704
But if I don't get the votes for that,
I say we snuff the whore.

312
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,094
- Why?
- Hookers are killed every day.

313
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:24,354
Face it, you're living
on borrowed time.

314
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:27,356
Darnell, you're a nice guy.

315
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,464
Why don't you just volunteer
to be killed?

316
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:32,384
I'll give you a ride to the airport,
but I'm not dying for you.

317
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,802
Nobody's going to die.

318
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:37,697
She's just going to stab
and stab and stab one of us until...

319
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:41,745
Oh, my God.

320
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,685
New front-runner: the dumb guy.

321
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,275
Of course. The dumb guy.

322
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,020
Why didn't we think of it before?

323
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:50,985
If we lie to him, he won't realize
what's happening until it's too late.

324
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,118
I heard that.
You burn in hell, stripper!

325
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,782
Look what we're doing to each other.

326
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,502
It's exactly what we did
to Mrs. Weezmer.

327
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,309
Again, never did anything to her.
Totally innocent and still might die.

328
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,581
- Welcome to being gay.
- Don't you see?

329
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,244
We labeled her as the Crazy Witch Lady,
and now we're labeling each other.

330
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:11,809
The bitch, the nice guy,
the gay guys, the stripper.

331
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,709
- Freaking Karma zombie.
- Okay, that, too.

332
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:17,262
But maybe this is what
Karma wants us to learn.

333
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:18,558
Look, guys.

334
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,975
When you label somebody,
you stop seeing them as a real person,

335
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:25,019
and suddenly, you can do
all kinds of terrible things to them.

336
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,055
And pretty soon, they stop seeing
themselves as a real person, too.

337
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,230
They just turn into that label.

338
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:33,817
Yeah, so Mrs. Weezmer acted crazy,

339
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,352
but after 20 years of people
treating her the way we did,

340
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:37,877
can you blame her?

341
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,499
Mrs. Weezmer,
we're all real sorry for what we did.

342
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:48,793
Do you mean that?

343
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,992
If you're going
to kill someone, kill me.

344
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:54,674
But I know you won't, 'cause...

345
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,384
you're not really crazy.

346
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,803
We drove you
to act like this because...

347
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,054
of what we did.

348
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,932
It's okay.

349
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:04,893
It's all okay now.

350
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:12,679
Crazy Witch Lady stabbed me!
It hurts so much!

351
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,491
Sorry, Mom.

352
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,016
Collect her tears!

353
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,027
We can all live forever!

354
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:28,058
<i>Turns out, Mrs. Weezmer was crazy,</i>

355
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:31,243
<i>and so the courts placed her
in a home for the mentally frazzled,</i>

356
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:34,542
<i>where they could give her the help
and care she needed to get well.</i>

357
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,740
<i>And we all found ourselves
making a little extra effort</i>

358
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:40,668
<i>not to let other people's labels
define who we were.</i>

359
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:44,553
<i>Joy did what she could to show Darnell
she really could be nice.</i>

360
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,429
Here's some sugar peas
for my sugar pea.

361
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,312
Hope you enjoy it.

362
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,147
<i>And Darnell knew
Joy would be happier</i>

363
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,775
<i>if she didn't feel like
she was married to a saint.</i>

364
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:55,610
Bitch, I hate peas!

365
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,407
Thanks, baby. That's all I need.

366
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:04,340
Just act like a mean bastard
every once in a while.

367
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,939
<i>And I decided
to spend a day relaxing</i>

368
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:11,042
<i>and show that I wasn't always just
"that guy with the Karma list."</i>

369
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,029
<i>And Randy got himself
a "word of the day" calendar,</i>

370
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:22,337
<i>so he could show people
he wasn't always dumb.</i>

371
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:26,441
This beer obviates the need
to go to the Crab Shack.

372
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,027
Obviate.

373
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:31,241
<i>And Patty?</i>

374
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,182
<i>Patty was called a lot of things,</i>

375
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:35,989
<i>but the one label she never
really lived up to was daughter.</i>

376
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,864
<i>She decided to fix that.</i>

377
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,938
<i>And after Mrs. Weezmer
spent some time</i>

378
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,802
<i>being seen as a mom
instead of a crazy witch lady,</i>

379
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,077
<i>she was well enough to come home.</i>

380
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:54,591
<i>And that gave us a chance to treat her
like a person with no labels at all,</i>

381
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:58,164
<i>which meant that I could finally
cross her off my list.</i>

382
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,942
I'll do it later.
