1
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,633
Forget what we saw.

2
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:11,093
We're here, and I don't want
to waste any more time.

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,555
I've been keeping a secret from you.
Keiko... she's in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,911
Keiko Arahida.
Your mom has posted your bail.

5
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:20,519
This ring is
a quantum entanglement device.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,397
This little thing prevents
people from blacking out?

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,316
- Hellinger wants to help you.
- Who?

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,400
Our boss.

9
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,695
You're going to die, but your daughter's
gonna be better off when you're gone.

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,157
They had me install a software.

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,659
I can find out who made it
and where it came from.

12
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:37,703
You get me into NLAP.
I'll tell you who caused the blackout.

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,247
Janis, this guy has been
lying to us about everything.

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,292
Now you want to take him to NLAP?
How the hell do you trust this guy?

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,419
- Her heart has stopped beating.
- She's gone.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,924
You do the math.
You're both part of the equation.

17
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,456
I cannot be in that house
with you tonight.

18
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:53,552
At 10:00 P.M.,

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,388
<i>you have to here with me.</i>

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,047
On April 29th, I'm gonna be on a bender.
So why not start now?

21
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,478
Today's the day daddy's a die.

22
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,707
Why are we stopping, mom?

23
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:31,936
'Cause we're just gonna
sit here for a while.

24
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,716
Look! That one's shaped a star.

25
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,253
Look at that, mom.

26
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:02,421
<i>Flight number 37...</i>

27
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,883
I'm looking for a Keiko Arahida.
I believe she's being held here.

28
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,304
Was. She was released an hour ago.

29
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:24,872
- Did she say where she was going?
- Not in English.

30
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,188
Do you have a phone number for her?

31
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:30,858
There's gotta be some
sort of intake file, right?

32
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,563
You got a warrant, officer?

33
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:47,552
Listen, this Keiko...
I've never met her.

34
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,092
But I saw her in my flash-forward.
I started drawing her.

35
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:54,762
I have 20 canvases
in my house of her.

36
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:57,724
She was wearing this t-shirt
of a Sushi restaurant

37
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,304
just outside of Tokyo.
So I flew to Japan.

38
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,872
I flew to Japan
because of a t-shirt.

39
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:06,126
But I didn't find her.
I didn't find her,

40
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,020
and I thought that was my only shot.

41
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:13,067
I know that she's here in L.A.,

42
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,050
and now maybe
you have a phone number.

43
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,408
She changed my life
just because I saw her.

44
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,288
That was really your flash-forward?

45
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,259
It was.

46
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,334
That's amazing.

47
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,250
Because in my flash-forward...

48
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,135
I had $100 in my pocket,

49
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:41,220
and I couldn't figure out
for the life of me how it got there.

50
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,635
This isn't right.

51
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:53,482
I saw her alive.

52
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,902
So did you.

53
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:02,723
I saw her.

54
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,922
- A pulse?
- Yes. Very faint.

55
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,482
Stay with me, Trace.

56
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,336
I'm begging you.

57
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:30,102
Stay strong.

58
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:32,027
Stay with me, Tracy.

59
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:34,557
Stay with me.
Just live,

60
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,387
and we'll wind up
where we're supposed to be.

61
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,125
That's it...

62
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,944
The La Honda access point.

63
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,741
This is mile 6 of the accelerator's
10-mile length.

64
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,836
We get in there,
I can get to the mainframe,

65
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,934
find the software
Hellinger's men had me install,

66
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,139
and use it to destroy them.

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,646
You'll use it
to help us identify them.

68
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,761
Right. That's the deal.

69
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,777
One of us needs to get this device close
to the security guard's access card.

70
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:26,259
Then it'll transmit
its code to my cell phone.

71
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:30,204
We'll just get the rig close
to the security guard

72
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,343
that we're trying to completely avoid.
That sounds simple. Good stuff, Simon.

73
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,734
This is gonna
get us inside the gate.

74
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,214
This is gonna get us
inside everything.

75
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:44,354
I know you don't trust him.

76
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,359
I trust you.

77
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,975
If you're here, I'm here.

78
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:54,660
- What's the matter? What's going on?
- I don't know.

79
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:57,731
Something's not right.
I think I did it back in my apartment.

80
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,693
- We're going to the hospital.
- We have to do this tonight.

81
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,716
We're not gonna get a second chance.

82
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,898
The FBI's not gonna let him
near that machine.

83
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,493
Catching whoever is behind the blackout
is more important than anything else.

84
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,124
I need you to do this.

85
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:13,998
Please. Do it for me.

86
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:37,354
Don't tell me
I won't regret doing this.

87
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,234
I already do.

88
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:44,123
Let's go.

89
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,165
-= Blackout Team =-

90
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,468
Saison 1 - Episode 22
-= Future Shock =-

91
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,921
Your snapping
on Hellinger like that...

92
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,990
I take some responsibility.

93
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,561
- I let it happen.
- What the hell are you talking about?

94
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:10,328
We were so focused on finding
when the next blackout is,

95
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,658
I haven't seen
what's been going on with you.

96
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,002
I've been meaning to talk to you
about your priorities lately.

97
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:28,193
<i>Sir, we've found two bombs
in the FBI with timers.</i>

98
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:30,574
- <i>There are probably more.</i>
- Call in the bomb squad.

99
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,942
I'm on my way.

100
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,843
Guess you're coming with me.

101
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:51,804
Hands on the wheel.

102
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,228
Hands on the wheel.

103
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,740
Get out of the car slow.

104
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,102
Slow!

105
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:01,271
- I need help!
- Ma'am, what are you doing here?

106
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:04,911
What's taking so long?

107
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:07,444
She has to get the reader closer.

108
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,322
Trying to find
Pacific State Hospital...

109
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,222
- on Old La Honda.
- Ma'am?

110
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,209
- Come on!
- That looked real. She was hurting.

111
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,171
I need an ambulance
at La Honda access point.

112
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,213
He's getting her to a hospital.
Come on.

113
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:31,135
We should be home now.
It's almost 10:00.

114
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,377
We're not.

115
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,511
So then...

116
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,934
things can change?

117
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,128
What are you doing here?

118
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,922
Sweetie, why don't you take Dylan
to the car and go get him a juice box?

119
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:58,361
Come on, Dylan.

120
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,666
How did you find us?

121
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,750
Actually...

122
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,253
my people called your people.

123
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:08,547
The bodyguards?

124
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,692
In my flash-forward,
I think I was on the verge

125
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,636
of figuring out something crucial,
but I think for that to happen,

126
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,512
I have to be at your house.

127
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,808
I have to recreate those conditions.

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,014
Why don't you let yourself in?
You recreate all conditions you want.

129
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:24,229
Listen to me.

130
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,552
You're part of it...
you and Charlie.

131
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:29,735
It's like Gabriel said.
You're part of the puzzle.

132
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:32,112
- How, exactly?
- I don't know.

133
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:33,650
I just know that you are.

134
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:36,575
This is bigger than you and me.
We can't stop it. I've tried.

135
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,953
- Mark pushed me away to save...
- No, I can't push you away.

136
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,258
Don't you understand?
I can't do this alone.

137
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:43,207
You should.

138
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:47,864
You're part of the equation,

139
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,915
and I cannot do it without you.

140
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,099
What are you doing here?

141
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:05,062
- Did you find her?
- They just released her.

142
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,564
I got a contact number for her.

143
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:13,904
It's the restaurant where I saw her
in my flash-forward.

144
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:15,816
Turns out it's in L.A.

145
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:17,896
It's all coming true for you.

146
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,994
Look, Bryce, I...

147
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:24,413
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

148
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,854
She flew all the way
across the Pacific Ocean

149
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:28,085
to meet you, and I...

150
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,729
I tried to keep you apart.

151
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,459
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,277
This whole thing is my fault.

153
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:40,847
I'm sorry.
I've been ignoring the truth,

154
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:43,754
the feelings that I had.

155
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,435
I know it sounds crazy,

156
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,795
but I love her.

157
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,079
This whole thing with her

158
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,909
was meant to be.

159
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:55,577
I put these on this morning

160
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,432
without a second thought.

161
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,103
It wasn't until half an hour ago
that I realized

162
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:04,037
this is what I was wearing

163
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:05,839
in my flash-forward.

164
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:08,542
I gotta go.

165
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,128
You should go.

166
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,098
<i>All liquids, gels and aerosols</i>

167
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,020
<i>must be in 3-ounce
or smaller containers.</i>

168
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:33,138
Hear me out. Wait.

169
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:34,836
Whoever put those bombs in there

170
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,839
is targeting something specific.
So we need to figure out what.

171
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,952
So help me,

172
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:40,587
all the glorious choirs of heaven,

173
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:43,648
if you step out of this car,
I will have your head on a plate.

174
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:45,793
I'm gonna send over a driver.

175
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:47,440
Stay in the car.

176
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:53,271
You need a friend,
so I tracked him down for you.

177
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:57,198
Someone to keep you company
while you wait.

178
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,572
Aaron, it's Mark.

179
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,698
<i>Where are you?</i>

180
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:05,999
<i>I'm okay, but I talked to Wedeck,</i>

181
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:08,122
<i>and I need to know
what's going on with you.</i>

182
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,173
I don't know.

183
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:13,539
I just kind of lost it.

184
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:14,685
And then...

185
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,416
And then I started to drink.

186
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,148
You know...

187
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:26,241
Sometimes what happens
in the world makes us forget

188
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,390
<i>it's all up to us.
We have choices...</i>

189
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,473
<i>you, me...</i>

190
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,274
<i>You choose what's next, you'll wind up
right where you're supposed to be.</i>

191
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:40,735
<i>Take care of yourself, Mark.</i>

192
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:53,373
Been celebrating?

193
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:55,898
A little.

194
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:58,409
Had to get back
to the office, though.

195
00:13:58,534 --> 00:13:59,588
Loose ends.

196
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,537
There's nothing
to see up there, Mark.

197
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,175
It's a fool's errand.

198
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,553
Last time I listened to you,
I took my eyes off the prize.

199
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:09,333
Not gonna happen again.

200
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:12,924
I have to go.

201
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,705
Got a little errand to run.

202
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,173
- Can I see it?
- Come on. It's upstairs.

203
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:36,259
I want cookies after.

204
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:38,585
- Dylan, that's not how we ask.
- It's okay.

205
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,799
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

206
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:42,297
- My house is your house, too.
- It's my house, too.

207
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:44,372
So...

208
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,205
9:33.

209
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:53,681
27 minutes till your epiphany.

210
00:14:57,718 --> 00:15:00,263
I think I'd better get to work.

211
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,274
All right.

212
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,404
So how does this work?

213
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,853
We just take our positions at 10:00,

214
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,785
wait for your breakthrough?

215
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,828
I think I'll keep
my shirt on this time.

216
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,627
What the hell?

217
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:35,225
- I don't know.
- Open this door.

218
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,315
- I don't know what happened.
- Now, Simon!

219
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,146
- I don't know what happened.
- I knew you'd try to pull something,

220
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:42,849
you sociopathic, lying son...

221
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,523
You're welcome. Come on in.

222
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,367
- Your friend asked you to trust me.
- Janis wanted me to help you.

223
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:55,078
I do not trust you.

224
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:01,793
This

225
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:04,629
is the last piece
of leverage I have left.

226
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:10,427
And now you have it.
Let's get to work.

227
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:12,360
Shall we?

228
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:22,488
<i>Confirming devices
on floors 5, 6 and 10, over.</i>

229
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:23,732
You got a det time?

230
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,144
<i>Affirmative.
36 minutes and counting.</i>

231
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:27,971
Copy that.

232
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:31,114
Any update?

233
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:32,773
Bombs.

234
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,619
We've located them
on at least 5 floors.

235
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,506
This is bigger than Hellinger.

236
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,315
Yeah. He's just a link in the chain.

237
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:41,291
They're coming after Mosaic.

238
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,086
Are you about to do
what I think you're about to do?

239
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,004
Your chances of making it
are not good.

240
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:50,634
I need you to do something for me.

241
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,752
If they're coming after Mosaic,
Lloyd Simcoe is not safe, either.

242
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,473
Now I've got this covered.

243
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,016
I'll secure Simcoe.

244
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,934
- You can find him at...
- Your house.

245
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,770
It's what I saw. It's...

246
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,484
It's where I'm going, right?

247
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:08,143
Right.

248
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:09,694
Lock it down.

249
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:11,154
You should know

250
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,115
I also saw myself
telling another agent you were dead.

251
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,872
Lloyd Simcoe's key.
We need him alive.

252
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,082
Same goes for you.

253
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,507
I'll keep that in mind.

254
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:33,635
<i>Mom, come here!</i>

255
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:38,932
My God.

256
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,585
He got into your lipstick
and just started writing.

257
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,944
It's the formula
in my flash-forward.

258
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,416
This is what I saw.

259
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,988
How is that possible?

260
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,769
I always assumed I'd written it.

261
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:03,729
I guess Dylan must have memorized it
this afternoon.

262
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:05,002
Is he in trouble?

263
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:10,004
Can we get cookies now?

264
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:11,960
Sure.

265
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:14,384
Charlie, why don't you take
Dylan downstairs

266
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,838
show him where they are?

267
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:18,440
I will, but he already knows.

268
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,079
Come on, Dylan.

269
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,561
What is this?

270
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,396
What does it mean?

271
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:30,265
This equation somehow links the QED,

272
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,995
the blueprints and the flash-forward

273
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,301
all together.

274
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,804
But it's a math problem, right?

275
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:40,034
How would it possibly tie
all those things together?

276
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:43,720
It's the tachyon constant.

277
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,751
It's the greatest mystery
in all of quantum physics.

278
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:53,158
And now I have to solve it.

279
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:57,082
Right now.

280
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:06,786
<i>Evacuate the entire building!</i>

281
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:11,733
Clear, blue team! Clear!

282
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,704
I've been waiting for you.

283
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,074
I'm really happy to see you.

284
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:36,993
Everything's gonna be okay.

285
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:38,489
That's what we saw, right?

286
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:40,261
I haven't felt her move in 3 hours.

287
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,306
We're gonna get you an ultrasound.
Ready.

288
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,283
He's where?

289
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:48,874
He's in the building

290
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:50,073
with the bombs.

291
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,072
Where I left my car keys.

292
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,403
We've got 23 minutes until the building
goes. We've gotta get him.

293
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:04,723
The answers will come.

294
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,265
You sound so certain.

295
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:11,384
At 10:00 P.M.,
the answers will come.

296
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:14,385
Because they will.

297
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,795
It's not a matter of equations.

298
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,100
It's not about

299
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,326
the 2 of us just...

300
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,304
physically being here.

301
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,146
It's about this moment.

302
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:28,698
Right here.

303
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:33,785
I've fought it and resisted it,

304
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:37,790
and yet here it is.

305
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,327
It happened.

306
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,288
The future happened.

307
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:56,296
All of it?

308
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,733
- Somebody means business.
- Yeah, you got that right.

309
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,048
You want up or down?

310
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:20,529
Down.

311
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,232
Go for it. I got you covered.

312
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:35,752
I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

313
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,300
I'm sorry.
You can't come in.

314
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,386
Please. I'm supposed to meet

315
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,388
a woman here.
I learned Japanese.

316
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:14,916
Thank you.

317
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,757
Try a different street, please.

318
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,244
When I can get to one.

319
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,482
I mean, the traffic's nuts.

320
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:34,249
I need to go.

321
00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:36,020
Thank you.

322
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,100
<i>All right, everybody.
It's almost 10:00.</i>

323
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,066
<i>5 more minutes
till we catch up to our future!</i>

324
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,485
You installed the software.
Now you can't find the file?

325
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,195
I'm just not seeing it yet.

326
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,281
- Beer?
- Beer?

327
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,491
Helps me cogitate.

328
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:33,953
You know, Janis is gonna be okay.

329
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,141
How do you know?

330
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:37,886
She saw it in her flash-forward.

331
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:40,653
All right let's get going.
Someone could walk in here any second.

332
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,213
It's almost 10:00.

333
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:48,411
I'm supposed to send Lloyd a text.

334
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,391
What is that, math?

335
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,478
It's an equation
for a damped 1-dimensional wave.

336
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,373
It was Lloyd's e-mail signature
for years.

337
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:03,955
A damped wave.

338
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:06,608
He used to call it
his "tearful good-bye."

339
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:09,171
That's cute.

340
00:24:09,676 --> 00:24:10,893
Is that physics humor?

341
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:12,784
I'm supposed to send him something.

342
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:13,961
He saw it.

343
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,206
An inside joke for an inside joke.

344
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,612
<i>4,</i>

345
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:25,681
<i>3,</i>

346
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:26,677
<i>2,</i>

347
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:27,516
<i>1!</i>

348
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:29,512
<i>It's 10:00, everybody!</i>

349
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:00,282
It's the text from Simon.

350
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:03,921
A wave.

351
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,040
Good God.

352
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,239
I have to make a call.

353
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,310
- It's me.
- <i>Did you crack it?</i>

354
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,146
The constant I've been looking for,
it isn't a number.

355
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:26,607
It's a wave.

356
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,720
<i>If I plug the wave into the blueprint
equation, I get an interval,</i>

357
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,863
which if added to the previous blackout,
tells us...

358
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,217
Tells us what, Lloyd?

359
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,011
As precisely as I can tell,

360
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:40,454
the next blackout is sometime
in April 2010,

361
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,747
<i>which means it's in the next 2 days.</i>

362
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:45,376
<i>Are you still there?</i>

363
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:47,669
April?

364
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:49,380
April 2010?

365
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:25,462
The baby's fine.

366
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,770
Good heartbeat.

367
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:30,171
But...

368
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,214
it's a boy.

369
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:34,437
It's a boy?

370
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,676
You disappointed?

371
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,101
Just surprised.

372
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,517
Future is like that.

373
00:27:32,223 --> 00:27:34,039
We're almost through this thing.

374
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,446
Finally go back
to the way things used to be,

375
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,199
where the only stuff we see

376
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,227
is what's right in front of us.

377
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,413
Welcome to the future.

378
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:48,804
Who did this?

379
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:51,192
The strings are different.
They moved.

380
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,718
Make it look right.
You make it look right.

381
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:14,086
April...

382
00:28:16,884 --> 00:28:17,695
Black...

383
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
Out.

384
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:23,421
"T."

385
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:26,495
"T."

386
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,582
"E."

387
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:33,878
"N."

388
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,421
"F."

389
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,966
"O. U."

390
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,135
"R."

391
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,220
"T."

20
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:44,412
"E."

21
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,675
"E."

392
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:46,891
"N."

393
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,059
P.M.

394
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:56,130
April 29th.

395
00:28:57,956 --> 00:28:58,956
10:14.

396
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,815
The blackout,

397
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,350
it's in 12 minutes.

398
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,680
The command system
won't let me access it.

399
00:29:26,805 --> 00:29:28,250
What was it you said earlier?

400
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,893
Now the only thing we can see
is what's right in front of us?

401
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:34,021
Whoever did this may have copied
the entire mainframe,

402
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,399
created some kind of clone.

403
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:39,537
- So what you're looking at is a...
- A fake,

404
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,738
designed to prevent me from getting in.
They knew I'd be back.

405
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,951
Remember me?

406
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,493
Now all I have to do is backdoor

407
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,744
into my archived account,

408
00:29:50,366 --> 00:29:51,705
compare the system,

409
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,418
- compare the code...
- I don't understand a thing.

410
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,509
- You got it?
- Downloading

411
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:04,834
it for you now.

412
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,736
I don't know who you work for,
Mr. Hellinger, but whoever they are,

413
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:11,865
they won't be very happy
that you didn't prevent this...

414
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:13,658
Not at all.

415
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,062
Done.

416
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:17,940
Whatever you'll need
to track the bastards is in here.

417
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,016
Sweetie, go.
Go play with Dylan.

418
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:30,532
Mark Benford

419
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:31,871
is dead.

420
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,414
He ran into the building.

421
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:35,220
Doesn't have a chance.

422
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,823
Are you okay?
Careful.

423
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,362
What happened?

424
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:37,433
You went off the road into the lake.

425
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,960
I wasn't even sure you were with us.

426
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:43,484
Then I pulled you out of the car,

427
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,075
and you started fighting me.

428
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,286
Come on. You must be freezing.
Here.

429
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,657
There.

430
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,372
It's okay. It's okay.

431
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:58,083
In my flash-forward,

432
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:00,587
I saw myself saving you.

433
00:32:01,911 --> 00:32:03,435
And all these months...

434
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,279
I thought maybe I failed.

435
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,775
I'm really happy that I didn't.

436
00:32:16,763 --> 00:32:17,810
You saw me?

437
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,392
An ambulance is on its way, okay?

438
00:32:27,594 --> 00:32:28,654
My name's Ed.

439
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:36,598
What?

440
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:39,373
What is it?

441
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,692
Someone's accessing the mainframe
from outside.

442
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:44,670
- What does that mean?
- It's a different command system

443
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:46,626
originating off-site.

444
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,637
They have control.

445
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:54,899
<i>Commencing activation sequence.</i>

446
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,099
What have you done, Simon?
Get away from there.

447
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:42,394
Put your hands up! Now!

448
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,877
You lying.

449
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:10,412
I didn't do this, Demetri,

450
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,009
not then and certainly not now!
I'm going to let them do this to me.

451
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:16,345
I won't let them turn me
into a monster,

452
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,721
to use my machine, my mind.

453
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,350
Millions of people, Demetri,

454
00:34:21,616 --> 00:34:23,560
millions of people
don't deserve to die.

455
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,289
You want to stop me?

456
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:30,484
You want to stop me,
trying to shut this machine?

457
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,569
Then you're going to have
to shoot me.

458
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:19,843
<i>It's Mark.</i>

459
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,720
You're still in the building?

460
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:23,497
<i>Get the hell out now!</i>

461
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:24,991
The next blackout,

462
00:36:25,272 --> 00:36:26,558
I figured it out, Stan.

463
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:30,896
It's gonna be at 10:14 P.M.
Pacific tonight. Call the White House,

464
00:36:31,312 --> 00:36:32,795
<i>EBS, NTSB,</i>

465
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,194
<i>everyone.</i>

466
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:37,820
This place is about to go
in three minutes. Move now!

467
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,366
Make the call, Stan.

468
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,846
Assistant Director Stanford Wedeck.

469
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,623
Put me through
to the White House now.

470
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,890
<i>Credible information

471

<i>Livy, listen very carefully.</i>

473
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,237
The next blackout's about to happen.

474
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,154
Take Charlie,
get her somewhere safe.

475
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,701
<i>It's gonna happen
in about two minutes.</i>

476
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,562
Tell her I love her.

477
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:30,739
I love you both.

00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:32,416

00:37:33,141 --> 00:37:34,376
<i>Good-bye, Livy.</i>
