00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,014
<i>Over here!</i>

2
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,907
Please, help me!
Please!

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,508
Someone, please! Please!

4
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,372
Demetri!

5
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:41,707
Demetri!

6
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:52,433
"No More Good Days"

7
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:57,731


8
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,940
<i>Good morning, Los Angeles.</i>

9
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:05,766
<i>It's 7:00, and it looks like
it's gonna be another beautiful day.</i>

10
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,892
<i>We're looking at light clouds
and highs in the mid 70s today.</i>

11
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:12,029
<i>Keep that umbrella handy because
we've got a chance of sprinkles later...</i>

12
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:16,993
{\YOU'RE A CRAPPY HUSBAND
I HATE YOU}

13
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:42,957
I hate you, too.

14
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,968
Babe, don't forget
to look at the garage door.

15
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,643
It's acting up again.

16
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,003
Already forgotten.

17
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:56,446
Bye.

18
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,072
<i>Just because I'm a squirrel
doesn't mean I like acorns.</i>

19
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:04,885
Smells good.

20
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:10,155
Here you go, my princess.

21
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:24,851
<i>Te ayudo.</i>

22
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:27,730
- Hey, Hector.
- <i>Buenos dias.</i>

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,650
Hey, Nicole.

24
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:34,320
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Don't worry.

25
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:37,375
Olivia's working the late shift
at the hospital tonight.

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,920
- You can stay an extra hour or two?
- No problem.

27
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:41,952
- I've got studying to do.
- You're a saint.

28
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,444
<i>Hey, this is Bryce.
You know what to do.</i>

29
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,137
Bryce, it's Olivia.

30
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:52,639
You weren't around yesterday.
You better have a damn good reason why.

31
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:53,964
You call me immediately.

32
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,216
I'm worried about you.

33
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,415
{\3 MISSED CALLS
DR OLIVIA BENFORD}

34
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,101
My daughter Tracy was 5'5",

35
00:03:52,214 --> 00:03:53,555
118 pounds.

36
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:54,973
But...

37
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,404
when the marines shipped her body
back from Afghanistan...

38
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:01,709
Sorry.

39
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,412
Her remains...

40
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,828
They weighed 37.

41
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,863
Only reason I knew it was her at all
was

42
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:11,942
because they DNA'd what was left.

43
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:15,489
So...

44
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,001
I took a drink that night.

45
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,462
You call Amanda yet?

46
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:31,889
- Yeah, we're talking.
- You're talking? Really?

47
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:35,564
That's kind a weird because she told
Olivia she never heard from you.

48
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:39,167
I'm your sponsor. I'm the one
who's supposed to be riding you,

49
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,529
not the other way around.

50
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:44,742
All right. I'm getting around to it.
Come on, Aaron. Just call. She's cool.

51
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,553
- Nurses freak me out, man.
- It's a date.

52
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,998
- She's not giving you a friggin' enema.
- How do you know that's not my thing?

53
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,932
- What's wrong?
- I thought I heard Charlie.

54
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:09,934
Charlie's asleep.

55
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,312
- This is so wrong.
- Which is why you love it.

56
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,564
As soon as we're done,
you have to get out of here.

57
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,983
All right, well,
stop talking and get to work.

58
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:26,200
So then we get to the subject
of the first dance, right?

59
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,413
I'm sorry, but Zoey picks one of
the corniest songs of all time...

60
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,959
"Islands in the Stream."

61
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:37,099
The old
Kenny Rogers/Dolly Parton duet.

62
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,746
Okay, and we used to sing it
when we did karaoke,

63
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,980
but that was when we were,
like, really drunk, you know?

64
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:45,552
I put up with it because we were dating,
and that's what you do.

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,420
But my friends will be there,
my family.

66
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:49,595
I cannot dance
to "Islands in the Stream."

67
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,271
I will never live it down.

68
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:53,185
You don't care about
any of this, do you?

69
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,237
I do. I do care.
I'm riveted. I'm fascinated.

70
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,324
But, what do you want me to say,
don't marry her?

71
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,634
Don't marry her.
The odds are against you anyway.

72
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,949
That's good. Thank you.
You're still married.

73
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:09,618
I'm surprised Olivia didn't leave me
a long time ago.

74
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:11,325
Me, too, buddy.

75
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:14,232
So what'd you guys dance to?

76
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,790
I can't even remember.

77
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:33,809
He's a holy terror.

78
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:36,131
Terrible twos at one year.

79
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,231
- You're lucky you have a girl.
- Are you kidding me?

80
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:41,572
You only have to worry
about one penis.

81
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:43,797
I gotta worry about all of them.

82
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:47,698
Here we go.

83
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:51,816
Showtime.

84
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:55,845
Khalid, Omar, unknown female
going mobile in a black S.U.V.

85
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,709
<i>You're on point.
They should hit you in 20 seconds.</i>

86
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:03,672
FBI. Janis Hawk.

87
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,589
It's Benford. Get Wedeck.
Suspects are on the move.

88
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,677
Three weeks.
Finally getting interesting.

89
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,057
- Mark, I'm putting you on speaker.
- What do you got?

90
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:16,711
Khalid, Omar and an unidentified
Caucasian woman.

91
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,687
We're e-mailing you
pictures right now.

92
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,689
Who is she?

93
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,650
That's the "unidentified" part,
sweetheart.

94
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,274
Get this to Digital Forensics
and run it by I.C.E.

95
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,618
They made us.
They're on the move.

96
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:44,671
Holy!

97
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:54,908
Come on! Get some backup!
Get some backup now!

98
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,518
- All right, all right.
- Suspects fleeing west on 6th!

99
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:00,521
Black Escalade, license plate 8,
"Queen," "Robin,"

100
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,730
7-2-2, "Young."

101
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,305
We need L.A.P.D.
and air support now!

102
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,627
- Drop! Car!
- Calm down!

103
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:11,152
- Car!
- Shut up!

104
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:16,161
- What are you laughing at?
- I don't know.

105
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,704
Never done this before.

106
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780


107
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:14,928


108
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:50,682
<i>We need help!</i>

109
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:59,124
Please help me!

110
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:22,169
- Dr. Benford, what happened?
- I don't know.

111
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,089
I lost consciousness.

112
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,248
You okay?

113
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,667
Nicole?

114
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,881
- What happened?
- I blacked out.

115
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:44,142
Help!

116
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,478
Demetri!

117
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:48,836
Demetri!

118
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,030
Calm down.

119
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,650
All right, sir. Okay.
Try to calm down.

120
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:28,409
Look out!

121
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:52,705
Mark! Over here!

122
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,429
Are you all right?

123
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,721
Yeah, I think so.

124
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:04,965
We were driving, right?

125
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,977
- I blacked out.
- Me, too.

126
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,102
Help me!

127
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:11,935
- All right, move aside. Move aside.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

128
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:16,318
- Stay calm. We got you.
- Yeah, got him.

129
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:18,403
Get back! This thing could blow.

130
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:21,119
All right, we gotta call this in!

131
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,031
We gotta call 911.

132
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,490
Trust me, they know.

133
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:27,762
Try the office. See if they can
tell us what the hell happened.

134
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,399
Somebody!

135
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,848
They're not moving! Help!

143
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,826
Just hold on! I'm a doctor!
I'll be right there!

144
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:11,014
Crap. Charlie!

145
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:19,923
Are you okay?

146
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:22,300
I had a bad dream.

147
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,607
I dreamt there were
no more good days.

148
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:35,148
Can't get my family.

149
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,636
- That's our SUV.
- That's what I was thinkin'.

150
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,379
Help me!
Can you hear me?

151
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,535
Go this way!
Get up and move it around!

152
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,166
Hands up! Hands up!

153
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:56,984
I got her.

154
00:13:58,195 --> 00:13:59,504
Get out. Come on.

155
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:02,507
Get out. Get out!
We know you were planning an attack.

156
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:04,571
What did you do?

157
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:06,970
- Tell me! 
- Take it easy.

158
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,664
We know about the suitcase.

159
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,099
- Did you set it off? Answer me!
- I blacked out.

160
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,351
I was somewhere else.

161
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:15,312
There was a storm.

162
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:17,355
The horses were scared.

163
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,024
What are you talking about?

164
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:21,289
- What are you talking...
- Calm down!

165
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:24,029
Does this look like a dirty bomb to you?
We don't know what this is.

166
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,406
- Maybe they weren't even involved.
- Are you guys cops?

167
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:27,908
FBI. It's okay.

168
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,091
- What happened?
- I don't know.

169
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,037
It's gotta be the big one.
I mean, look. Look at this mess.

170
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,721
- It's gotta be.
- When's help getting here?

171
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:38,001
Look, until
emergency services arrive,

172
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,756
we need to stay calm and help
whoever we can, all right?

173
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,756
- They ain't comin'.
- What?

174
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:46,023
I just heard on my radio,
some guy in San Diego.

175
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,452
They're dealing with the same thing.
It's more than just L.A., man.

176
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:53,349
Sit down.
You move, I shoot.

177
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:00,774
I can't get through to Zoey.
What about Olivia?

178
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:03,234
- No.
- Listen, Zoey's in Seattle right now.

179
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:07,361
But Olivia's close by, right? Hospital's
2 miles. You can make it on foot.

180
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,616
- No, I can't just leave...
- We can do nothing here right now.

181
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:13,787
Okay? Go check on your family. Go!

182
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,649
Help me!

183
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:54,141
Look out!
Move!

184
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,664
Watch out! Look out, man!

185
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:00,750
Hey! Son of a...

186
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:47,076
<i>There are</i> <i>thousands and thousands</i>

187
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,714
<i>of injured people</i>
<i>waiting for emergency...</i>

188
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,606
<i>All we know for certain</i>
<i>is that everyone on the planet</i>

189
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:55,555
<i>seemed to have blacked out</i>
<i>at exactly the same time.</i>

190
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:59,601
<i>... Confirming that the blackout was
a worldwide phenomenon. Officials are...</i>

191
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:05,413
<i>Fire services and police services are
completely overwhelmed at this time.</i>

192
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:07,063
<i>... En este momento.</i>

193
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,470
My God.

194
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,362
It's the whole world.

195
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:14,157
<i>... Information as to the cause of
the blackout.</i>

196
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,377
<i>Hospitals are overflowing.</i>

197
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,788
<i>Fire services and police services</i>
<i>are completely overwhelmed...</i>

198
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:22,332
Livy!
Livy, I'm here.

199
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:25,959
- Oh, thank God! I got ahold of you.
- What about Charlie? Is she okay?

200
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,380
She's fine. Nicole called. She can
stay put till one of us gets home.

201
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,423
- And you're all right?
- <i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

202
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:34,930
We were in the middle of surgery
and we all lost consciousness.

203
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,055
Everyone. Patient died
while we were out.

204
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,414
I'm downtown right now.
Same thing.

205
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,642
So what?
Everyone there blacked out?

206
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:45,605
Yeah. We thought it was the hospital,
but Corrie got a call from her mother

207
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,690
in Chicago.
Same thing happened there.

208
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:49,359
Looks like it was global.

209
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,398
Global?
That's impossible.

210
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:53,822
Oh, I love you,
but, babe, I gotta go.

211
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,890
All right, I love you. Livy?

212
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,160
8-year-old boy.

213
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,681
Pede versus car, plowed straight
through a fence at a school.

214
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,634
- Head injury...
- Dr. Benford!

215
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,460
Bryce, where were you?
Go get into your scrubs. Meet me in E.R.

216
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,754
Okay, let's get him into trauma.
You're gonna be okay, honey.

217
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,007
I know, Olivia.

218
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:13,508
How did you know my name?

219
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,283
- What have we heard from Washington?
- Same. Everyone's gathering intel.

220
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:24,477
CIA, Homeland Security.
Our various legats offices overseas.

221
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,145
Nobody knows anything.

222
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,931
- How's he doing?
- He's taking a turn for the worse.

223
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:31,283
I got no breath sounds on the left,

224
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,820
possible punctured lung.
He needs a left chest tube stat.

225
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,655
We don't release the pressure soon,
his heart will stop from beating.

226
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,741
Sats dropping.

227
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,525
- What is this? Worldwide phenomenon.
- Near as we can tell.

228
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,705
Every people losing consciousness
at exactly the same moment.

229
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,309
And for the same duration...
2 minutes, 17 seconds.

230
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:48,234
How is that even possible?

231
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,589
Where the hell is that chest tube tray?
I need it <i>now!</i>

232
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,842
We got no pulse. Blood pressure's 40.
What are we gonna do?

233
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,302
- Come on, sweetie. Hang in there.
- Pulse ox 90.

234
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,804
Pulse ox 80.
We're dropping!

235
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,224
- We're losing him!
- No pulse. No pulse.

236
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,893
Blood pressure's dropping.

237
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:08,062
So we've eliminated nuclear launches,
EMPs and chemical agents.

238
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,522
A natural phenomena then?

239
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:12,043
NASA's checking into
more exotic explanations...

240
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:15,570
Solar flares, gamma bursts, that kind of
thing. But so far they've come up empty.

241
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:18,795
What about the Vatican?
Has the Pope chimed in yet?

242
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,034
Let's get this chest tube in.

243
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,870
Sats improving, B.P.'s normalizing.

244
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,089
Pleur-evac.

245
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:30,251
Doing great, buddy.
Doing real good.

246
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,464
Let's get him into the C.T. scanner,
check out that head injury.

247
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,718
Bryce, you close him up.
Nice job.

248
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,154
But you're not off the hook. I still
wanna know where you were yesterday.

249
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:46,601
We need to wrap our heads
around the scope of this thing.

250
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,938
It's now been four hours
since the blackout.

251
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:53,818
You shut off the consciousness
of the entire human race

252
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:55,641
for two minutes.

253
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:57,653
What would the death toll be?

254
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,507
How many cars collided?

255
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,211
We have planes down at L.A.X.

256
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,368
How many more across the country?
Around the world?

257
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:07,667
F.A.A.'s reporting 877 aircraft down
in the United States alone.

258
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:12,084
Air Force Two was one of 'em.
The veep was on board.

259
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,226
What about hospitals?
Operations?

260
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:18,094
Births that were in process.

261
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,843
People probably died
walking up a flight of stairs.

262
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:24,418
Global projections
are pretty staggering.

263
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,308
What about
the blackouts themselves, sir?

264
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:29,394
What about them?

265
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:33,106
Well, we've been saying
people have been blacking out, but...

266
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,068
that wasn't my experience.

267
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,571
For me, it was...

268
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:44,492
more like a dream,
only more vivid than that.

269
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,827
One second, I was in a car.

270
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,664
The next...

271
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,918
- I was somewhere else.
- Yeah, the same thing happened to me.

272
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,582
During the blackout,
people seem to have experienced

273
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:58,673
some kind of... hallucination.

274
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:03,845
Except that mine didn't <i>feel</i>
like a hallucination.

275
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,515
- What's your point?
- I didn't just lose consciousness.

276
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,290
It felt more like my...

277
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,351
consciousness went somewhere else.

278
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:12,804
Like I was having a memory,

279
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:15,611
only it... it wasn't of the past.

280
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,360
It was of the future.

281
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:23,255
I was in my office.

282
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,131
It was night.

283
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:28,494
It was 10:00 on the hour.
I was looking out into the atrium,

284
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,539
and I happened to see the date...

285
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:35,418
April 29, 2010,

286
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,586
about half a year from now.

287
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,920
Hold on.
April 29th?

288
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,390
I saw the same date.
It was on the news.

289
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,470
Same for me, April 29th, 10:00 P.M.

290
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,468
So you're saying what,

291
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:49,418
everyone's consciousness just

292
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:52,393
jumped forward six months to...
April 29th?

293
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,922
Crazy as that sounds, yeah.

294
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:07,812
Sit down.

295
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:09,745
Sit down!

296
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:14,037
J.T., could you give me a hand?
Thanks.

297
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,562
We didn't do this.

298
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:19,865
Even if you didn't, you were still
planning on killing thousands of people.

299
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,226
So stay still...

300
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:22,861
and shut up.

301
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:28,179
- You get ahold of Zoey?
- Yeah, she's all right.

302
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,726
- Mark, hey. You got a sec?
- Sure.

303
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,142
There may be a way to corroborate
what we were talking about in there.

304
00:22:34,832 --> 00:22:37,403
- What do you mean?
- Well, in my flash-forward,

305
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:40,540
it was April 30th, 6:00 A.M.,
but I was in London,

306
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:43,110
which is 8 hours ahead
of the west coast, so it makes sense.

307
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:45,571
Wait, "flash-forward"?
What are we talking about here?

308
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:47,447
I'll explain later.
Tell me what you saw.

309
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,421
I was having a meeting
with our liaison at New Scotland Yard.

310
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,663
I remember
we were interrupted because...

311
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,374
this bird just crashed
into the window.

312
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:58,083
The point is,

313
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,168
I had a vision of Fiona Banks.

314
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,629
Let's see if she had a vision of me.

315
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:05,174
Inspector Banks.

316
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:09,219
Fiona, this is Al Gough, FBI.
I'm here with my colleagues in L.A.

317
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,388
My God.

318
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,680
I know why you're calling.
You want to know what I saw.

319
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:15,068
We all do.

320
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,397
- <i>We were in my office.</i>
- What was the date?

321
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,607
- <i>April 30th.</i>
- What time?

322
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,984
I don't know. 6:00 in the morning.

323
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,178
<i>Don't ask me why it was so early.</i>

324
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:28,424
<i>Something to do
with the Rutherford case.</i>

325
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:32,160
- Yes, and something interrupted us.
- <i>Yes, a bird.</i>

326
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,995
It flew at the window,
broke its neck.

327
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:36,664
So our visions were the same.

328
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,993
<i>When the worldwide blackout
occurred earlier today,</i>

329
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:44,601
<i>people were undergoing brain scans
at that exact moment.</i>

330
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:46,813
<i>So like MRIs or PET scans?
That kind of thing?</i>

331
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:50,052
<i>Exactly. And in each of these cases,
the hippocampus,</i>

332
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,370
<i>that's the memory center of the brain,
was actively engaged</i>

333
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:55,857
<i>for the entire
2 minutes and 17 seconds.</i>

334
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:59,478
<i>These thought patterns are consistent
with a waking experience.</i>

335
00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:01,961
<i>People were not asleep.
They were not dreaming.</i>

336
00:24:02,086 --> 00:24:03,691
<i>So what did they experienced?</i>

337
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,280
<i>By all appearances,</i>

338
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:08,278
<i>memories of events
that haven't occurred yet.</i>

339
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:10,113
<i>So everyone saw the future.</i>

340
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:12,577
<i>But did they see the same future?</i>

341
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:15,321
- <i>Are these accounts consistent?</i>
- <i>Well, they certainly seem to be.</i>

342
00:24:15,446 --> 00:24:18,019
<i>Hundreds of thousands of people
were watching news broadcasts,</i>

343
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:21,832
<i>reading newspapers, and their details
seem to be the same...</i>

344
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,713
<i>Senator Glenway
will be facing ethics charges.</i>

345
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,463
<i>The Dow will be on an upswing.</i>

346
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:29,001
<i>There'll be food riots in Ghana
and the list goes on.</i>

347
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:32,552
<i>A remarkably concise series of events
are starting to come together</i>

348
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:36,431
<i>from that day. It's like a grand mosaic
is being filled in.</i>

349
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:37,891
<i>Everyone on earth...</i>

350
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:39,987
Mosaic.

351
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:43,713
That was the name of the investigation
I was working on in my vision.

352
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:45,990
It had to do
with what caused all this.

353
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,860
So, did you see anything
in your vision that was helpful?

354
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:50,654
Photographs, names,

355
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:54,199
people of interest. If this really was
the future we all saw,

356
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,784
then I guess maybe they will be leads,
but none of them

357
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,870
- make any sense to me right now.
- Anything else?

358
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,706
- No, that was it.
- What about you? What did you see?

359
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,127
Nothing.

360
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:07,713
I blacked out like everybody else
and woke up on the road.

361
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:12,343
What about our person of interest?
Do we think she's involved?

362
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:15,391
She's a dead end, if you ask me,
and clueless as the rest of us.

363
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:18,182
Well, circle back on it anyway.
We're grasping at straws at this point.

364
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,036
- Janis, you wanna share what you saw?
- Yeah, I was...

365
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:24,604
getting a prenatal sonogram.

366
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:29,568
The baby was about 17 weeks,
and it was a little girl.

367
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,787
It was totally bizarre.

368
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:36,554
But I'm obviously not pregnant.

369
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,383
I don't even have a boyfriend.

370
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:40,788
And you, sir?

371
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,689
I was in a meeting.

372
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,671
And I happened to glance down
at the paper. Sports page.

373
00:25:52,305 --> 00:25:56,095
The Rays rallied from 3 runs down
to sweep the Sox at Fenway.

374
00:25:56,486 --> 00:25:57,762
And there's another story.

375
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:01,459
Kobe Bryant tore his ligament
in his knee. Out for the season.

376
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,353
We should start writing
these stories down.

377
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:08,274
The "Post" has a circulation of
a million?

378
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,347
A million.

379
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:12,611
How many other people were reading it
too? We gotta start comparing stories.

380
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:15,405
It's not just the "Post."
It's all the other news outlets.

381
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:18,325
7 billion people
caught a glimpse of the future.

382
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:20,711
Maybe just one of them knows
why this happened...

383
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:23,497
- How do we compare 7 billion stories?
- You create a web site.

384
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,710
People can log on and post what they saw
and cross-reference their visions.

385
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:30,003
We can piggyback on that
and search for patterns.

386
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,298
- That's what I was already doing.
- What do you mean?

387
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,144
Mosaic. All those leads

388
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:36,761
I was running down. We should start
following up on 'em now.

389
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,389
Assuming your vision is even accurate,
the investigation doesn't exist yet.

390
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,849
But it <i>could.</i>
It will.

391
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,556
In my flash-forward, I was investigating
what caused all this.

392
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:47,168
I seemed to have an idea
why all of this was happening and...

393
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:49,231
those people,
the places I saw on the board...

394
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,193
They were part of this puzzle...
Mosaic. Look, I'm certain of it.

395
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,008
Fine. We'll set up
interagency task force.

396
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,116
And as far as this office is concerned,
you three, you own this.

397
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,945
This is kind of insane. We're running
point on this because he had

398
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,373
- a vision of us running point on this?
- You find that funny?

399
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,585
- We don't even know...
- It's the only lead we have.

400
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,003
- We don't have anything right now.
- It works for me!

401
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:17,093
The whole world's on pins and needles,
people. Air traffic's been grounded.

402
00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:21,222
People scared to leave their homes,
Martial law's across half this country.

403
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:24,275
Priority number one...
Finding out what caused this.

404
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,228
Priority number two is
figuring out whether or not

405
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:29,020
it'll happen again.
You got it?

406
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:30,940
Yes, sir.

407
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,777
Good. I'm out.

408
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:42,410
Okay, my psychic friend,

409
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,784
- what do you got?
- I remember a name... D. Gibbons.

410
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,498
- Gibbons.
- That's right.

411
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:50,418
Yeah.
What else you got?

412
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:53,360
There was a photograph here
of a doll.

413
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,216
The doll was burned.
The head was melted.

414
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,739
There was a bullet casing nearby.

415
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,136
Something about Baltimore.

416
00:28:00,516 --> 00:28:01,679
A hand.

417
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,599
Baltimore... No. No, no, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

418
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,809
A... A "blue hand."

419
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,645
- That's what it said.
- What the hell does that mean?

420
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,480
I have no idea.
Just put it up.

421
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,358
No. Wait. Here, in the center.

422
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:20,448
This is gonna sound stupid,
but I was wearing one of those...

423
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:23,242
friendship bracelets.
You know, like kids make.

424
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:26,244
Okay, that's good. What else?

425
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:28,164
What else? That's it.

426
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:30,333
Those are all the leads
I can remember.

427
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,086
What about your state of mind?
What were you doing?

428
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:39,274
I was...

429
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,302
chambering a round.

430
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,054
I was scared to death.

431
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,777
- You were scared to death in here?
- Yeah.

432
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,226
The office was empty, but...

433
00:28:50,002 --> 00:28:51,802
Someone was coming for me.

434
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:54,398
They were wearing masks.

435
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,460
They wanted to kill me
because of what I knew.

436
00:28:57,585 --> 00:28:59,361
One of 'em had a...

437
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:01,655
tattoo.

438
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,309
How many D. Gibbons
there are in the world?

439
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:10,331
- Maybe thousands.
- Have Janis compile a list.

440
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:15,961
Not a hell of a lot to go on yet.

441
00:29:16,313 --> 00:29:17,755
At least you remember something.

442
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:19,215
What do you mean?

443
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,030
Everybody saw something.

444
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:27,765
Everybody had some kind of a vision.
I didn't see a damn thing, Mark.

445
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:30,684
Maybe it means you'll be sleeping
six months from now.

446
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:32,812
Then why wasn't I dreaming?

447
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,856
Look, I never remember my dreams.

448
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,717
Stop, all right?

449
00:29:40,852 --> 00:29:43,565
We're both thinking the same thing,
so let's just say it.

450
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:52,509
What if I didn't see anything
because six months from now...

451
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:54,784
I'm gonna be dead?

452
00:29:58,186 --> 00:29:59,324
Mr. Benford?

453
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:01,814
Are you all right?

454
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:05,328
Yeah.
How's Charlie?

455
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,558
She's fine.
She's sleeping.

456
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,274
I was watching the news all day.

457
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:15,980
They say it happened everywhere.

458
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,474
It's gonna be okay.

459
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:22,403
Is that what they're saying at the FBI?
Do you have inside information?

460
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:24,191
I wish we did.

461
00:30:25,452 --> 00:30:27,696
So then you don't know
it's gonna be okay.

462
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:31,370
I think God did this.

463
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:34,667
Why?

464
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,651
To punish us.

465
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,048
Still no luck finding his parents?

466
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:45,747
Well, his mother died on the 405.

467
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:48,846
Father's name is Lloyd Simcoe.
He works at Stanford.

468
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:51,992
But, no one's been able
to locate him yet.

469
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:56,044
So even if the kid pulls through,
he could still wind up an orphan.

470
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,855
You saved his life today.

471
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,966
You chalk that up as a victory.

472
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,685
I'm trying,
but after a day like today...

473
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:04,304
What about you?

474
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:06,614
How are you staying so zen
through all this?

475
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:09,241
Who says I am?

476
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:15,247
You wanna know why
I wasn't at work yesterday?

477
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:21,337
I've been going through
some really heavy things recently.

478
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:25,101
I don't want to get into it now.
But the... the point is...

479
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,802
This morning, I was out
on the Venice Pier,

480
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,803
and...

481
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:32,014
And I was thinking
about committing suicide.

482
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:35,726
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay. I'm... I'm okay.

483
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,860
I saw a glimpse of my future, and...

484
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:40,733
I was alive.

485
00:31:42,182 --> 00:31:44,896
You know, and everything's
changed for me now.

486
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:47,957
Whatever I was thinking about doing

487
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,199
obviously wasn't meant to happen.

488
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:53,909
It's like a sign from God
or something.

489
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:56,539
You know, these visions were a gift.

490
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,140
Don't you think?

491
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:03,006
A gift?

492
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:05,005
I don't know.
Not for me.

493
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,966
Why? What did you see?

494
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:12,997
I saw the end of my marriage.

495
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:18,701
I was drinking again,

496
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,646
in my flash-forward.

497
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,598
And in my head, I...

498
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,927
I know it wasn't
just a one-time thing.

499
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:28,988
I was full-fledged drinking again.

500
00:32:29,862 --> 00:32:31,372
All the anxiety,

501
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,992
shame.

502
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,077
It was all back.

503
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:38,457
Just because you saw that
doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

504
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,233
Even if this future stuff <i>is</i> real,

505
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:48,137
maybe it's a blessing in disguise. Maybe
because you saw it, you can change it.

506
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,594
Ghost of Christmas future crap.

507
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,387
What if I can't?

508
00:32:53,975 --> 00:32:56,348
People relapse. I did.
You pick yourself up again.

509
00:32:57,524 --> 00:33:00,519
Olivia said she'd...
She'd leave me if I slip again.

510
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:02,438
- She made that clear.
- Then don't slip.

511
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,791
Until you see something
that corroborates these visions,

512
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,738
it's all fantasy.
The future is still up in the air.

513
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:13,078
You're a terrible sponsor.
You know that?

514
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:15,833
What do you want me to say, Mark?

515
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:19,246
You're not the only one this...
this has happened to, you know?

516
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,590
I've got the opposite problem.

517
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:26,649
What do you mean?

518
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:30,114
Tracy was killed in Afghanistan.

519
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:32,551
- And you were at the funeral, right?
- Right.

520
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:35,617
But in my flash-forward,

521
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:38,891
she's alive.

522
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,979
Doesn't make any sense.
They I.D.'d her remains.

523
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,723
I know.

524
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,760
I can't explain it, but...

525
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:53,113
It <i>was</i> her.
I'm... I'm certain of it.

526
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,326
And if she's out there
somewhere, she needs me.

527
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:04,807
For two years, I've been
putting her to rest. Now...

528
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:07,733
I don't know what to think.

529
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:10,237
I'm confused.
I'm...

530
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,094
hopeful.

531
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,973
And I'm angry that I'm hopeful.

532
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:27,825
You're worried...

533
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,959
your future's gonna come true.

534
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:34,935
I'm worried mine won't.

535
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:05,870
- You fixed the garage door.
- It was a slow day.

536
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:26,437
Do you remember our song?

537
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,712
The one we danced to at our wedding.

538
00:35:31,178 --> 00:35:32,421
Etta James, "At Last."

539
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:38,586
Right.

540
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,346
What did you see?

541
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:47,514
I was at the office.

542
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:51,273
Working on a case.
It was... It was this.

543
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:54,689
What caused the flash-forward.

544
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,654
I got the sense I was in danger.
Then...

545
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:01,492
- Then it ended.
- Nothing else?

546
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:06,557
No, that was it.

547
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:11,710
What about you?

548
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,410
Babe?

549
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:21,637
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Why?

550
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,722
'Cause it was too upsetting.

551
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:26,683
I need to hear it, whatever it was.

552
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,485
No, you don't.

553
00:36:34,804 --> 00:36:36,772
Come on.
What did you see?

554
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:45,480
You know what?
Just... let it go.

555
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:52,432
What did you see?

556
00:37:00,524 --> 00:37:02,222
I was with another man.

557
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:05,803
Who?

558
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:07,756
I don't know.

559
00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:10,830
I've never seen him before.

560
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,276
He was downstairs.

561
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:27,004
I don't know who he was,

562
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:30,455
and yet my vision I had all these...
intense.

563
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,125
<i>Feelings for him. I...</i>

564
00:37:33,706 --> 00:37:34,756
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

565
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,257
I don't understand, Mark.

566
00:37:42,382 --> 00:37:44,059
I would never cheat on you.

567
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:47,260
I wouldn't betray you.
I wouldn't...

568
00:37:53,044 --> 00:37:55,772
Just because we saw these things
doesn't mean they're gonna happen.

569
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:18,010
- Dylan!
- I'm sorry. You are?

570
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:19,835
His father Lloyd Simcoe.

571
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,749
- How is he?
- He'll be fine.

572
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:25,678
His attending physician,
will be here in the morning.

573
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,846
She can fill you in
on some the details.

574
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,320
I'll wait for her.

575
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,620
Daddy?

576
00:38:51,438 --> 00:38:53,298
What are you doing up, sweetie?

577
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:54,977
It's after midnight.

578
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:56,416
I had a bad dream.

579
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,770
Come here.

580
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:02,141
You wanna talk about it?

581
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:05,646
Why was Mommy crying?

582
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:08,223
She was just scared.

583
00:39:08,823 --> 00:39:10,273
It's gonna be okay.

584
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:11,811
Are you scared?

585
00:39:13,581 --> 00:39:15,131
No, honey.
I'm fine.

586
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:23,610
- What do you have there in your hand?
- Something I made for you.

587
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:28,114
<i>I want you to have it.</i>

588
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:32,645
Take it, Daddy.

589
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:39,039
Do you want me
to help you put it on?

590
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,582
Sure.

591
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,348
There you go.

592
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,706
I'm still at work, babe.

593
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,298
They got us working late.

594
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:28,741
I'm watching it right now.

595
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,390
If this is the song you want,

596
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:35,936
you got it, baby.

597
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:44,385
Let's talk about the future
when you get home.

598
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,068

You have to see this.

599
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:49,317
Gotta go.

600
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:52,636
I love you, too.

601
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:57,522
What's up?

602
00:40:59,815 --> 00:41:01,365
So as far as we know,

603
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,105
every single person
on the entire planet

604
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,713
lost consciousness at the exact
same period of time, right?

605
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,591
- Right.
- So I started cycling

606
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,327
through a bunch of surveillance cameras
for the last five hours

607
00:41:12,452 --> 00:41:14,637
because I was curious to see
what they recorded.

608
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:17,682
I looked at hundreds of 'em.
I checked every major city,

609
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,077
even web cams in other countries
and they all show the exact same thing.

610
00:41:21,871 --> 00:41:24,890
At 11:00 A.M.,
people start dropping like flies.

611
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,402
And then 2 minutes and 17 seconds later,
they start to come to.

612
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:31,058
And then I saw this.

613
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,671
This was in Detroit.

614
00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:37,411
- What am I looking at?
- Hang on a second.

615
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:40,482

Look right there.

616
00:41:49,697 --> 00:41:51,176
- No way.
- Yeah.

617
00:41:52,882 --> 00:41:54,432
Who the hell is that?

618
00:41:56,942 --> 00:41:58,392
Why are they awake?

619
00:42:09,046 --> 00:42:12,863
