1
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:08,841
I saw someone drowning me.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,938
How do I atone for something?
I haven't done yet.

3
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:15,392
The man you might be sleeping with in
six months' time was in our living room,

4
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:18,017
and I sure as hell didn't bring him
into our lives. You did!

5
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,063
All the old patterns are back, Mark.

6
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:23,525
It's about trust,
and we don't trust each other anymore.

7
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:26,859
I had a vision of Fiona Banks.
Let's see if she had a vision of me.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,198
I know why you're calling.
<i>It's to do with the Rutherford case.</i>

9
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:33,484
You've been acting weird
for a couple of weeks yourself.

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,401
"Blue Hand"...
It's a clue from Mark's board.

11
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:49,958
<i>Dear Celia,</i>

12
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:54,273
<i>I don't know your last name,
and I don't know where you live,</i>

13
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,529
<i>but I know you have two young boys,</i>

14
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:00,023
<i>twins, I believe.</i>

15
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:04,914
<i>And I know you didn't have
a flash-forward.</i>

16
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:08,672
<i>I understand how terrifying that is</i>

17
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:10,945
<i>and how powerless
you must be feeling.</i>

18
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,780
<i>But I want you to know
that you are not alone.</i>

19
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,235
E-mailing your other girlfriend?

20
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,291
No, we broke up.

21
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:37,932
This is just porn.

22
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,472
I'm in pre-trial conference all day,
so unreachable, but don't forget,

23
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:44,922
- we need to sign off on the proofs.
- Proofs?

24
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:46,848
- For the wedding invitations.
- Right.

25
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,031
Bet you 20 bucks
they spell my name wrong.

26
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:50,833
Bet you $100 they got mine wrong.

27
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,583
They say couples
with commonly misspelled names

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,555
are the most successful.

29
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,030
Really?

30
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:02,245
Meet me at the printers at 6:00.

31
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:06,348
- Can't you just pick one?
- I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

32
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:08,861
I'm just saying you have great taste.
I don't...

33
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:10,296
need to be there.

34
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,173
Kick ass today.

35
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:26,812
I might be home late tonight.

36
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm covering the E.R.
for Sally again.

37
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:34,653
- I tried to get out of it.
- You don't have to explain.

38
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,782
It's hard 'cause Crosby's out of town,
so there is no one else.

39
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,701
You don't have to explain.

40
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:42,286
I trust you.

41
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:44,144
Good.

42
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,952
I trust you, too.

43
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:56,217
It's like everything I say
comes out wrong.

44
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:57,418
Everything.

45
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,534
Even when we're good, it's tense.

46
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:02,514
Things have changed for everybody.
It's a new world.

47
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:05,351
I miss the old one then.

48
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,759
Really?

49
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,939
When you used to crash on my couch
playing "Madden" till 4:00 am?

50
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:11,404
Don't you mean futon

51
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:13,523
and kicking your ass until 4:00 am?

52
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,260
- What?
- What? I said it.

53
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,751
You didn't kick anything.
You were... cheating.

54
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:20,533
That's what you were doing.

55
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:21,979
What you call cheating

56
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,613
I call finding a way
to change the game, my friend.

57
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,918
- How's Hawk doing?
- She's out of the woods.

58
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,089
Should be back to work
in a few weeks.

59
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,092
These three had to do
with her shooting?

60
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,942
We followed the hand stamp
from the guy who shot Janis,

61
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,998
led us to the house
where we found these guys.

62
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:42,555
The Blue Hand stamp?

63
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:45,976
- I'm sensing a theme.
- You want to share?

64
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,035
The contact ring, residue patterns
and bullet trajectories

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,356
are consistent
with self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

66
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,565
Self-inflicted?

67
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,910
You think this is some kind
of suicide pact?

68
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,116
Had to be.

69
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,281
But then who arranged the bodies

70
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,165
and covered them with the sheets?

71
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:06,370
All had alcohol in their systems.
She had ecstasy and heroin.

72
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,101
Who are these people?

73
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,429
Jason Martinez, 37.
Married, two children.

74
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,067
This is Diana Davis.
Still looking for next of kin,

75
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:16,434
And Ian Rutherford, 25.

76
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:21,135
British national reported missing
from a cargo vessel

77
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,684
docked in Long Beach.

78
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:27,224
Your Rutherford case?

79
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:34,648
Here we go.

80
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:37,839
<i>Season 1 Episode 07
The Gift</i>

81
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:45,432
- Hey, Aaron.
- What's up, Jack?

82
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:49,216
There's a guy waiting for you inside.
Says he served with Tracy.

83
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:13,562
- How can I help you?
- You're Aaron Stark?

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,927
Corporal Mike Willingham.

85
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:19,443
I wanted to talk to you
for a while, but...

86
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:22,153
but I've been mixed up,
trying to get a job, a place to live.

87
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,424
It's tough

88
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,436
re-adjusting to civilian life.

89
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,485
With the way things are now,
You just gotta hope it gets better.

90
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,122
Sorry to bother you at work,

91
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,362
but I promised Tracy
that if anything ever happened to her,

92
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,789
I'd give you this.

93
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:45,775
<i>How did you find me?</i>

94
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,681
<i>I'll always find you, kiddo.</i>

95
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,296
<i>I think right now,
you need this more than I do.</i>

96
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,877
I hadn't seen this knife

97
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,280
since Tracy deployed four years ago,

98
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:12,253
but somehow...

99
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:15,707
Now I understand
how in my flash-forward,

100
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,379
- I was giving it back to her.
- She said it was a good luck charm.

101
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,782
Maybe there's something to that.

102
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:27,700
For two years,
I've had to listen to people telling me

103
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:28,846
to move on,

104
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,963
to accept what happened to her.
But I always knew I'd see her again.

105
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:35,297
Now you showing up here...

106
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:42,257
It's all happening, isn't it?

107
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:45,816
It's all happening.

108
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,384
Why do a copy machine salesman,

109
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:00,753
a librarian

110
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,718
and a Scottish journalist decide
to get together to shoot themselves?

111
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,090
Because print is dead?

112
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,761
Say hello to your vision.

113
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,930
You all know Fiona Banks,

114
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,516
MI6, fresh off the plane
from London.

115
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,020
Nice to meet you again.

116
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,977
For the first time.

117
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:19,833
Nice to meet you.

118
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,587
Suicide seems
a little low-incident for MI6.

119
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:25,486
Ian Rutherford was reported missing
off a cargo ship two weeks ago.

120
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:27,300
The British embassy was notified.

121
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:29,312
I saw the report
and came here because...

122
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:32,284
'Cause you knew you'd be working
on this case from your flash-forward.

123
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,996
That's all well and good,
but what do we got?

124
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,230
When I found out
all 3 vics committed suicide.

125
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,783
I cross-referenced
their visions on Mosaic.

126
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,126
Turns out they're all ghosts.

127
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:47,550
So people who didn't see anything,
that's what they call themselves.

128
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,798
So none of them had visions
and now they're all dead.

129
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,445
Am I the only one
who finds that disturbing?

130
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,757
No, you're not.

131
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,935
Here.
Check this out.

132
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,187
It's a ghost web site.

133
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:04,003
It's where they connect with each other,
find out about upcoming events.

134
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:06,681
Anchorage, Buenos Aires, Dubai...

135
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:08,737
It's happening everywhere.

136
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:11,176
"The Blue Hand.
No limits. No fear.

137
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:14,698
"A place where ghosts can gather
to embrace the inevitable."

138
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:16,489
You've got to be kidding me.

139
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:19,491
- A death club?
- Like a book club, with bullets.

140
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,918
Whatever it is,
the guy who shot Janis is a part of it.

141
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,255
We need to find these people, figure out
who they are and shut them down.

142
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,179
The next meeting in LA is being hosted
by a guy named...

143
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:31,802
Raynaud.
Dr. Maurice Raynaud.

144
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:33,429
When is the meeting?

145
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,890
<i>Tonight, go downtown</i>

146
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,891
<i>and check the time.</i>

147
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,268
<i>Tonight, go downtown</i>

148
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:41,770
<i>and check the time.</i>

149
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,559
Ian Blaine Rutherford.
Born in Edinburgh, 1984.

150
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:58,234
Father's an aviation mechanic.
Mother...

151
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:01,765
Works in a factory,
makes cell phone components.

152
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,418
I've already seen that file.

153
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,654
Yes, of course.

154
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,571
Sorry. I just...

155
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:11,258
I never expected to be working
on this case so soon.

156
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,371
The dominos seem to be

157
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:15,137
falling into place.

158
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
It's funny.

159
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,824
I don't remember anything from
the actual dossier other than his name.

160
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,130
I just remember you.

161
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,440
And the bird.

162
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,753
When it hit the window...

163
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,153
I felt my heart skip a beat.

164
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,381
Then you had the phone call.

165
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,135
<i>Excuse me for a moment.</i>

166
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,496
After you left,
I looked out onto the ledge.

167
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:43,960
I went over.

168
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,716
I wanted to help it.

169
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,696
If only to end its pain.

170
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:57,513
But I couldn't.

171
00:09:58,567 --> 00:09:59,890
That was the worst part.

172
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,969
There was nothing I could do

173
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:04,353
to stop it.

174
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:16,946
What was your phone call about?

175
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,840
It was my attorney.

176
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,986
Why were you speaking to an attorney?
Did something happen?

177
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:27,042
<i>I killed her.</i>

178
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,830
No, everything was fine.

179
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,372
I'm working downtown tonight.

180
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:50,089
Thought I might stop by
that bakery on Grand, on the way back,

181
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,652
pick us up some
of those cinnamon rolls.

182
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:57,723
Or not.

183
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:05,487
You don't have any idea
why I'm mad, do you?

184
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:08,336
The printers?

185
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,260
Our invitations?

186
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:12,454
My God.
I'm so sorry.

187
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:15,941
Work was so crazy.

188
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:19,513
We got a lead on the guy who shot Janis
and now we're going to this club.

189
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,879
You're not the only one
who had a crazy day.

190
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:24,556
I've been cranking out
motions in limine all afternoon

191
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:25,893
but somehow

192
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,904
- made it to the printers anyway.
- You're right.

193
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,446
I should have been there.
I'm really sorry.

194
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:33,735
It's not about the invitations.

195
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:38,008
It's about you and me
and the fact that you've been...

196
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:40,670
checked out ever since
I got home from Seattle.

197
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:42,521
I've been slammed
since the blackout.

198
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:43,717
Since the blackout.

199
00:11:43,842 --> 00:11:45,867
That's been your excuse
for everything.

200
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:48,844
Yeah, no,
why you are late coming home,

201
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,203
why you don't talking,

202
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:53,124
why you shut your computer
every time I walk in the room.

203
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:55,797
- It's like I don't even exist.
- That's unfair.

204
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,838
What's unfair
is being in love with someone

205
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:01,026
who treats you like a stranger.
That's unfair.

206
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,930
And I don't want you to apologize.

207
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:08,101
I don't.
I want you to want to be here.

208
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:10,226
Talk to me.

209
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:14,149
Just be honest
about whatever's going on.

210
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:18,453
- You want me to be honest.
- Yes.

211
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:23,863
The more you jump down my throat,
the less I want to be here.

212
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:25,350
How's that for honesty?

213
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,274
- Is he qualified?
- No, I think...

214
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,935
Thanks for having me.

215
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,548
Not at all.
We always need volunteers.

216
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,215
There's a lot of menial tasks.

217
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,038
A lot of charts to be filed

218
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:45,314
and blood to be run to the lab.

219
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,925
- It's not glamorous.
- I'm not looking for glamour.

220
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,729
Aren't you supposed to be
at that conference?

221
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,647
Yes, but lab's lost the coags
on our spider girl,

222
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,691
the O.R. is trying to bump our appy,

223
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,065
and volvulus guy is leaving the AMA

224
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,108
to see his kid
in this ice capades thing.

225
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,557
So redraw the coags, tell the OR no,

226
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,379
and I'll talk to skater dad.

227
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,671
- Bryce, do you know Nicole?
- Yeah.

228
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:09,630
I think we met
at your christmas party last year. Hi.

229
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,248
Nicole's volunteering here.

230
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,458
He'll show you the lay of the land.

231
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:15,451
I will catch you later.

232
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,839
- Thanks.
- What's "volvulus"?

233
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:20,173
Twisted gut.

234
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:22,769
You pre-med?

235
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:26,805
No, I'm just volunteering,
helping people, you know.

236
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:33,353
Ma'am, slow down. I'm sorry.
We don't understand you.

237
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:49,409
<i>Arigato.</i>

238
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,425
Sweet peas symbolize good-bye
in japanese culture.

239
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,994
It's considered a bad omen
to give it to the sick.

240
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,157
Is that a cardigan?

241
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,360
What?

242
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,210
I was going for Average Joe.

243
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:07,840
Back off, Dem.
That jacket? Ridiculous.

244
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,398
Says the FBI agent in a police T-shirt.
Good going.

245
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,312
What?

246
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:18,565
"Go downtown, check the time."

247
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:44,131
We're here for the meeting.

248
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,443
At Dr. Raynaud's invitation.

249
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:39,312
Who's gonna play?

250
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,484
Play?

251
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:57,973
Who is going to play?

252
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:10,621
I get it.

253
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:12,816
No bullets. Good gag.

254
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:23,875
Your ticket...

255
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:26,593
in.

256
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:35,160
Welcome to the Blue Hand, gentlemen.

257
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,836
You got a death wish?
You could have been killed.

258
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,671
Not today.

259
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:01,394
That was a real bullet in that gun.
You know that, right?

260
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,995
Unlike the rest of these people,

261
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,460
I know I'm gonna be alive
in six months. I've seen it.

262
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:08,458
So bullet or no bullet,
there's no way I was gonna die tonight.

263
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:10,727
Hey.

264
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,288
What can I get you?

265
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:14,302
Could you get us to talk to Raynaud?

266
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:16,034
Is he here?

267
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,273
You guys first-timers?

268
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:21,414
No. Maybe.

269
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,730
The Raynaud changes
at each gathering.

270
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:25,835
And where is tonight's Raynaud?

271
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,338
He's around. You'll know him
when you see him.

272
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,471
What you got?

273
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,557
- It was on my board.
- <i>Another piece of the puzzle.</i>

274
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,228
So what do we do here?

275
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:44,985
Anything you want.

276
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:48,775
No limits. No fear.
There's something for everybody.

277
00:17:55,302 --> 00:17:56,102
Hi.

278
00:17:58,402 --> 00:17:59,203
Hey.

279
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,723
- I need to talk to you about...
- I don't think we should be doing

280
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:04,867
any of the...

281
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,001
Me first?

282
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,754
Okay. Fine.

283
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:15,343
I really just came by to say thank you
for everything you've done for Dylan.

284
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,328
He did all the hard work himself.

285
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,360
You saved his life...

286
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,266
And in doing that...

287
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,867
you saved mine as well.

288
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,315
The very last thing
that I would want to do,

289
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,694
is ruin yours.

290
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:36,193
- I don't think we should be...
- I understand.

291
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:38,158
I understand that this
is very awkward.

292
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,368
So please just let me
be perfectly clear.

293
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,413
Nothing is going
to happen between us.

294
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,524
- No, I know that.
- I would never...

295
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,471
do anything to come
between you and your husband,

296
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,734
despite what we may have
seen or experienced.

297
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:52,035
Good.

298
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,405
Okay, good.

299
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,652
Dylan and I are gonna
move back to the bay area

300
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,795
as soon as they approve
the hospital transfer.

301
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,730
Good.

302
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:02,398
Good. That's...

303
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:05,622
That's good.
You must be anxious to...

304
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:08,104
- get back to work.
- Right.

305
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,522
And I should go.

306
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:12,859
Listen, thank you so much
for everything again.

307
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,413
I'll do everything I can
to push that transfer through.

308
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:18,272
- Great. Thanks.
- Just excuse me.

309
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:19,271
Thank you.

310
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:24,918
Where did you learn
how to speak Japanese?

311
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:28,119
My dad was stationed in Okinawa
when I was little, and I picked it up.

312
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:30,094
When we moved back,
I took it in school.

313
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:33,083
Can I show you something?
Just for a second.

314
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:38,368
In my flash-forward,
I saw this symbol behind her.

315
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,054
Who's the woman?

316
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,442
I have no idea.

317
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,132
I was hoping that if I could figure out
what the symbol meant,

318
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:48,245
then I might be able to find her.
I know it's an Asian character,

319
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,189
but nobody seems to recognize it.

320
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,332
They didn't see it
because it wasn't finished.

321
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,441
You have a pen?

322
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,773
Yeah, a pencil.

323
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:57,320
- May I?
- Please.

324
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:02,349
There.

325
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,457
It's kanji.
It's a Japanese letter.

326
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:07,193
Kanji.

327
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:08,331
What's it mean?

328
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:10,124
"Believe."

329
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,256
Mr. Stark?

330
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:19,019
Mike. What are you doing here?

331
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,322
Sorry to bother you again. I just...

332
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:24,409
didn't feel right leaving things
the way we did earlier.

333
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:28,909
I'm not sure I understand.

334
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,859
It's just...

335
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,022
You seemed so happy.

336
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:35,562
I didn't know how to tell you,

337
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:37,595
but I think you deserve
to know the truth.

338
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:40,947
Truth about what?

339
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:43,016
About what you saw...

340
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:45,583
in your vision with Tracy.

341
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,469
It's not possible.

342
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:52,750
What are you talking about?

343
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:56,588
I was with her in the humvee.

344
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:09,075
Blind Father, this is
Hit Man 2 requesting backup.

345
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,962
Put Oscar Mike,
pursuing Hajis heading north,

346
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:14,647
about two clicks away
from checkpoint Victor Tango.

347
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:15,899
Over.

348
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,051
Damn!

349
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:28,019
Who the hell are these guys?

350
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:30,010
- Those aren't Hajis.
- Back up! Back up!

351
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,624
Those are Jericho!
We got to get out! Move!

352
00:21:33,054 --> 00:21:34,751
Burro, burro!
We're gonna get waxed!

353
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:36,480
- Get out!
- Look out!

354
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,296
Come on!

355
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,219
Tracy!

356
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:47,180
I'm sorry, sir.

357
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,869
When I went back to check on her...

358
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:07,992
I had to run.
I had to. But I saw her die.

359
00:22:08,623 --> 00:22:09,661
I saw her die.

360
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,099
This is pathetic.

361
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,602
What have they got to lose, man?

362
00:22:35,074 --> 00:22:37,698
Doesn't matter if it's
tonight or next month.

363
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,673
They're dead anyway.

364
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:09,160
Blue hands.

365
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,249
They represent a portal,

366
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:16,038
a gateway from one
understanding to another.

367
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:19,531
The blue hand marks a surrender

368
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:21,232
to the inevitable.

369
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:22,743
Raynaud.

370
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,988
Here we go.

371
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,136
You got me?

372
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:33,870
- Get down!
- Everybody get down!

373
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,134
Give me my gun!

374
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,582
Get down! Everybody down!

375
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,467
- Get my gun!
- Now! Now!

376
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,303
- I want to...
- Turn around!

377
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:44,284
I want this to end.

378
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:45,903
Not today.

379
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:47,842
Not... today.

380
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,007
Dr. Maurice Raynaud

381
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:56,911
discovered Raynaud's
phenomenon, also known as...

382
00:23:57,508 --> 00:23:58,518
blue hands.

383
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,354
Died 1881.

384
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,609
Guess it does beat your real name.
Jeff Slingerland. I'm saying that right?

385
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,623
Says here you taught
American history at South Fairfax High.

386
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:09,322
Teacher of the Year'08.

387
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,139
Then the blackout happens
and you turn into Friedrich Nietzsche.

388
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,243
Why is that, Jeff?

389
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:17,246
Or do you prefer Dr. Raynaud?

390
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:18,902
You know what Nietzsche said.

391
00:24:19,027 --> 00:24:21,626
"If you gaze into the abyss,
the abyss also gazes into you."

392
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,962
Is that the kind of optimism
that comes from not having a vision?

393
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:27,535
I had a vision.

394
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,468
A bottomless pit of darkness
and indifference,

395
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:34,152
infinite in its nothingness,
as if I never existed at all

396
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:35,706
and I never would again.

397
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:38,708
These people who didn't have
a vision "these ghosts".

398
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,020
Where do you Raynauds find them?

399
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:44,141
We don't find them. You do.

400
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,194
There's no better place to go
than your Mosaic site.

401
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,592
Couldn't do it without you.

402
00:25:02,947 --> 00:25:04,298
Do you see this guy?

403
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:10,258
One of your fellow blue hands,
shot and nearly killed an FBI agent.

404
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:13,928
Start talking or I'm gonna charge you
as an accomplice after the fact.

405
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:16,126
Throw me in prison.
I don't care.

406
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:18,432
It's all mapped out.
Don't you understand?

407
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:22,153
The script for this conversation
has already been written.

408
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:23,972
Whatever you've all seen...

409
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:25,815
is gonna happen.

410
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:28,536
What if you're wrong?

411
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,737
What if April 29th comes and goes,

412
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:32,906
you're still alive?

413
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:35,770
What then?

414
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:37,466
You can run

415
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:39,504
and you can hide,

416
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,579
but you can't escape what's coming.

417
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:44,795
No one can.

418
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,225
Heading out?

419
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:53,125
Yes, back to my luxury suite.

420
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:56,512
They still putting visiting agents up
at those crappy hotels by the airport?

421
00:25:57,395 --> 00:25:59,098
Now you're just rubbing it in.

422
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,725
You ever try dirty rice?

423
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:04,729
Dirty rice? What, you mean like,
eating it off the floor?

424
00:26:07,555 --> 00:26:09,529
No, it's a cajun dish.

425
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:14,163
It's my favorite. My mom makes it
for me when I go home at the holidays.

426
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:17,498
If I might try and make a batch of it
tonight. If you're feeling hungry at all

427
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:20,369
That's sweet of you.
That really is, but I'm jet-lagged.

428
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,164
I understand. I'd be tired, too.

429
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:31,555
I've been thinking about our bird.

430
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:35,635
- What if you taped the window?
- How do you mean?

431
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:38,102
Well, if you cover the window,

432
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,807
- the bird might not crash into it.
- It's a nice thought.

433
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:45,478
I think it'll probably just
crash into a different window.

434
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:47,064
Maybe.

435
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:50,376
But it's worth a shot.

436
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,858
Can't accuse him
of sugarcoating things.

437
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:07,137
That guy makes Marilyn Manson
look like Mr. Rogers.

438
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:11,629
Everybody deals with it
differently, I guess.

439
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,920
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's all right.

440
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:19,929
At least I don't have to deal
with the uncertainty.

441
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,184
It is the one good thing about
knowing the exact date of your murder.

442
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,445
Gives you time to prepare.

443
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:29,404
So what's gonna happen?

444
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:32,358
March 15th comes around,
you're just gonna pack it in?

445
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:33,484
Come on, man.

446
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:37,171
Say your good-byes,
have a nice farewell dinner?

447
00:27:37,296 --> 00:27:39,986
- I'll deal with it the way I choose...
- By fighting it.

448
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:43,312
- That's what we're doing here.
- Wake up, would you please? Wake up!

449
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,080
D. Gibbons. The the doll factory.

450
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,597
137 <i>sekunden</i>.

451
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:50,084
The Blue Hand. It's all come true.

452
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,009
- Listen, it doesn't mean that you're...
- Mark, look around you.

453
00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:57,329
Look around, man.

454
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,789
Raynaud was right.

455
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:06,347
It's all happening,
every single day.

456
00:28:12,664 --> 00:28:14,025
There's no way out.

457
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,276
There's nothing you

458
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,572
I or anyone can do
to escape what's coming.

459
00:28:20,547 --> 00:28:21,741
<i>Give me 20 bucks for it.</i>

460
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:25,713
<i>All is printed behind this tome.</i>

461
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,594
<i>This is magic
beyond all comprehension.</i>

462
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,063
<i>It searches
with power and imaginary.</i>

463
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:36,240
<i>It seems that cosmic energies
not meant for the mortal men.</i>

464
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,468
<i>They stay crumbled and resent
the shattering omnipotence.</i>

465
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,576
Okay, I'm tired, you're tired.
It's time for bed.

466
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:50,186
- Mommy! Please?
- That's all right. I got it.

467
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:54,482
Five minutes. Five.

468
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:56,921
- I love you.
- I love you too.

469
00:28:57,046 --> 00:28:58,638
Sleep well. Good night.

470
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:13,918
Daddy,

471
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:15,257
Are you sad?

472
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:17,213
No, baby.

473
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,176
Daddy's happy.

474
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,443
Got you something.

475
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:06,512
I'm not really hungry, but thanks.

476
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:22,571
I really do love you.
You know that, right?

477
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:29,044
I know I've...

478
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:32,276
I've been distant lately, but I...

479
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,957
Didn't know how to tell you...

480
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,261
And what to tell you.

481
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:39,974
I didn't know what to do.

482
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:42,557
About?

483
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,302
About my flash-forward.

484
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:54,602
I told you I saw myself
on the beach at our wedding.

485
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,063
That was a lie.

486
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:00,086
I didn't see anything,

487
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:01,772
Only darkness.

488
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:04,074
Nothingness.

489
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:09,335
I didn't have a flash-forward,
because I'm gonna be dead.

490
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,202
Tonight, I met all these people
just like me.

491
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:16,799
No visions.

492
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:18,582
No hope.

493
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:20,128
They were just...

494
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:22,131
waiting to die.

495
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,511
I don't wanna be like that.

496
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:30,682
I don't wanna be like that.

497
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,474
I wanna be here with you.

498
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,420
I know what I saw. The beach.

499
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:40,689
Our wedding.

500
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:43,192
I know you were there.

501
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:46,271
You gotta know
how much I wanted that.

502
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:50,253
I wanted to marry you,

503
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,920
have a baby with you,
grow old with you.

504
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,205
It was a mistake.
You just made a mistake.

505
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:59,583
- There's no way of knowing for sure...
- Zoey, I'm sure.

506
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:02,746
I'm sure. Listen to me.

507
00:32:03,872 --> 00:32:04,964
I love you.

508
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,554
I love you.
You are the life that I wanted.

509
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,879
Then let's "have" that life.

510
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:12,805
We can have that life.

511
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,431
You didn't want to give up hope.

512
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:15,954
Then don't.

513
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,603
We have two conflicting visions.
We can choose...

514
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,564
which one we wanna believe in.

515
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,476
I choose hope.

516
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:30,136
You're right.

517
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,663
Thanks for coming out.

518
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:50,455
- Is everything all right, sir?
- Everything's fine.

519
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:54,594
That's why I called you out,
actually.

520
00:32:55,195 --> 00:32:57,384
I thought you might be
upset with me, for...

521
00:32:57,918 --> 00:32:59,459
telling you what I told you.

522
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,520
I've spent the last few weeks

523
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:08,569
tortured by what I saw,

524
00:33:09,326 --> 00:33:11,326
up and down, living in limbo.

525
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,243
But your story, what you told me...

526
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,845
You've finally given me some peace.

527
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:21,290
And I was hoping
maybe I could return the favor.

528
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,011
You won't be the first screwed up vet
this place has hired.

529
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:35,888
Thank you.

530
00:33:36,787 --> 00:33:38,306
No, thank you.

531
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,189
You're a real artist.
You could totally sell these.

532
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:47,393
Thanks.

533
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:51,002
I'd give 'em away for nothing
if somebody could help me find her.

534
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:52,127
Thanks.

535
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,105
You don't remember her name
or where she lives?

536
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,167
Just, I remember the images...

537
00:33:57,292 --> 00:33:59,109
But I just can't put them together.

538
00:33:59,326 --> 00:34:00,871
You remember how you felt about her?

539
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,211
- You have to find her, Bryce.
- How? She could be anywhere.

540
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,589
Look at your paintings. Look at her.
It's Japan. It has to be.

541
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,300
Do you have any idea
how many people live in Japan?

542
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,010
Put your story up on Mosaic.

543
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:18,313
Even if she doesn't see it, someone
she knows might. It's worth a shot.

544
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,850
- Morning, guys.
- Morning.

545
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:55,633
- You coming to the meeting?
- You two go ahead. Demetri?

546
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:59,722
I left something on your desk. Can you
make sure it gets into the right hands?

547
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:02,347
See you later.

548
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:12,276
We've got this Raynaud guy
in custody.

549
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,444
Now what?

550
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:16,937
He's still refusing to name names,
give us an idea of who's in charge.

551
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:20,148
My sense is
this people aren't killers...

552
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:21,285
Just lost,

553
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,796
aggressive nihilists.

554
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,150
Your sense?
You've gotta do better than that.

555
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:28,167
You can break any perp.
You've just gotta change your approach.

556
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:30,012
Raynaud's different.

557
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,129
Can't threaten him with anything.

558
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:34,631
He's got nothing to lose.

559
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:37,551
He has seen his future,

560
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,303
and it is bleak.

561
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:42,222
He doesn't even know
how it's gonna happen. It could be...

562
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,475
a fall, a fight,

563
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,311
a shooting, a car accident.
The possibilities are infinite.

564
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,319
The guy's walking on eggshells
every minute of the day,

565
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,610
just waiting for the hammer to drop.

566
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:59,531
<i>Al, I just got off the phone
with hospital.</i>

567
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:03,258
<i>They took her off life support
an hour ago.</i>

568
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:04,414
<i>I'm sorry, Al.</i>

569
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:05,589
<i>She's gone.</i>

570
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:10,042
Every day, he wakes up wondering
if today is the day...

571
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:14,129
If today is the day his future's
finally gonna catch up with him.

572
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:17,023
What's gonna happen to her children?

573
00:36:17,148 --> 00:36:20,052
<i>It looks like the kids will have
to be placed in foster care.</i>

574
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,238
Those two boys are orphans...

575
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:25,933
Because of me?

576
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:28,894
<i>No, Celia's death
was an accident, okay?</i>

577
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:31,188
- <i>It could've happened to anyone.</i>
- But it didn't.

578
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:33,357
It was my fault.

579
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:37,834
I killed her.

580
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:42,950
- The change in...
- Stop. Stop!

581
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:07,015
Al! Talk to us!

582
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:08,818
Just talk to us.

583
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:10,227
We can fix this.

584
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,073
We can find her. We can find Celia.
We can protect her.

585
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,941
Anything you need,
we can find a way to make it happen.

586
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,278
- Come on, Al.
- It can happen anytime, anywhere.

587
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:23,030
- I don't even know how it happens.
- Al, listen to me.

588
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,909
You're alive six months from now.
You saw it.

589
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,494
Man, you saw it!

590
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:29,310
But if I'm not here...

591
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:31,290
- Come on, get down.
- If I'm not here...

592
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:37,296
- It means we can change things.
- Al, please get down.

593
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,422
What I saw...

594
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:40,549
I killed her.

595
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:42,342
What you saw...

596
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,553
doesn't have to play out that way.

597
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,808
What are you talking about?

598
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,321
I found a way to change the game.

599
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,565
<i>Al, listen to me.
Celia's death was an accident.</i>

600
00:37:57,395 --> 00:37:59,427
<i>A terrible, random accident.</i>

601
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,121
<i>There's nothing
you could've done to avoid this.</i>

602
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:12,906
<i>"Dear Celia,</i>

603
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,133
<i>"I don't know your last name,</i>

604
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:18,198
<i>"and I don't know where you live,</i>

605
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,486
<i>"but I know
you have two young boys...</i>

606
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,260
<i>"Twins, I believe.</i>

607
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,596
<i>"And I know
you didn't have a flash-forward.</i>

608
00:39:29,361 --> 00:39:31,430
<i>"I understand how terrifying that is</i>

609
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:34,740
<i>"and how powerless
you must be feeling.</i>

610
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,091
<i>"But I want you to know</i>

611
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,402
<i>"that you are not alone</i>

612
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:44,646
<i>"and that your situation</i>

613
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,281
<i>"is not as hopeless as you think.</i>

614
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:52,619
<i>"Our paths were meant to cross,</i>

615
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:55,475
<i>"I didn't know how.</i>

616
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:58,334
<i>"I didn't know when.</i>

617
00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:02,904
<i>"But things have changed now.</i>

618
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:07,119
<i>"Things are no longer going to unfold
as I had feared.</i>

619
00:40:10,114 --> 00:40:11,663
<i>"My gift to you</i>

620
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,301
<i>"is release from that dread...</i>

621
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:21,084
<i>"From the feeling
that you're no longer in control.</i>

622
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,139
<i>"We will never meet.</i>

623
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,614
<i>"I will never know you.</i>

624
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,155
<i>"So live your life.</i>

625
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:44,232
<i>"Live every day.</i>

626
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:49,846
<i>"And know that the future
is unwritten.</i>

627
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:54,833
<i>"Make the most of that."</i>
