<i>Previously on</i> FlashForward...

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,923
- You want to tell me what this is?
- It's my book. It's all there.

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:10,718
- We need someone on the inside.
- You want me to be a double agent?

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,512
This is where you get to prove
your dedication to the cause.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,847
Kill Benford.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,683
- What's up with you?
- I'm pregnant. Mark, I just hope that

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,144
- you know you can still count on me.
- I never doubted that.

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,812
I could've used you, Stan.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,023
Now I gotta deal
with Vice President Clemente.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,942
In my vision, it was clear
that Jericho had done

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,362
some things that threatened
our national security.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,863
You got military clearance.

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,449
As soon as you can document
what Tracy knows, I want it uploaded.

14
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,868
As of this moment,
the world thinks you and Simcoe

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,881
accidentally caused this blackout.

16
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:41,457
What happens if they find out
you were awake while it happened?

17
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:42,917
Simon Campos has disappeared.

18
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:44,960
He took the damn ring.

19
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,379
Did you overhear anything?

20
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,798
They said he's going to cause
another blackout.

21
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:57,161
On october 6th,

22
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,557
the planet blacked out
for 2 minutes and 17 seconds,

23
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,979
and the whole world saw the future.

24
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,771
Some of us were alarmed
by what we saw.

25
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:10,403
Others were elated and rejoiced.

26
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:12,446
Still others saw nothing at all.

27
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,949
They were left confused, concerned

28
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,237
and otherwise uncertain.

29
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:22,373
But that uncertainty
will soon be resolved.

30
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,999
Tomorrow is d-day...

31
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,836
The day we catch up
to the flash-forwards.

32
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,149
Our future both as individuals
and as a collective

33
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:31,529
is upon us.

34
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:35,511
This building may very well come
under attack tomorrow night.

35
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:37,865
But we will not back down.

36
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,328
We are the FBI

37
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:42,416
and we will be open for business.

38
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:43,853
That said,

39
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:47,987
the director is instituting
high maximum alert protocols

40
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:49,349
and procedures.

41
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:52,194
Agents Benford and Noh
will be coordinating SWAT

42
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,254
and sniper teams to provide
external security and support.

43
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,085
Vreede, Hawk,

44
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,491
will be briefing supervisors
on additional OPS plans.

45
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:04,206
We are in uncharted waters, people.

46
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:07,084
But we will get through this...

47
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,919
Together. That's all.

48
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,291
Walk with me. Simon Campos?

49
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,728
His photo's out to all local
and national agencies.

50
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,488
- His cell phone?
- So far, inactive.

51
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:23,654
What about his sister?
She's back with his family.

52
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,242
Maybe he'll try and contact her.

53
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:28,191
RCMP is sitting on the house. We also
have a trap and trace on their phones.

54
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:31,053
He's gone underground
and taken that QED ring with him.

55
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:32,943
I want him back here immediately.

56
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,208
We're on it.

57
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,196
Gentlemen.

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,948
This is turning into
one hell of a day.

59
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:40,910
- <i>Breaking news out of Los Angeles.</i>
- What is this?

60
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,652
<i>WYKR has just obtained footage</i>

61
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:47,212
<i>of what appears to be a man who
was awake during the global blackout.</i>

62
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:50,091
I gave strict orders for this
to be kept under wraps.

63
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:53,464
- Who released this?
- Wait a minute. This isn't us.

64
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,014
<i>Authorities are still trying
to identify the man, but...</i>

65
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:57,301
It's a different angle.

66
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,053
He's right.

67
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,916
No one's seen this on our end.

68
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,957
Where did it come from?

69
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,339
The better question is, why now?

70
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,270
<i>With april 29th only one day away,</i>

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,560
<i>the stunned world wonders,</i>

72
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:12,202
<i>who is this man,</i>

73
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,401
<i>and why was he awake?</i>

74
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,796
Hi. My name's David Walker.

75
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,101
Hi. My name's david walker.

76
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:30,915
My name's Dave Walker.

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,129
Is this seat taken?

78
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,173
All yours.

79
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:43,338
- Have I seen you somewhere before?
- Me?

80
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,810
You have such a cute face, Simon.

81
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,107
Don't hide it.

82
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:54,692
Who are you?

83
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:55,922
Lita.

84
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,194
And if you run, they will find you.

85
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,408
- What do you want?
- I'm here with an offer.

86
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,576
An offer?

87
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,246
Like what, take my last remaining
nine fingers and kill my mother?

88
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:09,848
You'll want to hear us out.

89
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:12,918
Simon, please.
I'm dying of thirst.

90
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,545
Just pour me one drink.

91
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:17,372
I suppose a taste wouldn't hurt.

92
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,170
What'll it be?

93
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:20,741
Not here.

94
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,809
-= Blackout Team =-

95
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:40,112
Saison 1 - Épisode 20
-= The Negotiation =-

96
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,555
This is Agent Noh of the FBI.

97
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:49,423
I need to speak to the news director

98
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,503
that took possession of
the suspect zero footage.

99
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,586
See if you can find him.
I'll hold.

100
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,267
- What are you doing here?
- Hi. Is something wrong?

101
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:03,724
I'm just surprised to see you.
What's going on?

102
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:07,380
I was in court over on spring.
I need a favor.

103
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:08,505
What's up?

104
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:10,221
Take tomorrow off.

105
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,884
Tomorrow? Not a chance.

106
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,688
- You know what tomorrow is.
- Exactly.

107
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,025
I looked into airfare to Hawaii...
Dirt cheap.

108
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,554
Apparently, people are afraid
to fly on flash-forward day, so...

109
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,623
- Baby, listen...
- We can make this happen.

110
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:24,490
Tomorrow can be
whatever we want it to be.

111
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:27,618
We're not tied down to anything now.
Let's just go.

112
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:31,587
Listen, we can't just pretend I'm not
connected to other people, all right?

113
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,592
You know what's supposed to happen
to Mark, and there's Janis,

114
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,413
- and there's Wedeck...
- For once...

115
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,422
Baby, can this just be
about you and me?

116
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:49,593
I'm gonna be on this plane tomorrow.
I'm hoping you will be, too.

117
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:50,808
This isn't fair.

118
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:57,898
Hang on. Hi.
This is Agent Noh from the FBI.

119
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,359
I need to speak
to your news director...

120
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,570
Whoever took possession of the footage.
I need to know how you got it.

121
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:08,532
I've got McDow in your office.
Olivia is with him.

122
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:09,744
Why?

123
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,974
They got some kind of connection.
She keeps him calm.

124
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:16,836
If he knows anything about who's going
to attack this office tomorrow night,

125
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,961
I want to be the first
to hear about it.

126
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:21,630
That's not right.
That's in the wrong place.

127
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,341
- I don't think you should touch that.
- This... it's not right.

128
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,635
Don't touch it.

129
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,706
- That's not right. Who did this?
- Could you leave those, please?

130
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,129
It's not right. It's not right as rain.
So many things I missed before.

131
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,936
- My name is Mark.
- You're Mark Benford.

132
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,939
She's Olivia Simcoe. I'm gonna meet
Stanford Wedeck and Janis Hawk

133
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,775
- when they walk through that door.
- Wait, wait. Go back.

134
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,042
- Go back to the drawing board.
- No, go back...

135
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,904
It's not right, see? See it?

136
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,698
Right time, wrong place.
See it?

137
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,966
It's not right.
And this one, that's not right.

138
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,412
- Can I take a look at that?
- It's my book. You be careful.

139
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,997
It's my book. It's my book.

140
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:59,793
How did you draw this?

141
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,865
With a pen.

142
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,338
With a pen. It's with a red pen,
because I like to use

143
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:07,211
the red pen for the lines...

144
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,054
Gabriel was given
multiple flash-forwards,

145
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,683
- so he may have been here before.
- I was here...

146
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:14,911
With Dr. Frost.

147
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:16,136
Dyson Frost?

148
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:20,717
He told my mother
he'd take care of me.

149
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:23,650
He didn't say it would be good care.
It wasn't.

150
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:27,237
Olivia took care of me at the hospital,
and I got some new shoes.

151
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,612
- Do you like my new shoes?
- They're cute.

152
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,737
And I have a huge hippocampus,

153
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,138
FYI.

154
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,988
Thanks for bringing him in.

155
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:38,742
Glad I could help.

156
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:41,494
We have to formally
debrief him, though.

157
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,468
I'm gonna go now.

158
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,137
- Should I stay, or should I go now?
- You're staying.

159
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,292
You're staying?

160
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,501
- You're staying.
- You're gonna stay.

161
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:57,267
- Please...
- You're gonna stay.

162
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:59,905
- Can you let go of my arm?
- You're staying.

163
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,897
- Can you let go of my arm?
- You're staying.

164
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,108
- Listen...
- You can't touch! You can look,

165
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,151
but you can't touch this.

166
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,809
- You can't touch this.
- Gabriel, it's okay.

167
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,957
- Maybe I should stay.
- I think that's a good idea.

168
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,644
- Everything's okay. It's all okay.
- It's okay now?

169
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,036
See? It's okay.
You want a soda?

170
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,620
Yeah. Can I have a soda?
With a straw?

171
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,392
Good. Here we go.

172
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:35,683
It's over. I'm done.

173
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,974
Pull me out.

174
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,018
- I've gone as far as I'm willing to go.
- Just take a breath.

175
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,603
They want me to kill Mark.

176
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:47,379
I tried to stall by going to DC,

177
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,736
but Carline's been calling me
every single hour.

178
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:51,692
You can't say no.

179
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:56,618
What am I supposed to do?
He's an FBI agent.

180
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,579
He's my friend.
I'm not gonna do it.

181
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,772
If you say no,

182
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:02,270
they'll find someone else
to kill him,

183
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:03,972
and then they'll kill you.

184
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,354
There is no coming in
from the cold here, agent Hawk.

185
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,218
The only way out is to finish
what we started.

186
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:14,999
Look at me.

187
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,348
We're close.

188
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:28,273
Fine.

189
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,956
But they're getting antsy.

190
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:34,239
They're gonna burn me
if I don't give them something big.

191
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,783
Then give them something big.

192
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,487
I tried calling you last night.

193
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:57,441
- And the night before that.
- I know. I'm sorry.

194
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,458
Things have been really crazy.

195
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,717
I didn't want to talk to you
about this at work, but...

196
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,546
I think we need a plan.

197
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,356
I'm really busy. Do you think
we can talk about this later?

198
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:11,960
I want to be a part of what's going on
with this baby.

199
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,165
I really appreciate that you were there
for me when I needed you

200
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,907
but you don't have
to do anything now.

201
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,827
She's my responsibility. It's fine.

202
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,369
What if that's not okay with me?

203
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:22,900
What if I don't want to walk away?

204
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:26,250
You have a second chance at life.

205
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,418
You and Zoey should make
the best of it.

206
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:52,967
I put everything in place for the
security detail at the house tomorrow.

207
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:54,319
Okay.

208
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:56,446
I'll have 'em lay low

209
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,003
so as not to upset Charlie.

210
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,795
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, Mark. It's just weird.

211
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,373
It's weird to be talking to you
about security details,

212
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,498
and not...

213
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:10,862
I don't know, garage door openers
and parent/teacher conferences.

214
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:13,589
Yeah. I wish I had something to say
that would make it easier.

215
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,542
Gotta make it right, yeah.
Gotta make it right.

216
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,054
It's wrong. Right is right.

217
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,234
- That's right.
- Hey, I thought I told you...

218
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,024
What's he doing in here by himself?

219
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:28,080
Where's Vreede?

220
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:29,521
He went to get my book.

221
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,523
It's not in the right place.
It's not right.

222
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,921
I can't have you
pulling things apart like this.

223
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:35,606
All right? There you go.

224
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,162
Make it look right.

225
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,115
- I don't understand.
- You. You make it look right.

226
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:40,992
Make.

227
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,909
You. You make it look, like,
like this.

228
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:45,580
Like that.

229
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,628
That's where they're holding Tracy.

230
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:03,805
Joshua base.

231
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,633
Jericho has these bases all over.

232
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:07,972
None of them on a map.

233
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:09,628
Kidnap,

234
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,924
imprison, torture whoever they want.

235
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:13,445
A shadow army.

236
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,859
That does things
your government wants to do,

237
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,361
but legally can't.

238
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,465
Who are you sending those to?

239
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,826
Someone who shares your belief
that Jericho are criminals.

240
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:27,788
There.

241
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,965
That's where they conduct
all the interrogations.

242
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,250
Tracy will be in there.

243
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,412
You get these uploaded,

244
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:37,714
then we'll get my daughter back.

245
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,785
<i> Authorities have identified him</i>

246
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,991
<i>as physicist Simon Campos...</i>

247
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:00,362
Run away with me.

248
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,433
<i>... along with Dr. Simcoe
took responsibility...</i>

249
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:03,663
Where would we go?

250
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:05,826
Well, I would say Paris,

251
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,579
but you messed that up when your people
plastered my face all over the news.

252
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,039
Don't get snippy with me.

253
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:12,624
I'm just the messenger.

254
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,753
Besides,
Hellinger wants to help you.

255
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,961
Who's Hellinger?

256
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,781
Hellinger's our boss.

257
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:20,937
I don't have a boss.

258
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,093
Everyone has a boss.

259
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,601
He paid for your school,

260
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:26,388
got you a job equal to your talents,

261
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,305
protected you along the way.

262
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,558
He's the big guy.

263
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,560
Piss off. I'm done paying my debts.

264
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,224
Hey, we're not the enemy.

265
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:36,231
We're your only friends.

266
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,845
Well, I have a message
for your friends.

267
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,051
I'm done dealing
with lower level functionaries.

268
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:42,946
I thought I sent
that message with flosso.

269
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,282
These things need to be
face-to-face.

270
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,272
Believe me, he got that message.

271
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,506
He's anxious to speak with you.

272
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:50,620
Why are you here?

273
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,544
Trying to keep you in one place.

274
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,429
One thing you should know...

275
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,683
He's a very charming man...

276
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,436
Until he's not.

277
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,486
Mr. Campos.

278
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:18,809
Let's share a drink, shall we?

279
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:35,452
Yeah, all of them.

280
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,626
We were...
We were all together at Raven river.

281
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:40,677
And you're certain about her?

282
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,506
Nhadra, yeah.

283
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,050
Nhadra had a nice smile.

284
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,344
Not in this picture,
but Nhadra had a nice smile.

285
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,554
And this is Kent.
This is a terrible picture of Kent.

286
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,807
Kent's my friend. Although technically
he's dead, he's still my friend.

287
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,518
All of these people were together,

288
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,812
and they're all connected
by the experiment?

289
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,605
We can posit that Raven river

290
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,869
was some kind of research
and development,

291
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:04,319
and Somalia was an alpha test
for the GBO on October 6th.

292
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,742
Or October 6th was the beta test,

293
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,406
and this is just the beginning.

294
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,994
Do you have any idea
when the next one will be...

295
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:14,996
The next global blackout?

296
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:18,677
We need your help with this.

297
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:22,170
Is there a specific date or time?

298
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,049
Dr. Frost was in charge. He...
He chose the time and the day.

299
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,759
No, I just went on my trips, is all.

300
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,138
I just went on my trips,
and then I wrote down the notes.

301
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,733
Dyson Frost ran the experiments
by himself?

302
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,100
Was there anyone else?

303
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,270
Yeah, the big guy.

304
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,231
He's the boss. Big guy.

305
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,150
You have his picture?
I drew his picture. He's very clean.

306
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:45,569
Does big guy have a name?

307
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,082
I just... I just told you his name.
His name is big guy.

308
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:50,612
Where is his picture?

309
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,342
- In my book.
- This one?

310
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:53,618
Yeah. Page 15.

311
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,162
It's a good picture.

312
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,649
It's in the black pen.

313
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:00,417
That's big guy.

314
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:02,794
Big guy.

315
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,698
I need you to tell me

316
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:10,802
everything you know about this man.

317
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,262
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

318
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,347
Mark, can I talk to you
for a minute?

319
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:17,726
Hey. What's up?

320
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:19,936
- It's not safe.
- You're safe here.

321
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,898
I'm fine! I'm fine!
He's not supposed to be here right now!

322
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,441
He died! You died!

323
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:27,319
Very sad that day, but that's...
That's the way it has to go

324
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,085
if things are gonna work out right.
You died that day.

325
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:39,122
Can you imagine

326
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,728
what vile, diseased lips
last touched these glasses...

327
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:43,877
or those sheets?

328
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,489
I'd hate to see them
under a black light.

329
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:48,923
The life of suspect zero.

330
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:51,176
You'd be surprised
what you get used to.

331
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:53,908
So...

332
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,859
We're about a day
away from the 29th.

333
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,142
It's time to come home.

334
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:01,728
Piss off.

335
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:04,022
Can we get a little ice in here please,
Lita?

336
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,531
You have every right to be angry.

337
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,468
Oh, I'm way past angry, mate.

338
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,437
Where do you go from here, Simon?

339
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:21,665
You're a fugitive from the FBI,
the whole world, for that matter.

340
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,084
Your life's work is over.
You have nothing.

341
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:25,580
You are nothing.

342
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:27,904
I can give it all back to you.

343
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,506
Come work for us.

344
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:32,717
You will be protected.
Your work will continue.

345
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,992
And we can even arrange for you
to see your family from time to time.

346
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:37,806
Your dear Annabelle.

347
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,475
That's the carrot.
What's the stick?

348
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:42,085
The stick...

349
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,729
Is the stick.

350
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,272
I don't want to consider that.

351
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,149
Because there is no stick.

352
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:49,996
What are you gonna do?

353
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:51,111
Kill my family?

354
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,321
Cut me up? Hasn't worked so far.

355
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,824
You need me,
otherwise I wouldn't be here.

356
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:57,100
At some point...

357
00:17:58,127 --> 00:17:59,571
we will cut our losses.

358
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,747
I'm the only person
that can calibrate the accelerator,

359
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:04,583
and you know it.

360
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,618
This is your final offer.

361
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,212
I'd say sleep on it,
but we're running out of time.

362
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,093
Yeah.

363
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,008
Well, you'll be receiving
my response soon enough.

364
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,824
Maybe Gabriel's "big guy"
can give us a lead on Simon.

365
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,153
We'll run this through
facial recognition analysis,

366
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:40,559
get it out worldwide.

367
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,330
We're closing in, Demetri.

368
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,371
You with me?

369
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:48,293
- I'm sorry. It's all right.
- Did McDow get under your skin?

370
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,335
A little.

371
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,881
And the whole thing with Slingerland
trying to kill people

372
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,717
to course-correct the universe,

373
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:58,094
and Dyson Frost and his garden
of forking paths. Now this guy.

374
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,347
I know where you're headed
with this.

375
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,641
Don't go there.

376
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,681
You believe any of that stuff?

377
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,815
That the universe
is somehow pushing us

378
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,942
towards one certain outcome?

379
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,971
Then my being alive isn't somehow...

380
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,318
Screwing things up?

381
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,996
I think you're screwing
a lot of things up,

382
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,207
but the universe
has nothing to do with it.

383
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:29,793
Thank you.
That was really touching.

384
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,475
Happy to help.

385
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,881
After 10:00 tomorrow night,

386
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,436
we're gonna have to go back
to living the way we used to.

387
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:38,840
Thank you.

388
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,125
Not looking ahead.

389
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,424
Gotta say,
kind of looking forward to it.

390
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:51,698
Me too.

391
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,992
I can see you're feeling better.

392
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:05,703
I have a huge hippocampus.

393
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,611
F.Y.I. Yeah, Olivia...
Olivia told me so.

394
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,500
- Olivia said so.
- She would know.

395
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:12,502
- Yeah.
- How's the debriefing?

396
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,338
- Stressful.
- Very stressful.

397
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,675
- I know. I've been there.
- How's it going without Simon?

398
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:23,221
Struggling
with the decoherence equation.

399
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,390
Yeah, the equation.
Yeah, the equa...

400
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,530
The equation?
You do the math.

401
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,729
I don't do math. I do art.
You do the math. Do the numbers.

402
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,691
You do the numbers together.
They have to be in the right order,

403
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,403
and then you're part of the equation...
Both of you are part of the equation.

404
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:42,994
This confirms Clemente's suspicions.

405
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,702
This entire operation
is not supposed to exist.

406
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,913
- You got what you're looking for?
- <i>I do.</i>

407
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,707
- <i>You've done a great job.</i>
- Then it's time to get tracy.

408
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:53,032
- You're not going in there.
- Yes, I am.

409
00:20:53,157 --> 00:20:55,336
<i>Don't.</i>
Please sit tight,

410
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,172
<i>At least until I can get the military
there to back you up.</i>

411
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,600
Negative.
My daughter is now the priority.

412
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,927
- I've held up my end of the deal.
- <i>I know,</i>

413
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,138
and I appreciate that, Aaron,

414
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,723
<i>but I want to keep you safe.</i>

415
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,460
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

416
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,611
I can't.

417
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:12,499
Damn it!

418
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:18,268
They're putting her in the truck.

419
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,930
Let's go.

420
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:34,375
I'm running out of excuses for you.

421
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:37,837
You asked me to kill my friend, Carline,
not to bake a cake.

422
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,105
I didn't ask you to do anything.

423
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:43,435
And when I tell you something
needs to be done,

424
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:45,011
you need to do it.

425
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:46,676
I understand that,

426
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:49,095
but Benford's an F.B.I. agent.

427
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,715
I can't just walk into the office
and shoot him in the head.

428
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,186
I'll take care of it.

429
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,610
When I can do it without getting
myself killed in the process.

430
00:21:58,054 --> 00:21:59,901
It better be before tomorrow night.

431
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:03,328
- Why?
- Questions get you killed, sweet pea.

432
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:05,990
Where are we with mosaic?

433
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:12,325
Don't piddle, Janis.

434
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,499
You are hanging on by a thread.

435
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,379
If I go back empty-handed,

436
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,381
it's over for you.

437
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:24,480
You have a baby to think about.

438
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:31,057
Gabriel McDow.
Do you know him?

439
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:33,277
Yeah, I know Gabe.

440
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:36,316
He's in the F.B.I. right now,
laying the whole thing out...

441
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,648
Raven river, Dyson Frost, all of it.

442
00:22:39,168 --> 00:22:40,400
And they're buyin' it?

443
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:44,654
They know he's a gold mine
and that your people want him dead.

444
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:49,399
He has been a bit of sand
in the petroleum jelly.

445
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:51,792
Can you deliver him?

446
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,372
He's being moved to a safe house.

447
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,291
I can tell you when and where.

448
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:59,635
I don't care
what they say about you.

449
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:02,376
You're worth the money, honey.

450
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,841
News director says
the suspect zero footage

451
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:16,122
came on a flash drive by messenger.
I've got forensics on the envelope.

452
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:18,499
Review the surveillance tapes
from the news building.

453
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:20,106
I want to talk to that messenger.

454
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,818
Marshals have a safe house
available in Sylmar.

455
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,572
- It's our best option for McDow.
- Overused. And Silver Strand Beach?

456
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,140
D.E.A.'s using it.

457
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:31,676
Sylmar it is.
We're on the move within the hour.

458
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,329
McDow's gonna blow a gasket
if we separate him from Olivia.

459
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:36,991
I'll let you break the news.

460
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:39,768
Thanks.

461
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,810
Olivia, could I talk to you
for a minute, please?

462
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:49,423
- Sure.
- Thank you.

463
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:50,678
I'll be right back.

464
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:52,722
I'm gonna be right outside.

465
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:54,088
Right there.

466
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:05,109
We're gonna take you
to your new house.

467
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:06,819
You'll like it there.

468
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,573
Can you tell me what you see?

469
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:12,359
Loose ends.

470
00:24:15,423 --> 00:24:16,829
I know the feeling.

471
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:20,544
Listen, before you go,
I need to ask something.

472
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,839
You called. You said...

473
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:29,502
"Olivia...

474
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:32,970
"Olivia... Simcoe."

475
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,331
- Olivia Simcoe, yes.
- That's right.

476
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:36,599
I need to know,

477
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:38,935
is that how this all turns out?

478
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,410
It's what I've seen.

479
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:46,234
I see so many things.
So many things I see come true,

480
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:49,403
and I've been waiting a long time.

481
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,770
Is she gonna be okay?

482
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,030
Will she be safe?

483
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:11,092
That's far enough. Let's put her down
and start digging.

484
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:25,940
Nice shot.

485
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:31,571
Don't move!
Don't move!

486
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,870
Don't move! Don't move!

487
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,325
Tracy, it's me. It's dad.

488
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:39,912
- You're safe now. You're safe.
- We've got to move and take cover.

489
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:42,081
I'll assess her injuries over there.

490
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,375
You're gonna be okay.
I got you.

491
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:02,665
Daisy?

492
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:05,104
Yes, it's Stan.

493
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,648
Can you get the President for me?

494
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:09,837
Put him through.

495
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:14,148
Big day tomorrow, Stan?

496
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,200
Yes, it is. Listen...

497
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,513
- What's wrong?
- <i>I'm sitting here with something...</i>

498
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:22,663
That I don't want,
and it has to do with you.

499
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,036
Well, you know all my secrets, Stan.

500
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,543
We've come all this way.
How bad could it be?

501
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,128
Joshua base.

502
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:32,175
It doesn't ring a bell.

503
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,176
Then I have nothing to worry about
if I turn these photos over to Clemente

504
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,965
- <i>for further investigation.</i>
- Why Clemente?

505
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,164
<i>Have you ever asked your Vice President</i>
what she saw happening...

506
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:42,433
Tomorrow?

507
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:46,943
I always knew this call was coming.

508
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:50,380
I just never figured
it would come from you.

509
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,611
I appreciate the call,
Assistant Director Wedeck.

510
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,689
Assistant Director Stanford Wedeck

511
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:14,856
for Vice President Clemente.

512
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,647
- Gentlemen, we all squared away?
- Ready to go.

513
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:21,722
- How you doing, Gabriel?
- I'm bulletproof now.

514
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,145
Feels good, doesn't it?

515
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:27,771
- Where's Dem?
- Prepping the van. Let's go.

516
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,339
McDow is on the move.

517
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:50,861
Black van, two agents,
two S.W.A.T., heavily armed.

518
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:54,125
118 east to Sylmar,
exit Foothill towards Arroyo.

519
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,757
- 20 minutes.
- Copy that. We're on our way.

520
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,730
<i>It's the day
before the flash-forward,</i>

521
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,220
<i>and once again, everyone's asking,</i>

522
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:14,714
<i>"what did you see?"</i>

523
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:17,194
<i>So I'll tell you exactly what I saw.</i>

524
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,572
I was, and will be,<i></i>

525
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,240
<i>enjoying atomic</i>

526
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,574
<i>wings at Wing a Ding Ding
off Tujunga!</i>

527
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:25,918
<i>Tuesday night is ladies night,
where ladies...</i>

528
00:28:26,043 --> 00:28:27,075
Jackass.

529
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:29,915
Sounds good to me.

530
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,086
This guy didn't even think
about using his blinker.

531
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:38,674
Learn the rules, son!

532
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,015
- You all right back there?
- We're good.

533
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,367
Check this out.

534
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,287
Get out of here. Reverse.

535
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:10,539
Go, Vreede!

536
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,064
Don't shoot!

537
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:39,902
- Drop your weapon!
- On the ground.

538
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,195
Play along.

539
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,614
Just play along.
We're after the big guy, okay?

540
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:46,190
Call your boss.

541
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:47,924
Tell him you have your man.

542
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,166
On the ground!

543
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,291
Are we clear?

544
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,134
My men will interrogate this soldier,
we'll see

545
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,650
what he knows about Tracy.

546
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:07,087
There must be a military hospital
back near Kandahar.

547
00:30:07,212 --> 00:30:09,614
The roads are too dangerous.
They'll flag us at the checkpoints.

548
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,802
Even if we manage to get there
without getting killed

549
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,564
- I don't think she'll survive the ride.
- Hold on, honey.

550
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,440
- I got you.
- Daddy.

551
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,022
- Aaron, we can't go back now.
- You listen to me, buddy.

552
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:23,420
We are gonna drive back to Kandahar,
and you're gonna save her life.

553
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:25,776
I saw her alive.

554
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:27,450
She's gonna make it.

555
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,221
We all are. Now drive.

556
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:30,911
Hold on, sweetheart. I got you.

557
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:35,190
We're gonna be fine.

558
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:38,389
I got you. Drive.

559
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:52,391
Mr. Hellinger said right over there.

560
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:06,414
Gabriel McDow.

561
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:09,416
Welcome back into the fold.

562
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:17,625
- It's a trap!
- Don't!

563
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,330
Red! Red!

564
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,057
Burn it all!

565
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,683
Move!

566
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:37,228
Hellinger, freeze!

567
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,330
Down on the ground!
Face down!

568
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,361
Don't move!

569
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,115
Game over, Hellinger.
Start talking.

570
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,372
Simon Campos...
does he work for you? Is he here?

571
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,866
Tell me where he is!

572
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,825
Damn it, Mark!

573
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,912
You scared me.

574
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:40,499
Who do you work for?

575
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:41,834
What?

576
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,587
You're not FBI.
So who the hell signs your paychecks?

577
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:50,978
CIA.

578
00:32:56,812 --> 00:32:57,714
How long?

579
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,058
Vogel recruited me at Quantico.

580
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:02,624
Three years.

581
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,108
How did you know?

582
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,651
I got suspicious when you sold out
Marcie as the mole.

583
00:33:08,014 --> 00:33:09,194
Marcie has a brother.

584
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,864
He's dying in Missouri
in a full-care facility.

585
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,240
It's expensive.

586
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,868
The meetings with Vogel,
the fish store...

587
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:19,121
where I assume you were meeting
your contact.

588
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:21,957
But it was the Hellinger sting,
confirmed everything.

589
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:25,836
Your assignment today
goes beyond being

590
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,713
- McDow's decoy.
- How far beyond?

591
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,133
Intel says they're planning to kidnap
McDow en route to the safe house, so...

592
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:34,303
It's out best chance
to capture someone of value.

593
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,263
Based on what intel, Janis?

594
00:33:37,138 --> 00:33:39,683
- There's a lot of chatter.
- "There's a lot of chatter"?

595
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:42,721
There is no chatter.
We don't even know where to listen.

596
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:45,337
- Who's your source?
- My source

597
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:46,482
is reliable.

598
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,447
You blew your cover
by setting him up.

599
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:55,991
Why now?

600
00:33:57,464 --> 00:33:59,953
Because they wanted me to kill you,
Mark.

601
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,619
I told them I would.

602
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,880
A lot of people are gonna be wondering
who you really are.

603
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:11,775
I did what I had to do.

604
00:34:12,503 --> 00:34:14,344
"Sacrifice for the greater good."

605
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,262
I've tried that line. It doesn't work.
Looks good on a plaque, though.

606
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:19,214
Don't say that to me, Mark.

607
00:34:21,865 --> 00:34:24,082
I've been living
in between two separate lives

608
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:27,003
in this tiny space
where nothing ever happens.

609
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,939
I can't have any friends.

610
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:34,062
I can't

611
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,615
fall in love.
Nobody even knows me.

612
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,056
I was doing my job.

613
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,168
That has to count for something.

614
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,336
It does.

615
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:53,962
Too bad all anyone will ever see
is the deception,

616
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,693
and they will never get past it.

617
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:00,973
You're on the outside now, Janis.

618
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,170
If you sacrifice everything,

619
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:07,855
be prepared to walk alone.

620
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:10,023
You're walking right beside me.

621
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,530
You're about to lose your family.

622
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:18,271
Is it worth it to you?

623
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:20,868
I don't ask that question.

624
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,995
How can you not?

625
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:24,968
Too much at stake.

626
00:35:30,684 --> 00:35:32,478
Please don't tell Demetri

627
00:35:34,977 --> 00:35:36,383
just let me do it.

628
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,690
It's all over.

629
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,860
I'm glad to be out from under
all that lying.

630
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,557
I don't understand how you could.

631
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:55,511
I thought I could get away clean

632
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,400
and not hurt anybody.

633
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,016
What about the pregnancy?

634
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,557
- How does that not involve me?
- Demetri, I just...

635
00:36:05,108 --> 00:36:06,516
I needed a way out.

636
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:10,125
I thought it would be
a new beginning.

637
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:13,591
I'm sorry. You're my friend,
and I should have done better by you.

638
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:16,665
But this baby is the most important
thing that has ever happened to me.

639
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,366
It didn't just happen to you.

640
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:23,388
Every little decision you make leads
to something else,

641
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:26,517
and now we're all connected...
You and me and Zoey.

642
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,601
No, we're not.

643
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:32,703
Demetri, there's me and my baby,
and then there's you and Zoey.

644
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,317
Don't let this situation
ruin your life.

645
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:37,861
You don't need to be part
of the mess that I made.

646
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:43,776
I already am.

647
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,130
<i>Meanwhile, in the ready room
of the American eagle squadron,</i>

648
00:36:57,453 --> 00:36:58,924
<i>Yank, Doodle and Dee watch</i>

649
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,260
<i>while Dan tries to contact
Roger Ramjet.</i>

650
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:05,148
<i>Roger should have located
the No-Goods' hideout by now.</i>

651
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:07,930
- <i>Then why can't we reach him...</i>
- Hey, Gabriel.

652
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:12,223
- Agent Noh.
- Yeah, I know.

653
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:14,314
Mind if I sit?

654
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:15,993
Take a seat.

655
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,125
Sure. Take a seat.

656
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:20,612
- "Roger Ramjet"?
- It's Dr. Evil Kisser.

657
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:22,656
- I love this show.
- Yeah, me, too.

658
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:34,426
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

659
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,493
In all the futures you saw,

660
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:42,378
was I in any of them?

661
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,011
No, you died.

662
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,555
People...
people were sad.

663
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,182
Very sad.

664
00:37:49,957 --> 00:37:51,658
What do you think happens when...

665
00:37:52,808 --> 00:37:54,229
the future you saw changes?

666
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,192
That's not possible.

667
00:37:58,685 --> 00:37:59,804
It's not possible.

668
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,161
It's like trying to find
a different path.

669
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:03,947
You wind up in the same place.

670
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,117
Always in the same place...
Like fate. Like Lloyd and Olivia.

671
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,326
Everyone is ending up...
Where they're supposed to be.

672
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:12,826
Even you.

673
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:17,127
Makes sense.

674
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:25,918
- <i>Now what's your plan?</i>
- <i>Find that diabolical machine</i>

675
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:27,638
- <i>before it's too late.</i>
- <i>Then hurry.</i>

676
00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:40,379
Wait here. Wait here.

677
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:48,517
My god.

678
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,831
This is it. We're here.

679
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,751
I'll always find you, kiddo.

680
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:00,921
It's okay.

681
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:02,573
We made it.

682
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,144
Janis, relax.
Relax.

683
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:27,505
I need your help.
