1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:03,975



2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,713


3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,133
In my flash-forward,
I was investigating.

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,260
I seemed to have an idea
why this was happening.

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,512
Priority number one,
finding out what caused this.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,058
Priority number two is figuring out
whether or not it'll happen again.

7
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,936
What if I didn't see anything
because six months from now,

8
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,051
- I'm gonna be dead?
- D. Gibbons is a bad man.

9
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:27,413
Tracy was killed in Afghanistan,
but in my flash-forward, she's alive.

10
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:29,445
You're worried your future's
gonna come true.

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,857
I'm worried mine won't.

12
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:37,682
- This is Demetri.
- <i>Mr. Noh?</i>

13
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,497
<i>I'm sorry to disturb you,</i>

14
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,743
<i>but I'm calling in response
to your mosaic board posting.</i>

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,127
Who is this?
How did you get this number?

16
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:48,506
I can't divulge that, but I can tell you
my vision involved you.

17
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:51,089
Go on.

18
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:54,588
In my flash-forward, I was reading
an intelligence briefing,

19
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:57,039
and I am sorry.

20
00:00:57,496 --> 00:01:00,246
There is no delicate way
to say this, but...

21
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:03,104
on March 15th, 2010,

22
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:06,691
you are going to be murdered.

23
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:07,912
What?

24
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,111
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,217
I understand why you're upset,

26
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:14,892
but my hope is
by telling you what I know,

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,147
<i>you will be able to prevent
your murder from happening.</i>

28
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:19,582
Did it say who killed me?

29
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:21,844
- I'm afraid not.
- What did it say then?

30
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,500
<i>That you were an agent
from the American FBI,</i>

31
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:27,683
and that you were shot
three times in the chest.

32
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,185
You gotta give me more to go on here.
What kind of briefing was this?

33
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,010
I'm sorry, Mr. Noh.
I have to end this call now.

34
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,095
No. Wait. Wait!
Hello? Hello!

35
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:39,221
Hello?

36
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:42,051
<i>I'm sorry. Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.</i>

37
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:42,985
Come on!

38
00:01:45,836 --> 00:01:47,406
1x03 - 137 Sekunden

39
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,820
<i>We're trapped in here.
We have to get out.</i>

40
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:53,586
<i>I'm freezing!</i>

41
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:55,190
<i>At least you have fur.</i>

42
00:02:58,014 --> 00:02:59,970
Nicole, it's Olivia again.

43
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:03,770
Look, babe, we're not mad, okay?
We're just worried about you.

44
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:06,716
So can you please call
and let us know you're all right?

45
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,271
We'll speak to you soon. Bye.

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,663
Man. We gotta cover
for Nicole again.

47
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:15,499
I can pick Charlie up after school,
take her back to work with me.

48
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:16,737
Are you sure?

49
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:20,087
We're sifting through blackout intel
from Interpol and such.

50
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:22,644
I'll welcome the distraction.

51
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,201
That's Aaron.

52
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,391
Aaron's coming here?

53
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,334
Phone's broke.
Said he'd take a look.

54
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:32,531
I just called Nicole.

55
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:35,162
The problem's with my work line.

56
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:39,131
You called me from your work phone,
said it was urgent.

57
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,835
And now you're lying to Olivia?

58
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,390
If you want to prevent the future
and save your marriage,

59
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,519
first step isn't keeping secrets.
Take that from a guy already divorced.

60
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,812
This is different.

61
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,730
- It's about Charlie.
- What happened?

62
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:54,233
She's been freaking out
about what she saw, right?

63
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:57,987
There's a guy we've been investigating.
We've been calling him D. Gibbons.

64
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,032
Charlie's vision had to do with him.

65
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,219
She knew who he was.

66
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,195
She said, "D. Gibbons is a bad man."

67
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,498
- How is that even possible?
- In my flash-forward,

68
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,543
masked gunmen
were comin into the office.

69
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,379
Maybe D. Gibbons
is connected to 'em.

70
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:18,716
You think whoever's supposed to be
after you will come after Charlie?

71
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,468
What if this whole investigation
circles back on me?

72
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,948
Well, isn't that always the risk
with your line of work?

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,557
And shouldn't you be talking
to somebody down at your office?

74
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:28,392
Blackout's changed everything.

75
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:30,442
I'll tell you what I'd do...

76
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,543
father to father.

77
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:34,208
If someone's gonna hurt your family,

78
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,431
the best thing to do is
catch 'em before they can.

79
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:40,183
The world's changed. Maybe the rules
need to change a little, too.

80
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:42,364
If it were up to me,

81
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,625
I'd do whatever I had to do.

82
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:55,476
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

83
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,107
<i>Welcome aboard Flight 82
for Los Angeles.</i>

84
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:01,158
<i>We've gotten the okay from the tower
to push back as soon as all carry-ons</i>

85
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:03,199
<i>and personal items
are safely stored.</i>

86
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:06,138
- <i>Flight attendants...</i>
- So are you flying to home or from?

87
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:07,202
To.

88
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:08,724
Back to my fiancé.

89
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:11,385
I've been stuck here
since the blackout.

90
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:14,711
But now that the airlines
are up and running again...

91
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,136
I hopped on the first flight
they were offering.

92
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:19,144
What were you doing in Seattle?

93
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,362
I'm a lawyer...
criminal defense.

94
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,718
- What about you? Why are you flying?
- I have to.

95
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:27,764
I'm the CEO of the airline.

96
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:31,294
All the executives are
taking flights today...

97
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:34,570
to prove to our customers
that the skies are safe again.

98
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,942
How's that working out for you?

99
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,295
Gangbusters.
Another scotch.

101
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,609
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure. What do you need?

102
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:58,744
I got a call last night
from an unknown number.

103
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:01,112
Can you have the tech guys
back-trace it through the carrier

104
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,743
and see if they can identify
the cell sites it was routed through?

105
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,410
What's the priority on this?

106
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:07,506
Nuclear.

107
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,002
How's it going?

108
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:16,683
Let me put it this way...
I miss the good old days,

109
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:19,420
when law enforcement didn't share
their leads with each other.

110
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,333
We're gonna be cashing
in our pensions

111
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,582
before we finish sifting
through all of this intel.

112
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,634
Kingdom of Tonga?

113
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:28,334
Now who knew they even had
an intelligence agency?

114
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:32,256
They're blaming the flash-forwards
on phytoplankton blooms.

115
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:35,448
Well, I'll see your boring
and raise you an insane.

116
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:38,537
"The flash-forwards were
caused by a toxic gas

117
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:42,573
"that was released from deep within the
earth as a result of crustal rifting."

118
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:46,030
So the earth farted, and we blacked out.
That makes sense to me.

119
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:49,825
At least this one's vetted
by our legates in Germany.

120
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,544
Apparently there's a prisoner,
a former Nazi.

121
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,081
A Rudolf Geyer, who's claiming to know
why the blackouts lasted

122
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,363
exactly 137 <i>sekunden</i>.

123
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,444
<i>Sekunden.</i>
That's german for "seconds."

124
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:07,909
Wait a minute.
The guy who sent this in...

125
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:09,623
Do you have a picture of him?

126
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,452
That's him.
He was on my board.

127
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,721
We gotta follow up on this.

128
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:22,015
Based on what, Mark...
your spidey sense?

129
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,683
Something spookier.

130
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,091
The Nazi's report...

131
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,370
mentions Mark by name.

132
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,579


133
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,832
Let me see if I got this right.
We got agents working 24/7

134
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:41,769
to identify the two guys
who were awake during the blackout.

135
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,381
This week alone I've gotta figure out
how to eulogize eight dead agents,

136
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,383
and you want to fly to Germany
to talk to a Nazi?

137
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:50,496
Well, a former Nazi.

138
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:52,596
Well, that just makes me feel
so much better.

139
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,807
Geyer requested a meeting
with me specifically.

140
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,118
- How does he even know you?
- I have no idea,

141
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,882
but he says he can explain
why the blackout lasted 137 seconds,

142
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:04,024
and he won't talk
unless I see him face-to-face.

143
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,423
And in the meantime, you're getting
nowhere with tracking down Suspect Zero

144
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:08,831
or D. Gibbons.

145
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,989
NSA's still working
on the Suspect Zero video.

146
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,083
And we're running down digital forensics
from D. Gibbons' cell phone.

147
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,454
For all we know, it's Geyer's
information that will lead us...

148
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:19,779
to them.

149
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:25,283
Book the flights.

150
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:49,236
I thought I was never
gonna see you again.

151
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,404
Me, too.

152
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:58,276
So can I tell you now?

153
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:02,166
- Tell me what?
- What I saw in my flash-forward.

154
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,713
- Zo...
- What's the big deal, babe?

155
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,772
It's not like we didn't see
the same thing.

156
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,381
Here.

157
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,425
We could talk...

158
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:13,439
- or...
- Or?

159
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,515
Or we could go to a motel...

160
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:17,806
I like your thinking, stranger.

161
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:36,366
What can I get you?

162
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,093
Just a soda water, Kate.

163
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,542
What the hell are you doing here?

164
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:48,545
Our daughter's alive, Kate.

165
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:54,388
I saw her during the blackout.
In my vision, I was with her.

166
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:56,053
She was wounded.

167
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,663
I think it might have been
somewhere in Afghanistan.

168
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,474
Are you sure you weren't dead?

169
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,733
Maybe you were in heaven with her.

170
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:05,679
You might want to check on that
with your higher power.

171
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:09,711
You know what people have been saying.
Glimpses of what's to come.

172
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:13,453
What's to come?

173
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,400
You want to know what I saw?

174
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,736
This.

175
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:20,990
I was doing the same thing
I'm doing now,

176
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:23,044
same thing I've been doing
the past five years.

177
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,250
And those sorry-ass regulars there?
They were here, too.

178
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,627
What you saw...

179
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,441
was wishful thinking.

180
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,087
Let her go, Aaron.

181
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:33,965
I can't.
Not when I know she needs me.

182
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,764
- She's out there. I'm positive.
- She's dead! She's buried!

183
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:40,680
This isn't about some vision. This is
about you coming up with a fantasy

184
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,114
'cause you're the reason she went
into the military in the first place.

185
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,983
- That's not true.
- Of course it is.

186
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:49,522
She's daddy's little girl,
following in your footsteps.

187
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:52,275
Why are you doing this, anyway?

188
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:54,473
What do you want from me, anyway?

189
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:56,397
Stop, stop. It's all right.

190
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:59,653
I just want your signature.

191
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:01,742
I need you to sign an affidavit

192
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:04,235
so I can exhume her remains.

193
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,262
You're not gonna get it, Aaron.

194
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:09,244
Why don't you just take this and go?

195
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:14,052
I'm gonna find her, Kate,
whether you help me or not.

196
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:16,396
And when I do, I'll let you know.

197
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,325
That's the second time
I've blacked out this week.

198
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:31,111
Now can I tell you about what I saw?

199
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,380
It was our wedding.

200
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,201
It was on Hamoa beach in Hawaii,
I think, where we went last spring.

201
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,125
It was so peaceful.

202
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,637
The wind and the waves...

203
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:55,620
Everything was perfect.

204
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,174
And you saw me there?

205
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,972
Did you see me?

206
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:09,683
Of course I saw you...

207
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:13,133
In that white dress...

208
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,983
Barefoot.

209
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,362
Baby, you were so beautiful.

210
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:22,789
It's just like you described.

211
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,296
You realize that's gonna be
our wedding day, don't you?

212
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:27,746
April 29th?

213
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:29,623
D-Day?

214
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,028
All that's happened, baby,
I'm not sure we should...

215
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,216
- commit to a date.
- We already have.

216
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:39,358
So...

217
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,743
Can't you just...

218
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:44,685
fall back...

219
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,385
Let the future happen
like it's supposed to?

220
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,879
Welcome to Munich.

221
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:20,660
Agent Benford, Agent Hawk.

222
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,615
- Stefan Krieger.
- Hello.

223
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,308
I'll be your BND liaison
during your stay.

224
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:29,891
Thanks for arranging this meeting
on such short notice.

225
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,013
You're here as guests
of the German government.

226
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:35,891
As such, you have
no actual authority

227
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,701
and will proceed with
appropriate decorum. Agreed?

228
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:39,925
Agreed.

229
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:42,077
There are a lot of ghosts here.

230
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:45,064
Isn't this where Sophie Scholl

231
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:48,616
and the rest of the White Rose Nazi
resistance group were executed?

232
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,311
If I'm not mistaken,
your country eradicated

233
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,147
it's indigenous Indian population

234
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:57,034
and practiced institutionalized
slavery for over...

235
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:58,907
250 years.

236
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:01,756
We also gave the world
Britney Spears.

237
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:06,873
Rudolf Geyer may present
himself as a frail,

238
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,388
forgetful old man,

239
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:12,841
but I should remind you that he managed
to elude capture for half a century.

240
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:16,563
Spending at least 20 of those years
within your own US borders.

241
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:18,895
He's an unrepentant murderer.

242
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,478
His entire existence has been based
on dissemblance and falsehood.

243
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,907
Never forget that.

244
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:31,703
<i>Herr</i> Geyer.

245
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:39,669
Gentlemen...

246
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,451
and lady.

247
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,845
I've looked forward to meeting you,
<i>Herr</i> Benford.

248
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,123
For quite some time.

249
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,394


250
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,397
- How did you know my name?
- I saw it in my vision.

251
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,224
You said you had information
about the flash-forward,

252
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:05,737
about how long they lasted.

253
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:09,035
It's not quite that simple,
I'm afraid.

254
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,306
You see, before
my unfortunate incarceration,

255
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:13,662
I lived in America,

256
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:17,582
and I learned how you can't
get something for nothing.

257
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:22,066
We've anticipated this, <i>Herr</i> Geyer.
Upon verification of your information,

258
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:25,548
you will be transferred to
a minimum security facility.

259
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:31,833
But I had more than
a gesture in mind.

260
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,592
I want to return to America,

261
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:39,062
and all charges against me
are dropped.

262
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,277
- You're dreaming.
- I'm not permitting my client

263
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,070
to breathe a word of what he knows

264
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:49,345
without getting his pardon first.

265
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,880
I believe we have what's called
a game of chicken.

266
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,083
Who do you think will blink first?

267
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,632
Before you answer, consider the fact

268
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:03,336
I have nothing to lose.

269
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,508
He's playing us.

270
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:12,640
Think about it. This is win-win for him.
At best, he's just jerking us around

271
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:15,744
for a few days' entertainment, and at
worst he goes free, and we have no...

272
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:18,252
We'll figure out a way
to cover ourselves if he's lying.

273
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,061
You heard his lawyer. They're not
gonna let us cover ourselves.

274
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,615
This is full pardon or nothing,

275
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,900
- that's what Geyer's gonna give us.
- We don't know.

276
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,972
The only thing is Geyer's important
to our case six months from now,

277
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:30,772
- which means...
- Listen to yourself.

278
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,139
- I am listening.
- Mark, six months from now?

279
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,046
The only thing we know at this point
is how much we don't know.

280
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:39,775
Mark, you're talking
about letting a mass murderer

281
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,084
go free in exchange
for potentially nothing.

282
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,574
Janis, there are
several billion people...

283
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,456
who need answers.

284
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:50,175
That's not nothing.

285
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:53,273
They need to know why it happened,
whether it'll happen again.

286
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,411
The guy makes me sick.

287
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,964
But he's 86 years old.
He's on his way out.

288
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,935
And as much as I'd like to
personally help him on his way,

289
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,981
I have to ask myself if the ends
don't justify the means here.

290
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,070
They never do.

291
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:09,694
Geyer's age is irrelevant.

292
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,405
There's no statute
of limitations on evil.

293
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:14,275
Geyer deserves his punishment,

294
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,699
and his victims deserve him
getting that punishment,

295
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:19,287
and you can't take that,
away from them on a hope.

296
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,793
So how's Mark handling all of this?

297
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,080
The usual way...
throwing himself into work.

298
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:28,972
- How about Stan?
- The same.

299
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,451
Since becoming
bureau assistant director,

300
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:34,719
he's convinced he has to work twice
as hard as everybody else in the bureau.

301
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:37,178
He's pulled
two all-nighters in a row,

302
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,166
working on this eulogy
for the memorial service.

303
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:44,062
Like if he found the right words, he
could bring these agents back to life.

304
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,907
Mark's convinced that what he saw in his
flash-forward is going to save us all.

305
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:51,319
So Mark saw himself saving the world,
and what did you see?

306
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:54,073
Hey, honey.

307
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,534
Nothing important.

308
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,598
- How about you?
- I was home.

309
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,936
I was in Jason's room,

310
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,150
but all of his stuff was gone.

311
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,424
That makes sense. He's in college.
He still comes home for holidays.

312
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,025
But in my vision,
everything was gone

313
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,350
and replaced by
a young boy's things.

314
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,969
He was about 8 or 9 years old,
and I was putting him to bed.

315
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:17,850
Good night, Mom.

316
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:19,583
Good night, Attaf.

317
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:22,731
And you've never
seen this kid before?

318
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:25,346
No, never.

319
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:27,939
People are saying
these visions are real.

320
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,745
So I don't know how, but...

321
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:32,938
in the next six months, this little
boy's gonna come into my life,

322
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:34,510
and I'm gonna be his mom.

323
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,041
I refuse to believe
these visions are random.

324
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,920
There is a purpose.

325
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:41,672
I know it.

326
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:47,276
We have a compromise to suggest...

327
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:49,604
One piece of information now...

328
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,929
and one later.

329
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,046
An offer of proof.

330
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:56,051
You verify certain aspects
of my client's flash-forward,

331
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:57,601
pardon him.

332
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,263
Then he will give you
the remainder of what he knows.

333
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:04,426
Fine.

334
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,145
The 137 seconds...

335
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:08,312
Why?

336
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:11,606
In my time at Treblinka,

337
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:16,080
I obviously came
into contact with many Jews.

338
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:19,741
I also came to learn
about certain aspects

339
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,161
- of their beliefs, their culture...
- Is this going somewhere?

340
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:26,810
Tell me, Miss Hawk,

341
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,751
why do you wear a ring
on your left thumb?

342
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:34,380
What's it matter?

343
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,424
In some Eastern European countries,

344
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,167
where homosexuality is illegal,

345
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:44,724
a ring on a woman's left thumb

346
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,727
is considered an indication
of her proclivities.

347
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:49,978
What does this have
to do with anything?

348
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:51,753
Everything and nothing.

349
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:56,304
I am merely referencing
a certain kind of code.

350
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,531
I will now make a reference
to another kind of code.

351
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:01,637
Have you heard of Kabbalah?

352
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:04,536
It's a set of esoteric teachings...

353
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,703
Jewish mysticism.

354
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,706
In Kabbalah,

355
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,375
everything has a hidden meaning.

356
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:14,295
This is the word
spelled in Hebrew...

357
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:23,425
And each letter
in the Hebrew alphabet

358
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,849
is ascribed a number.

359
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,905
And if you add up these numbers,

360
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,896
you arrive at 137...

361
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,498
Exactly the number of seconds...

362
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,234
that the blackout lasted.

363
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,026
Listen to me...

364
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:40,401
The only reason I'm sharing
the same air as you

365
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:43,116
is because you said
you've got relevant information.

366
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:46,300
And you've got exactly
one minute to prove that to me,

367
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:47,787
or I'm gone.

368
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,740
You won't leave.

369
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:52,250
Not yet.

370
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,558
I have information

371
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,589
that'll prove crucial
to your investigation.

372
00:20:58,027 --> 00:20:59,227
And I know it,

373
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:01,748
because in my flash-forward,

374
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,623
I was being...

375
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:07,181
repatriated to the United States.

376
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:10,393
And I had bought my freedom

377
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:14,149
with the second piece
of information...

378
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:17,983
Which I am prepared
to share with you.

379
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:22,760
What did you see?

380
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:25,909
I was in an American airport.

381
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:27,663
I don't know which one.

382
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,205
I was clearing through immigration.

383
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:33,750
There was a young man who
was processing my documents.

384
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,879
I remember he had a nametag
that read "Jerome Murphy."

385
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:42,050
Disappointing, Agent Benford's
not here to welcome me home.

386
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,014
Coming back from Germany?

387
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,724
Returning home, actually.

388
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,727
I have one murder to thank for it.

389
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:56,147
A murder?
Whose murder?

390
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,401
This is just our offer of proof.

391
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,056
Locate this customs agent,
this J. Murphy.

392
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:06,463
Compare his flash-forward
to my client's.

393
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,658
Confirm he's telling the truth.

394
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:11,329
Are you enjoying watching us
jump through your hoops?

395
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,749
I hope you are. Because you're never
leaving this prison, Geyer.

396
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:17,210
I will leave...

397
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,102
on April 29th, 2010.

398
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:25,843
It is a future
that has already happened.

399
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:30,358


400
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:35,458
I can't believe
you're running with this.

401
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,897
Let's just see
if his flash-forward proves out.

402
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,399
If it does, it means Geyer's

403
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,901
free in six months' time
which means he's telling us the truth.

404
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,389
Or a lie we believed.

405
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,943
Are you okay with this?

406
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:52,509
- Benford.
- Hey, it's me. You got a minute?

407
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:54,226
<i>Aaron, what's up?</i>

408
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:56,162
I need a favor...

409
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:57,637
a big favor.

410
00:22:57,762 --> 00:22:59,002
It's for Tracy.

411
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,170
<i>I want to get her remains exhumed,
test 'em against the DNA.</i>

412
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:04,962
<i>The military's got on file for her.</i>

413
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:09,012
 I'll listen to any "this isn't
a good idea" speeches you gotta give

414
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,439
<i>if you can swear you wouldn't do
the exact same thing if it were Charlie.</i>

415
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:17,162
You fax over the paperwork.
I'll push it through.

416
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,515
There's no paperwork,
'cause it's not signed, and...

417
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:24,152
it's not signed
'cause it needs Kate's signature.

418
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,569
<i>I need you to push through
more than paperwork here.</i>

419
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:28,698
- Aaron, That's...
- I said it was a big favor.

420
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:30,720
Leaving aside the illegality,

421
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:35,089
have you thought about what'll happen
if the results come back positive,

422
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,790
and the person in that grave
is Tracy?

423
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,362
I saw her, Mark.

424
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:42,378
I saw her alive.

425
00:23:42,683 --> 00:23:43,880
It was impossible.

426
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:46,946
That's what makes it
a leap of faith.

427
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:50,387
<i>You've never taken a leap of faith?</i>

428
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,932
I'm a little busy right now.

429
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,880
I'm sorry.
I'm just...

430
00:23:58,657 --> 00:24:01,037
Everything is fine with Zoey.
I'll take care of it.

431
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:03,836
You tell him
I'll call when I've got the warrant.

432
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:06,110
A warrant?
For a customs officer?

433
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,613
No, that's...
Something else.

434
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,240
Marcie ran through
the T.S.A. employee database,

435
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,698
and there aren't any
J. Murphys working customs

436
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:16,204
at any of the airports in
the continental United States.

437
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:18,274
Did you check applicants?

438
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:21,153
Geyer said he spoke
to an actual officer.

439
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,448
Six months from now. Our guy
might not be working customs yet.

440
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:27,765
Have Marcie check.
If she finds something, run it down.

441
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,643
There a problem?

442
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,481
My head's just not
in the game today, boss.

443
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,638
Get it in the game.

444
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:50,338
Hello?

445
00:25:20,597 --> 00:25:21,561
Jerome Murphy?

446
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,008
Have a minute?

447
00:25:25,784 --> 00:25:27,353
Like you're saying, I make it?

448
00:25:27,478 --> 00:25:29,234
I'm gonna be a customs official?

449
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:32,920
Man, I saw it,
but I didn't really believe it.

450
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:36,072
This rocks, dude.
I totally thought I blew the physical.

451
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:38,429
Do I get a gun and stuff?

452
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:39,996
I need you to focus here.

453
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,036
I'm trying to corroborate
a suspect's flash-forward,

454
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:45,361
and he claims that you were in it.

455
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,390
Do you understand?

456
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,046
Sure.
No problem.

457
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:52,272
What's "corroborate" mean?

458
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:55,678
I need you to tell me
whether you saw the same thing

459
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:59,056
in your flash-forward as
this guy claims he saw in his.

460
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:02,310
I know that.

461
00:26:02,974 --> 00:26:05,188
I was working in an airport.
It felt good.

462
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,107
Badge...

463
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,367
Uniform...

464
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:11,627
It gave me purpose.

465
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:13,570
Coming back from Germany?

466
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:19,619
I woke up after the blackout,
applied the next day.

467
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:22,163
Do you remember anything else,
anything odd?

468
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:25,166
Come to think of it, he did.
He said something about a murder.

469
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,834
<i>I have a murder to thank for it.</i>

470
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,645
I figured I just misheard him.

471
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
All right.

472
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,466
I might be in touch.

473
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:36,702
I can explain that.

474
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,495
- That's okay, I know what a bong is.
- That's not mine.

475
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,382
It's... my roommate's.

476
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,368
Look...

477
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,653
Home slice,

478
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:50,109
if I get tagged for this,
that's it for me.

479
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:52,635
They won't hire me
with drug bust on my record.

480
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,153
It does seem unlikely.

481
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,011
I was doing it.
I saw myself doing the job.

482
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:58,804
I saw myself wearing the uniform,

483
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:01,077
and it wouldn't have happened
if you bust me.

484
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,931
It won't happen if you bust me.
I mean, what I'm saying here is...

485
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:07,917
it's up to you
whether or not my future happens.

486
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,297


487
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,520
Thank you.

488
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:29,446
Buy you a drink?

489
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:31,760
No, thanks.

490
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,805
To moral relativism.

491
00:27:38,642 --> 00:27:40,574
I'm sorry
this is bothering you so much.

492
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:43,168
I'm sorry
this isn't bothering you at all.

493
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,831
- Don't make this personal.
- Don't hide behind the badge.

494
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:50,042
You're the one driving this thing.

495
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:51,960
You are.

496
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:54,524
Just own it...

497
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:56,465
at least.

498
00:27:57,986 --> 00:27:59,760
Fine.
I've been driving this.

499
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:01,329
It's what we do.

500
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:03,559
We cut the dealer a pass
to get the distributor.

501
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,975
We let the foot soldier walk
to bust the kingpin.

502
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:08,585
But there have to be some limits.

503
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:10,938
There have to be people

504
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,469
that we won't deal or flip.

505
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:16,986
And I'm sorry, but if we can't even
draw that line at a Nazi...

506
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,923
I don't even know
what we're doing anymore.

507
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:22,783
Have you ever taken a leap of faith?

508
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:25,513
What's that got to do with anything?

509
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:28,134
I'm pushing this
because I have faith

510
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:30,392
that seeing Geyer's picture
in my flash-forward

511
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:33,002
means his information
will be important to us.

512
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:36,934
There you go. There's our problem,
because in my flash-forward,

513
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:40,051
all I saw was a baby
that I don't even know I want.

514
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:44,221
So how can I have faith in something
I'm not even sure is real?

515
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:48,038
Then you've got a problem,

516
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:50,953
because that's what faith is.

517
00:28:55,912 --> 00:28:56,912
Benford.

518
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,143
Dem found your Nazi's customs agent.

519
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:01,333
Same flash-forward.

520
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,801
- So he's telling the truth.
- <i>I'll put a call into state,</i>

521
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:06,744
have them start the arm-twisting
of the German government.

522
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:07,914
You sure?

523
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:09,145
Hell, no.

524
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:12,655
But something tells me I better get used
to that particular feeling.

525
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,905
We all better.

526
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,518
World's changed.

527
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:18,490
Some of us, all of us,

528
00:29:18,745 --> 00:29:20,925
are making decisions
now based on what will happen,

529
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,573
not what could.

530
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:25,471
It makes us do things
we wouldn't ordinarily do.

531
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,726
You'd think knowing the future
would make us less concerned about it.

532
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,033
But just the opposite has happened.

533
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:38,401
The future's what all of us
are living for now.

534
00:29:39,497 --> 00:29:41,190
It's what we're living by.

535
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:07,325
We got nothing
on your unknown caller.

536
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,849
Tech traced it to somewhere
off the New York Coast,

537
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:13,227
but they read the signal as coming
from two different sites at once.

538
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:16,799
Whoever it was,
they know how to cover their tracks.

539
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:19,428
Thanks for trying.

540
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,407
Can you pull the LUDS off
those two repeater sites?

541
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:29,871
There's probably a million or so calls
routed through those towers.

542
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,447
At least.

543
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:37,299
You can't do this!

544
00:30:37,424 --> 00:30:39,520
You need my government's consent
to free Geyer,

545
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,381
- and my superior...
- Signed off. Five minutes ago.

546
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,469
Congratulations.
You're a free man.

547
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:48,387
Just like that?

548
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:50,431
Start talking.

549
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:55,811
I blacked out, as we all did.

550
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:59,350
The flash-forward happened
as I described it.

551
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,484
Then I woke up.

552
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:03,642
I went to my window,

553
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,531
and I saw the city burning
in the distance.

554
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:09,378
And on the ground,

555
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:12,147
at the courtyard outside...

556
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:16,484
I saw crows.

557
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:18,363
They were dead.

558
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:24,882
Dead crows?

559
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:26,842
The ground was littered with them.

560
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:29,845
"A murder of crows..."

561
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,140
In proper parlance,
a grouping of crows.

562
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,644
What the hell does this have to do
with the Kabbalah and 137 seconds?

563
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,354
Nothing, <i>fraulein</i>.

564
00:31:38,737 --> 00:31:42,066
I have no idea why the blackout
lasted as long as it did.

565
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:45,725
So what, it was all crap...

566
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,823
- The Kabbalah, the birds?
- The crows are real.

567
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:51,141
They were dying outside my window.

568
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:53,661
- That must mean something.
- Tell us!

569
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,538
I can't tell you what I don't know.

570
00:31:57,564 --> 00:32:00,709
Please take this.
I have no further use for it.

571
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,788
But I believe you will,
<i>Herr</i> Benford.

572
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:06,295
In my vision,
I knew that I'd be freed

573
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,420
because of what I told you
about the crows dying.

574
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,180
It could be helpful
in your investigation.

575
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,930
How helpful it will be...
we'll just have to see.

576
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:20,759
Then you'll rot in here until we do.

577
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:23,102
My attorney...

578
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,871
is here to prevent that,
<i>Herr</i> Krieger.

579
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:29,255
You played us.

580
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,323
The future will tell
whether it's true.

581
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:32,911
But in the meantime,

582
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,536
I am, as you said, however...

583
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:39,196
A free man.

584
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,003


585
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:09,862
Hey. You look horrendous.

586
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:13,160
Glad I accomplished at least
something with this trip.

587
00:33:15,937 --> 00:33:16,987
That badly?

588
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:19,373
As bad as it could've gone

589
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,582
without getting shot at, yeah.

590
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:28,164
My mom, she always says,
"Live in the now."

591
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:31,757
How the hell is anyone
supposed to do that anymore?

592
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Come here.

593
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:39,855
What you doing?

594
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:42,617
- What am I doing?
- What you doing?

595
00:33:43,463 --> 00:33:44,873
Living in the now.

596
00:33:45,478 --> 00:33:46,659
Living in the now.

597
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:02,113
- My mom's advice wasn't so bad.
- Not so bad.

598
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:09,627
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey.

599
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:13,474
He's been here for a while.

600
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,290
Hasn't asked me to pour a drop.

601
00:34:15,415 --> 00:34:17,416
But you can tell
he's thinking about it hard.

602
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:27,757
I can't be too sure

603
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:30,302
since I had a few yesterday, but...

604
00:34:30,427 --> 00:34:33,411
I thought I was pretty particular
about not wanting to see you again.

605
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,072
Well...

606
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:40,848
I figured you'd make
an exception for...

607
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:42,317
for good news.

608
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,603
You were right.

609
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:49,720
The body...

610
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:52,366
The remains.

611
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:55,172
Tracy's grave.

612
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,283
You were right.

613
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:08,015
I'm sorry I went behind your back.

614
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:11,154
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

615
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:16,063
It's okay.

616
00:35:24,065 --> 00:35:25,430
It's all gonna be okay.

617
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:39,942
There are no words for this...

618
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:44,115
None that mean half a damn anyway.

619
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:48,659
The people we love are gone,
and they're not coming back.

620
00:35:50,778 --> 00:35:51,977
And we'll miss them.

621
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,658
But things are going to get better.

622
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:01,252
The sun's gonna rise on a new day.

623
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:03,373
I know it doesn't feel...

624
00:36:04,524 --> 00:36:06,705
like it will,
but that dawn is coming.

625
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:08,992
There's hope.

626
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:11,794
One of the agents here
repeated to me something

627
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,765
that a friend had mentioned to him.

628
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:17,049
And he said,
"We're all prophets now."

629
00:36:17,664 --> 00:36:20,719
And you know, I can't think
of a prophet worth a damn...

630
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,613
that didn't suffer.

631
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:29,144
And I also can't think
of a prophet...

632
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,565
that God didn't love.

633
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:46,578
Good night, Mom.

634
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,000
This little boy's gonna come into
my life and I'm gonna be his mom.

635
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:25,571
Absent friends.

636
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:27,479
<i>Absent friends.</i>

637
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:33,381
How many of these speeches do you think
have been given since the blackout?

638
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:36,224
You gotta figure something like this is
happening every day,

639
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:37,553
all over the world.

640
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:39,298
All over the world.

641
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,513
All over the world.

642
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,546
All over the world.

643
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:53,687
I need your help. 

644
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,661
- What?
- Excuse me. Just come on.

645
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:03,648
I'm a raindrop,

646
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:05,782
and I'm falling for you.

647
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,179
What?

648
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,824
That's how you tried to
pick me up. Remember?

649
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:11,770
I would never use that line.

650
00:38:11,895 --> 00:38:14,427
I said, you owed me a drink for,

651
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:16,507
shredding my ass
on the witness stand.

652
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,421
I did shred your ass,
but I left all the good parts.

653
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:23,351
You all right?

654
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:29,536
Let's do it.

655
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:31,711
The "D-Day" wedding.
Let's do it.

656
00:38:33,732 --> 00:38:36,946
- Are you sure? 'Cause the other day...
- The other day was the other day. I...

657
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,817
Today...

658
00:38:42,497 --> 00:38:44,780
I want us to make our future happen.

659
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:49,824
Baby!

660
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:54,687
Okay, just go with me on this
for a second.

661
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:57,011
It says here
that the Audobon Society

662
00:38:57,136 --> 00:38:59,194
tracks bird population trends.

663
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:02,333
I need you to look up
the worldwide crow population

664
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,676
for, say, the last year.

665
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:13,642
There. See that dip?
The day of the blackout.

666
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,842
Geyer said that crows died outside
his cell, but it wasn't just in Germany.

667
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,790
Crows died all over the world
during the blackout.

668
00:39:24,373 --> 00:39:27,467
And I say this with love,
who gives a damn?

669
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:30,550
Look and see if there were
any other instances

670
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:32,762
of crow populations
plummeting like this.

671
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:39,519
In the Ganwar region of Somalia.

672
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,337
In 1991, all the crows died
on the same day.

673
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,422
Who cares?

674
00:39:44,555 --> 00:39:46,133
Why did we set up Mosaic?

675
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:48,023
To look for patterns.

676
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,306
Thanks to Geyer, we now know crows died
all over the world during the blackout.

677
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:55,475
Search on Ganwar
and the date those crows died.

678
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,732
Just one hit.

679
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:05,124
A CDC request for
additional funding from DHS.

680
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:08,441
You know, Mark,
this is just anecdotal.

681
00:40:08,566 --> 00:40:10,693
Look, they don't even have
any corroboration.

682
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:11,992
No, wait.

683
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,085
"CDC doctors travel to the Ganwar
region in response to claims

684
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,000
that the inhabitants suffered
a mass loss of consciousness."

685
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,726
We've been so worried
the blackout might happen again.

686
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:25,714
We haven't stopped to ask ourselves,

687
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:27,591
what if it happened before?
