1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,038



2
00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:04,023



3
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:05,755



4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,230
In my flash-forward,
I was investigating.

5
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:11,260
I seemed to have an idea
why this was happening.

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,415
You were planning an attack.
Tell me what happened!

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,555
We didn't do this.

8
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,906
You were still planning
on killing thousands of people.

9
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:19,153
I think God did this to punish us.

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,521
I'm a little at sea in dealing with
Dylan's condition. He's autistic.

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,425
This man means nothing to me.
I'm not gonna cheat on you.

12
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,944
On March 15th, 2010,

13
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:29,737
you are going to be murdered.

14
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:34,459


15
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:06,500
It's okay, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be just fine, okay?

16
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,187
What we're gonna do
is on one, two, three,

17
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,922
you're gonna take
a big breath with me, okay?

18
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,268
One, two, three.

19
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,778
I wish I could have saved
more people.

20
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,269
I reached the surface,

21
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:40,105
did the Australian crawl to the shore,
and then I walked home.

22
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,741
And then I realized
that the whole world had blacked out.

23
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:46,550
That was two weeks ago. This is
the first time you've seen a doctor?

24
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,186
Yeah, didn't need one till now.

25
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,923
- Well, Mr. Ned, I...
- You can call me "Edward."

26
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,189
- Edward.
- Wait, you know. Call me "Ned."

27
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:56,717
My friends call me Ned.

28
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,221
- Ned Ned?
- Yes, yes.

29
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,631
How did you stay so calm?

30
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:04,298
I don't know.

31
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:05,999
I just was.

32
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:08,686
It says here that triage gave
your morphine for your pain.

33
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:11,058
- Does that mean...
- They should call that stuff "mor-fine"

34
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:13,609
'cause that's how I'm feeling
for the first time since the crash.

35
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,750
- Why didn't you come in sooner?
- It didn't start off so bad.

36
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,699
I thought I'd maybe just bruised
my spleen or somethin'.

37
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:24,543
Okay, Mr. Ned...
Ned. Whatever.

38
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,813
I think with your low blood count
and your pain,

39
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:29,191
we should keep you in for observation
and a CT scan.

40
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:31,335
It's all gravy, Dr. Benford.
Truly.

41
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:34,004
Okay, good.
Now after the blackout,

42
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,007
- do you remember what...
- Your flash-forward.

43
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,132
What did you see?

44
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:38,926
Not where I was goin'.

45
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,701
You really wanna know?

46
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,040
I was rocking leather pants.

47
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,142
I've never rocked leather pants.

48
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:53,915
It's always been
one of my top three fears,

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,831
along with clowns and escalators.

50
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:58,807
But there I was,
rocking out at this bar

51
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:01,990
that I've always wanted
to go to but I've never gone to

52
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:04,243
because I thought I'd be
too nervous, that I'd be...

53
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,903
Well, too nervous.

54
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,290
But it wasn't that way.

55
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:10,833
I was happy.

56
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:13,199
I was at peace.

57
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,654
And I was black.

58
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,529
Wait, you were...

59
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:21,779
black in six months?

60
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:23,469
Like Oprah.

61
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:25,472
You know, African-American. Black.

62
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,393
Okay, Mr. Ned.

63
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,290
We'll see you later, Mr. Ned.

64
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,407
1x04 - Black Swan

65
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:47,508
So they're your parents,
you should be the one to tell them

66
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,084
that we moved up the wedding.

67
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,407
Though I'm sure a free
to trip to Hawaii

68
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:53,716
still won't make up for the fact
that I'm not Korean.

69
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:55,169
Right.

70
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,779
Okay, where have you been
for the last 20 minutes?

71
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:00,544
I'm fine. It's just work stuff.
Work stuff.

72
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:03,467
I've been trying
to trace a call from...

73
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,175
an informant.

74
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,228
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm here.

75
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:10,864
Speaking of work,
can I ask you something work-related?

76
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,270
Are you guys gitmo-ing
a suspect downtown?

77
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,482
Some blonde,

78
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:19,360
arrested the day of the blackout.

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,550
Bin Laden in Prada?

80
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:24,281
I can't confirm or deny this, Zo.

81
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,244
I think you just did, sweetie.

82
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,411
But professionally,

83
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,706
if the bureau's violating someone's
due process, that's uncool.

84
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,948
But personally,

85
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,707
if that woman has anything
to do with the blackout,

86
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:39,263
I really hope you're getting
all Dick Cheney on her ass

87
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:40,660
to find out what she knows.

88
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:43,801
Ladies and gentlemen...

89
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:48,153
As Eggbert,

90
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:52,251
I would like to egg-xpress my desire

91
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:56,433
for you to eat oatmeal this morning.

92
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:58,478
- You're silly, daddy.
- Silly?

93
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:00,442
- Can I get a "cluck cluck"?
- Cluck cluck!

94
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:04,571
Cluck cluck.

95
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,969
Thank you muchly.

96
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:08,415
I believe you know my mum.

97
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,663
Eggbert!

98
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,534
You really are the Shakespeare
of cheesy dad humor.

99
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,290
You could play, too.

100
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:21,484
You could be <i>ze</i> french toast.

101
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,794
<i>Ze</i> toast of love.

102
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,176
Good morning.

103
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,834
- Hey, mommy.
- Hi, sweetie.

104
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,600
So guess who's picking you up
from school this morning?

105
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:34,143
- Nicole?
- That's right. Nicole.

106
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,634
She missed you.

107
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,752
She's ready to start
babysitting again.

108
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,692
- Yeah, Nicole is coming.
- Yeah, Nicole is coming back.

109
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:44,737
Thanks for breakfast.

110
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:49,826
First time in a while, I've been out
acting like a normal person.

111
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,378
I know what you mean.

112
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,512
You want an ice cream or something?

113
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:04,381
Where was that place Tracy used
to take you when you were little?

114
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,163
They turned it into a giant juice
when I was a freshman.

115
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:13,594
She spent all the money she made
babysitting you buying you milkshakes.

116
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,857
I should get going.

117
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:20,753
It's my first day back at the Benfords',
so I don't want to be late.

118
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:25,152
Mark told me you went AWOL.

119
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,509
I'm sorry, Aaron.

120
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:31,112
You got me that job with them,
and I totally screwed it up.

121
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:34,328
If that were true, they wouldn't have
asked you to come back.

122
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:36,282
Nicole, you're not alone.

123
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,159
Everyone's freaked out by this.

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,786
But I think we have to surrender
to a higher power

125
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,606
and have faith that whatever we saw,

126
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:43,973
we saw for a reason.

127
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,197
So make Cowbell Lady NPO.

128
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,655
We'll take her to the OR
if she spikes again.

129
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,138
And, what happened to the scan we...

130
00:07:58,888 --> 00:07:59,888
Come on.

131
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:01,563
Come on!

132
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,052
What did the scan show
on our bus crash guy?

133
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,435
Yeah. Ned?

134
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:10,279
I can't stop thinking
about that guy.

135
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:12,403
I mean, how does somebody
possibly go

136
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:15,028
from being Caucasian
to African-American?

137
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,320
I mean, if that's the vision that
he saw in his future, then I guess

138
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:20,862
Bryce, I need you in the present.
Here. Now.

139
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:23,076
You know, patient care,
doctoring, CT scan.

140
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,841
Still don't have it. ER's got a bunch
of traumas. They keep bumping Ned

141
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:27,063
from the scanner.

142
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:29,460
So I ran into Dr. Flemming earlier.

143
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,766
- Who?
- Blythe Flemming, the psychiatrist

144
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:34,110
you're supposed to be following up
with every week?

145
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:36,668
Well, it's just, you know,
I've had my rounds and...

146
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:39,935
Come on. Less than a month ago, you
were standing on a pier with a gun.

147
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:48,766
- I know how it sounds, but trust me...
- If you wanna keep working here,

148
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,440
you need to follow up with psych
twice a week. Got it?

149
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,756
Excuse me!

150
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,780
Bollocks.

151
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:01,513
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

152
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:03,806
Sorry.

153
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:16,016
You know what? That Simcoe kid
is awfully tuned out.

154
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:17,977
I wanna transfer him
to physical therapy.

155
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:19,725
But he's on IV antibiotics.

156
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,846
- Just as soon as you can, okay?
- Yeah.

157
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,486
And I need that scan of Ned's,

158
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:27,200
so wheel him to the scanner
yourself if you have to.

159
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,071
You wanna go to Somalia now?

160
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:31,388
Last week, you talked me into
flying you to Germany

161
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:33,822
- because of an index card.
- And it paid off.

162
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,064
You found out some crows died
in Somalia 18 years ago.

163
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:39,952
You know your definition of paid
off is a little different than mine.

164
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,624
If a blackout had happened before,
that'd be major.

165
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,984
I agree, which kind of makes you wonder
why we haven't heard of it before.

166
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:49,334
- Evidence Stan. There's evidence.
- Last I checked,

167
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,937
all you've got is a footnote

168
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:52,841
in a CDC funding request.

169
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,415
I've been working with Mark
on trying to get satellite photos

170
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,346
of the region from '91
out of Langley.

171
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,415
They've been giving us
the runaround, so...

172
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,772
Maybe the CIA's just
a little busy these days

173
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:04,451
to dig through satellite intel
from last decade.

174
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:06,688
Guys, I get it.

175
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,602
Germany didn't exactly work out

176
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:11,468
and you're trying to stretch
a single into a triple. I get it.

177
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,453
But going to war with the CIA

178
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,437
is not the way to do it.

179
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,294
Remember that hacker we busted?

180
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,106
You know, the one who broke
in the DOD's network,

181
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:28,945
trying to take our overseas
drones for a joyride?

182
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,343
- Mr. Cheeto Dust?
- Yeah, that's him.

183
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:35,612
Don't you think he'd find Langley's
mainframe a delightful challenge?

184
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:38,953
Yeah, he'd find it delightful.
It's illegal.

185
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:41,890
Spying on your own country?

186
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:46,133
- More than some procedural jujitsu.
- Talking about a federal offense.

187
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:49,229
Yeah. You're right.
Where's Demetri?

188
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:51,671
He brought that hot blonde
terrorist over from holding.

189
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,614
- He's questioning her now.
- Why?

190
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,962
I don't know.
'Cause she's hot?

191
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:59,866
I'll repeat
what I've said many times.

192
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:03,610
My name is Alda Hertzog,
and I'm an honest businessperson.

193
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,599
We caught you doing business
on the day of the blackout. Remember?

194
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:09,418
With known terrorists, selling them
weaponized nuclear material.

195
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,454
Then charge me with a crime.

196
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,838
You can't hold me here indefinitely.

197
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,157
You're right.

198
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,664
You should call your embassy
and complain.

199
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,386
Which embassy is that by the way?

200
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,204
We wanna know 'cause...

201
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,323
we wanna get you
the right phone card.

202
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:29,579
I'm truly flattered
that you still feel the need

203
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:32,068
to talk to me after
all that's happened.

204
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,369
But I've done nothing wrong.

205
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,440
It's my associates who you want.

206
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:39,531
Honey, your associates died
on the day of the blackout.

207
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,241
They were super dead.

208
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:46,090
So you wanna give me somebody else?

209
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:51,209
Customer Choice restaurant group.

210
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:58,033
It's in Indio.

211
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,441
Town comes up
a bunch of times in wiretaps,

212
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,429
but we never found out
the significance.

213
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:05,122
Customer Choice restaurant group.

214
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:07,351
That's all I have for you today.

215
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:20,131
You're running out of time for this to
continue being a civil conversation.

216
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,772
Really, Agent Noh?

217
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:26,161
Here I thought you were the one
running out of time.

218
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:28,731
What'd you say?

219
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:32,678
You really should get out there
before it's too late.

220
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:37,339


221
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,299
I'm not getting this.

222
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,843
Instead of following up
on the Somalia lead,

223
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,992
you wanna reopen
the dirty bomb case?

224
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:46,413
We never closed it.
And Somalia is not a lead.

225
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:48,360
It's an urban myth, at best.

226
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:51,195
Meanwhile, back on planet Earth,
we have a material witness...

227
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,543
In a weapons deal.

228
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:54,886
That broke on the day
of the blackout.

229
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:58,698
So maybe it's not as sexy
as dead poultry in Africa,

230
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:01,154
but you gotta admit the timing's
a little hinky here.

231
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,281
- It's a coincidence!
- So what if it is?

232
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:07,623
It is a legit lead
on a terrorism investigation,

233
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,752
which is kind of
what we do around here.

234
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:10,979
Agreed.

235
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:13,667
Send me a postcard from Indio.

236
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,903
What the hell's the matter with you?

237
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:24,976
I just want to be
an FBI agent today. All right?

238
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:26,344
Life is short.

239
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:41,365
Thank you,

240
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,682
for putting up with me.

241
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:45,279
Hi, Mr. Simcoe.

242
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,863
I'm afraid I'm the annoying parent

243
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,564
who always wants a thousand details.

244
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:53,038
I'd like to apologize for that.

245
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,485
I can tell
it makes you uncomfortable.

246
00:13:57,843 --> 00:14:00,839
No, it doesn't.
Doesn't make me uncomfortable at all.

247
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:04,632
Sorry about the little outburst this
morning... the tantrum in the hallway.

248
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:08,221
The... unidentified
flying meal tray.

249
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,150
It's his autism.

250
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,673
I don't know what to
say to him when he's like that.

251
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:18,064
Sometimes, you can't say anything.
You just have to be there.

252
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,035
Thanks.

253
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:21,711
Thank you.

254
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:25,201
Unfortunately, I haven't really
been there since our separation.

255
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,990
You know, work picked up and...

256
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,652
Well, I barely know him.

257
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:35,102
Well, you're here now.
It's what counts.

258
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,026
- A good night's sleep might help.
- Well, despite the

259
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:41,571
luxury of two rigid plastic chairs
in Dylan's room,

260
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,714
the Sandman
has proven a bit elusive.

261
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,926
You shouldn't be sleeping
in his room every night.

262
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,426
Well, actually, the...

263
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,664
police brought me the keys
to his mother's house.

264
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,993
I just can't bring myself
to go there for some reason.

265
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,968
You should try.
Maybe being in Dylan's room,

266
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,919
around his things...

267
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:59,465
It might give you some sense
of who he is.

268
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,686
Too much time in the hospital is not
good for anyone, Mr. Simcoe.

269
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,337
You hang in there.

270
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,936
Hey, Dr. B.,
I got that scan that you wanted.

271
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:12,369
I was just gonna grab a veggie dog
while it prints out.

272
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,610
Transfer Dylan Simcoe
to physical therapy.

273
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:17,317
- But I thought...
- P.T. can handle the antibiotics.

274
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:18,763
Just transfer him.

275
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,712
I don't understand
what all this is about.

276
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,310
Welcome to my world.

277
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:34,147
This restaurant came up
in a confidential investigation.

278
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,601
We need the names and addresses
of every employee.

279
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,669
The list, please. Thank you.

280
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,387
Burgers, waffle fries.
That's all we do. For now at least.

281
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,443
We're going to be adding frozen yogurt
in the future.

282
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,154
So this place is owned
by Customer Choice restaurant group?

283
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,809
This place is
Customer Choice restaurant group.

284
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,354
We're not quite a group yet.

285
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:56,572
Would you give me and Agent Noh
a moment, please?

286
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:57,497
Sure.

287
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,745
Somebody get some burgers
for these FBI guys, please!

288
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,467
I can't believe I didn't want to come
here today. I mean, the intel...

289
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:06,089
They're adding frozen yogurt! 

290
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,185
Freeze!

291
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:29,165


292
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:41,889
- Go left. I'll take right.
- Gotcha.

293
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:36,029
Come on.
Give me your hand!

294
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,614
You got him!

295
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,267
Shut up!

296
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,603
- Where you running, man?
- Get up. Get up!

297
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,876
We were just coming in for a burger.

298
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,099
On your knees!
Get on your knees!

299
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,176
I heard what you're being.
FBI can be biting my ass!

300
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:54,297


301
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:58,451
Yellowcake uranium, Mark.
Black market nuclear material.

302
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,539
Do you think we should leave it,
go back to your office

303
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,628
- and stare at your bulletin board?
- You don't be wanting this.

304
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,129
Yellowcake.

305
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,063
It's the type of strain,
the type of weed he's slingin'!

306
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:16,238
It's the sickest strain 'round.

307
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,399
In my flash-forward,
I'm driving pimping ride.

308
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,011
19-inch rims.

309
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,134
I must be going to be
Scarface of pot.

310
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,090
You can't be fighting fate.

311
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,151
Shut up!

312
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:34,031
Truth hurts, pig!

313
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,239
- Get off of me!
- What are you doing?!

314
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,867
- Burning his mouth!
- I'm talking about today, about you!

315
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:42,245
Racin' around, looking for someone
to shoot! Just drop your crap

316
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,622
- and do your job!
- I'm doing something!

317
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,847
I'm not sitting on my ass, waiting
for clues to appear in my dreams!

318
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:50,045
Give it a rest.
This isn't about what I saw.

319
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,913
It's about what you did!

320
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:00,472
March 15th.

321
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,934
Three shots to the chest.

322
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:10,625
I'm not just gonna die.
I'm gonna be murdered.

323
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,278


324
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:28,522
How'd you find out?

325
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,318
Anonymous call.

326
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,890
The woman said she read it
in an intelligence briefing.

327
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:39,716
That's all she gave me.

328
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:44,432
Mark, I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

329
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:47,727
but I thought maybe I could find
who's gonna kill me

330
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,325
or get a lead on them.
I don't know, but...

331
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:53,697
Why would you think
there's anything out here?

332
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:57,261
Alda said I was running out of time.

333
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:59,001
That was it?

334
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,929
Damn, Alda's a pro.

335
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:07,288
She knows you're vulnerable,
and she pulled a number on you.

336
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,672
All I can hear is the clock ticking.

337
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,131
Every day.

338
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,168
- What am I supposed to do?
- Somehow...

339
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:21,969
you get past the fear

340
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:24,157
and you fight.

341
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:26,141
- How?
- You know what I saw.

342
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,647
I'm staring at the Mosaic board,
and men are coming in to kill me.

343
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,489
We are partners.
If they're coming to kill me,

344
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,541
they're probably after you too
or gonna be.

345
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,123
It's the future, Mark.

346
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,198
- Why do you think you can stop it?
- Because we saw it.

347
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:44,367
We can use what we saw

348
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,290
to stop what we saw.

349
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:49,831
Demetri, we can solve your murder
before it happens.

350
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,668
That's why I wanna put
everything we have on Mosaic.

351
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,921
For you. For me. For everybody.

352
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,314
Now can we get out of here?

353
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:13,158
We can.

354
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:15,812
Excuse me.

355
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:17,726
Hey, Mr. Simcoe.

356
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:19,527
Stepping out for a bit?

357
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,695
Just... following some advice.

358
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,869
I think you left this
in Dylan's room.

359
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,566
Thanks.

360
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:28,865
She's beautiful.

361
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,247
Your girlfriend?

362
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,418
- We haven't actually met.
- <i>Coming up soon,</i>

363
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,588
<i>a Glendale postal worker
uses the Mosaic web site</i>

364
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,532
<i>to meet the police officer
he believes</i>

365
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:42,747
<i>is going to save his life
in the coming months.</i>

366
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:44,427
<i>You won't wanna miss this.</i>

367
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,631
<i></i>

368
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,096
It's incredible, isn't it?

369
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:49,870
A temporal anomaly
in global consciousness.

370
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,700
Yeah, I think that qualifies.

371
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:55,319
So what'd you see?

372
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:59,525
I guess this is the new
"How's the weather?"

373
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,204
Alright, then...

374
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:07,928
Why not?

375
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,870
I was in a house...
Not my own house.

376
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,419
I got a call from someone.

377
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,583
I don't know who it was,
but it was urgent.

378
00:22:16,243 --> 00:22:18,793
Dylan was nearby,
maybe in another room.

379
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:21,238
I heard a woman's voice...

380
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:23,007
- <i>Honey.</i>
- I turned towards it...

381
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,774
And it was over.

382
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,110
I never saw her face.

383
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,302
But I knew that we were together...

384
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,395
That she was
important to me somehow.

385
00:22:36,743 --> 00:22:38,022
I know what you mean.

386
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:40,933
Thank you.

387
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:43,486
Excuse me... One second.

388
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,405
I'm sorry.
Dr. Benford!

389
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,573
Dr. B.

390
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,519
- Ned's CT.
- Great.

391
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,801
Big hematoma.

392
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:57,423
Blood's been gathering around the liver
since the bus crash.

393
00:22:57,548 --> 00:22:59,168
Ned's lucky he showed up in time.

394
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:04,119
No, it's not luck.
I mean, he was alive in his vision.

395
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:07,140
- So clearly he made it to the hospital.
- Enough about visions.

396
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:09,565
No, Dr. Benford, it's relevant data.

397
00:23:09,903 --> 00:23:11,103
It's not data.

398
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:13,952
It's not data any more
than the dream I had last night.

399
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:17,428
Look, I don't understand
how you can ignore something

400
00:23:17,553 --> 00:23:20,177
that even the most skeptical
people in the world

401
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:23,505
- think might be real.
- I'm not ignoring the flash-forwards.

402
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,047
I'm just not bringing them
into the practice of medicine.

403
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,108
Now consent Mr. Ned for surgery
and meet me in the OR.

404
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,963
With any surgery,
there's a risk of infection,

405
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:38,917
blood loss, drug allergy
and even death, Ned.

406
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,376
It's all gravy.

407
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:45,060
It's okay if you've got questions
or if you're worried.

408
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:47,041
- This is a major surgery.
- I get it.

409
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,619
You're telling me I need some sort
of drug allergy-death surgery.

410
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:51,971
I'm cool with it.

411
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:55,176
I know it sounds weird, but...

412
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:57,769
Some kind of change is happening.

413
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:00,469
I don't feel nervous or afraid

414
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:02,298
of like anything.

415
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:05,068
All that worrying all the time...

416
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,860
It's just, like,
kept me from being...

417
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,919
the me I'm supposed to be.

418
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:12,745
Six months from now, I see myself,

419
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,829
and I'm like, this invincible,
fearless black guy,

420
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,498
like Shaft or Bryant Gumbel.

421
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:20,583
And knowing that...

422
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,327
It's already changed me.

423
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:42,397
Yes, Rabbi Hirscholtz.

424
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:43,981
15 in the last 2 weeks.

425
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:47,984
Four on Sunday, actually.

426
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:50,599
I didn't leave the cemetery
until after sundown.

427
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:51,873
Bye.

428
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:52,978
Sorry.

429
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:56,202
I'm so sorry about everything.
It's been so busy with everything.

430
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:57,982
How can I help you?

431
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:04,405
I'm sor...

432
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,288
I keep crickets.

433
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:10,007
Oh, really...
I really like the way they sound.

434
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,115
So, Paige, you were saying?

435
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:15,003
Paige is my sister.

436
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:16,410
I'm Nicole.

437
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:20,476
I only come on Christmas
and sometimes on Easter.

438
00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:24,148
But that's gonna change.
I wanna help out.

439
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,945
I wanna start doing
some volunteer work,

440
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,527
- in the morning, before I have work...
- That's great!

441
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,838
But as far as volunteer work goes,
we are full up.

442
00:25:33,423 --> 00:25:36,251
In a crisis like this, people,
they really wanna...

443
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,786
People need to help.

444
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,082
Why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

445
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:52,133
How do I atone for something
I haven't done yet?

446
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:59,349
In my flash-forward,
I felt like I was being...

447
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,349
punished.

448
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,998
Do you think...

449
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,081
Do you think God made this happen?

450
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,898
You know, 
it's really hard to believe

451
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:15,823
that there's not a divine hand
involved somehow.

452
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:19,180
Tell you what.

453
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:20,993
This, right here,

454
00:26:21,118 --> 00:26:23,789
is Audrey Ridgeway's phone number.

455
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,812
She is the volunteer coordinator.

456
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:29,715
I hope she can help.

457
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,457
Here's a T-shirt.

458
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,420
Bye.

459
00:26:59,895 --> 00:27:01,446
- Where's Ned?
- OR took him.

460
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:03,946
- When?
- 10, 15 minutes ago. What's wrong?

461
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:06,648
Call the OR.
We're about to kill our patient.

462
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,207


463
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:16,655
We can't operate.

464
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:20,115
I couldn't figure it out.
I couldn't make sense of it.

465
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,493
But now I've got it.
Ned has Addison's disease.

466
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,344
Surgery could kill him.

467
00:27:26,022 --> 00:27:27,839
In the bus crash, he was calm

468
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,869
in the face of an insane disaster.

469
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:32,146
And again today, he spoke
about his flash-forward.

470
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:34,694
- Please.
- And again he mentioned he was weirdly

471
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,007
calm and black.

472
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,114
You better scrub if you want in.

473
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,564
If he's got Addison's,
his body is making melanin compounds

474
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:44,322
instead of adrenaline. That's why
his skin is going to get dark.

475
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:45,595
I know what  it is.

476
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,760
Without adrenaline, his body
can't mount a proper stress response.

477
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:51,043
That's why he's so serene
in the face of this surgery.

478
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,976
- Without the stress hormones,
his body will be unable

479
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:56,465
- to adapt to surgery.
- No, without surgery, he'll die.

480
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,099
And he'll die. Listen.

481
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:02,221
You're not listening to me.
In his vision, he saw...

482
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,681
Enough about visions!

483
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,367
- He needs hydro cortisone.
- I'm not administering

484
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:09,202
a potentially harmful drug
because a patient had a freaky dream.

485
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:10,594
They are not dreams.

486
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,926
I don't know what you saw,
and I don't care.

487
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:15,954
But it is affecting your professional
judgment, and it needs to stop.

488
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,396
How about your
professional judgment?

489
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:20,421
- Excuse me?
- Come on, Dr. Benford.

490
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:22,904
You know why you don't want
to believe in your flashforward.

491
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:25,784
You said it yourself.
You saw the end of your marriage.

492
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,782
You are so out of line, doctor.

493
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:31,051
And you sticking your head in the sand
is gonna end up killing our patient.

494
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,466
You know what's gonna kill him?
Wasting time arguing

495
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:35,863
because he's lying on that table
continuing to bleed.

496
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:39,638
That's not from a Magic 8-ball
or a Ouija board or some kind of vision.

497
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:42,199
Right here, right now, that's real.

498
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,772
Don't bother scrubbing in.

499
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,682
Retract the duct
a little more laterally.

500
00:30:23,674 --> 00:30:26,446
- Suction.
- Anyone make it to grand rounds today?

501
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,254
This guy from Yale says he can enhance
memory of the flash-forwards

502
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:33,717
- using a calcineurin antagonist.
- Yeah, I was there. Pretty cool.

503
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:35,249
Irrigation, please.

504
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,794
BP's 78 over 54.

505
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:42,853
- Stay clear of the hepatic artery.
- 800 ccs out.

506
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,231
- Systolic's in freefall.
- Must be another bleeder somewhere.

507
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:49,263
Or some kind of fluid shift.
Get another unit on the rapid infuser.

508
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,934
- Tributary's ligated.
- Run of 6.

509
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,600
100 of lido right away.

510
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,685
- He's in V-TAC. No pulse.
- Damn it.

511
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:57,910
- Code cart and a mig of epi. Let's go!
- Lido's in.

512
00:30:58,035 --> 00:30:59,770
Where's the cart?


513
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:02,739
You're charged for 360.

514
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,532
Clear.

515
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,991
No change.

516
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:12,047
Going again. Clear.

517
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:22,197
Come on.

518
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,831
- Fourth epi's in.
- Chase it with lido.

519
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:27,378
- He's had five rounds.
- Amiodarone then.

520
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,596
- This makes no sense.
- This makes no sense at all.

521
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:45,482
100 migs of hydrocortisone.
I.V. push.

522
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,054
He's got adrenal crisis.
Addison's disease.

523
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,990
- Nobody bothered to tell me this?
- He hasn't been diagnosed yet.

524
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,577
It would explain the lack of response
to fluids and pressors.

525
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:55,329
Exactly. Compression?

526
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,372
Holding.

527
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,563
Normal sinus.

528
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:11,448
Good carotid.

529
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:13,305
Nice catch, Dr. Benford.

530
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:21,688
Let's close him up.

531
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:31,240
What do you know
about Agent Noh's murder?

532
00:32:31,536 --> 00:32:32,646
His murder?

533
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,328
Something funny about that?

534
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:39,393
Just that I knew he didn't have
a flash-forward.

535
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:41,748
I had no idea
he was gonna be murdered...

536
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:43,460
Till now.

537
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,585
How did you know
he didn't see anything?

538
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,882
Because your partner
posted it on the Internet.

539
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,134
Because everyone
in this office knows.

540
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:52,977
Any particular reason why
you felt the need to waste the time

541
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:55,097
of the agents investigating
the blackout?

542
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,576
In all likelihood, nothing
I tell you will be the truth.

543
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:00,811
So why persist in asking?

544
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,938
Asking questions is my job.

545
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,927
So let's start with a simple one.

546
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,401
What do you know about the blackout?

547
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:11,384
That's not a simple question.

548
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,812
All right.

549
00:33:14,486 --> 00:33:15,951
You've ever been to Somalia?

550
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,828
I can't say I've had the pleasure.

551
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:20,682
What about Detroit?

552
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,083
Utah?

553
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,716
You're wasting your energy
on what caused the blackout,

554
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,216
who's responsible.

555
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,161
You're ignoring the most
profound question of all...

556
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:33,471
Why?

557
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:38,098
Do you know what a black swan is?

558
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:44,188
It's a metaphor used to describe
a high-impact event.

559
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,318
Something so rare it's beyond
the normal realm of human expectation.

560
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,778
It comes from the 17th century
when scientists assumed

561
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:55,908
that all swans were white.
They were wrong.

562
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:57,826
Fascinating.

563
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:08,284
"There's a room.
A small boy enters with a candle."

564
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:12,499
- What is this, a bedtime story?
- It's a Sufi parable.

565
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:16,137
The man in the room,
referring to the candle, asks...

566
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:18,749
"Tell me where this light
comes from."

567
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:21,149
And the boy blows out
the candle and replies,

568
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:24,811
"If you tell me where this light went,
I'll tell you where it comes from."

569
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:25,748
Cute.

570
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:29,233
Your partner is right
about one thing.

571
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:32,735
I commune
with some very dangerous people.

572
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,613
I'm friends with those willing
to don suicide vests,

573
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:37,032
in the name of ideology.

574
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,203
I know when a man is willing
to sacrifice anything for his cause.

575
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:44,188
And you're not that kind of man,
Agent Benford.

576
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,949
Even if you were to start asking
the right questions.

577
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:50,963
You're not willing to do
what it takes to get the answers.

578
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:53,775
You're that little boy,
Agent Benford...

579
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,218
Alone in the dark.

580
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,566
Hey, Al.

581
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:27,778
Hey, man.

582
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:35,257
Remember that hacker...
Mr. Cheeto Dust?

583
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:38,111
Give him a call.

584
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:45,119
You sure?
Is Somalia really that important?

585
00:35:52,072 --> 00:35:53,829
It's time I got out of the dark.

586
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,445


587
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,670
Addison's disease?

588
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:01,180
Who's Addison?

589
00:36:01,489 --> 00:36:04,286
He was the guy
who discovered the condition.

590
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,881
It's a hormonal imbalance
that makes surgery very dangerous.

591
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:10,766
But luckily,
Dr. Benford realized it in time

592
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:13,196
and gave you the medication
that saved your life.

593
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:18,637
- Thanks, Dr. Varley.
- We should thank you.

594
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,459
Your flash-forward helped us
piece it together.

595
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:24,586
If you hadn't told us what you saw,
you might have died on the table.

596
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:25,974
It's pretty cool.

597
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,517
I wasn't afraid,
because I didn't need to be afraid.

598
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,942
The future saved me.

599
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,956
Ned's crit is stable.

600
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:48,919
Look, about earlier.

601
00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:51,112
I was completely out of line.

602
00:36:53,352 --> 00:36:54,628
But you were also right.

603
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:58,027
I just didn't want to see
what was going on with Ned,

604
00:36:58,706 --> 00:37:02,104
'cause of what's going on with me.

605
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:03,760
Look, I get it.

606
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,141
It's what's happening with me.
That's what made me believe him.

607
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:13,146
Bryce, I haven't pushed you

608
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,704
'cause you didn't want
to talk about the...

609
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:18,243
Me standing on the pier
with a gun to my head?

610
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,506
I just want you to know
that I'm here...

611
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:22,021
if you want to talk.

612
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,388
Thanks, Dr. B.

613
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:29,496
- I'm gonna be all right.
- You really think you're just okay now?

614
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:31,340
I know I am.

615
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:33,474
The future saved me.

616
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:41,620
Dr. Benford?
I need you to sign the discharge

617
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:44,219
on the rollerblade guy
so I can roll him on out of here.

618
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:48,307
Dylan Simcoe's white
count spiked to 19.

619
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:49,963
Here's his CVC.

620
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:52,844
He was transferred, physical therapy.
Can you give it to his attending?

621
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,869
- The chief transferred him back.
- What?

622
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:57,050
PT said they couldn't
handle the antibiotics,

623
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,107
so the chief put him
back on your service.

624
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:03,679
Are you okay, Dr. Benford?

625
00:38:04,307 --> 00:38:05,862
Yeah. Fine.

626
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,599
Charlie's just upstairs
changing into her PJs.

627
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:19,586
All right.

628
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:21,757
We did some finger painting,

629
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:26,002
and she's all done with her homework,
and we kicked around a soccer ball, too.

630
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:30,349
- And she had ants on a log for a snack.
- And how are you doing?

631
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,860
I feel bad for disappearing on you.

632
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,892
Everybody disappeared for a while.

633
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,225
Some people aren't even back yet.

634
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,613
I guess I'm just trying to figure out
why you guys didn't fire me.

635
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,366
Nicole, you're part of the family.

636
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:55,832
What's the matter?
You want to talk about what happened?

637
00:38:57,778 --> 00:38:58,924
You can, you know.

638
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:10,907
I saw someone drowning me.

639
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:12,849
What?

640
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:18,397
I saw someone drowning me...
in my flash-forward.

641
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,600
I saw someone drowning me
and I don't understand,

642
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:26,113
but I felt like I deserved
what was happening.

643
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:30,784
Like I had done something wrong
and there's no other way out.

644
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,370
I saw the man's face
who was doing it.

645
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,802
He pushed me back down and...

646
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:39,334
then I was just gone.

647
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,379
What did I do that...

648
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:46,925
- I think I deserved getting killed?
- You don't know exactly what you saw

649
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,505
- or even how you felt.
- What kind of person doesn't care

650
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,015
- they're being murdered?
- Nicole, I've known you a long time.

651
00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:55,977
You didn't do anything wrong,
and you won't.

652
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:58,862
Tomorrow, I'm gonna have
a detective friend of mine

653
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:02,915
from the LAPD come talk to you.
We're not gonna let anything bad happen.

654
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,903
I'm gonna do whatever I have to...
to make sure you're safe.

655
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:08,345
All right?

656
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:13,085
That person you think you saw,

657
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:18,064
That person you're worried you might be,
that's not you.

658
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,002
Do you think you could
try to believe that?

659
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:26,926
Yeah. I can try.

660
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:28,586
Good.

661
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:32,407
- Hey, daddy.
- Hey! Come here, you.

662
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,389
Moons Over Miami. You in?

663
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,886
- I'm in.
- All right. Let's get started.

664
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:41,634
- Are you staying?
- You know what? I have to go.

665
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:42,856
She's staying.

666
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:44,670
Breakfast for dinner?

667
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:45,901
Can't beat that.

668
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:51,031
- Come on. Please?
- Sounds great.

669
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,911
Get cracking the eggs, Professor.

670
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:58,001
- Can I have a bowl, please?
- One bowl coming right up.

671
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:01,875
- That's silly.
- Here we go.

672
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:13,136
Do you want the coin back?
Say the magic words then.

673
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:16,279
- Not again.
- Are you ready?

674
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:18,460
See you tomorrow, Dr. Benford.
Good night, Deb.

675
00:41:22,165 --> 00:41:23,105
There you go.

676
00:41:23,526 --> 00:41:25,441
Do it again! Just once more!

677
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:28,276
I think my junior magician
has to get his strength up

678
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,530
before the next trick.
How about some dinner?

679
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:39,329
I'll be right back.

680
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,958
You're the eye of newt soup, right?

681
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:47,504
All right. Chicken, it is.

682
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:00,371
<i>We need to talk.</i>

683
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:01,705
I can't right now.

684
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,849
<i>I'm truly sorry about that, Lloyd,</i>

685
00:42:05,116 --> 00:42:07,630
but talking to me is
just one of those little inconveniences

686
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,589
