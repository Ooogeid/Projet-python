00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,961
<i>
</i>

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,060
<i>
</i>

3
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:06,047
<i>
</i>

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,051
I've never even had the urge
to have a baby.

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,720
There I was.
I don't even have a boyfriend.

6
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:14,220
You're worried about Olivia.

7
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:16,641
You're worried you're gonna fall off
the wagon in the future.

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,767
If you wanna save your marriage,

9
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,853
first step isn't keeping secrets
from your wife.

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,529
Remember that hacker,
Mr. Cheeto Dust?

11
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:26,199
- Give him a call.
- Is Somalia really that important?

12
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,195
We've been so worried the blackout
might happen again,

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,247
we haven't stopped to ask ourselves,

14
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,998
what if it happened before?

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,289
- Thanks, man.
- You're...

16
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,358
All things being equal,

17
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:45,389
it wouldn't have been the worst thing
in the world if I had...

18
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:46,892
Forget it. Forget it.

19
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:50,409
I just wanted you to know
the details I do remember,

20
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,118
I remember clearly.

21
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,513
Fabulous. Look, just keep
your mouth shut.

22
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,557
You tell anyone else about this,
we are DOA.

23
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:10,069
Just wanted to share
some good news with you.

24
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:13,233
Even though the whole trip's been
a bit of a disaster,

25
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,124
Wedeck pulled some kind of rabbit.

26
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,137
Who knows?

27
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:19,008
Maybe he wouldn't have had...

28
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:31,007
Get out! Let's go!

29
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:42,101
1x05 - "Gimme Some Truth"

30
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,804
Senate hearings I understand.

31
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,218
But what I don't get

32
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:49,066
is them dragging us down here
first thing in the morning.

33
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:52,653
If you ask me, this whole thing
is one big Chinese fire drill.

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,865
Is that inappropriate
for the workplace?

35
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,333
No. That's cool.

36
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,615
I know how you old people are.

37
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:04,165
- Demetri Fordis Noh?
- What do you want me for?

38
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,322
I didn't see anything.
I told you in my affidavit, man.

39
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:09,736
Doesn't you mean you were telling
the truth when you gave it.

40
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,715
I was alone.

41
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:34,487
I didn't think there was
anyone else in the building.

42
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,740
I didn't think anyone else
was in the building.

43
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:41,494
It was late. 10:00 P.M.

44
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:47,208
I was working in my office.

45
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:48,827
I was working late.

46
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:52,505
I was leaving for the night.

47
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:55,549
I was headed out the security exit.

48
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,094
I don't know why.
Maybe...

49
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,262
because it was late.

50
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,182
Did you see anyone else
during your flash-forward?

51
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,810
Yes.

52
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,394
I saw two men,

53
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,676
both wearing masks,
both carrying Kalashnikovs.

54
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:15,111
Did you recognize the men?

55
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:18,531
I did mention they were
wearing masks, right?

56
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,178
- How's it going over there?
- <i>How's it going in DC?</i>

57
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,579
Well, they don't think
I'm a traitor.

58
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,748
Those lie detectors
can be fooled, right?

59
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,667
Seriously,
how's it going over there?

60
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:30,640
Well,

61
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:33,586
I've just about figured out
what's wrong with your alarm system.

62
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,870
<i>And you're welcome.
I fixed that hack repair job</i>

63
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,782
<i>that you did on your garage door.</i>

64
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,552
You're a full-service sponsor.

65
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,137
Charlie now knows
how to drive a stick.

66
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,136
<i>So now that you're off the hot seat,
when can we expect to see you back?</i>

67
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:47,415
Wedeck's testifying
in these hearings.

68
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:50,062
I'm gonna help Demetri
with document support.

69
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,107
- Sounds exciting.
- <i>I'm the one who started the office</i>

70
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,349
on this Mosaic path,

71
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:57,027
and I'm feeling a whole lot
of pressure to be right about it.

72
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:59,697
DC's got AA meetings, too, you know.

73
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:02,408
Might not be a bad idea
to go and find one.

74
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,709
I'll take it under advisement.

75
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,791
See if you can't get Charlie
into a few colleges while I'm gone.

76
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,260
Go to a meeting.

77
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:19,049
Very cloak-and-dagger.
Just like the movies.

78
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,657
What's all this stuff anyway?

79
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:21,973
Evidence.

80
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:25,431
Wedeck thinks he needs it
for his senate testimony.

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,407
He's afraid they're gonna take away
our funding, in which case,

82
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,144
Mosaic is dead in the water.

83
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,067
I've never seen Wedeck
with a stick so far up his ass.

84
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,524
He hates DC. He used to live here.

85
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,854
Apparently, it left
a bad taste in his mouth.

86
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,905
You ask me, he's a dude
with something to prove.

87
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:54,604
You're gettin' better.

88
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:57,586
You're gettin' older.

89
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:02,419
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

90
00:05:02,544 --> 00:05:04,294
It's been too long, Stan.

91
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,207
Who said the SIC hearings
weren't good for anything?

92
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:09,198
I say it on a daily basis.

93
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:11,417
Look, Dave,

94
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,555
- these hearings...
- Relax.

95
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:18,047
This is Congress masturbating
to the sound of its own voice.

96
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:18,976
Really?

97
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,003
Cause my understanding is these hearings
are gonna redistribute a lot of funding.

98
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:23,404
And funding is what I need.

99
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:26,732
Nobody's gonna take
anything from you.

100
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:29,155
Our Mosaic investigation's
already paying off.

101
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,741
We're starting to get
a real picture of April 29th

102
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,311
and what caused the blackout.

103
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:34,964
But it's gonna take money.

104
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,599
And it wouldn't hurt to have...

105
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,337
a big dog on my side.

106
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,831
- You don't want me as your friend.
- Why?

107
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:43,174
Clemente's chairing these hearings.
You remember?

108
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,972
You didn't know that?

109
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:51,058
You think I'd even set foot
in DC if I did?

110
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,611
All right, I would've,

111
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:57,022
because this is
that important, Dave.

112
00:05:58,982 --> 00:05:59,784
What?

113
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:03,456
No, it's just that
the trusty boy scout...

114
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,925
is funny coming from you.

115
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:09,106
You would know.

116
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,239
That was a pretty impressive
move back there.

117
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,864
- You almost knocked the wind out of me.
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?

118
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:52,437
No problem.

119
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:54,620
"Enter the Dragon's" playing
at the Nuart tonight.

120
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,456
I thought maybe
we could check it out.

121
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,125
Sorry.

122
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:01,173
I already have plans tonight.

123
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:04,025
Okay. Maybe another time.

124
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,508
Maybe. Yeah.

125
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,804
All right,
I'll catch you guys later.

126
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,072
- Bye.
- All right.

127
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:12,999
Bye.

128
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,260
What a douche.

129
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,095
What's his name?

130
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,825
Does he have a brother?

131
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,903
I don't know.
I'm still wading in.

132
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,174
Good morning.

133
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:28,530
Here you go, sunshine.

134
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,808
- Your very own haystack.
- What is this?

135
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,733
18 years worth of satellite imagery
from Southern Somalia,

136
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,621
courtesy of the C.I.A.

137
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,706
I thought you and Mark
got shut down on that.

138
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,165
We got unshut.

139
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,601
Upload whatever,
and we'll start pouring through it.

140
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:43,545
For what?

141
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,006
Anything that relates
to the crow die-off in '91.

142
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,925
Especially
if we can substantiate reports

143
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,140
that people lost consciousness
in the Ganwar region during that time.

144
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:52,995
Bonus points
if we can find something

145
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,140
that gives Wedeck extra ammo
in Washington.

146
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,423
Anything to keep our
happy investigation going?

147
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:58,746
I'm on it.

148
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,831
- Where's Benford?
- Back at the hotel.

149
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,732
He said photo ops
make him constipated.

150
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,026
Tell him to get in line.

151
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,409
I wish my 5th grade teacher
could see me now.

152
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,417
Always said I would either
end up dead or in prison.

153
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:19,311
There's still time.

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,998
Still time.

155
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,341
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President will make a statement.

156
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,937
At the conclusion of it,

157
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:33,420
the President will answer
a limited number of questions.

158
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:36,131
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the U.S.A.

159
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,232
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please.

160
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:42,636
Please be seated.

161
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,584
Be seated, please.

162
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:51,655


163
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,490
So if you want to understand
why the senate hearings were closed,

164
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,199
you'd have to ask a senator.

165
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,090
But I'm willing to wager
it's because

166
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:00,693
National Security issues
will be discussed.

167
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,822
- Next question.
- Mr. President.

168
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,581
Mr. President,
3 weeks since the blackout,

169
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,332
and there's still no centralized agency
to deal with the consequences.

170
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,488
What is your response
to critics who say

171
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:13,801
that your administration hasn't learned
from the lessons of 9/11 and Katrina?

172
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:18,098
Today's hearings have been convened
to address just this issue.

173
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,395
We're coordinating our responses.

174
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,440
We're redirecting funds
to the most promising leads,

175
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,891
and we're dropping investigations

176
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:27,852
which are not producing results.

177
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,855
When I finalize
my vice presidential choice,

178
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,822
he or she
will supervise these efforts.

179
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:36,524
- Thank you, all.
- Thanks, everyone.

180
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,679
Why aren't you sharing what you saw,
Mr. President?

181
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:42,706
Mr. Obrego.

182
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,181
Like many other world leaders,

183
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:48,167
I'm following the policy
of not revealing what I saw.

184
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:55,190
<i>Sir, I'm sorry to wake you,
but something's happened.</i>

185
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,973
I'm thinking about the present,
not the future, Oscar.

186
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:02,653
We have too much to do.
Thank you, all.

187
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,571
Mr. Wedeck?
Please follow me.

188
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,737
All I need is a new code.

189
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,859
0-3-1-2.

190
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:20,765
Wedding anniversary.

191
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,230
You don't want to pick
something that Mark will remember?

192
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:26,959
How's it going in Washington?

193
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,001
Not great. Mark called.

194
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:32,296
- He sounds stressed.
- I'm sure he'll do fine.

195
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,354
- You don't seem too sure.
- I don't know.

196
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:41,472
This case has him traveling a lot,
he's away from home, his support system.

197
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:47,895
I overheard you both talking about him
going to meetings in Washington.

198
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,495
Is he having a hard time?

199
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:54,622
It's just a friendly reminder.

200
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,314
The last time Mark had a problem.

201
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:01,284
He was away from home,
testifying in one of his cases.

202
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,661
He'd been promoted.

203
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,840
- This is a little different.
- I think it's exactly the same.

204
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,654
- And even if wasn't...
- Look,

205
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:10,787
I get it.

206
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,077
Things have been stressful
for both of you.

207
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,384
I guess Mark told you
about my flash-forward?

208
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,175
Of course.

209
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:29,022
He's just fixated now

210
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:32,582
on the idea that in 6 months' time,
I'm gonna be sleeping with another man.

211
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:34,357
Which is insane. But...

212
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:37,299
his whole job depends on these
flash-forwards coming true, so...

213
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:38,902
Mark's an alcoholic.

214
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:42,826
He doesn't need a reason to drink.
He drinks because he drinks.

215
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:45,185
I know.

216
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,914
If you're asking me if
I think he's gonna take a drink...

217
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:49,892
I am.

218
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:57,894
- Are you asking for him or for you?
- I don't know.

219
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,198
I love him, Aaron. I just...

220
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:07,368
I know I can't control him.

221
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:09,763
That's the hardest part
about all of this.

222
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,813
Trust always is with an alcoholic.

223
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,659
But,

224
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,510
if you can't trust Mark,

225
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:17,355
who can you trust?

226
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,476
Let me guess.
You remembered you owe me

227
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,455
and had a change of heart
about helping me out.

228
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:30,665
We're not
on the campaign trail anymore.

229
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,113
And inside the beltway, well...

230
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:36,344
You have to be a little subtler
about calling in our chits.

231
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:39,091
I got out of the beltway,
if you recall.

232
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,661
You're right about me owing you one,

233
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,596
and about me helping you out.

234
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,792
But my plan is gonna bring you
right back in the beltway.

235
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,100
I always felt really bad

236
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:55,238
that I couldn't
bring you on board initially.

237
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:57,024
It's fine.
Everything worked out.

238
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,893
The Chinese view chaos
as opportunity,

239
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:05,660
and the blackout gives me
the chance to pay you back.

240
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:11,437
Director of Homeland Security,

241
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:13,253
member of my cabinet.

242
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:24,101
I'm pretty sure
Clemente will block my appointment.

243
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:26,048
Clemente's got bigger fish to fry.

244
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:30,868
Think about it.

245
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:33,338
There's no rush.

246
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,827
Thank you.

247
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:45,591
This is the sixth course.
What are you, a food critic ?

248
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:48,075
Chef, actually.
This is my restaurant.

249
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,523
The one where I work.

250
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,706
Your being FBI,
I'm guessing you're not...

251
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,719
Out?

252
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:58,722
I work for the federal government,

253
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:02,007
and they're not too big
on trusting gays with guns.

254
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,177
Who knows? Maybe six months from now,
we'll all be more enlightened.

255
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,962
In my flash-forward,
I'm here in the restaurant,

256
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,599
but I have a wedding band
on my finger.

257
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,521
That was way too much information,
especially for a first date.

258
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:21,735
Maybe it's a sign
of how well this is going.

259
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,696
Help me change the subject.
What did you see in your flash-forward?

260
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:26,814
Well,

261
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:28,861
I was...

262
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,687
On the International Space Station

263
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:34,663
having a 3-way with
Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin.

264
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,334
Really? Actually, did I say
I was in the restaurant?

265
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:41,194
I was on
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

266
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,278
and Angelina Jolie
was the game show host.

267
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,050
You slut.

268
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,377
Angie just asked me
the million dollar question.

269
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:51,973
I went to phone a friend, you.
But you didn't answer.

270
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,100
So my "millionaire" moment was gone.

271
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,346
I don't buy that.

272
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:58,296
What?

273
00:14:58,421 --> 00:15:01,191
That Angelina Jolie would be
a game show host?

274
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:06,196
That I would ever
let you down like that.

275
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,182
Actually, Senator Clemente,

276
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,799
the FOA, the EPA and the CDC

277
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:32,337
have all ruled out
psychotropic pharmaceuticals

278
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:33,847
in the global water supply

279
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,427
as the potential cause
of the consciousness shift.

280
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,051
An alien intelligence may have
been at work here, yes.

281
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,221
That's what we're thinking.

282
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:43,524
China.

283
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:46,735
Can you elaborate, Director Keller?

284
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,613
China's population
numbers 1.3 billion.

285
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,701
Yet they suffered fatalities of less
than half a percent during the blackout.

286
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:55,162
No mystery.

287
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:58,081
When the blackout happened,
it was 2:00  over there.

288
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,499
Everybody was asleep.

289
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,405
That doesn't strike you
as a bit convenient?

290
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:05,606
They're practically untouched,
while America suffers

291
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,622
the greatest number of causalities
per capita of any country in the world.

292
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,053
It is the CIA's belief
that this was not an accident.

293
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,271
We believe that this was
a targeted event

294
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:17,851
designed to bring about
the collapse of our government.

295
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,105
Let's take a short recess.

296
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,148
Then we'll hear
from Stanford Wedeck,

297
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:27,276
field director of
the FBI's Los Angeles office.

298
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:31,095
Agent Wedeck is currently running
an interesting investigation

299
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,515
that has diverged significantly

300
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,202
from the methodology employed
by the rest of the bureau.

301
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,089
It's all Kabuki theater.

302
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,668
Now I remember what I hate about DC.

303
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:44,765
What this place turns me into.

304
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,101
<i>Stan, just remember who you are.</i>

305
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:50,342
<i>This whole thing will blow over,
and you'll be home before you know it.</i>

306
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,303
- Enjoying DC, Stanford?
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

307
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:55,930
Joyce.

308
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,744
Senator, actually.

309
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,399
Has anyone ever told you
you're a sore loser, Joyce?

310
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:02,029
Look who's talking.

311
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,347
You're the one
who got put out to pasture.

312
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:05,764
Speaking of which...

313
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:07,966
How do you sleep at night,

314
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,643
knowing what you did
with that woman?

315
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,843
Does your wife know?

316
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:16,562
If I could've proved
what you did six years ago,

317
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:20,656
I would be sitting behind
the desk in the Oval Office right now.

318
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:24,292
If it makes you feel any better,
I doubt you would've gotten a 2nd term.

319
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,446
"If you sit by
the river long enough,

320
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:32,048
you'll see the bodies
of your enemies float by."

321
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:33,470
Sun Tzu.

322
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:35,511
Get ready to float, Stanford.

323
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,385
You wanna go after me?
You give it your best shot.

324
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,503
- But Mosaic...
- Is a joke.

325
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,728
Not everyone's visions
are going to come true.

326
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:47,189
- Most people don't agree.
- Most people didn't see what I did.

327
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:51,360
I saw myself as president
in six months.

328
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:57,304
Now as impossible as that may be...

329
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:01,349
It's a nice thought, isn't it?

330
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:11,256
How much did you hear?

331
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,880
Enough to know I don't want to be
the guy in Joyce Clemente's gun sights.

332
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:17,478
You don't.

333
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:22,142
While others are using what they know
of the present to explain the blackout,

334
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:24,760
our office is trying
to consolidate information

335
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:27,730
gleaned from
the flash-forwards themselves.

336
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,986
The Mosaic collective
has gathered the visions

337
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,777
of hundreds of thousands
of people all around the world,

338
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:36,499
letting our office construct a picture
of what the world will look like

339
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,450
on April 29th, 2010.

340
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,838
A tact, I believe, you've taken
without prior approval

341
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:43,450
or proper authorization.

342
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:45,666
- It's gotten results.
- Yes, I forgot.

343
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,626
You're an "ends justify means"
kind of guy,

344
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,751
no matter how questionable
those means may be.

345
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,654
In this case,
the "means" merely involve

346
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,393
using the future we've seen

347
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:59,295
to guide our investigation
of the blackout.

348
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,469
How exactly?

349
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:02,809
One of our agents had
a flash-forward of himself

350
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,850
investigating the cause
of the blackout.

351
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:08,183
He remembers leads
and investigatory paths

352
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,690
that we won't have
for another six months.

353
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,476
Those leads have already lead to
significant breaks in the case.

354
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,407
"Significant" might be overstating
things a little, Agent Wedeck.

355
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:22,183
Still, if your entire investigation

356
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,620
is bottomed
on what this one agent saw...

357
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:26,289
Perhaps we should hear from him.

358
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,458
I'm the Deputy Field Director,
Mme Chairman.

359
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:33,831
You seem to have landed
on your feet quite nicely, Mr. Wedeck.

360
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,883
The point being, I'm the one
heading up the investigation.

361
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,595
Not to mention that Agent Benford's
already been thoroughly vetted,

362
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,301
including submitting to a polygraph.

363
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:45,658
In that case, he won't mind submitting
to some questions from us.

364
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,396
This hearing reconvenes tomorrow
at 10:00 A.M...

365
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,614
with Agent Benford's testimony.

366
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:01,056
Just tell the truth.

367
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,795
It's gotten us this far.

368
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,664


369
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:18,593
Here.

370
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,727
Let a professional do that.

371
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,679
Thank you.

372
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,807
You know,
I'm not totally useless, Maya.

373
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,272
I can break down a sig sauer
in, like, 12 seconds.

374
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm impressed.

375
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,858
I don't even know
what a sig sauer is.

376
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:56,379
Stupid alarm clock.
I can never set it right.

377
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:59,245
No wonder I'm always late.

378
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,595
Speaking of which, I actually
have to go to the office now.

379
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,197
Exciting day collaring bad guys?


380
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,143
You watch too much cable.

381
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,577
And, no, it's actually a busy day
analyzing satellite imagery.

382
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:16,399
- So totally different.
- All right.

383
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,859
Let me get dressed.

384
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,640
Stay. Eat food.

385
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,782
Rifle through my stuff.

386
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,948
Just lock the door when you leave.

387
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:28,598
Will I see you later?

388
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:31,581
One of my friends is having
a showing at the Merton Gallery.

389
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,101

Great.

390
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,963
We've determined
that at least two men were awake

391
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,383
during the blackout.

392
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,966
Moreover, we've discovered

393
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,954
a recurring theme of crow attrition.

394
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:47,472
"Crow attrition"?

395
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,933
Crows died all over the world
during the blackout.

396
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,644
The same thing happened
in Somalia in 1991.

397
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,854
Now I'm no scientist,

398
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,773
but that seems significant to me.

399
00:21:57,301 --> 00:21:59,567
Because you saw it
in your flash-forward?

400
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,029
No, we learned about the crow deaths

401
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,117
from a lead that I remembered
from my flash-forward.

402
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:09,327
And this is a lead
you followed up on your own?

403
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:12,163
- My office did, yes.
- Why, exactly,

404
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:15,413
has your office
set up its own investigation

405
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,408
without getting authorization
from FBI Headquarters?

406
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:22,674
Well, to be perfectly honest,

407
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,843
in my flash-forward,
I seemed to be...

408
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,361
or rather, the...

409
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:31,266
LA office seemed to be at the center
of the blackout investigation.

410
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:32,803
Really?

411
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:35,269
A how did you determine this?

412
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,429
- Here we go.
- In my vision,

413
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:39,899
I was running point
on something called Mosaic.

414
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,404
I had a case board set up in my office,
covered in clues, pictures, leads.

415
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,865
Everything that you would see
in an ongoing, fruitful investigation.

416
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,091
In other words,
you're investigating this

417
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:52,954
because you had a vision
of investigating this.

418
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:56,482
You have a bulletin board

419
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:59,210
with lots of nice pictures on it.

420
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:02,380
But what led you to assume
your investigation

421
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,257
would actually amount to anything?

422
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,058
Because, Mme Chair,

423
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:12,598
I also saw a team of masked gunmen
trying to kill me...

424
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:14,807
Presumably for what
we'll have accomplished

425
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,803
in this investigation
over the next six months.

426
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,314
Six months from now,

427
00:23:19,486 --> 00:23:21,899
masked gunmen are going to burst

428
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,376
into your office

429
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,535
in a secure federal building

430
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,037
and try to kill you?

431
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:31,965
That's what I saw, yes.

432
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,943
Did you find anything?

433
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:46,727
The Ganwar region is the habitat
of the remarkable Somali pygmy gerbil.

434
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:47,852
Awesome.

435
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:49,385
So how was your date?

436
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:52,653
- You had a date?
- Was there any groping?

437
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:54,658
Can we focus on what we're doing?

438
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,562
If the satellite imagery
doesn't give us anything,

439
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,008
then let's start to look
at environmental statistics.

440
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:02,655
Anomalies in the ozone layer,

441
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,809
sunburst activity during that time,
anything.

442
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:07,653
Any reasonable explanations?
Now you're talkin'.

443
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:10,782
Wait. Do you see that?

444
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:12,658
Is that an asphalt road?

445
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:14,199
Go forward.

446
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,330
What are those?

447
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,918
- They look like pylons.
- In the middle of nowhere.

448
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,045
Or towers.

449
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,548


450
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:29,592
Agent Benford,

451
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,095
why were you alone
in the office that night?

452
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,223
- Presumably, I was working late.
- And what were you doing...

453
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:38,108
before you realized
the gunmen were in there?

454
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,936
Looking at the Mosaic case board.

455
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:43,823
I think I might've been
on the phone at some point,

456
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:47,418
- but I'm not sure who I was talking to.
- How can you not be sure?

457
00:24:48,063 --> 00:24:50,754
Other people who were on the phone
in their flash-forwards

458
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:54,235
- remember who they were talking to.
- If you don't believe me,

459
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,493
Senator,

460
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,037
you should talk to the bureau agent
who polygraphed me.

461
00:24:58,822 --> 00:24:59,622
I did.

462
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,501
He was kind enough to provide
a transcript of your session.

463
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,726
You described your experience

464
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:09,345
as "impressionistic flashes
of reality."

465
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:11,300
Is this correct?

466
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:12,979
Yes.

467
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:15,787
And from what I can tell,
you've recounted about...

468
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,857
30 seconds worth of...

469
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:19,100
"Impressions."

470
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,270
Everyone else we've heard from,
unless they were asleep,

471
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,524
experienced vivid,
easily recalled visions

472
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,318
covering the entire 2 min and 17 s
of the blackout.

473
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:32,613
- Is that a question?
- I'm just trying to understand.

474
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,033
Was the building on fire?
Was there smoke in the room?

475
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,453
Why is everything
in your recollection so hazy

476
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,871
and disjointed?

477
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,526
- As far as I know, there was no fire.
- Then how do you account

478
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:50,953
for the stark,
qualitative difference

479
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,928
between your experience
of the blackout and everyone else's?

480
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,598
With all due respect, Mme Chair,

481
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,014
have you spoken to all
7 billion people on the planet?

482
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:02,101
No, I haven't.

483
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,986
Possibly because
those 7 billion people

484
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:07,311
aren't seeking millions of dollars

485
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:09,386
to spearhead an investigation

486
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:12,826
based on their somewhat
murky flash-forwards.

487
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,363
Senator Clemente...

488
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:16,699
Hundreds of thousands
of federal dollars

489
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,992
have been spent because of what
you claim to have seen.

490
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:22,565
- Don't you think, somebody...
- How dare you.

491
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,574
Should've ascertained what you were
doing the other hundred-plus seconds?

492
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:30,671
Am I the only one who thinks
these investigative techniques

493
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,745
seem a little closer
to voodoo or fraud?

494
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:38,982
Now...

495
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:43,100
Did someone have a question
about Nazi repatriation?

496
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,157
- Where the hell is Wedeck?
- Toilet?

497
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:48,544
For 40 minutes?

498
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:50,608
Voice mail. What a disaster.

499
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,960
That Clemente is a hard-ass.

500
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:56,077
But when you hear it laid out like that,
it does sound questionable.

501
00:26:56,202 --> 00:26:59,169
It sounds like we consulted the psychic
network for clues or something.

502
00:26:59,294 --> 00:27:00,256
Thanks...

503
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:02,348
I'm not saying
I think that necessarily...

504
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:06,082
It sounds totally nuts...
Dead birds, D. Gibbons, doll heads.

505
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,223
China... That's starting
to sound pretty good right about now.

506
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:12,490
So it was a mistake to mention
the dolls heads, is what you're saying?

507
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:16,384
<i>Get to a laptop. We got something
you're gonna want to see.</i>

508
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,845
- <i>What are we looking at here?</i>
- Wajid, Somalia, population 325,

509
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,932
- <i>about 200 miles east of nowhere.</i>
- Oprah's building a school there?

510
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,643
Honey, be quiet.
The grown-ups are talking.

511
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,980
<i>This is a satellite photo
taken December of 1990...</i>

512
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,983
About five months before
your crows did a face-plant.

513
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:35,005
- What the hell are those?
- <i>We don't know,</i>

514
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,172
<i>but they were built from scratch
over the course of five months.</i>

515
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,116
You get the idea.

516
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:44,740
<i>It looks like they were
about 100 feet tall</i>

517
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:48,505
<i>when they were completed
here in April of 1991.</i>

518
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,378
The same month
our proto-blackout hit.

519
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,449
<i>Any idea what these structures are?</i>

520
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:57,033
Beats me. But it's the last thing
I'd expect to see

521
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:59,560
at a place that doesn't even
have indoor plumbing.

522
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:02,513
We're sending the images down
to forensics for evaluation.

523
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:06,058
The state department's been stonewalling
us on our request to send a team in.

524
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,394
This looks like
it'll cut through some red tape.

525
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,814
<i>Whoever built these clearly didn't want
anyone else to know about 'em.</i>

526
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,315
<i>- Janis Hawk.</i>
- Janis, this is Wedeck.

527
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,740
<i>Everything okay?</i>

528
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:32,960
I need you to do something
for me right away.

529
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:40,550
{\- Hey, Maya.
- Hey.}

530
00:28:42,265 --> 00:28:44,992
Sorry I'm late. My boss called
right as I was out the door.

531
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:46,057
No worries.

532
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,517
I got you a little something.

533
00:28:49,642 --> 00:28:52,437
- Thank you.
- I just saw it and thought of you.

534
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:54,732
<i>Wake up.</i>

535
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,362
<i>It's time to get up.</i>

536
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,809
So you're not late anymore,
unless you wanna be.

537
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:01,238
Thank you. That's very sweet.

538
00:29:03,313 --> 00:29:05,422
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

539
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,203
It's a little awkward.

540
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,913
You're getting all flustered.

541
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,582
Do you date guys, too?

542
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,079
The last one was in high school,

543
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:17,087
and I try not to think about it.
Why?

544
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,537
I guess that's the part
that's awkward...

545
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:22,176
I kind of did something.

546
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:26,999
You went through my stuff!
I knew you would do that.

547
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,770
I did the next best thing.

548
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:33,270
I Mosaic-ed you.

549
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,065
You what?

550
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,483
I couldn't resist.

551
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,111
It's way better
than Google stalking.

552
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,739
I saw that in five months from now,

553
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:44,964
you'll be...

554
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:47,137
You know...

555
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,661
pregnant.

556
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:55,392
And as talented as I may be
in the bedroom...

557
00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:58,218
- That'd be pretty impressive.
- It's not a big deal.

558
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,592
In my flash-forward,
I'm wearing a wedding ring.

559
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:07,080
Maybe it's ours.

560
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:11,837
For what it's worth, I think
that you're gonna be a great mom.

561
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:15,481
And that was
the wrong thing to say, too.

562
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,365
This isn't...

563
00:30:18,938 --> 00:30:20,288
a "me/you" thing.

564
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:22,427
This is a "me" thing.

565
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,699
And honestly,
I haven't even figured it out yet.

566
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,786
I don't even know what I'm gonna do.

567
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,575
You know what?

568
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:39,587
I don't think I can do this...

569
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:41,839
right now.

570
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:45,012
I'm sorry.

571
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:48,049
I'm really sorry.

572
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,220


573
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:01,609
It's been a while.

574
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,611
May I come in, Renee?

575
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,952
My man! Hello, my man!

576
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,278
What's happenin'?

577
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,209


578
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:21,535
Long way from $2 beer night
at Geno's.

579
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,385
My first term was a bitch.

580
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,347
I could've used you, Stan.

581
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,896
Really, I'm sorry
I couldn't bring you in.

582
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,475
But I can now.

583
00:31:36,212 --> 00:31:38,028
Have you thought about D.H.S.?

584
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:41,532
I know you'd love being
Anastasia Markham's boss.

585
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:52,909
I'm not here about the job.

586
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:56,037
So no more boy scout?

587
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,497
How'd you find her?

588
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,446
I was the bagman

589
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:03,002
who paid her 250 000 $ to disappear.
Remember?

590
00:32:03,351 --> 00:32:05,019
Only she didn't go very far.

591
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:06,506
She's living with the boy.

592
00:32:07,128 --> 00:32:08,925
Right here in Georgetown, in fact.

593
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:12,387
And you know that how?
Through our Mosaic web site.

594
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,306
It's amazing how we've been able
to cross-reference people's visions.

595
00:32:17,431 --> 00:32:19,394
Turns out Ms. Garrigos
had a vision, too.

596
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:22,730
She saw herself living in Puerto Rico
six months from now.

597
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,493
And in her Mosaic post, she remarked

598
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:29,606
how different that was
from her current home in Georgetown.

599
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:35,352
You know what I liked
about having you around, Stan?

600
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:38,433
You weren't just comfortable...

601
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:39,825
in the mud.

602
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,990
You enjoy being there.

603
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:50,967
Clemente is going to cut off the funding
unless you stop her. So, stop her.

604
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,095
And the negative
goes into the shredder.

605
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:59,809
You can only play this card once.
You sure you wanna play it now?

606
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:03,718
Now's all I got.

607
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,134
I've got a problem
I need you to take care of.

608
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,570
Do it!

609
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,188
Go, man!

610
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,235
I hate karaoke.

611
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:57,492
Think it might be a good idea
for you to slow down there?

612
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:01,121
I got five months to live.

613
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:04,763
I think that entitles me
to blow off a little steam, man.

614
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:27,940
You got something to say?

615
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,111
'Cause you look a little pissed.

616
00:34:33,857 --> 00:34:35,036
Why would I be angry?

617
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:38,357
Just because you bailed in the middle
of the hearing, left me twisting.

618
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:39,585
Let's be honest.

619
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,733
It's not like my being there
would've kept you from choking

620
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:45,295
on the witness stand.
You were flailin' in there!

621
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,535
Why didn't you call for a recess?

622
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:05,101
- You could've spoken up for me.
- And said what?

623
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:08,428
There's a good explanation why you're
having trouble remembering something,

624
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:11,297
the rest of us have lasered
into our brains?

625
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:13,985
See, this is my own damn fault.

626
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:17,312
Clemente is just asking you questions
I should've asked weeks ago,

627
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:19,532
but I didn't because I trusted you.

628
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:22,702
And I went with this whole Mosaic thing
in the first place because

629
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,517
I believe in you, Mark.

630
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,915
- And I have gotten you results.
- That's not an answer.

631
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:32,023
Now Clemente may be a total bitch,
but she's right about one thing...

632
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:36,099
Your story's got more holes
than a kitchen sponge.

633
00:35:36,224 --> 00:35:39,635
- Why can't you remember everything?
- Because I was loaded, okay!

634
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:56,504
What was I supposed to say, Stan?

635
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,368
I've been sober seven years,
and I have zero intention

636
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:05,923
of ever taking another drink again.

637
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:09,655
But I can't change what I saw.

638
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,060
I put my entire career on the line

639
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:19,521
based on your flash-forward
and now you're telling me...

640
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:24,013
You were impaired when you had it?

641
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,872
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

642
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:36,666
That's fantastic, Mark.
That's fantastic.

643
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,135
Everything okay in here?

644
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,633
Everything's fine.

645
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:43,069
Guys,

646
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,495
won't don't you buy yourselves
a couple rounds? On me.

647
00:36:47,724 --> 00:36:50,265
It's celebration time.

648
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,416
What are we celebrating?

649
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:56,551
I got us our funding.

650
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:08,961


651
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,312
Pound.

652
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,580
Zero, three, one, two.

653
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:14,523
Set.

654
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:15,892
Damn it.

655
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:17,016
Aaron...

656
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:44,093
All things being equal,

657
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,862
it wouldn't have been the worst thing
in the world if I had...

658
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:49,144
- Forget it.
- I just want you to know

659
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:52,685
the details I do remember,
I remember clearly.

660
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:55,354
Fabulous.
Look, just keep your mouth shut.

661
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,400
You tell anyone else
about this, we are DOA.

662
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,402
<i>President Segovia has announced
his nominee for vice president,</i>

663
00:38:01,808 --> 00:38:03,405
<i>a position which has been vacant</i>

664
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,714
<i>since the tragic death
of Vice President Pratt</i>

665
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,050
<i>during the blackout.</i>

666
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:10,252
<i>Tonight, the President says
he has nominated Senator Clemente.</i>

667
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:13,033
<i>The nominee will have to be approved
by majority vote</i>

668
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,685
<i>in both houses of Congress.</i>

669
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,375
I don't get this town.

670
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,044
Everything's a trade-off.

671
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,550
DC's your ultimate
"can't get something for nothing" place.

672
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:23,577
Here we go.

673
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:48,824
Just wanted to share some good news
with you. We've got our funding.

674
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,239
<i>Mosaic's still alive.</i>

675
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:51,994
Because of the Somali intel?

676
00:38:52,424 --> 00:38:54,766
No. Wedeck pulled
some kind of rabbit.

677
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,973
Who knows?
Maybe he wouldn't have had to if...

678
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,054
- Get out!
- Let's go! Go!

679
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:55,299
<i>Wake up. It's time to get up.</i>

680
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:05,924
<i>Wake up. It's time to get up.</i>

681
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:14,762
<i>- Tell me.
- It's a girl.</i>
