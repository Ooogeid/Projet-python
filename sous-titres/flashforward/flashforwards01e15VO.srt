1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,426
We believe that this man was somehow
connected to the blackout.

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,385
He's highly efficient
in advanced computing equipment.

3
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:16,182
He also seems to have
a penchant for chess.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,560
The man you call D. Gibbons,
his real name is Dyson Frost.

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,271
<i>Hello, Demetri.
My name is Dyson Frost.</i>

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,814
<i>Got your attention, didn't I?</i>

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,108
In my flash-forward,
I saw this symbol.

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,070
I remember the images,
but I just can't put them together.

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,364
Your have to find her.

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,990
Our entire investigation hinges
on what's in your head.

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,451
I'm here to make sure
you don't lose it before april 29th.

12
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,162
- We went to Utah.
- Officer down!

13
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,081
D. Gibbons knew we were coming.
You unearthed the Somalia photos.

14
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,910
5 minutes later, we're getting shot at.
Whoever we're investigating

15
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:45,326
knows what we're doing
before we do it.

16
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,712
We have 'em all.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,341
You're forgetting what we saw...
The part where we're not together.

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,399
<i>Hey, honey!</i>

19
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,794
I want to go away with you
and with Charlie.

20
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:59,058
I just want to get away
from all of this. Yes or no?

21
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,233
I'm sorry. I was in surgery.

22
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,693
I'm fine. I'm fine.

23
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,988
- Oh, god. What happened?
- I ran into a bullet.

24
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:16,966
Babe, I'm serious. 6 inches this way,
this bullet's in your heart.

25
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:18,091
I know.

26
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,247
I'm not sure
I can handle this anymore.

27
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:25,282
Livy, I was an F.B.I. agent
when you married me.

28
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,019
But it is different now.
We have a daughter.

29
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,340
I mean, if something happens to you,

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,808
I don't wanna...

31
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,159
Look, I get that this is
who you are.

32
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:39,964
But it's different.

33
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:43,286
I mean, I've got to know
that our family comes first.

34
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:45,566
Something's gotta change.

35
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,547
Wedeck offered me

36
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:50,359
a position on the DHS
counterterrorism task force.

37
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:52,028
It's an improvement?

38
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:55,323
It's surveillance.

39
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:59,047
Two guys in a car eating burritos,

40
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:02,538
listening to phone calls in farsi.
I'll be out of the line of fire.

41
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,491
My biggest concerns will be
boredom and cholesterol.

42
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:07,543
You're gonna hate that.

43
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,265
But I can take it.

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,548
What I can't take
is losing you and Charlie.

45
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:15,584
Our family will always come first.
I promise.

46
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:24,744
So, if you need anything,

47
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,456
I'll be staying at the Wedecks'.

48
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,693
I'm sorry. I have no idea
how to do this.

49
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,821
Neither do I.

50
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,956
She's been in there 20 minutes.

51
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:51,420
I'll call you tonight.

52
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,471
Are you my new partner?

53
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:09,611
If you are, I insist
you change your clothes.

54
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:11,491
Can't catch bad guys in pajamas.

55
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,421
Where are you going?

56
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,845
I'm just going to the Wedecks'
for a little while.

57
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,448
How long is a little while?

58
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:23,744
I hope it's not very long at all.

59
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,724
What's this?

60
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,855
You lost your bracelet.

61
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,631
It'll keep you safe from the bad guys
until you come back home.

62
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,970
Let me put it back on.

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,780
Come here.

64
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:54,184
I love you so much, Charlie-bear.

65
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,239
-= Blackout Team =-

66
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:03,180
Season 1 Episode 15
-= Queen Sacrifice =-

67
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:07,691
<i>If you're watching
this message in 2010,</i>

68
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:11,237
<i>that means the global blackout
was successful.</i>

69
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:13,096
<i>That also means</i>

70
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:16,380
<i>we've had a near miss
in Pigeon, Utah.</i>

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,950
<i>How do I know all this?</i>

72
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:24,782
<i>Because I myself have had
hundreds of flash-forwards.</i>

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,895
<i>In nearly all of my futures,</i>

74
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,441
<i>I end up dying on march 15th...</i>

75
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,598
<i>Like you, Demetri.</i>

76
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:40,655
<i>So if you managed to find
this tape in Somalia,</i>

77
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,257
<i>it would seem our fates</i>

78
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,252
<i>are on a collision course,</i>

79
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:48,371
<i>and the possible outcomes
of the game</i>

80
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,139
<i>are rapidly narrowing.</i>

81
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,531
<i>As for the endgame,</i>

82
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,963
<i>the next move is Mark Benford's.</i>

83
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,919
That's Dyson Frost?

84
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,333
And it's genuine?

85
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:08,137
It's legit.

86
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:13,104
Degradation rate in the tape plus the
date of production makes it authentic.

87
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:16,607
The only explanation,
however implausible,

88
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,480
is that Frost flashed-forward
from 1991 to our present

89
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:22,738
and saw us in Somalia.

90
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,657
Then in 1991,

91
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,243
he makes a tape he knows we'd find.

92
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:30,121
That's a 19-year flash-forward.

93
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,372
And march 15th,

94
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,540
the day he dies in his future,

95
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,195
is the date I'm supposed
to be murdered.

96
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:40,615
Maybe that's the collision course
he's talking about.

97
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,824
Dem, Frost talks
about narrowing outcomes,

98
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:46,347
another indication that what people see
in their flash-forwards...

99
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,015
are only possibilities.

100
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:53,185
- Could be warning us.
- Warning us about what?

101
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,275
There's gonna be another blackout.

102
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:00,526
What?

103
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:02,750
How? When?

104
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,240
We have to assume
that's Agent Benford's next move...

105
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,909
to find out and to prevent it.

106
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:12,163
So let's make it a good one.
Find Dyson Frost...

107
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:13,748
yesterday.

108
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,751
This is magnificent work.

109
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:21,839
Master circuits built from basic
sketches I designed when I was 13.

110
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,377
When you finish patting yourself
on the back, can we get to work?

111
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:27,734
I had to go to a lot of trouble to get
all this, not to mention that basement.

112
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:30,414
Yes, I know, the missing digit.

113
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:31,974
A terrible loss.

114
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,956
You find anything in those documents
we got in Somalia?

115
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,022
A couple of things.

116
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,567
There were several references
to tachyonic dark matter.

117
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,819
In '91? How is that possible?

118
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,905
The theoretical basis existed.

119
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,783
- But the experiment failed.
- Because they needed us.

120
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,369
Clearly, you're missing
the silver ling.

121
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,411
The blackout.

122
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,039
We're off the hook.
Not our fault.

123
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,444
Frost flash-forwarded in '91

124
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,877
using technology
that we did not develop.

125
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:05,007
Flosso said our NLAP experiments
amplified the blackout.

126
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,675
We can't dodge that.

127
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,429
- Find anything else interesting?
- I saw this formula

128
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,056
in my flash-forward.

129
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:13,849
Written on a mirror.

130
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,706
It's the exact inverse of some
of our early NLAP computations.

131
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:23,353
I don't know, maybe a process
to reverse the blackout?

132
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:25,860
You're working on blackout protection
in your flash-forward?

133
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:26,862
I don't know,

134
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,240
but it was this formula,
and there was...

135
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:31,993
There was more of it
written on the mirror,

136
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:34,578
and the two of them
are combined somehow.

137
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,914
We need the other formula
that you saw on the Benfords' mirror.

138
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:40,751
Go see your girlfriend.

139
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:43,045
Ticktock.

140
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:50,710
Nothing. I ran face recognition software
on every available database.

141
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:54,102
Since frost faked his death in 1990,
there is not one record,

142
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:57,518
- not one sighting of this guy. Nothing.
- He's a thorough guy...

143
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,745
Likes complex things like chess.

144
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,898
He's also got an arrogant streak.
Likes people to know when he's winning.

145
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,595
I've been looking through membership
lists of chess clubs pre-'90.

146
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,709
Frost placed third
in an amateur league in '87.

147
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,408
And the guy he beat
lives in San Francisco.

148
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,994
His name is Ian McKinnon.

149
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,228
McKinnon was the reigning champion
until frost beat him in an upset.

150
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:21,751
So I traced him
and then I gave him a call.

151
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,929
But when I mentioned Frost,

152
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,880
- he hung up.
- Let's travel.

153
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,349
We need to get to San Francisco
and talk to him, right?

154
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:31,344
Yeah. But first,
there's something else.

155
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,826
This is Frost's final tournament
against McKinnon.

156
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:36,057
He uses a very risky play

157
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:38,499
called the queen sacrifice.

158
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,358
Looks like a total hail mary,

159
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,563
but it's one of the most effective
plays in the game.

160
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,606
So what?

161
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:47,234
He knew we would see these games.
It's another message from 1991.

162
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:49,299
Tournament game sheets.

163
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:51,370
Each of his moves takes either two

164
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:53,324
or four seconds.
Never more, never less.

165
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,952
In the three games,
he made 50 moves, after which

166
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:58,247
he resigned.

167
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:02,083
So this is a code of some kind.
Wait. Is this...

168
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,373
This is morse code.

169
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:07,463
2-second moves are dots.
4-second moves are dashes.

170
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,031
There are 50 moves,
so 50 characters.

171
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:12,885
- This is jumbles of letters here.
- Not letters.

172
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,805
Numbers in morse code
have five dots or dashes.

173
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,474
50 divided by 5 is 10 digits.

174
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,351
Is it a phone number?

175
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:28,359
Prepaid cell.

176
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,486
He really did know the future.

177
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,013
<i>Well done.
Leave a message.</i>

178
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:37,624
Dyson Frost?

179
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:39,791
This is Agent Benford.

180
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:41,974
It's your move.

181
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:45,442
Now we're traveling.

182
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:07,733
In english, please.

183
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:11,328
I know you like halibut.
Some just came in this morning.

184
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:12,653
No, thank you.

185
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,197
I ate some cereal.

186
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,949
That's not enough.
You need protein.

187
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:21,028
You are kind, but I can't.

188
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:23,372
It's too much money.

189
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:40,806
I want a new beginning.

190
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:42,391
And new love.

191
00:10:58,147 --> 00:10:59,907
Some miso soup, a little rice?

192
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:18,386
Not today.

193
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:30,911
Come here often?

194
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,414
I'm beginning
to feel like a regular.

195
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:37,822
Don't you have anything better to do
than hang around a chemo ward?

196
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:39,532
Bryce, you're my friend.

197
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,742
You're crazy if you think
I'm gonna let you alone.

198
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,960
I appreciate
what you're doing, but...

199
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:46,872
I don't want you
to see me like this.

200
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,583
Is this about your pride?

201
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:51,252
- A little bit, yeah.
- Hello, it's me.

202
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,672
You've glued pennies to the wall
with my lunatic mother.

203
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,945
I think we've both seen
behind the curtain.

204
00:11:57,703 --> 00:11:58,467
Besides,

205
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:01,455
the chemo's gonna make you
sick as a dog in 24 hours.

206
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:04,265
So tonight let's have some fun.

207
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,729
Let's do it.
But I'm buying dinner.

208
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,109
You call SFPD?

209
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:25,031
What do you think?

210
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:33,499
- Help you guys?
- Special Agent Benford. Agent Noh.

211
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:36,422
Detective John Smith.
Yes, that's my real name.

212
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,366
- What do you need?
- What happened here?

213
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,400
Some guy from the chess club
took two in the back of the head.

214
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,387
Don't tell me. Ian McKinnon?

215
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,475
Yeah, Ian McKinnon.
Person of interest?

216
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:53,919
Not anymore.

217
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,706
Ian McKinnon was unlucky enough to play
a few games of chess back in the '80s,

218
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:07,078
and now he's dead.

219
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,594
He was our best lead on Frost,
but our leak turned him

220
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,123
into a homicide investigation.

221
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,296
San Francisco bureau
is handling the follow-up,

222
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:14,756
but I'm not expecting much.

223
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,636
How long between when you first made
contact and time of death?

224
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,112
Eight hours tops.

225
00:13:19,237 --> 00:13:20,716
There's only one conclusion.

226
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:23,685
The leak we've been tracking,
that's compromised the security

227
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,912
of the whole mosaic investigation
is inside the bureau.

228
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:28,537
Not just the bureau.

229
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,130
Inside our office.

230
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:34,054
I've been ordered
to give full agency support,

231
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,651
fresh pair of eyes,
all the rest of that crap.

232
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,297
You got a play?

233
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,364
My dad knew a guy
who used to go blast fishing.

234
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,741
He'd throw a stick
of dynamite in the water

235
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,827
and watch the fish float to the top.

236
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,495
It was ugly, but it worked.

237
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:51,872
Game on.

238
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,005
Just don't forget
who your friends are.

239
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:01,045
What's unacceptable is
that one of them is my enemy.

240
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:20,267
- Step away from your desk.
- What the hell is going on here?

241
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,523
Everyone's required to assemble
in the conference room.

242
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:24,031
On whose authorization?

243
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,581
Sorry, assistant director Wedeck.
Orders.

244
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:29,118
- Whose orders?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

245
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,311
That's not part of
the task force agreement.

246
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:34,790
No calls, and I'll need
your cell phone, please.

247
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,638
- Don't touch me.
- Sir, your phone.

248
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,654
What's going on?
Someone lose their keys?

249
00:14:58,415 --> 00:14:59,690
Simon Campos?

250
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:01,651
You're in there also.

251
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,945
I'm not really an employee.
I'm more of a visitor.

252
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,615
What is this?
I've not had my coffee yet.

253
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,007
What's this about?

254
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:32,700
Judging from the way our offices
are being torn apart,

255
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:36,310
I'd say an inter-agency task force
has been formed,

256
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:38,187
and is looking for a leak.

257
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,731
We can't just look
for the leak on our own?

258
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:44,277
I think the point is,
one of us is a mole.

259
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:52,743
And Mark?

260
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,329
Apparently already vetted.

261
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:03,337
This office has been swept.

262
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:09,719
<i>* You are the sunshine of my life *</i>

263
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:12,405
<i>* Girl *</i>

264
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:17,673
<i>* Forever you're stay in my heart *</i>

265
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,730
<i>* You are the apple *</i>

266
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,028
Tweezers.

267
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,807
There's your leak.

268
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,679
Get out.

269
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,047
It's voice-activated.

270
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,515
When your office is swept for bugs
at 4:00 AM

271
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,611
the sweepers don't make any sound.

272
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:01,464
No sound, no transmission.

273
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:05,405
You've vetted the sweepers?

274
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,653
Since the blackout,
all techs have been agency-contracted.

275
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,411
Blind assignments.

276
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:13,366
That's how you do security.

277
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:16,944
They just don't know
about the singing.

278
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,587
So who has access
to your office, Mark?

279
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,399
Everyone in that room.

280
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:32,289
Time to light the fuse.

281
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,935
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you may have deduced,

282
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,438
we're closing in on a leak
inside the FBI

283
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,139
that is hampering
the mosaic investigation.

284
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:49,110
Now, anyone want to confess?

285
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:57,034
Then it's the hard road.

286
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,745
You'll be first, Agent Noh,
as you were part

287
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,998
of the failed attempt
to contact Ian McKinnon.

288
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,260
You got anything to say about this?

289
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,500
We have to do this.

290
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:18,145
Vogel, you're a son of a bitch.
You know that?

291
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:20,975
True as that may be,
I'm working with agent Benford today.

292
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,606
I was with you the whole time
in San Francisco.

293
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,316
- You're not the mole.
- Who then?

294
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,901
- Someone in that room.
- If you don't think I'm the mole,

295
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,155
- what the hell am I doing in here?
- He has to think I suspect everyone.

296
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:35,462
Even you.

297
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,849
How long are we gonna be
stuck in here?

298
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:42,997
Good question. They've got
their whole procedure to go through.

299
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:45,666
Re-vet contact histories,

300
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,710
bureau records, computers.

301
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:50,713
That could take days. They're gonna want
to vet all of our personal files.

302
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,715
Not if they don't have passwords.

303
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,344
- You didn't give up your passwords?
- Not to my personal files, no.

304
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,055
Something on your computer
you don't want people to see?

305
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:02,425
No, I mean,
nothing that's sensitive.

306
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:03,893
I'm clean.

307
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:04,996
It's porn.

308
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:07,605
Agent Curdy, downloading
naked cheerleaders on F.B.I. time?

309
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:09,565
It's nothing like that.
It's...

310
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:13,069
It's just an R.P.G.

311
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:14,445
What?

312
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,613
It's an R.P.G.
It's a role-playing game.

313
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,478
I play "Warlocks of Avalon" online.

314
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:21,535
I'm a 7th level druid.
My name is "Argothic."

315
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:25,024
You have any special powers?

316
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,210
Cape of invisibility, lightning hammer,
elixir of life, healing.

317
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:31,997
- That's impressive.
- Yeah, it's cool.

318
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:41,514
You're next. Vreede.

319
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:44,595
Can I borrow that cape?

320
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,733
There any reason we can't get back
to work, do something useful?

321
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:57,029
Vogel found a micro-transmitter...

322
00:19:58,711 --> 00:19:59,824
In that key.

323
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:04,245
You want to be useful?
Tell me who put that in my office.

324
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,040
You think it was one of us?
That's the working theory.

325
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,544
"M"... For "Mark."

326
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:12,712
Nice touch.

327
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:16,632
- Unless it was you, Marcie.
- Can you shut up for five minutes?

328
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,693
- Want some sugar?
- I don't use sugar.

329
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,765
We're with you.
You know that.

330
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,066
Thanks.

331
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:28,853
But we're close.
We'll get him.

332
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,357
Good thing the fate of the planet
doesn't rely on Benford

333
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,875
finding the mole.

334
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,229
Son of a bitch!

335
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,440
Excuse me!

336
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,970
Koreatown's further west.

337
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:21,697
No. I'm not Korean.
I'm Japanese.

338
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,982
Either way,
you gotta get on the bus.

339
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:35,378
- You want this car to do that?
- That's the idea.

340
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:37,964
I look?

341
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,716
You look?

342
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:44,220
You look like you don't belong here,
and you don't belong under the car.

343
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:46,764
Hydraulics or nitrogen air bags?

344
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:51,519
Hydraulics.

345
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,256
Could be fracture in cylinder.

346
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,950
I can help.

347
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,485
Maybe I surprise you, yes?

348
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,907
Okay, ninja girl. But if you break
my axle, I'm coming after you.

349
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:13,309
Thank you.

350
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:21,716
This is really screwing
with my trust issues. You know that?

351
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,925
You've been through a lot, Janis.

352
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,971
I took a bullet, Mark.
And I'm seriously a suspect?

353
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,007
You have to admit that getting shot
and living makes for a perfect cover.

354
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:31,634
Screw you, Vogel.

355
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,644
I'm sure there's a reason,
but you got a number

356
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:36,301
of unaccounted personal breaks
in the weeks since the blackout.

357
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:37,940
- 13 in all.
- So?

358
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:41,747
In the three previous years
at the Bureau, you've taken precisely...

359
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:42,862
Two.

360
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:46,619
You know what I saw
in my flash-forward.

361
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:49,215
I've been going
to a fertility clinic.

362
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,870
You only had eight visits.

363
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,602
- We checked.
- So what?

364
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,715
So I went out to go buy some shoes.

365
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,634
- Come on, Mark.
- Where were you?

366
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:06,541
What is it, Janis?

367
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:11,027
Ever since the shooting, I've been
looking at everyone differently.

368
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,225
Suspicious.

369
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:15,129
Just checking up.

370
00:23:15,797 --> 00:23:18,981
- And you found something?
- Does he have to be here for this?

371
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:25,988
Marcie has a brother.

372
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,851
- We know about him.
- There's another one...

373
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:31,631
A half brother.

374
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:33,621
He's very sick.

375
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,998
He's dying in Missouri
in a full care facility.

376
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:37,875
It's expensive.

377
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:40,544
Marcie didn't name him
in any of her applications.

378
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:43,923
Those absences? I went off-site
to look into some things.

379
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,112
- You never mentioned this before.
- I was waiting.

380
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:48,177
For what?

381
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:53,391
- I was seeing if she did something.
- Marcie's paying for this care?

382
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:58,062
There was a deposit made
to an account for $50,000

383
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,644
three months ago...

384
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:01,732
Anonymous.

385
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:05,361
Okay, Janis. Thanks.

386
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,989
I don't know anything for sure.
I'm just trying to help.

387
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:11,492
- You've done the right thing.
- It doesn't feel like it.

388
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,666
You trust her?

389
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:18,404
You know what?

390
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,710
Being around you makes me
not trust anyone anymore.

391
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,638
It's gonna rain.

392
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:39,604
But we're together.
We're having a girl's day.

393
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:42,926
I don't want to have a girl's day.
I want daddy to be here.

394
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,859
Daddy wants to be here, too.

395
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,544
Then why isn't he?

396
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,779
Here's the thing, sweetie.

397
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:53,591
Daddy and I love each other
very much.

398
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,953
But most of all, we love you.

399
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:58,417
And we're always gonna be a family.

400
00:24:58,695 --> 00:25:00,865
That's never gonna change.
I promise.

401
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:04,030
Come on. Let's go for a ride.

402
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:05,880
Let's do it.

403
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,842
- Can I ride the ferris wheel?
- You want to go on the ferris wheel?

404
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:31,033
I went through Marcie's background.
She did declare her brother

405
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:32,549
in her initial application.

406
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:33,950
Janis said she didn't.

407
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:36,494
The original vetting records
were at a regional field office.

408
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:37,967
When they were routed to DC,

409
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:40,844
an entirely separate file was created.
It was easy to miss.

410
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,838
You okay?

411
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:00,351
I moved out of the house.

412
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,349
Olivia and me... we're...

413
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,525
I don't know.
I moved out.

414
00:26:08,144 --> 00:26:09,144
Sorry.

415
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:13,254
Is this about what you saw
in your flash-forward?

416
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:16,278
Partly that, partly what she saw.

417
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:19,036
Is there anything I can do?

418
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:23,254
But Marcie's still a suspect,
so keep digging.

419
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:25,844
All right.

420
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:51,068
<i>Tell your future.</i>

421
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:19,113
- Can we do that again?
- No, my love. Let'go. Let's go.

422
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,560
- Can we go again?
- No, sweetie.

423
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:38,032
Why are you following us?

424
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:39,533
Because it's my job.

425
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:42,597
I'm special agent Danforth Crowley.

426
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:45,623
Your husband assigned me to be
your security detail. Your safety

427
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,460
is his number one priority.

428
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,379
You don't know much english,
so I know you don't have a work visa.

429
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,956
I can try to get you
paid off the books.

430
00:28:05,194 --> 00:28:06,416
That's your first job.

431
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,291
Client wants more horsepower,
so we've been trying to remap the ECU.

432
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:12,581
My guys only work on carbureted
engines, so for them it's like...

433
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:14,605
Japanese.

434
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,821
German.

435
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:20,670
You said you were some big-time engineer
back in Japan.

436
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,924
Maybe you can figure this out.

437
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:25,274
It is no problem.

438
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:26,872
Yo, Emil.

439
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,666
You didn't tell us about a masseuse.

440
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:32,420
Listen up.

441
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:34,755
Cut the music.
I got something to say.

442
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,196
This is Keiko.

443
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,759
She works here now.

444
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,250
She's part of the family.

445
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:46,601
Treat her with respect,

446
00:28:47,534 --> 00:28:48,894
or we're gonna have a problem.

447
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,032
Everyone get that?

448
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,247
I'll take that as a yes.

449
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:08,690
Get to work.

450
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:12,919
Hey, it's me.

451
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,121
I just wanted to thank you
for that security detail.

452
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:18,194
It scared the hell out of me,

453
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,975
but I guess it helps.

454
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:22,199
Charlie misses you.

455
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,597
Anyway, I'm at the hospital,
so call me if you...

456
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:30,311
We need to talk.

457
00:29:33,617 --> 00:29:36,528
I swear I wouldn't bother you
if it wasn't absolutely necessary.

458
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:38,611
You literally have
the world's worst timing.

459
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:40,404
I've heard that before.

460
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:42,865
What do you want, Lloyd?

461
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:45,660
I need to know exactly what you saw

462
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:47,150
in your flash-forward.

463
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,246
I wrote a formula
on your bedroom mirror,

464
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,754
and I think it relates somehow
to the global blackout,

465
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,923
but what I saw was incomplete.
Did you see it?

466
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:56,212
I did.

467
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,213
Part of it.

468
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:01,801
I've to make a call.

469
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:04,971
After a while,
I got up from the bed.

470
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,244
Then I noticed something was written
on the mirror.

471
00:30:13,205 --> 00:30:14,716
It was written in lipstick.

472
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:18,150
Most of it was indecipherable,

473
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,724
but I did recognize this.

474
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:24,921
Halothane.

475
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,160
It's an anesthetic.

476
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,730
Quantum physics and anesthetics...

477
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:35,604
That's what Mark and I were
working on in our flash-forward.

478
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:38,529
I thought QED
meant quantum electrodynamics.

479
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:41,691
But we were... Building
a quantum entanglement device.

480
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:44,093
Good.

481
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,528
That clears that up.

482
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:49,015
- I've to be getting on with my rounds.
- Of course.

483
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,595
I don't want you to think...

484
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,036
I'm harassing you.

485
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:54,312
No, I know.
You're just trying to save the world.

486
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:56,731
Good-bye.

487
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:03,096
So you come here every single night

488
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:04,733
just in case this guy shows up?

489
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:06,699
And during the daytime.

490
00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:09,957
I know.

491
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:11,162
I know.

492
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,040
But it's the only way
I can find him.

493
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:16,834
All right. I respect that.

494
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,712
You saw your fate,
and now you're doing your thing.

495
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:22,214
When I saw my future,

496
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:23,883
it was

497
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,384
the best day of my life.

498
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:27,890
It was the first day

499
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,765
I let myself want
what was in my heart.

500
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:32,224
So like you say,

501
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:34,393
I am doing my thing.

502
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:41,442
Can I ask, what did you see?

503
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,029
Something different than you.

504
00:31:48,335 --> 00:31:49,842
Let's leave it at that.

505
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:53,412
You are kind

506
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,053
to give me a job.

507
00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:01,170
We're lucky to have you.

508
00:32:02,465 --> 00:32:03,666
Thank you, Emil.

509
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,637
You ever tried sea urchin?

510
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:09,644
No. Is it good?

511
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,808
It's like eating somebody's thyroid.

512
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:16,269
I'm sure Keiko loves it.

513
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,265
If she's the woman you love with in your
vision, you have to it eat with her.

514
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,070
This could be a problem.

515
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:23,988
What if sushi's her favorite food,

516
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:26,074
and that's all
she ever wants to eat?

517
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:29,308
Suddenly she's a Mogwai.
You're being ridiculous.

518
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:30,433
A what?

519
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,777
Never mind.

520
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,762
- What's a mogwai?
- I'm not explaining it to you.

521
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,332
Justify your metaphor, young lady.

522
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:42,699
Mogwai... You know, <i>Gizmo...</i>

523
00:32:42,824 --> 00:32:45,673
The furry creatures that turn into
gremlins if you don't feed 'em right.

524
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,758
They had dietary restrictions.
Forget it.

525
00:32:49,137 --> 00:32:52,179
It's a very nerdy metaphor.
Just shut up and read the menu.

526
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,518
I don't know.
I'm just not feeling

527
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,805
sushi tonight.

528
00:32:59,051 --> 00:32:59,812
I am.

529
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,024
I guess I can have teriyaki.

530
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:05,401
You're kind of a spoiled brat.
I never noticed

531
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,421
- that about you before.
- How dare you?

532
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,779
I have cancer.

533
00:33:09,952 --> 00:33:11,698
All right.
What do you want to do?

534
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:20,834
I'm sorry...

535
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:23,210
I don't know why...
I just did that.

536
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,191
I know why I did that, but...

537
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:28,086
It's, you're thinking
about another woman.

538
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,254
You can't just

539
00:33:30,523 --> 00:33:31,531
kiss me...

540
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:33,095
In little Tokyo,

541
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,211
- no less.
- Yeah, I know.

542
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:37,566
I'm sorry. It's just...

543
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:41,254
You're great.

544
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:43,758
Honest mistake.

545
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:46,465
Just buy me a burger,
and we'll call it even.

546
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:47,828
Deal.

547
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,084
- Good morning, Keiko.
- Morning.

548
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:05,253
Too much sake?

549
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:08,464
Next time we have tequila.

550
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:11,217
How's it going?

551
00:34:11,655 --> 00:34:13,719
This car will go very fast.

552
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:17,640
We need a little more horsepower. We're
not trying to launch it into space,

553
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,558
- you know?
- Immigration!

554
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,227
I.C.E. Nobody move!

555
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,187
- Hands behind your heads!
- Do what I do.

556
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,523
Hands behind your head!

557
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:32,995
Now! Do it now!

558
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:38,362
You Emil Gutierrez?

559
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,789
You're under arrest for employment
of undocumented workers.

560
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,250
What's your name?

561
00:34:46,345 --> 00:34:47,503
Do you have an I-9?

562
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:49,243
I-9?

563
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:51,747
Surprise, surprise.

564
00:34:52,498 --> 00:34:54,093
Load 'em into the van. Let's go.

565
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:26,315
It's me. Listen,
I had a great time last night...

566
00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:29,921
and I'm sorry about kissing you.

567
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:36,451
Actually, I'm not.

568
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,490
I'm glad. So...

569
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,225
Anyway...

570
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:55,071
They've been in there

571
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,239
36 hours.

572
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,323
Got anything?

573
00:35:57,594 --> 00:36:00,747
All of marcie's background has been gone
through by vogel's people already...

574
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:03,454
Financials, phone records,
background checks up the wazoo.

575
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,505
I'm doing surveillance tagging
right now.

576
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:09,335
This surveillance tech isgood.

577
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:15,675
Wait.

578
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:17,232
Go back.

579
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:18,775
Go back there.

580
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:23,557
How many times does she have coffee?

581
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:26,571
She has coffee most of the time.
Why?

582
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,591
She doesn't use sugar.

583
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:42,122
Give me time stamps for every time
she put sugar in her coffee.

584
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:47,951
Each of these time stamps
corresponds to a day

585
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:50,126
a key piece
of information was leaked.

586
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:57,717
Look at that.

587
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:02,680
No one knew about the pigeon,
Utah, trip...

588
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:04,724
Crap!

589
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:10,229
Or the Somali intel

590
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,879
that triggered the attack
in Washington.

591
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:21,115
Every time she put sugar
in her coffee,

592
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:23,200
she was signaling her handlers.

593
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:40,426
Marcie, what you doing?

594
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,347
Down! Everybody down!

595
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,610
- Go!
- Cut her off at the stairs!

596
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:52,206
Hold fire, hold fire.

597
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:11,168
Get her out of here.

598
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:14,312
It looks like you were right, Janis.

599
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:16,887
I wish I wasn't.

600
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:34,470
- You could have let me in on it.
- I couldn't say anything.

601
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,334
- Orders.
- You told Demetri.

602
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:37,787
It was discretionary.

603
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:39,670
I need people in that room.

604
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,795
So I was manipulated
for the greater good.

605
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,166
Queen sacrifice...

606
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,300
Frost's play.

607
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,595
- How'd you know about that?
- We all have our ways, Mark.

608
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:56,161
<i>Agent Benford. Dyson Frost.</i>

609
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,884
<i>Don't speak. Just listen.</i>

610
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:00,943
<i>I haven't come forward since all
your leads end up dead.</i>

611
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:03,251
<i>But now that your mole problem
has been fixed,</i>

612
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:06,228
<i>I look forward to meeting you.
I'll be in touch.</i>

613
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:15,621
You were quite the hero today.

614
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,735
I like a woman who knows how
to handle a firearm.

615
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,235
Fanca drink?

616
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:25,383
I'm not really your type.

617
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:29,934
I think you'd be surprised
to learn exactly what my type is.

618
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:35,142
I reviewed your uncle
Teddy's autopsy x-rays.

619
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,570
The CPR you gave him
was quite aggressive.

620
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:40,820
Could have even been
the cause of his death.

621
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,542
Yeah, I...

622
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:44,110
can be quite a tiger.

623
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,322
You murdered him to send a message.

624
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,744
Message received.

625
00:40:56,761 --> 00:40:58,226
I should have known.

626
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,652
A double plant.

627
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,784
Two moles,

628
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,198
in case one is caught

629
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:07,554
brilliant.

630
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:11,526
And not one person in the office
would suspect it's you.

631
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:13,534
Not one.

632
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,917
Well, that would be the point,
now, wouldn't it?

633
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:21,022
