1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,426
In my flash-forward, I was in my office.
It was 10:00 on the hour,

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,429
and I happened to see the date...
April 29, 2010.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,264
Oh, my God. This is it. We're here.

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,601
- How's it going?
- Struggling with the equation.

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,437
The equation? Yeah, you do the math.

6
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:23,983
You do the numbers together,
and you're both part of the equation.

7
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,191
What's your name?

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,111
We have a shift down
at immigration tonight.

9
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,211
- I have something I have to tell you.
- Me, too.

10
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,072
We're here now.
This is all that matters.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,782
I want to be with this baby.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,201
- Don't do anything.
- What if I don't want to walk away?

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,662
I'm gonna be on this plane.
I'm hoping you will be, too.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,440
We ran this gait analysis
on Simon Campos and on suspect zero.

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,209
Simon Campos is suspect zero.

16
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,086
- Who's Hellinger?
- It's our boss.

17
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,255
Face down! On the floor!

18
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,881
Simon campos... is he here?

19
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,176
No, Janis. I need your help.

20
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,686
Mommy!

21
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:06,440
Sweetie!

22
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,404
It's okay. Deep breaths.

23
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:14,365
You're okay. You're okay.

24
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,491
What happened?

25
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:17,451
I had a bad dream.

26
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:18,936
You did?

27
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:20,496
It's okay.

28
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,166
Today's the day.

29
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,825
But you know what?

30
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:36,590
It's gonna be all right.
I'm right here.

31
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,053
Today's the day daddy's gonna die.

32
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,020
-= Blackout Team =-

33
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,323
Saison 1 - Épisode 21
-= Countdown =-

34
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,035
You work with my security detail,

35
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,038
so you know what will happen
when everyone finds out

36
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,203
that the mad scientist was awake
when the rest of the world was asleep...

37
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:08,492
- I'll be a dead man.
- What do you want, Simon?

38
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,599
I want revenge.

39
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:16,174
I want to destroy the people who are
responsible for the global blackout.

40
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:18,193
Look, they're cornered now.

41
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,071
We have Hellinger in custody.

42
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:21,557
You, of all people,

43
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,851
must know it goes beyond one person.

44
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:25,854
I want to get back at them.

45
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:28,147
- And who are they?
- I don't know,

46
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,900
and they had me install a piece
of software into the mainframe

47
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,979
to make the accelerator fire
on October 6th.

48
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,656
We've been over that system
a thousand times,

49
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,492
- and we didn't find anything.
- I designed it.

50
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,494
I'll find something
other people won't.

51
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,090
Let me bring you
to the bureau, Simon.

52
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:46,877
- We can help you.
- I can't do this...

53
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:50,539
with the FBI.
I can't do this with the CIA contacts.

54
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:53,756
Those people won't let me anywhere
near the mainframe again.

55
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:57,774
Look...

56
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,931
You get me into NLAP,
I'll turn myself in.

57
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:05,453
Why did you start working
for these people in the first place?

58
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:07,478
I was a kid...

59
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,565
Told me I was destined
for greatness.

60
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:14,527
I believed them.

61
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,974
That was a marathon night,
but we did it.

62
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,004
We got Hellinger.

63
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,243
Yeah, we did it.
It's not the end, though.

64
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,145
Got a full morning
with the digital forensics guys.

65
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,581
No, you don't.
You got a flight to catch.

66
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,016
Here.

67
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,771
- What the hell is this?
- That, my friend,

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,673
is 15 covers of
"Islands in the stream."

69
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:40,061
There's my morning jacket, Feist,
the Constantines,

70
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,680
- some band from Croatia...
- when the hell did you make this?

71
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:45,182
Yeah, I don't get much sleep.

72
00:03:48,617 --> 00:03:50,753
You're alive.
In the future you saw, you weren't.

73
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,264
Go to Hawaii. Go be alive.

74
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,109
Are you kidding? It's d-day.
We need all hands on deck.

75
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:58,362
The place is packed with CIA, FBI, NSA.
We're covered.

76
00:03:58,756 --> 00:03:59,468
Go.

77
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:02,170
Pick a version you like.
Dance with your bride.

78
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,411
- What's up?
- Nothing.

79
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,315
Everyone gets cold feet, Dem.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,124
It's not cold feet.

81
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,358
Do you love her?

82
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:14,762
Come on.

83
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:18,511
Do you want to marry her?

84
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:20,538
Hell, yes.

85
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,271
So what's stopping you?

86
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:25,514
You know,

87
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,958
even with the way
everything went down...

88
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:31,324
Even though I lost her...

89
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:35,313
Marrying Olivia
was the best thing I ever did.

90
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:39,612
Don't be afraid,

91
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,198
especially on a day like this.

92
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,770
You'll stay home from school
today with me, sweetie.

93
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,337
- Hello?
- <i>Hey. It's me, Lloyd.</i>

94
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,045
<i>Hey, Lloyd. Can I call you back?</i>

95
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,966
No, there's no need.
I was just...

96
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,204
- <i>I wanted to talk about tonight.</i>
- You know,

97
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:05,067
<i>I really can't think
about that right now.</i>

98
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:06,305
Is everything okay?

99
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,349
Charlie's having a really hard time.

100
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,567
<i>I'd really like for us
to be together.</i>

101
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,729
I'll call you back, okay?

102
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,316
Sweetie.

103
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:23,864
Where's Demetri?

104
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,325
He's taking care of something else.
What do we got?

105
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,469
Hellinger invested big

106
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,153
in dot-coms in the early '90s,
then dumped them before the crash.

107
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,170
He put those earnings
into real estate.

108
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:36,590
- Got out at the height of the market?
- Every transaction.

109
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,350
He bought low, sold high.

110
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:39,609
Future-casting.

111
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:43,676
They use the flash-forwards to determine
the outcome of a particular event,

112
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,303
then put money on a sure thing.

113
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,014
So was this the bigger conspiracy
you were talking about in Hong Kong?

114
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,410
Because it sounds like Econ 101.

115
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:52,685
Imagine how you could
use this technology

116
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,440
to manipulate geopolitics.

117
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:56,865
NSA just finished up with Hellinger.

118
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,817
It's been eight hours,
and he just said his first six words...

119
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,362
"I'm only speaking to Mark Benford."

120
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,037
Finally.

121
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,360
We need to talk.

122
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:24,800
Did you cause the global blackout?

123
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,136
We actually have something
more pressing that has to do with you.

124
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:30,689
Did you cause the global blackout?

125
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,852
Yes, I caused the blackout.
But that really doesn't matter now.

126
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,925
- We can't change that.
- How'd you do it?

127
00:06:37,203 --> 00:06:39,815
I've seen today more times
than I can remember.

128
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:43,334
And a lot of those days started with me
sitting right here with you.

129
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:45,799
May I?

130
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,368
- This?
- Please

131
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:54,947
Thank you.

132
00:06:58,078 --> 00:07:01,116
There are so many possibilities...

133
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:03,130
Different paths this day could take.

134
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:04,711
I have seen...

135
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,511
so many different versions
of this moment...

136
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:11,756
And the next one and the next one.

137
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,611
But in every version
of the future I saw...

138
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:20,147
I saw this.

139
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,488
In this room,

140
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,070
you will lose control.

141
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:28,575
And then you'll lose everything.

142
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,410
You're going to attack me, Mark.
You're going to attack me

143
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,246
because you realize you will never
get the answers to your questions.

144
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:36,791
And then...

145
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,589
at the end of it all,

146
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:42,420
you'll be killed in your office.

147
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:54,894
When's the next blackout?

148
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,685
I've seen how this goes, Mark.

149
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,521
If you keep me in custody,
you will die.

150
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:04,430
I'm sorry. You drew me a picture,
and now you want me to let you go?

151
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:07,021
I know it seems self-serving, but...

152
00:08:07,146 --> 00:08:09,504
please, you have to believe me.

153
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,036
This is your life.

154
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,120
Tell me how you did it

155
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,647
and how to stop it
from happening again.

156
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,290
If you're not interested
in saving your own life,

157
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,497
I don't have much to say to you,
Agent Benford.

158
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:33,387
That's all right.
You just told me what your next move is.

159
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:35,765
Mind if I take this?

160
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,403
You know we're kicking civilians out
at noon, right?

161
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,406
Yeah, I was just packing up my stuff
so I could carry on working at home.

162
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

163
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:57,242
That symbol. What is it?

164
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:00,456
The tachyon constant.

165
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:04,502
A theoretical number that physicists
have been trying to crack for centuries,

166
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,796
sort of a holy grail thing.

167
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:09,533
It was on these blueprints
that Dyson Frost was carrying.

168
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:10,675
It was in the...

169
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,761
formula in my flash-forward.

170
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,439
At 10:00 tonight,

171
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:17,266
I was supposed to be on the verge
of cracking something monumental.

172
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,809
That would certainly qualify.

173
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,852
I don't know if this helps,
there it is again.

174
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:23,854
Lucas Hellinger drew this.

175
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,941
He included that symbol
as something his side is gonna do today.

176
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,818
I want to beat him to the punch.

177
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,904
So what the hell is a tachyon wipe?

178
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,906
Nothing. Doesn't make any sense.

179
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,868
The tachyon's a particle.
You can't wipe it.

180
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:40,118
You literally can't even touch it.

181
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:45,775
- Hey.
- Hey.

182
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,086
Happy flash-forward day.

183
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,239
I know you love these.
They're for you.

184
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:50,902
Thanks.

185
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,253
I was just thinking about you.

186
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,093
Liar.

187
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,766
Seriously. Check it out.

188
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:02,018
I haven't planned out
everything for tonight,

189
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,646
but I thought maybe we could start
with some water polo.

190
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:08,133
We could bob for apples,

191
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,875
maybe finish off
with some scuba diving.

192
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:16,991
Yeah. Keiko.

193
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,036
Are you sure that you're okay
with tonight?

194
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,503
With us?

195
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:25,833
So the sweet, sexy woman
that brings me cupcakes...

196
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,708
worried about a pretend girl

197
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,210
who lives half a world away?

198
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,134
Come on.

199
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:50,024
Keiko-san.

200
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:21,923
<i>Attention, travelers. You are not
required to give money to solicitors.</i>

201
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,891
<i>The airport does not sponsor
their activities.</i>

202
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,340
Hi.

203
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:30,147
Oh, baby.

204
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,817
I knew you'd come.

205
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:33,989
Oh, my god.

206
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,122
So my parents are already
at the hotel,

207
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,576
and they said that there's a hot tub
in the room.

208
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,912
Do you remember when
we had a hot tub?

209
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,791
Yeah.

210
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,356
You're ready?

211
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:52,075
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,213
Okay.

213
00:11:58,213 --> 00:11:59,343
What's up?

214
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:02,477
I love you.

215
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,663
And,

216
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,783
I should have told you this...

217
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:09,854
a long time ago.

218
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,105
In Janis' vision,

219
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:17,282
she was...

220
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:18,662
pregnant.

221
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,156
For that to come true,

222
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,160
it had to happen
while she was in Somalia.

223
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:25,782
Okay.

224
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,876
I slept with Janis
so she could get pregnant.

225
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:34,879
- What?
- I know that was wrong.

226
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:38,097
I just... The future was happening,
you know

227
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:41,427
My life was ending.
Another life was beginning.

228
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,529
I know it sounds crazy, but...

229
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:48,247
I thought I was gonna die, and...

230
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,145
It made sense at the time.

231
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,544
Everything that I've been doing,
Dem.

232
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,810
All the lines that I've crossed,

233
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,041
I did everything for you.

234
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,744
I did everything I could.

235
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,077
It was because I believed that...

236
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,065
I believed that you were gonna live

237
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:19,257
and that we were gonna spend
the rest of our lives together.

238
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:21,751
Obviously, you didn't.

239
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:24,637
I am so sorry.

240
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:25,825
So sorry.

241
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,184
I just thought that our life together
was over on March 15th.

242
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,789
That's what I thought. I was wrong.
You were right.

243
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,439
You believed
that we can change the future.

244
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,364
But I want to start over.

245
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:40,146
I want to marry you.

246
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,487
Please marry me.

247
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,174
Please?

248
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:49,161
I'm gonna...

249
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:52,832
I'm gonna go to Hawaii
with my parents,

250
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:55,418
and I don't want you to come, Dem.

251
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,819
And after that...

252
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:01,836
I don't know.

253
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:09,307
Don't worry, Tracy. We made it.

254
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,614
This is where we were
in our flash-forward.

255
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:15,455
I was in a cave.

256
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,231
Jericho brought me here.

257
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,025
Honey, don't worry.
Don't try to talk.

258
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,633
She needs a hospital.
I'm not sure I can care for her here.

259
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:22,964
Her pulse is thready.

260
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,643
They made me tell them.

261
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,285
Tracy, we know what we saw.

262
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,944
You're gonna be fine, all right?

263
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:43,716
I cross-referenced Hellinger's financial
documents with the word "tachyon".

264
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:46,552
Tachyon offsite information systems.

265
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,253
Their office is in Arcadia.

266
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,869
Do you think that's what Hellinger meant
by a tachyon wipe?

267
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,238
They warehouse data.

268
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:55,603
Maybe you can't wipe a tachyon,
but data's a whole other story.

269
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,347
I'm going in with a team.

270
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,316
You sure that's a good idea?

271
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,777
Going after the bad guys? Yeah.

272
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,862
Think about it.

273
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,156
Hellinger helps organize
a worldwide blackout.

274
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,910
You really believe he'd be sloppy enough
to leave you a clue like this?

275
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:12,119
Maybe.

276
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,372
- People make mistakes.
- Forget it.

277
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,332
- What?
- You heard me. You're staying.

278
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,202
You stay on Hellinger.

279
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:21,003
I'll send a special ops unit
to check it out.

280
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,496
No. You can't do that.

281
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:24,632
I can. You're staying.

282
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,550
I'm not letting you
walk into a trap.

283
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:32,958
She's barely moving air.

284
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:34,976
Breathe! Tracy!

285
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,060
No, stop.

286
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,489
Aaron, please, let me work. Please.

287
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:43,497
You.

288
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:46,195
What the hell did you
and your Jericho buddies do to her?

289
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:51,887
You're gonna tell me
why Jericho came after my daughter.

290
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,911
I'm just an independant contractor
on a...

291
00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:00,126
She saw you guys,

292
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,760
killing an entire village.

293
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,942
I don't know
what you're talking about.

294
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:07,955
You're gonna tell me why, now.

295
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,470
We weren't killing them.

296
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:12,816
She saw...

297
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,975
an entire village full of people
passed out on the ground.

298
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,369
It was an experiment,

299
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:18,555
a test run.

300
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:19,631
For what?

301
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:24,233
Keep talking!

302
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:25,985
The experiment's radius

303
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,208
was 1 kilometer.

304
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,954
We needed to know why she was awake.

305
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,472
Experiment for what?

306
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:38,164
- For what?
- For the global blackout.

307
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,781
I hope the CIA gives you
an expense account.

308
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,633
We have to stop by a hardware store,
get some supplies on the way to NLAP.

309
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,590
Breaking into a linear accelerator,

310
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:52,303
we're gonna need
more than duct tape.

311
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:55,348
Not that kind of hardware.

312
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,768
What's going on here?
What is he doing here?

313
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,088
Tell him to put down his weapon.

314
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:09,445
What's he doing here?

315
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:11,948
He's making a deal.

316
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:18,829
You're bringing him to NLAP?

317
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,332
You're planning to let him touch
that accelerator?

318
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:24,543
He can give us more information
than anyone else can.

319
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:26,180
In the meantime,

320
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:29,131
you risk him using that machine
to put the world to sleep again.

321
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,868
I didn't use it the first time.
I'm not gonna use it this time, either.

322
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,098
This is about nailing the people
behind the blackout.

323
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,192
This is about getting the job done

324
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,132
the best way I know how.

325
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,358
Come on.

326
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:46,992
You got more to worry about
than just doing a good job.

327
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,150
Okay.

328
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:53,114
I just need you...

329
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:55,491
to pretend like you never came by.

330
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,909
Just let me do this.

331
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,348
You're gonna regret this decision
for the rest

332
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,641
of your life.

333
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,645
<i>We've secured
the tachyon data center.</i>

334
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,079
<i>All we've got
is a room full of servers.</i>

335
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,256
Has the data been wiped?

336
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:40,672
<i>No. It's weird. I'm getting nothing...
just a blinking cursor.</i>

337
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:44,186
What the hell was that?

338
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,814
<i>I don't know. It sounded
like it was coming from a storeroom.</i>

339
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:50,171
- I thought you swept the place.
- <i>We did. I'm gonna go check it out.</i>

340
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,612
<i>We're getting thermal
readings back now.</i>

341
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:55,384
Get out.

342
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:57,536
Get out of there, Agent!

343
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,430
<i>Heads up! Movement on your...</i>

344
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:01,657
<i>Watch out... 9:00!</i>

345
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:08,725
Get out of there!

346
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:29,320
Mark, wait.

347
00:19:30,357 --> 00:19:31,921
What's going on?

348
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,503
They opened fire on
three of our guys.

349
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,228
You were right. Tachyon was a trap.

350
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:39,887
- Cool down.
- No, I gotta go talk to him!

351
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,138
Cool down.

352
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,931
Don't worry.
I got this.

353
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,221
I got this.

354
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:47,346
Daddy!

355
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,724
Hey, sweetie.

356
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:56,612
You okay?

357
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:03,536
Are you?

358
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,518
It's been a slow day.

359
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:12,567
Babe, you want to go wait
in daddy's office?

360
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:17,800
I'm really sorry just bringing here
like this.

361
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,970
She's scared.

362
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,550
I think the reality of today and...

363
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:27,143
everything that's happened,
I think it's really hitting her.

364
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:33,721
She just needed her dad.
I really did not know what else to do.

365
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:37,111
I'm glad you brought her over.

366
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,963
Hey, Charlie bear.

367
00:20:57,496 --> 00:20:58,661
What's up?

368
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:01,510
I don't want you to die.

369
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:07,106
Come here.

370
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,197
I need to ask you to
do something for me,

371
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:23,574
something really, really hard.

372
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,662
Don't be afraid.

373
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:32,291
I mean, it's okay
to be afraid. It is.

374
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:34,858
But that's just what
happens at first.

375
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:38,172
After that, you have to
tell yourself something...

376
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:40,386
"my daddy loves me,

377
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,563
"and everything will be okay,

378
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,596
"no matter what."

379
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:48,184
"My daddy loves me."

380
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,341
So much.

381
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:53,646
"And everything will be okay,
no matter what."

382
00:21:57,711 --> 00:21:59,026
It's not easy,

383
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:00,956
'cause things can be scary,

384
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:03,148
bigger than us.

385
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:05,783
But we can fight it.

386
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,810
That's what I do.

387
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,378
I tell myself,

388
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:12,873
"Charlie loves me,

389
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:15,126
"and everything will be okay

390
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,530
"no matter what."

391
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:18,129
- You do?
- I do.

392
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,368
I tell myself that,

393
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:22,550
it makes me strong.

394
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,719
It makes me brave.

395
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:28,627
'Cause when I say that...

396
00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:34,895
You're always with me.

397
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,836
And when I say it?

398
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:41,694
I'm always with you.

399
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,821
Always.

400
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:47,100
I love you so much, baby girl.

401
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:51,287
I love you with everything I've got.

402
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:56,292
Thanks, honey.

403
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:06,533
You go and be with mom, okay?

404
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:07,970
You go ahead now.

405
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,043
- You're making a big mistake.
- Shut up.

406
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,095
This guy

407
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,097
has been lying to us
about everything.

408
00:23:51,454 --> 00:23:54,183
He was working for them.
He was awake during the blackout.

409
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,217
How the hell do you trust this guy?

410
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:58,396
After all the lying,

411
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:00,356
I think I've realized that

412
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,608
you just get to a point
where you can't do it anymore.

413
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:07,918
- You coming with me?
- To the FBI?

414
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:14,612
Tell 'em where you found him.

415
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:17,331
Don't lie for me.

416
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,895
This NLAP thing is insane.

417
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,246
- You know that, right?
- Yeah. I know that.

418
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,651
If I hadn't have shown up,
you'd have gone through with this?

419
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:50,981
Get in.

420
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,130
No, Dylan. Watch out.

421
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:07,298
I am watching.

422
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:09,425
It's a figure of speech.

423
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,719
I mean, be careful,
'cause somewhere in here

424
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,763
is the answer
to a very big question.

425
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:15,890
Why did the 8 die?

426
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:17,350
What?

427
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:20,853
Why did the 8 die?

428
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,274
That's not an 8.
That's infinity.

429
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:27,042
What's infinity?

430
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,028
Well, infinity means "forever."

431
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,331
But you're right, it does
kind of look like an 8 on its side.

432
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,667
All the ones with numbers
have to be together.

433
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,584
Just please,
please leave those there.

434
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:45,454
It all has to be in the right place.

435
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:49,578
What did you say?

436
00:25:49,952 --> 00:25:52,090
It all has to be in the right place.

437
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:55,096
<i>Do the numbers.
You do the numbers together,</i>

438
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:56,889
<i>you're both part of the equation.</i>

439
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,688
Go and get your coat.
Go now.

440
00:26:10,346 --> 00:26:12,097
I hope your agents are all right.

441
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:15,241
In most futures, they survive.

442
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:17,159
When's the next blackout?

443
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,245
You're not in a place
where you can hear this,

444
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,239
and I don't want to say I told you so,
but I gave you a choice, Mark.

445
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:25,293
I asked you a question.
When is the next blackout?

446
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:28,460
I gave you a choice,
and you chose the wrong path.

447
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,507
I'm sorry the way this is turning out.
I mean it when I say that.

448
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,431
But there is nothing you can do.

449
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:35,386
Shut up! When is it?

450
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,762
You're going to die,

451
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,223
and I take no pleasure in that.
I really don't.

452
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,143
I've had so many conversations
with you in this very room.

453
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:44,102
You're a decent man.

454
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:45,896
This is just all over your head.

455
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:48,524
When is the next blackout?

456
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:52,786
You work hard.

457
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,031
You're passionate about what you do.

458
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,240
But don't you see?

459
00:26:56,642 --> 00:26:59,035
All of this is just so futile,
all of it.

460
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,746
All of it?
We caught you.

461
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,168
Your faith... it's admirable.

462
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,010
I mean, that board in your office...

463
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,508
How much time have you spent
on that thing?

464
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,510
How much time have you spent
looking at it,

465
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:17,846
all on faith?

466
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,514
Deep down, you've gotta
know what that board really is.

467
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,725
Tell me. What is that board about?

468
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:25,353
It's nothing
but a scrapbook of your failures.

469
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:29,774
Tell me when the next blackout is.

470
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:32,234
A freed nazi,

471
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,724
a botched mission to Somalia,
some monster paintings, dead birds...

472
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:37,573
- Tell me.
- And you keep looking at it.

473
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:40,701
You keep believing, you keep fighting
'cause that's what you do.

474
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,038
You and that board,
you're Mr. Stick-to-it. Don't you see?

475
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:46,124
That's why you're gonna die, Mark.

476
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,092
You just don't give up. You just...

477
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:58,277
I swear to God, Mark,

478
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:00,337
I am gonna miss you.

479
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:06,602
Charlie's gonna miss you, too.

480
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,731
You are gonna die, Mark.

481
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:14,443
You're gonna die,
but there is an upside.

482
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:17,489
And this is gonna sound a lot
harsher than it really is.

483
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:21,734
Deep down, you know what I mean.

484
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:24,621
You're going to die.

485
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:28,416
But your daughter's going to be
better off when you're gone.

486
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:46,976
I'm not finished!

487
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,062
Let go of me!

488
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:56,609
Clean yourself up, playboy.

489
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:18,257
Get him out of here.

490
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,052
You're kidding me.

491
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:24,472
You've been on the brink
of losing control all day...

492
00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:26,036
all year.

493
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,863
- That crazy son of a bitch...
- Out, now.

494
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:31,103
I don't care what day it is.
Get him out of here.

495
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:33,404
- Get out.
- You can't do this to me!

496
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:35,323
You're not gonna do this!

497
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,494
We are gonna have
so much fun tonight.

498
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,812
I promise.

499
00:29:49,937 --> 00:29:51,582
I was looking forward to a picnic.

500
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,084
That's what we're doing.

501
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:56,542
We gotta get there early and stake out
some good seats for the fireworks.

502
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,715
There's gonna be 2, 000 other people.
I wanted to be with you.

503
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:04,679
There's never been a night like tonight.
In four hours,

504
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,093
people are literally gonna be
deciding whether

505
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:08,808
to make their own futures happen.

506
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:10,582
I want to be witness to that.

507
00:30:11,648 --> 00:30:12,895
Why? 'Cause your future

508
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,063
didn't happen?

509
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:17,695
Where'd that come from?

510
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,240
I've just been thinking

511
00:30:19,365 --> 00:30:21,028
a lot about the visions lately,

512
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,369
and I'm...

513
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:25,984
I'm worried mine
may have already started.

514
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:27,451
You'll be with me.

515
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,346
They won't. It's not.

516
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:38,379
Nothing is gonna happen no,
to you tonight.

517
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,630
I promise.

518
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,674


519
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:42,842
Let's go.

520
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,220
It's not the drowning.

521
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,864
It's that feeling I had,

522
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,727
like I deserved it.

523
00:30:56,842 --> 00:30:58,916
I've been keeping a secret from you.

524
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:03,557
It's really stupid now, because

525
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,574
when I tell you,
you're gonna hate me.

526
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:07,961
Come on.

527
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:10,202
Give me some credit.

528
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:12,413
Keiko.

529
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,833
She's in Los Angeles.

530
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:18,537
What?

531
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:22,131
I'm sorry. I should have told you as

532
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:23,841
soon as I found out. I just...

533
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,511
I was afraid you'd choose her.

534
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:30,389
Tell me where she is.

535
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:34,038
Some people from the hospital...

536
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:37,495
they went down to this immigration
detention center in Lancaster.

537
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,648
She's in jail?

538
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:41,067
No, it's just a holding facility.

539
00:31:41,397 --> 00:31:43,110
You let her stay in... in jail?

540
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:48,040
I should have told you, Bryce.
I'm sorry.

541
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:51,028
Keiko Arahida?

542
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:56,816
There's someone here to see you.

543
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,572
<i>I need a transfer guard
at the main Gate.</i>

544
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:18,706
Her heart has stopped!
I need your help!

545
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,923
Just breathe.
Breathe, Tracy.

546
00:33:29,444 --> 00:33:31,177
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.

547
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:34,494
This can be right.
Tracy, come on back!

548
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:36,390
Come back to me, sweetheart.

549
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,821
"This is just all over your head."

550
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,990
<i>You have no idea.</i>

551
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:57,370
<i>In every version of the future</i>

552
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,245
<i>I saw,</i>

553
00:33:58,413 --> 00:33:59,455
<i>I saw this.</i>

554
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,832
<i>The forces of the universe</i>

555
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,293
<i>are maybe pushing us towards
the futures we have seen.</i>

556
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:06,507
<i>You are gonna die, Mark.</i>

557
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:08,839
<i>But there is an upside.</i>

558
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,760
<i>Deep down, you know what I mean.</i>

559
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,471
<i>Your daughter's gonna be better off
when you're gone.</i>

560
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,580
Excuse me.

561
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,900
I don't mean to bother you, but...

562
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,356
in my vision,
I had just quit drinking.

563
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:26,816
And I...

564
00:34:27,154 --> 00:34:29,591
and I'd really like to make that happen
right now.

565
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,320
See, I saw you, and you...

566
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:34,314
you look like you can use this.

567
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:37,025
Here.

568
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,302
It's okay. I don't...

569
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:40,814
What made you change your mind?

570
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,083
I don't know.

571
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,632
I get why you did it.
It worked. We have Hellinger.

572
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,149
But,

573
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:52,687
Janis, I was so pissed off at you.

574
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,733
Working for the CIA?

575
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:01,378
Since Quantico, I...

576
00:36:02,503 --> 00:36:04,460
I felt like I lost my best friend.

577
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,031
It's like I didn't know
who the hell you were.

578
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:15,961
And then I'm driving away.
I got Campos in the backseat.

579
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:19,278
I'm looking in the rearview, and
I'm thinking, going to NLAP? This is...

580
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,070
It's so like you.
I know you, Janis.

581
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,933
I don't know what

582
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:27,695
you were doing. I don't know
what we're doing tonight, but I...

583
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:29,464
I do know you.

584
00:36:40,145 --> 00:36:41,409
I told Zoey...

585
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:45,313
- About the baby.
- What?

586
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,036
There just comes a time when you...

587
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,795
You can't lie anymore, right?

588
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:06,017
We need to stop now.

589
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:08,211
She's gonna be okay!

590
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,271
Her brain has been deprived
of oxygen too long.

591
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:12,078
I know what I saw!

592
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:14,926
She's been through enough.

593
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:16,731
We were here together.

594
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,782
Her heart has stopped beating.

595
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:21,457
She's gone.

596
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:27,872
Let her go.

597
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:32,769
I saw you, Tracy.

598
00:37:59,558 --> 00:38:00,988
I like the string, buddy.

599
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:05,980
The Chinese say red string
brings luck.

600
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:08,242
The Dutch say leave me alone.

601
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,332
Maybe in my vision,
we were talking to each other.

602
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,859
You ever think about that?

603
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:18,191
Because that's not what I remember.

604
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,142
I'm sorry. I meant to call.

605
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:32,812
I'm at your house.
Why haven't you been answering?

606
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,648
I just needed to get away.

607
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,233
When you coming back?

608
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,652
Not for a while.

609
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:41,696
What are you saying?

610
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:45,066
I just need some space, Lloyd.
I need to get away from you

611
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:47,886
and Mark and flash-forwards
and all of it.

612
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,204
- I need to get away.
- <i>No, Olivia, listen to me.</i>

613
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,984
Look, certain conditions
have to be met if I...

614
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,877
At 10:00 PM,

615
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,172
-<i> you have to be here with me.</i>
- Don't make this about fate.

616
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,966
<i>Don't make this about freewill,</i>

617
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,352
okay?
I have Charlie to think about.

618
00:39:04,903 --> 00:39:07,727
<i>So I am not gonna be
in that house with you tonight.</i>

619
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:09,790
I'm sorry.

620
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:15,685
They're not coming back.

621
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:27,017
Yeah, no, I'm sure it was you.

622
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,138
Cheap suit and the...

623
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,185
The bad breath and the droopy eyes.

624
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:34,892
And I kept saying,
"hey, man, why are the eyes so droopy?"

625
00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:37,838
That's it?

626
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:40,521
Is that the best you can do?

627
00:39:41,658 --> 00:39:43,090
So you're one of those guys.

628
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:45,514
- Am I?
- Yeah.

629
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,839
You're fightin' fate,

630
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:49,472
and it's so sad, man.

631
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:52,796
'Cause it's so obvious, man,
you've already lost.

632
