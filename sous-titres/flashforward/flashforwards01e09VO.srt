1
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:10,781
On March 15th, 2010,
<i>you are going to be murdered.</i>

2
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:13,688
- Your briefing said who killed me?
- I have to end this call now.

3
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:15,125
My daughter's alive.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,319
She saw something she shouldn't have...
<i>and got in trouble with Jericho.</i>

5
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:20,723
<i>The second that Jericho
knows that I'm still alive,</i>

6
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:22,378
they'll kill me.

7
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:25,148
N.S.A. sent back
a new rendering of Suspect Zero.

8
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,192
- What's on his hand?
- A ring?

9
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:29,563
This morning,
I was thinking  committing suicide.

10
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:32,339
- My God.
- Everything's changed for me now.

11
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,377
- Who's she ?
- <i>She was in my vision.</i>

12
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,599
In my flash-forward,
I saw this symbol.

13
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:38,454
- It's a letter.
- What's it mean?

14
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,083
"Believe."

15
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,245
See there,

16
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:46,992
there...

17
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,148
- and there.
- It's metastasized.

18
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:54,486
To the liver.

19
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:57,364
No sign of it in the lungs or bones?

20
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:02,028
We hoped this treatment
would have stopped the growth.

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,329
It doesn't seem
to have had an effect.

22
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:07,025
What about hormone therapy?

23
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:09,797
You're stage four.

24
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:13,092
It's not likely to do much
except make you feel lousy.

25
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:15,581
I...

26
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:17,976
I feel all right now.

27
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:20,475
That's not atypical
for this type of cancer.

28
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:24,468
I'm gonna be straight.

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,397
We're running out of options.

30
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:29,663
We could try another round of chemo.

31
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:33,811
I have patients at this point
who have gotten into clinical trials.

32
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:37,144
How long have I got?

33
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:46,776
Come on!

34
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:20,473
What are you doin', man?

35
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,794
Didn't you see me?

36
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,701
I'm talking to you.

37
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:33,804
What are you doing?

38
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,368
No! Come on!

39
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,263
All right. Come on!
What are you, nuts?

40
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,026
You made your point!
This is a Cherry'63 T-Bird!

41
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:53,797
I want to report a hit and run.

42
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,716
He's still hitting me!
You made your point!

43
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,050
All right. Okay.

44
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:01,489
It's all right.

45
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,230
You are so dead, man.

46
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,828
You hear me?

47
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:10,856
You're dead!

48
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,404
"Believe"

49
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:07,904
Dr. Varley,
she's oozing an awful lot.

50
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:10,851
What was her platelet count,
hemoglobin and coags preop?

51
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,980
I'm sorry. Her platelets were...

52
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:19,560
Platelets 80,000, hemoglobin 10.5.

53
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:22,848
- Looks like a cirrhotic to me.
- Is she a drinker, Dr. Varley?

54
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,760
Sorry...

55
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:26,981
Come on, Bryce.

56
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,031
Maneesh, I'm gonna need some F.F.P.

57
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:31,162
and 2 units of
packed red blood cells

58
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:32,683
as soon as you can get 'em.

59
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,834
She's oozing everywhere we cut.
Send a D.I.C. panel

60
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,568
and hang a banana bag
with two grams of mag.

61
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:52,391
Dr. Benford, I'm sorry.

62
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,098
You need to think seriously

63
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:02,932
about whether or not you're
committed to this profession.

64
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:37,737
I don't know where I belong.
I'm not a very good doctor.

65
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:40,545
I never have been, really.

66
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,543
It wasn't what you wanted?

67
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:45,586
I don't know what I want.

68
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,599
I just...

69
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,427
did it.

70
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:55,933
<i>And now I'm here.</i>

71
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:58,919
Have you told your family,

72
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:01,063
your colleagues about your illness?

73
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:04,450
My family's been through enough,
Dr. Flemming.

74
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,504
<i>With my dad dying of
lung cancer for three years...</i>

75
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:10,989
It was a nightmare.

76
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:12,658
What about your colleagues?

77
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,438
- Surely they would understand.
- I don't want their pity.

78
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,550
Pity ?

79
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:22,209
You need support. That's
what's gonna get you through this.

80
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:24,487
Nothing is gonna
get me through this.

81
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,422
My diagnosis is terminal.

82
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,800
You don't know
what the future holds.

83
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:32,686
None of us do, really.

84
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,634
Your job is to take care of yourself

85
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:39,146
to try and have the best life
you can for as long as you can.

86
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:43,001
Live each day
doing what feels right.

87
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:14,608
<i>You're really here.</i>

88
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,021
<i>Pleased to meet you.</i>
Hajimemashite.

89
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:38,594
<i>Please speak more slowly.</i>

90
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,658
Yukkuri hanashite kudasai.

91
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,497
<i>What's your name?</i>
O namae wa nan desu ka?

92
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,075
<i>I love you.</i>
Suki desu.

93
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:58,852
<i>Please sit down.</i>
Okakekudasai.

94
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:02,899
<i>How are you feeling today?</i>

95
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,793
Gokigen ikada desu ka?

96
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,019
<i>I hope you are well...</i>

97
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,212
<i>Can you give me the directions?</i>

98
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:23,813
<i>I am lost.</i>

99
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,448
Michi ni mayotte imasu.

100
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:30,099
<i>Who are you?</i>

101
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:33,043
Anata wa dare desu ka?

102
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,632
<i>What do you want?</i>

103
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:38,808
Nani o omotome desu ka?

104
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,616
Hey, how is Tracy?

105
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:57,534
She's...

106
00:12:58,436 --> 00:12:59,695
She's pretty shut down.

107
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,036
<i>Terrified Jericho's</i>
<i>gonna come and find her.</i>

108
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,875
I've been looking into that for you.

109
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,042
Unfortunately,
private military contractors

110
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,711
like Jericho and Blackwater
are harder to break into

111
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,129
<i>than Fort Knox.</i>

112
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:20,924
- That's what I was afraid of.
- <i>But this outfit's headquartered</i>

113
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,029
<i>in Santa Monica,</i>
<i>right in our own backyard,</i>

114
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:28,449
<i>working out of the Burroughs Foundation</i>
<i>for International Peace...</i>

115
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,717
<i>Some kind of think tank.</i>

116
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:34,354
- Think tank?
- Yep.

117
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,875
It's gonna take a higher
security clearance than I have

118
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,275
to get much beyond that.

119
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,578
Hold on a sec.

120
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:41,510
Livvie, your phone's ringing.

121
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:43,447
<i>- Can you get it?
- I gotta go.</i>

122
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,698
I'll put out

123
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,436
<i>some more feelers, all right?</i>

124
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,405
Who is it?

125
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,912
Who was it?

126
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,472
What is this?

127
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,848
It's this weird text I got.

128
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,528
Who sent it?

129
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:14,421
I have no idea.

130
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:16,581
Do you...

131
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:19,983
figured you...
you wouldn't mention it?

132
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,403
You already told me about the drinking.
Before I got a chance to bring it up.

133
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:25,065
Since we talked about it,

134
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,199
that didn't seem
like such a big deal.

135
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,448
I gotta get dressed.

136
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,229
- Nice job with that tension pneumo.
- Thanks.

137
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:46,457
You okay?

138
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,415
You look sick.

139
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,217
- I'm okay.
- Come here.

140
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,170
I'm all right.

141
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,003
You're not febrile,
but you're really pale.

142
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:00,026
Go home.
Cynthia will cover your shift.

143
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:01,983
I'm gonna be okay.
I just need a minute.

144
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:04,582
Come here.

145
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:06,872
Come sit.

146
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,060
- You look terrible.
- I'm just tired.

147
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:15,449
Graphia says you almost passed out
during grand rounds last week.

148
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,457
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

149
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:23,421
- We don't need to do that.
- Come on.

150
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,068
Why do you have a central line?

151
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,990
It's for the chemo.

152
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:38,003
Chemo?

153
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,482
I have...

154
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:45,442
renal cell carcinoma.

155
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:48,155
Stage four.

156
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,077
How long have you known?

157
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,348
About a year.

158
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,875
Had my kidney out
just before I started here.

159
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,659
This is why you tried
to kill yourself...

160
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:12,284
I was terrified.

161
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:15,995
I didn't think that I could
face the prospect of dying.

162
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:19,849
I didn't want to put
my family through that.

163
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,193
I can't believe you...

164
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,194
have been going through this alone.
I can't believe I didn't see it.

165
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,851
It hasn't been that bad so far.

166
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:34,075
It's rough for a few days after
chemo, but then I bounce back.

167
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,494
Anyway, since the blackout,

168
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,279
things are different now.

169
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:40,262
I'm gonna be okay.

170
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,892
I've got something to live for.

171
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:54,070
It's hot.

172
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:57,942
I forgot the cheese.

173
00:16:58,377 --> 00:16:59,671
I don't need the cheese.

174
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:03,088
This smells great.

175
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:06,025
When I was in the military,
this crazy staff sergeant in my detail

176
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,208
made the best food
I ever threw a lip on.

177
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:25,542
What?

178
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,754
I can't do this.

179
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:28,964
Do what?

180
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:35,540
Have you drinking here.

181
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,417
It's just a glass of wine.

182
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,743
Doesn't matter. A glass of wine...

183
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,758
or a fifth of vodka...

184
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:58,162
It just doesn't work for me.

185
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:02,141
Come on, Dad. Relax.
I'm not asking you to drink.

186
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:05,309
That's not the point.
I can't be in the same room as it.

187
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,566
You understand that?

188
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:10,484
After everything I've been through,
I can't have a glass of wine?

189
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:13,336
I'm 24 years old,
and I've been through hell.

190
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:14,739
I can't have a drink?

191
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:17,778
Baby, I'm not talking about
what you can or can't do.

192
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:19,885
I'm telling you...

193
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:21,934
what I can't do.

194
00:18:25,257 --> 00:18:26,258
This is good.

195
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:35,309
Fine.

196
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,012
I'll go somewhere else.

197
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,606
The NSA's digital forensics team
uncovered this symbol

198
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,008
on Suspect Zero's ring.

199
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:52,964
Alpha.

200
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,812
And it could mean anything...

201
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:57,078
The angle of attack in aerodynamics,

202
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:00,430
the brightest star in a constellation.
Alpha is the beginning of everything.

203
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,849
If we can enhance the ring so well,

204
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,642
why can't we see his face?

205
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,532
We tried to rebuild that image from all
the various camera angles that we got.

206
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:11,275
But in one,
his skin was all blown out.

207
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,953
In another, it was
a raking profile and so on.

208
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:15,813
The ring was much easier.

209
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:18,197
It has hard edges
and a reflective surface.

210
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,366
We captured still images
as the hand moved.

211
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,828
We replaced pixels and then
built a 3-D model of it.

212
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:28,204
Frankly, we were hoping
the NSA would provide us

213
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:31,419
an analysis of the ring that
was a little more substantial.

214
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,633
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little uncomfortable

215
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,621
talking in this particular group.

216
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,344
Uncomfortable?

217
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:42,347
Look, Mrs. Levy,
we don't have time to play games.

218
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,992
I'll be blunt, Mr. Wedeck.

219
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,939
One of the members
of your Mosaic task force

220
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,187
has been red-flagged by the NSA.

221
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:51,867
What?

222
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:53,817
Who?

223
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:58,904
A couple of months ago,
our wiretapping program

224
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:03,029
intercepted a phone call whose origins
had been professionally concealed

225
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,619
to a bureau cell phone.

226
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:06,246
Whose phone?

227
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:10,124
Agent Noh's.

228
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:12,752
Since when do you guys
wiretap the FBI?

229
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,879
Homeland Security
is the number one priority.

230
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,840
- Homeland Security...
- Wait a minute.

231
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,061
Maybe it's the call...
your call from the woman.

232
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,655
- About your murder.
- Right.

233
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,142
Are you saying that you have
a recording of that call?

234
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:30,520
How do I get it?

235
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,857
I'm sorry. It's classified SIGINT...
signals intelligence.

236
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,145
The woman who made that call told me
I was gonna be murdered on March 15th.

237
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,374
I'm running out of time,
so if you have any information

238
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,406
on who that was
or why I'm going to be killed...

239
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,463
- I'm not authorized to give...
- Come on!

240
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:47,327
Call whoever you need to call
to make it happen then!

241
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,854
How about that, Ms. Levy?

242
00:20:58,043 --> 00:20:59,465
Let me make a call.

243
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,176


244
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:11,392
<i>Benjwa...</i>

245
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,973
<i>doko...</i>

246
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:15,600
<i>Desu ka</i> Los Angeles?

247
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:18,594
You just said
"Where is the toilet, Los Angeles?"

248
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,227
Let me see that book a sec.

249
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:26,279
It's so cool you're learning a language
for someone you haven't even met.

250
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,738
But I am gonna meet her.

251
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,741
I know it.

252
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,162
I'm hearing myself,
and I sound crazy.

253
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:36,773
But it's a good kind of crazy.

254
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:38,435
Love crazy.

255
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:41,377
You think?

256
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:50,562
Hey.

257
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:52,889
- Didn't see you there.
- Yeah, I came in late.

258
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:54,791
Yeah? What's up?

259
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:56,800
I'm really struggling, Aaron.

260
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:00,524
Things were going great at home,

261
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:02,648
or better at least.

262
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:04,684
Then this thing happened.

263
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:09,072
Someone sent Olivia a text, telling her
I was drinking in my flash-forward.

264
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:10,990
Who would do that?

265
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,308
I don't know.

266
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:16,512
I only told two people.
It's kind of freaking me out, you know?

267
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:18,873
That's weird.

268
00:24:25,758 --> 00:24:27,590
You trying to say
something to me, Mark?

269
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:29,846
Like I said,

270
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,021
I only told two people.

271
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:45,441
Do you know how many hours
I've spent listening to your crap,

272
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:47,692
your doubt, your self-pity?

273
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:50,143
- I thought you were my sponsor.
- That's right.

274
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:52,490
That doesn't mean
I'm your punching bag.

275
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,386
I think I have the right to ask you

276
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,454
if you're communicating
with my wife behind my back.

277
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,909
You son of a bitch.

278
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:04,674
After all the time
we've known each other,

279
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:06,752
you think I would do that?

280
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:11,595
- I don't know what to think anymore.
- You don't know.

281
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:27,781
Don't know.

282
00:25:29,164 --> 00:25:30,740
Here's some food for thought.

283
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,390
Why don't you get a new sponsor?

284
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:36,075
Someone you can really trust.

285
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,458


286
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:43,204
- Got it.
- What?

287
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:44,879
Demetri's phone call.

288
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,503
I'm taking it down
to audio forensics right now.

289
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,984
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

290
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,002
Did you send Olivia a text?

291
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:56,545
Your wife?

292
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,891
- Why would I send your wife a text?
- Well, someone did.

293
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:04,579
Telling her I was drunk
in my flash-forward.

294
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,422
You're one of only
two people I've told.

295
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:14,298
So?

296
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:15,501
So as...

297
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:20,881
I recall you were pretty pissed
that I was drinking and...

298
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:24,205
the implications that had
for our investigation.

299
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,793
Oh, I see.
You were thinking I was...

300
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:31,559
so angry and so petty that I'd run out
and text your wife about it?

301
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:37,280
Get out of my office, Benford.
I don't wanna see your face right now.

302
00:27:48,614 --> 00:27:51,218
Your accent is really improving,
Dr. Varley.

303
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:59,885
If nothing else, I'll come out of this
having learned a second language.

304
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:03,313
So how's the search
for your young woman?

305
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:05,695
Well, no response
to my Mosaic posting yet,

306
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,810
but I did finish my drawing.

307
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,328
You wanna see it?

308
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:13,224
She's quite beautiful.

309
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,944
I was thinking
about posting it on the web.

310
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,696
At least you know
where she likes to eat.

311
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:20,926
What do you mean?

312
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,032
Sushi Arahida.

313
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:25,606
It's a restaurant in Tsukuba.

314
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:27,246
Not that far from Tokyo.

315
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,409
I taught at the university there.

316
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,665
Is it possible there's more than
one restaurant with this name in...

317
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,753
Tsukuba?

318
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,488
I doubt it, not with this same logo.

319
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:37,965
It's a little, tiny place.

320
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:40,884
She's probably a local.

321
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:44,511
Ms. Kondo, in my flash-forward,

322
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:46,682
I was sitting
in a Japanese restaurant.

323
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,309
Maybe it's this Sushi Arahida.

324
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:50,443
- Maybe.
- Thank you!

325
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:01,058
Do you have a minute?

326
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:03,226
Listen,
maybe it's none of my business,

327
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:05,620
but I made a few calls,
did a little bit of research

328
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,859
and there really are
some good options out there.

329
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:10,339
- I appreciate...
- A friend from medical school,

330
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:13,040
who's running an experimental trial
with Trifectumab

331
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:16,962
out of M.D. Anderson in Houston.
So I made a call, and you're in.

332
00:29:18,805 --> 00:29:20,340
- Thank you.
- No. You kidding?

333
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:22,017
It's the least I can do.

334
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:23,794
Here.

335
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,539
I've read about Trifectumab.

336
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:30,309
I'm not sure
about the side effects, though.

337
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,723
We're talking about your life.
Now's not the time to be conservative.

338
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:36,096
Dr. Benford, thank you.

339
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,777
But you don't understand.

340
00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:44,476
Because of my flash-forward, I know
that I have something to live for.

341
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,535
I can't take a drug
that might kill me or make me sicker.

342
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:51,122
You're only gonna hear me
say this once.

343
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:55,136
Maybe the reason you're alive
in your flash-forward

344
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:58,504
is because you're gonna take
this drug and get better.

345
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,006
Don't give up on me.

346
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,024
Please.

347
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:04,241
Come here.

348
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:06,804
Go to Houston.

349
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,348
You need a couple of days,
take a couple of days.

350
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,238
<i>There is no delicate way
to say this,</i>

351
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:14,927
<i>but on March 15, 2010,</i>

352
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,471
<i>you are going to be murdered.</i>

353
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,501
It's even worse
hearing it a second time.

354
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:28,547
We've analyzed the ambient noise,
and we've come up with a potential lead.

355
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:31,925
- What kind of a lead?
- Listen to this.

356
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,488
<i>There is no delicate way...</i>

357
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:36,305
Now, I stripped away everything
but the background noise.

358
00:33:40,392 --> 00:33:43,062
- We found...
- You found cheesy electronic music.

359
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,869
Not just any cheesy electronic music,
my friend.

360
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,479
It's the <i>Symphony of Lights</i>,

361
00:33:48,604 --> 00:33:51,552
the world's largest outdoor
light and music show.

362
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:55,741
Plays every night,
in Hong Kong Harbour.

363
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:00,287
Wanna take a little trip?

364
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,619
I'm sorry,
but I just can't send you to China

365
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:05,763
after that C.I.A. idiot accused them
of causing the blackout.

366
00:34:05,888 --> 00:34:08,276
Relations between us
are tense enough as it is.

367
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:11,639
Look, I want to solve Demetri's
potential murder as much as anyone,

368
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:14,591
but even if she made the call
from Hong Kong,

369
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:17,517
- there's nothing to say that...
- She concealed the origins of her call.

370
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:19,184
That alone makes her a suspect.

371
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,520
We have to find out
who she is and what she knows.

372
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,699
I promise you,
I'll have our legats guy in Asia

373
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:25,764
track her down, but I need you here.

374
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:28,315
You're not going to Hong Kong.
End of story.

375
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:39,322
We're going.

376
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:41,381
What?

377
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:42,380
Hong Kong.

378
00:34:45,573 --> 00:34:47,191
Wedeck's gonna be pissed.

379
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,843
He'll get over it.

380
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:41,646
I'm sorry.

381
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:46,991
Is this your daughter,

382
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,007
Is this your daughter?

383
00:36:00,553 --> 00:36:01,742
Is this your sister?

384
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,994
They told me at the restaurant,
that she lived here.

385
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,663
Please, I came all the way
from Los Angeles. Is this Keiko?

386
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:09,500
Do you know Keiko?

387
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:11,307
Keiko, please.

388
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,144


389
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,021
I'm such an idiot.

390
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:34,144
I travel more than 5,000 miles
because of a T-shirt?

391
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,945
- <i>What was I thinking?</i>
- That you were going to find the woman.

392
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:40,197
- But I didn't.
- <i>Now you know her name.</i>

393
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,322
- That's something.
- <i>I don't know if it's her real name.</i>

394
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:46,810
I went to the university.
I went back to the restaurant.

395
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:48,789
No one can tell me anything.

396
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,375
<i>I don't know
how long I can wait, Nicole.</i>

397
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,336
<i>Maybe you're just trying to rush things
that can't be rushed.</i>

398
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:57,638
Sometimes,
you just gotta be patient.

399
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:01,296
<i>Isn't that how love works?</i>

400
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,293
Maybe,
I misinterpreted the whole thing.

401
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,180
Maybe it's just...

402
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,076
Some kind of fantasy.

403
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,618
<i>And a really good way
to run away from my life.</i>

404
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,147
Bryce, come home.

405
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:17,725
<i>Come home.</i>

406
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:50,058
Can I come in?

407
00:37:51,116 --> 00:37:52,186
What do you want?

408
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:54,521
To talk.

409
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:05,885
- I was out of line.
- Yeah, you were.

410
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,036
I've been a little stressed.

411
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,580
You think you're the only one
who's dealing with issues?

412
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:12,849
Of course I don't.

413
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,232
I know you're dealing with Tracy...

414
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:16,670
You have no idea,

415
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,015
so why don't you just
shut the hell up?

416
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:26,630
Tracy's back, but she's not
the person she used to be.

417
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:28,144
That person is dead.

418
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:32,810
- Aaron...
- No, you...

419
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:36,609
You don't get it.

420
00:38:37,707 --> 00:38:38,806
She's broken,

421
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:40,979
angry, scared.

422
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:43,274
She drinks herself to sleep,
every night.

423
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:46,023
She's a messed up alcoholic.

424
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,156
And I'm to blame...

425
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:50,285
for all of it.

426
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,935
She enlisted because
she wanted to be just like me.

427
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,723
And now she drinks.

428
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:00,804
Just like me.

429
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:05,493
There's not a damn thing
that I can do about it.

430
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:19,788
Look, we've crossed a line here...

431
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:22,283
for better or worse.

432
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:30,409
I don't think
I can be your sponsor anymore.

433
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,375
Sorry.

434
00:39:33,093 --> 00:39:34,897
But I could really use a friend.

435
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:41,270
You got it.

436
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:49,196
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles.
Enjoy your stay.</i>

437
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,021
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles.</i>

438
00:41:19,463 --> 00:41:21,228
