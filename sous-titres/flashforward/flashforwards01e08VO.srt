1
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,752
- <i>Tell me.
- It's a girl.</i>

2
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:14,095
You disappear to Los Angeles.
You don't return my calls,

3
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,139
I'm worried about you.
We all are.

4
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:19,936
I know when a man is willing
to sacrifice anything for his cause,

5
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,420
and you're not that kind of man,
Agent Benford.

6
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,523
I need a favor... a big favor.

7
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,235
<i>It's for Tracy.</i>

8
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:28,052
Hi, Dad.

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,155
What I saw, what you saw,
doesn't have to play out that way.

10
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,950
- What are you talking about?
- I found a way to change the game.

11
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:54,999
<i>Dear Celia,</i>

12
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:58,321
<i>I don't know your last name,</i>

13
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,365
<i>and I don't know where you live,</i>

14
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:04,737
<i>but I know you have two young boys.
Twins, I believe.</i>

15
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:08,361
<i>And I know you didn't have
a flash-forward.</i>

16
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,944
<i>They all saw FBI agent Al Gough,</i>

17
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,037
<i>alive and well on April 29th.</i>

18
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,903
<i>What this guywas trying to show us</i>

19
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:02,526
<i>is we can't take
what we saw for granted.</i>

20
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,225
<i>Bottom line,</i><i> this is a new world.</i>

21
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,699
<i>This is a new day, and I just think
we need to take a moment</i>

22
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,420
<i>and let that sink in.</i>

23
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:11,958
<i>What we need to have answered right now,
is the question,</i>

24
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,692
<i>is there going to be</i>
<i>another world blackout?</i>

25
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:16,372
<i>People are terrified.</i>

26
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,158
<i>Let's get back to the big question.</i>

27
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:20,156
<i>What question?
Do we have free will?</i>

28
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:23,997
<i>That's the big question,
the central question of human existence</i>

29
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,316
<i>for millennia.</i>

30
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:32,962
If this is supposed to be
your resignation, forget it.

31
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:35,959
You're not gonna let me
explain myself?

32
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:39,594
You were attacked.
You were shot.

33
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:43,848
You returned to duty to find out
a coworker jumped off a building.

34
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:46,933
Am I in the right ballpark?

35
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:50,720
My life's not making
a whole lot of sense right now,

36
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,023
and I think I need a little time off
to figure it out.

37
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,825
Understandable.

38
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,076
I need you here.

39
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:03,450
I know we've been shorthanded
since the blackout.

40
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,327
But since Gough...

41
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:09,488
Since Al...

42
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,792
- This isn't about Al.
- Yes, it is.

43
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:15,837
When I found out about what he did

44
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:17,612
and why he did it,

45
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,925
it made me think
about my own future.

46
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:23,011
 What I'm supposed to do.

47
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,301
Do I lean into what I saw?

48
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,735
Do I fight it?

49
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,949
What if my getting shot was...

50
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:33,732
I don't know. Some...

51
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:37,264
Some sort of a sign
that this baby's not meant to be?

52
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:41,114
You're gonna let a bullet decide whether
 you bring a baby into this world?

53
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,094
If Al's death proved anything,

54
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:49,734
it's that our choices still matter,

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,917
now more than ever.

56
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,654
I believe without reservation

57
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:03,234
or recrimination that your card

58
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:05,885
is the ace of spades.

59
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,857
That certainly
answers that question.

60
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:13,337
I've been wondering
how a Nobel finalist

61
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:16,477
and recipient of the MacArthur prize,
spends his idle moments.

62
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:18,563
This isn't the time or the place.

63
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:20,819
You dropped off the radar.

64
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:24,651
Without so much as a phone call.
I had to check myself into the hospital

65
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,857
to have my bruised ego X-rayed.

66
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,369
Hello, Dylan.

67
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:31,246
Remember me?

68
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,866
Why, this is not my pancake!

69
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:36,418
We're not having this discussion
in front of my son.

70
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm done having you dictate
when and where we talk.

71
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:41,966
Myhill forwarded me
the e-mail you sent him.

72
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,550
- Or the suicide note?
- It's the only logical move.

73
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,049
If you're bent on self-destruction,
I suppose it is.

74
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:49,360
I have doubts as to the cause
of the blackout.

75
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:52,016
Our experiment killed
20 million people.

76
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:53,456
20 million.

77
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:58,862
The world has been upended.
People need answers.

78
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:03,487
We have to go public and tell the world
we caused the blackout.

79
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:09,755
All right.

80
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,997
We have to leave this room sometime.

81
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:17,794
I have a reservation with
the hotel that says different.

82
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:22,089
Plus, you haven't opened
your gift yet.

83
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:24,441
What's this?

84
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:27,093
Just a little

85
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:30,059
something to celebrate.

86
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,098
What are we celebrating?

87
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:34,810
Second chances, I guess.

88
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,980
And the fact that
we can change the things we saw.

89
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,349
I never thought we couldn't.

90
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,495
That's the office.

91
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,458
I told 'em not to call
unless it was an emergency.

92
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:58,627
I promise.

93
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:03,108
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

94
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,005
This better be good, Dem.

95
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:08,593
I'm sorry.
Something came up.

96
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,976
- <i>Did you bring your laptop?</i>
- Yeah.

97
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,099
I'm sending you some video
we got from Barstow P.D..

98
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,105
<i>Remember you had Marcie plug the clues</i>
<i>off the Mosaic board into NCIC?</i>

99
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,230
-  Got something?
- Barstow P.D. caught a homicide.

100
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,399
<i>Eyewitness recorded it
on her cell phone.</i>

101
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:26,235
<i>When it hit the system,
NCIC kicked back a red flag.</i>

102
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:27,461
Why?

103
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,860
<i>Stay tuned.</i>

104
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:44,713
I'm headed back right now.

105
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,583
"Playing Cards With Coyote"

106
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,395


107
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,606
What do we have?

108
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,272
Anything that might help us
id our tattooed friend?

109
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:08,632
Not really. The victim, Neil Parofsky,
is an aeronautics engineer

110
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:10,405
who works out of a plant
in El Segundo.

111
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,903
Watch and wallet were missing,
so everybody's thinking robbery.

112
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:15,440
Is that confirmed by whoever
shot the cell phone video?

113
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:16,702
Ingrid Alvarez.

114
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,957
She saw Parofsky hand something
over before he got shot,

115
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,214
- so she thought it was a mugging, too.
- Great.

116
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,668
First day back?

117
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,518
- I should have gotten you flowers.
- They're for your wife...

118
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,560
For stitching me back together.

119
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,471
And these are for you...

120
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,640
Hard copy stills
taken from that cell phone.

121
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,828
Video forensics enhanced
the images as best they could.

122
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,115
So now we just gotta figure out

123
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:56,462
why someone would want to hit
an engineer from El Segundo.

124
00:08:57,143 --> 00:09:00,191
Have Vreede get into Parofsky's life...
Friends, family,

125
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:01,932
bank accounts, whatever.

126
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:03,440
What are we gonna do?

127
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:05,501
What was the name
of that eyewitness?

128
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,459
Ingrid Alvarez.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,458
We'll be talking to her.

130
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,301
If the guy in her video is one
of the men I saw in my vision,

131
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:14,261
this is our best lead so far...

132
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:16,013
Our only lead.

133
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,963
I'm putting him away now.

134
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,742
Find out who sent him

135
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,395
and make sure he never
shows up here on April 29th.

136
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:30,457
Al sacrificed himself to prove
we could change the future...

137
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:35,009
So let's change it.

138
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,542
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

139
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:55,135
Everything okay?

140
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,467
You're back early.

141
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,368
Mark had a work thing.

142
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:05,681
So...

143
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,447
What's going on here?

144
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:09,618
The usual.

145
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,360
You haven't been gone that long.

146
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,286
It's all right.

147
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,087
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:40,314
It's pathetic waking up
every damn morning like this.

149
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,323
Maybe if you'd just talk about it...

150
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,498
I told you.

151
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,589
I don't want to talk about it.

152
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,590
Well, I'm not giving you
a choice anymore.

153
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:56,238
I've been grieving for you

154
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,832
for two years, Trace.

155
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,753
Hell, I even had your grave
exhumed two months ago

156
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:05,080
because I was convinced
that you were alive.

157
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:21,471
If you want to keep hiding out here...
If you want me to pretend to the world,

158
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,181
your mom included,

159
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,142
that you're still dead,

160
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,561
you have to tell me what happened.

161
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,711
After what I saw
in my flash-forward,

162
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:34,901
I'd believe anything at this point.

163
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,798
Listen to me, Trace.
Four months from now,

164
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:42,006
I'm gonna be sitting
by your side in Afghanistan.

165
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,453
You saw it, and I saw it.

166
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,732
Isn't that why you came home?

167
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,209
Obviously at some point,

168
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,565
I'm gonna get involved,
whatever it is.

169
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,629
So let's just cut to the chase

170
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:55,101
and get started.

171
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:01,595
How about the Simcoe boy?

172
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,841
He was supposed to be
discharged while I was gone.

173
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,439
Not yet.
He was complaining of calf pain,

174
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:09,811
so we removed the cast, did a doppler,
and the kid's got a DVT.

175
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,104
You're kidding me.

176
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,857
I'm going to be a grandmother
before this boy goes home.

177
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,839
I don't get it. Why are you
so anxious to get rid of him?

178
00:12:17,765 --> 00:12:19,456
Is it his dad, Mr. Simcoe?

179
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:21,362
What makes you say that?

180
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:24,547
Just that you guys have
a weird relationship.

181
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:27,335
I mean, every time he comes around,
you get crazy tense, and...

182
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,413
Dr. Benford?

183
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,532
Actually, Dr. Varley just
told me about Dylan's status.

184
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,224
But what are the ramifications...

185
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:35,379
Would it be safe to leave
the boy's bedside?

186
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,221
I see here that you have him
on heparin.

187
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,174
Now the risk of complications

188
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,551
at that dose is relatively minimal.

189
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,178
- Is that correct?
- You are?

190
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,098
- Good question.
- A friend of the family.

191
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,556
Frankly, I was hoping to pry Lloyd away
from the hospital for a while...

192
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:52,104
Steak dinner, some fraternal martinis.
You could see fit to sanction that?

193
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,066
I mean, the boy is essentially
ready to be discharged,

194
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,228
if I've read his chart correctly.

195
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,014
May I?

196
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,256
Barring any complications,

197
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:12,541
I see no reason why Dylan couldn't
go home in the next couple of days.

198
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,823
Well, it's settled then. Lloyd,
you've been absolved of any guilt,

199
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:18,118
parental or otherwise.

200
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:19,768
Lovely.

201
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,092
Thank you for your help.

202
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,634
Of course. Dr. Varley.

203
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,818
Nice legs.
Are you sleeping with that woman?

204
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,146
That is none of your concern.

205
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,655
Everything you do is my concern now,

206
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,380
since you pressed "send"
on that idiotic e-mail of yours...

207
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:41,650
Which brings me to
the purpose of my visit.

208
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,017
I'm going public with or without
Myhill's cooperation or yours.

209
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:47,911
- Good luck anyone to believe you.
- Good luck stopping me.

210
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,975
It appears we're at an impasse.
There are two ways to settle this.

211
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,211
The first is so tawdry and public.

212
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,041
I make a general annoyance
out of myself,

213
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,910
kick over as many anthills
as possible...

214
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,595
Enough, Simon.

215
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,132
Or we settle this
in a more civilized manner.

216
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:03,716
Define "civilized."

217
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:06,120
Do you remember whose name go first

218
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,204
on the application
for the Sloan fellowship?

219
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:10,680
Texas hold'em, no holds barred.

220
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:13,113
You win, we go public,
hang ourselves out to dry.

221
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,614
I win, you keep your mouth shut
and your guilt in check,

222
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:17,355
and we buy ourselves some more time.

223
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,343
You want to wager
the fate of millions of people

224
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:22,460
on the outcome of a poker game?

225
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,197
The gods did it all the time...

226
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,979
Dice, chess,
whatever took their fancy.

227
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:30,746
They loved tinkering with the lives
of those mere mortals.

228
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,995
We're not gods, Simon.

229
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:36,270
20 million deaths on our shoulders.

230
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,720
Isn't that what you said?

231
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:40,061
If that doesn't qualify us
for Godhood,

232
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,190
tell me,

233
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:42,743
what does.

234
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,551
Let the games begin.

235
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,136


236
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:51,056
What's Barstow PD doing here?

237
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:54,065
Let's hope 3-star guy
didn't get to our witness.

238
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,558
Do you think
she drives a gold sedan?

239
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:02,431
Maybe not anymore.

240
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,905
Special Agent Benford, FBI.

241
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,110
Detective Rick Malchiodi,
Barstow P.D.

242
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:12,369
We think your victim might be
an eyewitness in a homicide.

243
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,704
- That's a hell of a coincidence.
- How's that?

244
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,966
Her roommate said
she witnessed a homicide, too.

245
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,649
Her roommate?

246
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:21,436
Alvarez...

247
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:23,628
Ingrid Alvarez.

248
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:24,900
Came home from work,

249
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,550
found her roommate there
double-tapped to the side of her head.

250
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:29,687
So looks like they got
the wrong roommate.

251
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,628
I believe it's to you.

252
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,691
How much do you want
to give me this round?

253
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:42,325
$2,500.

254
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:45,894
I hope you don't drag this game
out as long as the last one.

255
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,073
When you lose, you'll be able
to console yourself

256
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,583
that I've prevented you from confessing
to a mass murder.

257
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,311
Manchester figure of speech.

258
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:03,722
$2,500.

259
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:05,044
I'll call.

260
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,465
I don't understand.

261
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,519
You're saying they killed Blanca,
but they were trying to kill me?

262
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:17,396
That's what it looks like
to us, yes.

263
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,588
And it's because
of what happened in the alley?

264
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:23,623
Now, Ingrid, what exactly
did happen in the alley?

265
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,609
We have the video,

266
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,862
but it would really help us
to get your account.

267
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:33,020
I was working late,
me and one of my clerks.

268
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:36,397
<i>- Can't say I see you as a blonde.
- And I can't see you as a rock star,</i>

269
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:38,207
<i>but that's what you say
your vision was.</i>

270
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,773
I was locking up for the night.

271
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,388
<i>You want me to walk you to your car?
I mean, it's kind of late.</i>

272
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:43,454
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

273
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,422
I went to my car,
but there were men in the alley...

274
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,565
Three of them.

275
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,010
They were fighting, arguing,
but I couldn't hear what about.

276
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,723
But when it got physical, I hid.

277
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,353
I called 9-1-1,
but they put me on hold.

278
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:05,690
I still can't believe I stayed calm
enough to think to use my phone.

279
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,429
My hand was shaking so much.

280
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,327
Now you told the police

281
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,161
the victim gave the other men something
right before they shot him?

282
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,626
They were arguing
about a case or something.

283
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:26,917
But I didn't see what it was.

284
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:30,053
What about the faces of the other men?
Do you think you could describe them?

285
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,758
I didn't get a very good look,

286
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,990
but I think one of them
maybe had gray hair.

287
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:38,056
The other one was bald,
and he was big, muscular.

288
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,466
It was very dark.

289
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,434
We're gonna sit you down
with a sketch artist.

290
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:44,813
Whatever you can give us.

291
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,022
And if you can remember
anything else,

292
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,650
it could be a big help.

293
00:17:52,676 --> 00:17:55,884
As they were walking away,
they were talking about something.

294
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:57,909
It sounded like "QED."

295
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:02,328
Thank you.

296
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:18,117
You guys ever read about
that inevitability index thing

297
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,717
that's been in all the papers?

298
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,183
$5,000.

299
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,002
It's a scam...

300
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,846
Some entrepreneurial huckster's
attempt to sell us on the idea

301
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:29,315
that the odds of the future
happening can be "calculated."

302
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,817
It's all rubbish.

303
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,135
Fate is fate.

304
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,155
- We're not responsible, Lloyd.
- What about free will?

305
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,489
No such thing.

306
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,203
Since when did you become
such a hard determinist?

307
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,224
Simple quantum suicide theory.

308
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:42,537
I will win this hand

309
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,499
and every subsequent hand
we play ad infinitum. QED.

310
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,335
Don't you get tired of hearing
yourself pontificate?

311
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,722
Don't you get tired of being
a self-righteous prig?

312
00:18:52,323 --> 00:18:53,728
We're scientists, Lloyd.

313
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,859
Not attention-seeking
reality show contestants

314
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:58,178
looking for their 15 minutes
of fame on a talk show.

315
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,599
- You always do this.
- What's that?

316
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:05,999
Use intellectual argument
to defend your behavior.

317
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:06,924
What?

318
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,163
So you sleep with Cabrini's wife,
and you call it electromagnetism.

319
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:12,160
You fire your assistant
and blame it on Darwin.

320
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,119
- Shut up.
- Now you've upended the world,

321
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,031
and you hide behind
determinist rhetoric.

322
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,947
You're not the only one
who's lost someone.

323
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,165
Who, Simon?

324
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,202
Who have you ever cared about?

325
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:25,413
I'll call.

326
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:36,720
You see,

327
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,844
I knew you were bluffing
this entire time. You know why?

328
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,597
Because there's
no such thing as luck

329
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,765
or fate

330
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,017
or "there but for the grace of God."

331
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:49,229
This game is pointless.
I've already won.

332
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,387
The future's already happened.

333
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,817
Fighting it is futile.

334
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:56,772
Hey, Nicole.

335
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,238
Nicole?

336
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:00,948
You okay?

337
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:02,745
Sorry.

338
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:04,077
My mind wandered.

339
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,912
I'm guessing Mark
told you what I saw.

340
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:09,119
He did, yeah.

341
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:11,381
But only 'cause
he's worried about you.

342
00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:12,544
We both are.

343
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,117
You don't have to be.

344
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:16,005
I'm gonna be fine.

345
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:20,040
The future can change.
It's all over the news.

346
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:23,436
Crazy-huge floral delivery for the
quintuplets. Can you give me a hand?

347
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:30,435
Don't worry, Olivia.

348
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,188
We can change what we saw,

349
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:34,349
just like we could
before the blackout.

350
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,734
Everything's back
to being up to us again.

351
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,281
Dad.

352
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:52,693
My humvee got attacked.

353
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,539
Your friend Mike told me that.

354
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,791
But that was two years ago, Tracy.

355
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,433
- Why didn't you go back to your base?
- I couldn't.

356
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:03,485
The attack...

357
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,180
We were fired on
by supposed friendlies.

358
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:07,733
Marines?

359
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:11,194
Jericho PMC...
Private Military Contractors.

360
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,949
I've heard about them,
but that doesn't explain why.

361
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:17,692
Jericho works for the military, which
means that I can't trust the military...

362
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,862
Hold on a second.

363
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,941
Why would you say
you can't trust the military?

364
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:25,062
About two weeks before
my humvee was attacked,

365
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:30,288
I was working long-range recon on this
village in the foothills near Kunar.

366
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:31,999
I was alone.

367
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,723
Orders were to stay covert
so the locals wouldn't see me.

368
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:38,876
But there must have been
someone else out there.

369
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,006
Jericho.

370
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:44,858
And I watched them...

371
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:49,726
I watched...

372
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,741
as they wiped out a village.

373
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:55,594
They killed women,

374
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:58,472
and they butchered children.

375
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:00,709
They slaughtered them.

376
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:03,988
- Why? Why would they want to do that?
- I don't know,

377
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,950
but I told my superior officer,
and about a week later,

378
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,690
Mike and I pulled duty at a forward
roadblock near the Kalikata Mountains.

379
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:14,113
Out of nowhere, a Haji truck
breached our roadblock.

380
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,073
We took off after them.

381
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,377
Damn!

382
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,423
Embrace the suck, Stark.

383
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:28,471
Who the hell are these guys?
Those aren't Hajis!

384
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,556
Burro, burro!
We're gonna get whacked!

385
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,891
- Get out!
- Go!

386
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,950
I don't know how I survived.

387
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:52,025
I thought I was the only one.

388
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,368
What's been going on?
You sounded freaked when you called.

389
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:31,075
- Did you slip or something?
- No, I just...

390
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,209
I didn't believe it myself.

391
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,995
I took this picture at my house.

392
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,840
My God.

393
00:23:46,145 --> 00:23:47,216
It's Tracy.

394
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:51,087
- How?
- How?

395
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,266
Tracy would kill me if she knew
I was talking to you, but...

396
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:59,437
she was in a humvee
with three other soldiers.

397
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,986
It got blown to hell, a bloody mess.

398
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,901
Body parts everywhere,
including her leg.

399
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:06,360
The D.N.A...

400
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,442
- It got basically thrown into the mix.
- Then where has she?

401
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:12,252
What has she been doing
for the past two years?

402
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:15,410
It's what I need to talk to you about.
Basically, she's been on the run.

403
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:19,808
She saw something she shouldn't have
and got in trouble with Jericho.

404
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:23,265
- They're this...
- Yeah, military contractors.

405
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:26,172
They were ones who attacked her.

406
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:30,627
I know this sounds like something out
of a Baldacci novel or something but...

407
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:33,034
Tracy was dead...

408
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,347
and now she's alive.
So, I really need your help, Mark,

409
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:40,449
'cause Tracy is scared
to death of these Jericho guys,

410
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:42,855
and I'm afraid they're
gonna try to find her.

411
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:45,381
- You all right?
- Yeah.

412
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,149
I saw something today,

413
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:53,061
and it got me thinking
that if this person's future

414
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:54,586
could come true,

415
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,294
and it did,

416
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,540
even though it seemed impossible,

417
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,303
then maybe these visions are
more set in stone than we thought.

418
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:07,434
Or maybe we have to work
that much harder.

419
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:08,741
You're right.

420
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:21,519
Did you open my gift?

421
00:25:23,206 --> 00:25:25,248
- They're lovely.
- You didn't put 'em on?

422
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:28,067
I figured you'd just
take 'em right off again.

423
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:29,388
Right.

424
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:33,197
We can change things, Mark.

425
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:37,225
We just have to decide
how badly we want to.

426
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:41,794
How far we're willing
to go to make it happen.

427
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:44,743
But I say there's nothing,

428
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:48,548
nothing that we shouldn't be willing
to do for one another.

429
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:50,923
So what are you suggesting?

430
00:25:51,408 --> 00:25:53,358
Set a trap, for our suspects,

431
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:55,015
draw 'em out.

432
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,054
I knowa lot's changed lately, but...

433
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:59,640
we still don't use
civilians as bait.

434
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,080
- Ingrid knows the risks.
- Then work the case.

435
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:06,138
- Work the Parofsky angle.
- We've been doing that.

436
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:09,355
Parofsky was chief engineer
at Micro-Circadian Electronics.

437
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,111
He was recently let go on suspicion
of corporate espionage.

438
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:15,489
What if Parofsky is selling
his work to the highest bidder?

439
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,660
Ingrid did say that they took a package
from him right before they shot him.

440
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,120
So it was valuable enough
to kill for.

441
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,830
Look, Stan, it's a real lead.

442
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:25,416
Ingrid's gonna be protected on this.
I promise.

443
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,078
What makes you so sure
they'd try to hit her tonight?

444
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:30,046
They already tried
to kill Ingrid once.

445
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:33,382
If we get the word out that we're gonna
release her from custody,

446
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:36,363
- they might try again.
- Why do you say that?

447
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,471
We went to Utah.
D. Gibbons knew we were coming.

448
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,767
You unearthed the Somalia photos.

449
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,061
Five minutes later,
we're getting shot at.

450
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:48,981
Whoever we're investigating knows
what we're doing before we do it.

451
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,360
You think we've got a mole.

452
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,527
We have a mole.

453
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,922
Two men with assault rifles
are gonna get into this building

454
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:58,597
five months from now,

455
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,244
and someone's gonna let 'em in.

456
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,562
We catch these guys tonight.

457
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:06,457
We can finally put a face
on our enemy.

458
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,545
Careful, it's hot.

459
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:18,219
Guess there's no chance of
getting any bourbon in there.

460
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,972
Probably not a good one, no.

461
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:24,433
When did you start whiskey?

462
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,149
- I told Mark Benford.
- You what?

463
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:34,902
- He can help.
- Are you insane?

464
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:38,501
- You don't know these people, Dad.
- I gotta get out of here.

465
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,447
- Hold on a second.
- I came to this house because I thought

466
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:45,295
that I'd be safe, but I see now
that was a big mistake.

467
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,791
Mark's a Fed, Trace.
I mean, he's practically family.

468
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:51,705
The second that Jericho knows
that I'm still alive,

469
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,963
- they'll find me and kill me.
- That's not true.

470
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:56,394
Don't you remember
your flash-forward?

471
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,343
The fact that you even had one
proves that you're gonna be alive.

472
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:02,179
I was with you.
I gave you my pocket knife.

473
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:04,307
You were on a cot, fell asleep.

474
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,893
We were in some kind of bunker
or cave surrounded by guards,

475
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:10,646
and there was graffiti
all over the walls.

476
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,815
I think somebody
was calling my name.

477
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:18,088
Then I stepped outside,
there was a man out there.

478
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,990
He was very concerned about you
and something strange.

479
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,700
<i>The account has been verified.</i>

480
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:26,579
Then I gave him an envelope.
I don't know what was in it.

481
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:30,057
"The accounts have been verified."
Does that mean something to you?

482
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:35,092
But this guy, what did he look like?

483
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:38,215
- Tall, dark. Scar.
- Khamir.

484
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:43,199
Khamir Dejan.
He was a field medic with the I.M.C.

485
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:45,149
He took care of me.

486
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:48,304
He got me back together.

487
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,767
That's why I left.

488
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,649
I was so afraid that Jericho
would kill Khamir to get to me.

489
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:58,117
That's not gonna happen. Five months
from now, he's alive. I saw him.

490
00:28:58,242 --> 00:29:01,322
- All three of us were there, Trace.
- How can you be so sure

491
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:03,407
that everything we saw
will still come true?

492
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:05,945
Enough of mine
has come true already that...

493
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:07,225
I'm a believer.

494
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:09,872
You came back to me, Trace.

495
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:12,083
Didn't you?

496
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:16,129
I don't know what could drag us
both back to Afghanistan,

497
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,304
but I have to trust what I saw.

498
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:26,555
<i>The area is secure.
We're good.</i>

499
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:28,302
Roger that.

500
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:30,050
<i>All units stay on tact-2.</i>

501
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,628
These guys are pros. Former military,
based on that video we saw.

502
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:40,515
You have a lot of amazing birds.

503
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,030
My babies.
The only real family I've ever had.

504
00:29:43,703 --> 00:29:45,616
Each one of them, is special to me.

505
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:48,035
Hard to believe
I thought of giving them up.

506
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,788
- What do you mean?
- My flash-forward.

507
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,032
In my vision, I wasn't working
at the store anymore.

508
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,531
I had blond hair,
and I was living in New York.

509
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:01,683
So the next day,
I put it up for sale.

510
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,356
Since we're standing here, I'm guessing
you didn't have a lot of buyers.

511
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:07,889
It was all for the best.

512
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,308
I don't know what I was thinking.
Planning on changing my life

513
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,908
for a future
that might not even come true.

514
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,943
We keeping you awake, cupcake?

515
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,698
I'm sorry, man.
I was up late with Zoey last night.

516
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:28,098
I told her what happens to me.

517
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:30,453
What's gonna happen to me.
Supposed to happen to me.

518
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,873
She wants me to quit,

519
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,844
get out of the line of fire.

520
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:37,282
Are you...

521
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:38,961
thinking about it?

522
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
I wasn't.

523
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,110
I mean...

524
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:46,159
Who knows? I quit, I get hit by a bus.
That's my luck.

525
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:47,290
Whatever.

526
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:51,369
What am I supposed to do,
become a barista until my death?

527
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:54,790
That's one way to go.

528
00:30:57,932 --> 00:30:59,106
When this is over,

529
00:30:59,397 --> 00:31:01,223
whether it's tonight or later,

530
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,748
I'd like for you
to have one of my cockatiels.

531
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,944
A thank you gift.

532
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:08,761
Don't make me insist.

533
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:12,081
If you truly loved your birds,

534
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:15,406
you're not gonna want to give one to me,
but thank you.

535
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,632
Very sweet.

536
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,187
- What was that?
- Stay here.

537
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,881
Sabre-2, this is Sabre-1.

538
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:28,036
- Sabre-2, go.
- Think I may have some movement here.

539
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,501
<i>You want us
to move in on your position?</i>

540
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,247
Could be nothing.
Let me check it out first.

541
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,772
Sabre-2, we have a breach.

542
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:41,857
All units surround the perimeter!

543
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,133
<i>Nobody gets out!</i>

544
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:45,319
I got Ingrid covered in the back.

545
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:48,507
Freeze!

546
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,153


547
00:33:05,478 --> 00:33:07,024
You saw him turning on me.

548
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:08,819
He was makin' a move.

549
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,780
It was dark.

550
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:15,750
I didn't get a good look.

551
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:19,026
But I do know we can't
interrogate a dead man.

552
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,086
What does this all mean?

553
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:33,052
I'm sorry,

554
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:35,679
but one of the men you saw
is still out there,

555
00:33:35,852 --> 00:33:37,875
and he's not gonna stop
until he finds you.

556
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,329
We need to put you
in witness protection.

557
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:47,149
That's okay.

558
00:33:48,948 --> 00:33:50,486
I think that's my future.

559
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,447
I should have trusted
my gut all along.

560
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:58,917
Judging from your dwindling
amount of chips,

561
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,454
the pain is almost over.

562
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,610
What are you thinking
over there, mate?

563
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,108
Maybe you got a pair of 8s,
working a full boat.

564
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:25,625
How much do you have left?

565
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:27,938
Just under 15.

566
00:34:32,463 --> 00:34:33,591
$5,000.

567
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:54,258
Why don't we make this hand,
winner take all?

568
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:55,992
If you win, we go public.

569
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:58,732
But of course I'll win,
and you'll keep your mouth shut.

570
00:34:59,077 --> 00:34:59,880
Fine.

571
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:15,424
As a physicist, Lloyd,
you really are a genius.

572
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:18,622
But you were never very good
at concealing your tells.

573
00:35:23,175 --> 00:35:24,787
Four of a kind for Mr. Camp.

574
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,300
Straight flush.

575
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,927
Pot and game to Mr. Simcoe.

576
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:40,898
Congratulations.

577
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:43,332
Keep the chips.

578
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:45,455
Call it a tip.

579
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,320
I got what I came for.

580
00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:52,489
How did you beat me?

581
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:54,903
Did I tell you Dylan
really loves magic?

582
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:58,118
Sleight of hand's his favorite.

583
00:35:58,995 --> 00:36:01,906
There are some things
even I won't leave to chance.

584
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:03,187
That being said.

585
00:36:03,614 --> 00:36:06,505
I'll let you have the first pass
at drafting the announcement.

586
00:36:10,227 --> 00:36:11,794
Thanks for backing my play there.

587
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,823
I just want to make sure
I know which play it was.

588
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:20,266
Is this about taking
tattoo man off the streets

589
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,180
- or putting him under it?
- What are you talking about?

590
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,004
Look, I know you said
if we get this guy,

591
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,299
we might be able
to change our futures.

592
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:29,228
But?

593
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,440
I just want to make sure
the plan here wasn't to kill him

594
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:36,777
so he can't kill me
or come after you in your office.

595
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:39,271
Whatever gave you that idea?

596
00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:40,823
Because I had it.

597
00:36:43,156 --> 00:36:45,529
The second you suggested
tattoo man might be the guy

598
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:47,542
who's supposed to kill me,
I thought,

599
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:49,279
I'm gonna kill him first.

600
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:53,058
But now you think I actually did...

601
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:57,422
That I went that far.

602
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:02,077
I would've.

603
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:21,523
- What are you doing here so late?
- Trusting my gut.

604
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,598
Your e-mail said
you had something for me.

605
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:29,830
Yeah, I do.

606
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:32,469
N.S.A. finally sent back
a new rendering

607
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,398
of that suspect zero photo.

608
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,005
- Looks like the old one.
- It is.

609
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,714
This... is the new one.

610
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:44,456
What's that on his hand?

611
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:49,391
It looks like a ring.

612
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,643
Can the image
be enhanced any further?

613
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,645
N.S.A. is working on it right now,

614
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,180
but it took them this long
to get this far.

615
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:58,833
Tell them to put
their foot on the gas.

616
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:01,403
If we can tie this jewelry
to the guy wearing it,

617
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,821
we'll have our first workable lead.

618
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:05,365
Good job.

619
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:31,426
You look like you had
a perfectly ordinary day.

620
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:34,607
Worse than ordinary?

621
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:40,504
I killed a man tonight.

622
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:42,534
What happened?

623
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:43,820
I had a shot

624
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:46,099
at changing my future.

625
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:50,369
Our future.

626
00:38:53,822 --> 00:38:54,831
And I took it.

627
00:38:56,797 --> 00:38:58,043
Mark, come here.

628
00:38:58,839 --> 00:38:59,839
Come here.

629
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:04,424
Maybe April 29th's, just gonna be
another day at the office now.

630
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:08,960
What does that mean?

631
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,726
I told you in my flash-forward
I was in danger, right?

632
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:18,224
A man was trying to kill me.

633
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:20,874
But tonight...

634
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:22,983
I got to him first.

635
00:39:27,294 --> 00:39:29,032
I changed the future, Livy.

636
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,529
We have a second chance.

637
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:36,693
We have a second chance.

638
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:15,558
You have them?

639
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:29,309
There were supposed to be seven.

640
00:40:36,344 --> 00:40:38,252
After the first atom bomb test,

641
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:41,012
you know what a colleague
of Oppenheimer's said?

642
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,483
"What a foul and awesome display."

643
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:46,076
He then added,

644
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:48,487
"Now we are all sons of bitches."

645
