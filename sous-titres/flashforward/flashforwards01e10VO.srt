1
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,967
Priority number one,
finding what caused this.

2
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:13,804
Priority number two is figuring out
whether or not it'll happen again.

3
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,516
Our experiment killed 20 million people.
We have to go public

4
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:19,393
and tell the world.

5
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,896
D. Gibbons was on
the phone during the blackout.

6
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:26,025
"He who foresees calamities,
suffers them twice over."

7
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,071
D Gibbons escaped.
We got his cell phone and a white queen.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,198
I love you,
even if my parents don't.

9
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,742
I didn't have a flashforward
because I will be dead.

10
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:38,370
<i>I know what I saw.
The beach. Our wedding. You were there.</i>

11
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,790
You said you didn't wanna
give up hope. Don't.

12
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,710
Our wiretapping program intercepted
a phone call to a Bureau cell phone.

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,048
On March 15th, 2010,
you are going to be murdered.

14
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,467
You're not going to Hong Kong,
end of story.

15
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:52,551
We're going.

16
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:55,221
- Wedeck's gonna be pissed.
- He'll get over it.

17
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:58,057
<i>I am here to warn you tonight</i>

18
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:02,228
<i>that there is yet a chance
and a hope of you escaping my fate,</i>

19
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,023
<i>a chance and a hope
of my securing, Ebenezer,</i>

20
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:09,568
<i>your freedom in the afterlife.
Tonight,</i>

21
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,779
<i>you will be haunted
by three spirits.</i>

22
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,825
<i>Is that the chance
and hope you mentioned?</i>

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,867
<i>It is.</i>

24
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,328
<i>Without their visits,</i>

25
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:23,249
<i>you cannot hope
to shun the path I've tread.</i>

26
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:27,129
<i>Expect the first tomorrow</i>

27
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,507
<i>when the bell tolls one.</i>

28
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,220
<i>Expect the second on the next night,</i>

29
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,138
<i>about the same hour.</i>

30
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:41,129
<i>Expect the third on the next night,</i>

31
00:01:41,254 --> 00:01:45,258
<i>when the last stroke of 12
ceases to vibrate.</i>

32
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:55,112
You think we can find
the woman who called me?

33
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:58,741
Linguists expect your caller is here,
specifically from Tehran.

34
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,284
London educated.

35
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:03,954
How many Persian speaking women
with that accent could be in Hong Kong?

36
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:07,666
We're gonna find her, Dem.
We're going all the way. Come on.

37
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:14,381
You really should answer your cell.

38
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:18,469
It's your boss calling.

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,099
Marshall Vogel, FBI office,
Hong Kong.

40
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,434
Did you think
you were gonna stroll in

41
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:27,728
without immigration flagging
your arrival?

42
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:31,232
- Mark Benford. This is...
- Agent Demetri Noh.

43
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:36,612
Badge number 4587,
born February 17th, 1977.

44
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:40,074
Potentially murdered,
March 15th, 2010.

45
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,911
I know about the mystery woman
and why you're looking.

46
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,540
This is a sovereign territory of
communist China,

47
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,710
a country that ours believes was
responsible for the blackout.

48
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,587
So you're here to offer help.

49
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:56,924
Go home, is what I'm saying.

50
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:01,679
If you catch the first flight back,
your jobs might still be there.

51
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:05,099
Unless you're willing to arrest us,
we'll take our chances.

52
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,981
- Hi, cupcake.
- <i>What part of</i>

53
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:14,483
<i>"stay the hell out of Hong Kong"</i>

54
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:16,902
did you two idiots not understand?

55
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,865
Al Gough did a half-gainer off
the building you're in

56
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,992
to prove the future can be changed.

57
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,161
- You two are disobeying a direct order!
- By the way,

58
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:30,291
I lied to Demetri. I told him
you changed your mind about us coming.

59
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,792
Merry Christmas.

60
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:40,050
- Why'd you tell him you lied to me?
- If things go south,

61
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:43,137
you're definitely gonna need to
keep carrying a gun.

62
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:48,017
<i>We're live here in Palo Alto,
where sources are claiming</i>

63
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:52,187
<i>a major announcement will be made
concerning the causes of the blackout.</i>

64
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:55,149
<i>Thank you for attending
this press conference.</i>

65
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,529
My name is Gordon Myhill.
I am the director

66
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:01,282
of the National Linear
Accelerator Project.

67
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,577
Today we have some important
information concerning the events

68
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,455
- of October 6th that we feel...
- They're gonna crucify us.

69
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,375
What's a little martyrdom
between friends?

70
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,294
Stick to the points we discussed.

71
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,505
Last thing we need is your conscience
dragging us further.

72
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,881
What does that mean?

73
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:21,802
You feel guilty because your wife died ,
you have to take care of your son

74
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,930
I won't let you drag me down into
your shame

75
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,183
just because you're playing Mr Mum.
Understood?

76
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,686
<i>I'd like to introduce you now to</i>

77
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:34,106
<i>our associate directors of the
Plasma-Wakefield Program,</i>

78
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,359
<i>Dr Lloyd Simcoe and Dr Simon Campos.</i>

79
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,195
<i>Good morning.</i>

80
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,281
<i>My name is Lloyd Simcoe.</i>

81
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:46,577
<i>As Dr Myhill indicated,
our speciality</i>

82
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:49,455
<i>is proton-driven plasma-Wakefield
acceleration.</i>

83
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:53,208
<i>What we're trying to do is
to reproduce the kind of energy levels</i>

84
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,171
<i>that existed just after the Big Bang,
on a more controllable scale.</i>

85
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,216
<i>We were conducting just such an
experiment here on...</i>

86
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,470
<i>October the 6th, at precisely</i>

87
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,555
1100 hours Pacific Daylight Time.

88
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,100
Please, please!

89
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,353
If you could wait a moment,

90
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,605
I will take questions. Please.

91
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,107
I just need to get to
the heart of the matter.

92
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,444
<i>We are here today</i>

93
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,323
<i>because we believe
that the global blackout</i>

94
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:27,910
<i>was precipitated by our experiment.</i>

95
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,455
Please.
If you just give me a moment,

96
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,000
I will take questions in a minute.
Please, one moment...

97
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:44,802
Are you taking responsibility
for all the death

98
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:46,678
and damage caused by the blackout?

99
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,603
We admit that our experiment
does seem the most likely cause.

100
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,438
But we contend

101
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,233
there was no way to predict
anything like this

102
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,943
happening whatsoever.

103
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,694
This was utterly unforeseeable.

104
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,114
Scientists experiment all the time.

105
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,699
We cannot stop experiments

106
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,119
because we are not sure
of the results!

107
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:13,872
What does that mean for Mosaic?
Game over?

108
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:16,291
Maybe Simcoe caused the blackout...

109
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:19,002
Maybe he didn't.

110
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,131
Game's not over.

111
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,801
- With the work...
- ... releasing an official statement,

112
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,386
regarding this event.

113
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:31,056
We will be concluding this.
We will now be concluding...

114
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,266
Please.

115
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,187
Please believe me when I say
that our hearts go out to anyone

116
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:41,233
who was hurt or lost someone they
cared for. My own wife was killed.

117
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,361
And I would give anything
to have her back.

118
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:49,366
We understand people are scared
of another blackout.

119
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,742
There won't be.

120
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,744
Because we were the cause.

121
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,413
And we assure you,

122
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,250
we assure you that this could not
happen again

123
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,128
because of this moment,
all plasma-wakefield experiments

124
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,005
are on hold indefinitely.

125
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,892
You didn't even apologize!

126
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,728
You killed my family!

127
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,148
Idiot.

128
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:24,860
We talked about having suspicions,
our work contributing to a phenomenon.

129
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,279
- We needed to be more definitive.
- There's no we.

130
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:29,531
You made that clear.
You lost all objectivity.

131
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,242
You're ignoring the obvious
to save your own skin.

132
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,578
Of course, I am.
It's the scientific method.

133
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:37,122
It's about collecting
empirical evidence.

134
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,708
Until we can prove empirically
that we were the cause,

135
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,835
I'm not about to flush my life
down the toilets.

136
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,880
I do not think we were
to blame for this, you do.

137
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:48,008
If you won't see my line of reasoning,
it's war between us.

138
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,395


139
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,861
- What happened to your TV?
- Those scientists.

140
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,488
I want them in here yesterday.
I want to debrief them.

141
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,657
You and seven billion other people.

142
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,575
They both disappeared within ten minutes
of their announcement.

143
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,288
Simon Campos
is completely off our radar.

144
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,915
Lloyd Simcoe, he had a ticket
for a flight to DC

145
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,085
that left San Francisco
within an hour of his little speech.

146
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:26,463
- We found out he wasn't on the plane.
- Wait. Simcoe.

147
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,799
I knew I heard that name before.

148
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,092
How and why, Janice?

149
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:33,554
When I was in the hospital, I overheard
Olivia Benford talking about...

150
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,014
Dylan Simcoe.

151
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,767
He was a patient that they were
treating. He's Lloyd Simcoe's son.

152
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,271
Then you're going to wait for him
to check on his boy.

153
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,858
- We don't have any basis for an arrest.
- Right. This is you.

154
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,527
One agent reaching out. That's it.

155
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,237
We need to know what he knows.

156
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,909
Have you spoken to Mark or Demetri?

157
00:08:58,203 --> 00:08:59,663
That's what happened to the TV.

158
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,384
<i>You've reached the Nohs.
Leave a message</i>

159
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,678
Mrs Noh. But this is it.

160
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,514
This will be the last time
I ask you.

161
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:19,808
You're the parents
of the man I love.

162
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,436
I want you at our wedding.

163
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,522
In the future that I saw,
you were there

164
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:28,442
and if you say you'll go,
it makes it real.

165
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,196
I'm supposed to marry Demetri

166
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,449
and I hope to God that this is
the message I'm supposed to send

167
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,825
so that you go.

168
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,829
I love your son more than
anything in this world and...

169
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:44,249
ma'am, he loves me. Can you
just please help us be together?

170
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,088
- You're early.
- Hi.

171
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm trying to make
senior partner one day, too.

172
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,844
You going to the memorial tonight?
I know you didn't know Joyce well.

173
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,973
She was so friendly and so kind to me,
so of course. I wouldn't miss it.

174
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,433
- See you then.
- Yes.

175
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,234
This is it.

176
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,611
Audio forensics gave us
a three-mile radius

177
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,238
of where the call was placed.

178
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,491
But there are a bunch of good reasons
why we might find Eartha right here.

179
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,659
Eartha?

180
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:21,620
Well, she kind of sounds
like Eartha Kitt, don't you think?

181
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,747
What?

182
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,042
You know, the Batman TV show.
She played Catwoman.

183
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,545
You're right.
She does sound like Eartha Kitt.

184
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:32,631
A Persian,
well-educated Eartha Kitt.

185
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,009
There's only two news stands
within a block of here

186
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,803
that sell Persian newspapers.

187
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,722
This may be a stretch
but there's a place around the corner

188
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,391
that sells Iranian cigarettes.

189
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,184
That voice, you know, it's...

190
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,478
it's a pretty good bet she smokes.
What?

191
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,567
<i>Madd O' Meh.</i>

192
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,194
Farsi for the tide in the mist.

193
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,655
Persian woman, Persian food.

194
00:10:58,073 --> 00:10:59,199
Yahtzee.

195
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,959
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

196
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:16,091


197
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,635
Forget it.

198
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,686
What?

199
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:30,188
I've just never been
surveilled before.

200
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,899
I'm not surveilling you.

201
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,984
It feels like I'm being surveilled.

202
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,072
Well, I could split, if you slide me
Lloyd Simcoe's phone number.

203
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,742
And what do I do after I get fired?

204
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,660
A girl's gotta try.

205
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:46,580
Dr Benford said that you came
in while I was away.

206
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,083
- How'd it go?
- She says I'm doing good.

207
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,085
Not good enough to have a baby yet.

208
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:55,214
- You wanna have a baby?
- I didn't...

209
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,134
But then the blackout happened
and I saw myself getting a sonogram.

210
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:02,679
I was pregnant. I was totally crazy.

211
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,098
It was like being in love
or something.

212
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,895
I don't know. Maybe I'll just listen
to the universe and...

213
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,272
and throw the towel in
on the whole thing.

214
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,607
Listen. In your flash forward,
you saw yourself pregnant.

215
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,697
If you were really listening
to the universe,

216
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:22,448
you'd be trying to have that baby.

217
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:24,534
Do you know how far along you were?

218
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,287
The sonographer said four months.

219
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:30,081
The beginning of January.

220
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:33,668
- If that's what you saw, that's...
- When I'm supposed to get pregnant.

221
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,504
You still wanna get pregnant?

222
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:40,008
Then don't, give up.

223
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:45,722
<i>Hitler, Idi Ami, Suharto.</i>

224
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:50,143
<i>Simcoe and Campos killed more people
than all of those monsters combined.</i>

225
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:53,021
<i>There's a real good case
to be made here.</i>

226
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:56,024
<i>You've got the biggest mass
murderers in history.</i>

227
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,484
<i>- Why aren't they in jail?</i>
- Wedeck.

228
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:02,322
<i>- They haven't broken any laws.</i>
- He's...

229
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,157
<i>What about criminal negligence</i>

230
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:07,118
- And no-one?
- <i>leaving 20 million people...</i>

231
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:08,369
Yes.

232
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:10,538
<i>There needs to be a trial.</i>

233
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,958
<i>Simcoe went to Harvard, 1998.</i>

234
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,501
<i>He got his PhD.</i>

235
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,825
So you're here to turn yourself in?

236
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:33,079
I'm not sure what we did
could be construed as a crime,

237
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,374
even if it were proven
we were responsible.

238
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:41,504


239
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,449
I do not believe
we caused the blackout.

240
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:49,578
You probably shouldn't have stood up
in front of reporters and said you did.

241
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,204
Not my choice.

242
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,707
Lloyd Simcoe tends to let
his emotions run rampant.

243
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,417
I don't.

244
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,503
Any idea who is responsible then?

245
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,133
But if you allowed me access
to your Mosaic investigation,

246
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:06,010
I could divine the answer for you.

247
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:07,595
So you wanna be deputized.

248
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,306
I've served on three panels
with the National Science Foundation,

249
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,475
- I have security clearance.
- You're confusing me

250
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,977
with someone who gives a damn.
I'm up for giving you,

251
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:16,938
not a new career.

252
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:22,693
How long do you think Washington will
continue to fund an investigation

253
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,570
into what caused the blackout

254
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:27,865
when somebody has already stepped
forward and accepted the blame?

255
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,536
My guess is unless you come up with some
compelling evidence relatively soon,

256
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,705
you'll never find out what or who

257
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,959
caused the greatest global
catastrophe in human history.

258
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,712
Or if you can prevent it
from happening again.

259
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:43,881
How about this.

260
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,093
You come back tomorrow morning,
I'll have something to show you,

261
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:48,511
we make some progress.

262
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:52,223
I'll see what I can do
about an official role.

263
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:54,267
Because I do like you,

264
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:57,603
Assistant Director Wedeck.

265
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,525
I will accept
your disingenuous offer.

266
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:10,283
How dare he come in here.

267
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:11,325
He's here.

268
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:17,498
Did you charter a flight?

269
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:19,333
- Excuse me?
- I'm Agent Janis Hawk

270
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,793
with the Mosaic task force.

271
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:23,129
- Are you here to arrest me?
- Come in and talk to us.

272
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:25,881
We need information
and you need some protection.

273
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,177
I'm sorry. My son's safety
is my priority right now.

274
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,180
If you've connected me to him, it won't
be long before others do as well.

275
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:35,023
I have to get him out of here.

276
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:36,475
Let us help you. Please.

277
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:40,146
- This could be an opportunity...
- To be polite, I'm not interested.

278
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,814
Just leave us alone.

279
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:50,573
We're looking for a friend.
She works around here,

280
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,241
maybe eats at this restaurant.

281
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,952
We don't have a picture of her
but we have a recording.

282
00:15:55,077 --> 00:15:56,746
Can you take a listen

283
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,081
and let us know if you recognize it.

284
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:00,541
Sure.

285
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:05,510
<i>I am sorry, there is
no delicate way to say this,</i>

286
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:09,222
<i>but on March 15th 2010,</i>

287
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:11,599
<i>you are going to be murdered.</i>

288
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:16,604 --> 00:16:20,149
I would remember that voice
if I knew who it belonged to.

290
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,611
Now, how about some dessert?

291
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:25,279
Sure, thank you.

292
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:31,907
Yeah, I saw it. Stand outside.
Make sure no one comes in.

293
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,917
"Merry Christmas!"

294
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,256
Some faludeh.

295
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,176
- Thank you.
- Your friend?

296
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,346
Stepped outside.
Sit down, join me.

297
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,234
The woman we're looking for,
she has information we need.

298
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,653
It's a matter of life and death.

299
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,656
I'm so sorry.
I can't help you.

300
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,034
You have it backwards.

301
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,954
If you can't help,

302
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,956
you will be sorry.

303
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,086
You know that woman.

304
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,922
Not so long ago,

305
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:33,635
a hotel concierge
named Anush Harandi,

306
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,596
an Iranian man, much like yourself,

307
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:41,017
was taken from his home in Bangkok,
in the middle of the night

308
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:44,855
because my government believed
he had some small

309
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,857
piece of information.

310
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,859
His friends, his family,
no one knew what happened to him.

311
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,030
He spent two years
in secret detention.

312
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:59,661
My government's gotten
very good at that sort of thing.

313
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,294
- Her name is Nhadra Udaya.
- You got her name?

314
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,088
She comes here on the weekends
but almost every night,

315
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:13,466
she has a late dinner
at a dim sum place, two blocks down.

316
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:17,762
Now, we just have to get her to talk.
One way or another.

317
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,810
- Why didn't you want me in there?
- I'm trying to protect you, Dem.

318
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:28,523
If someone's hands are gonna get dirty,
let it be mine.

319
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,611
We've given these to our top-level
analysts.

320
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,155
They haven't been able to
tell us anything useful.

321
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:37,657
It's a good thing
I'm smarter than they are.

322
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,201
These are highly-classified images

323
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,163
so we've obscured anything that
indicates where they were taken.

324
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,121
Somalia.

325
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,250
The dip slopes
in the overlying limestone,

326
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,170
the orientation of the flora,
shallow waters...

327
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,838
Tell us what you see.

328
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,467
- Are you taking the piss?
- Tell us what you see.

329
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,262
Zoom in, please.

330
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,852
I designed that.

331
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:10,065
That is a specialised post laser
for a plasma afterburner.

332
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,527
It increases the rate of acceleration
for radio frequency machines.

333
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,406
The concept should win me a Nobel
in a couple of years.

334
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,283
I must say,

335
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,660
the modelling software
you guys use, is incredibly impressive.

336
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,956
The structure almost looks real.

337
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,419
That is a real structure.

338
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,714
And that is a real photograph.

339
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:39,469
That's not possible.
The technology doesn't exist yet.

340
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,846
We're still
running numerical simulations.

341
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,182
When did you come up with the idea ?

342
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,268
'92. Why?

343
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:50,814
That photograph was taken in 1991.

344
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:58,777
That...

345
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:02,990
- doesn't make sense.
- Who could've come up with this idea?

346
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,366
No one.

347
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:06,785
Your unparalleled genius act
is wearing thin.

348
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,328
That's not what I mean.

349
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:12,040
You ask any great scientific mind
what they want to achieve

350
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:15,335
and the only honest answer
is immortality.

351
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:20,257
If you discover something that
changes the world, you live forever.

352
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:24,469
So whoever designed this
not only had to be brilliant but

353
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,347
didn't care about being famous.
Didn't want it.

354
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:31,852
Practically
fetishised their anonymity.

355
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,063
A recluse. A paranoid.

356
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:36,315
Exactly.

357
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,401
We believe this man was
somehow connected to the blackout.

358
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,070
This is a composite sketch,
made by our field agents

359
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,531
He was awake during the black out.

360
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:47,451
He may have been in contact
with another person who was awake.

361
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,079
We don't even know his real name.
He's using the alias "D Gibbons".

362
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,333
<i>He's highly efficient
in computing equipment</i>

363
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,335
<i>and particle-physics simulation.</i>

364
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,755
<i>He's been hacking into
a number of high-tech facilities.</i>

365
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,382
<i>He also seems to have
a penchant for chess.</i>

366
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:05,844
A techie, chess-playing,

367
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:09,973
social-misfit physicist.
That should narrow it down.

368
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:13,643
Have you ever seen him before,
at conferences or lectures?

369
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:17,731
But if he had anything to do
with the blackout, I'll do everything

370
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,066
to help him.

371
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,735
At least,
I'd like to give his testicles a squeeze

372
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,529
for shocking
my plasma-afterburner I designed.

373
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:29,743
I need to find somewhere
where my son can be safe.

374
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,453
Southland University Hospital.

375
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:35,248
That's less secure than here.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

376
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,501
You don't seem very good at that.

377
00:21:38,668 --> 00:21:41,546
- I beg your pardon?
- The announcement, you said

378
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,362
you caused the blackout,

379
00:21:43,673 --> 00:21:45,717
and then that you didn't mean to.

380
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,636
It was all kind of a jumble.

381
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:51,890
In my experience, innocent people
tend to speak in specifics.

382
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:54,935
No. I spoke in specifics,

383
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,187
I related a series of facts,
and now...

384
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,022
Southland University Hospital.

385
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:01,285
I can transfer your son.
 I put it through?

386
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,567
I want...

387
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:07,697
I need you to find a secure facility

388
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,617
for my son.

389
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:12,994
Let's try Travers.

390
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:15,789
It's a private children's hospital,
in Glendale.

391
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:18,542
- I doubt they'll have beds.
- They will when I make a call.

392
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:23,338
Get that started, and I'll draw up
a transfer note. Be back in an hour.

393
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:30,136
I don't suppose I can expect anyone
to help me much in future.

394
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:32,347
You need help, I'll help you.

395
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:44,442
"And I, John, saw the Holy City,
New Jerusalem,

396
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:47,279
"coming down from God out of heaven,

397
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,283
"prepared as a bride
adorned for her husband."

398
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:56,382
We are here tonight
to say a final goodbye to Joyce.

399
00:22:58,431 --> 00:22:59,502
<i>You saw me there.</i>

400
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:05,767
<i>But I'm positive you were.</i>

401
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,439
Joyce's death is a tragic loss.

402
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:14,233
We've lost a daughter, a wife,

403
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,069
a friend.

404
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:21,115
But what we must remember,
what we must hold in our hearts...

405
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,803
Looks like we found her.

406
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:11,365
- You shouldn't have come here.
- You called me, remember?

407
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,159
That was a mistake, clearly.

408
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:15,119
You being here now,

409
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,164
you'll set things in motion
that will end very badly for you.

410
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:20,708
Can we just skip over

411
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,794
the histrionic action-movie cliches?

412
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,381
Cause I'm way too jet-lagged to deal
with any of that right now.

413
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:28,716
Tell me who you are.

414
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,218
I can't.

415
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:34,930
Why'd you call me?

416
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,893
- I was trying to warn you.
- You don't know me.

417
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,271
- Why do you care if I live or die?
- Your death is the first

418
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:44,482
in a long line of dominos.

419
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:48,360
- I would rather not see fall down.
- So help us prevent it.

420
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:50,154
- I can't.
- You can.

421
00:24:51,238 --> 00:24:52,239
By telling us.

422
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:53,532
If I tell you more,

423
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:57,620
the act of telling you may bring about
the unfortunate incident

424
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:59,246
we are all trying to avoid.

425
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:01,123
I'm willing to take that risk.

426
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,672
I said you would be shot
three times.

427
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:11,675
Shots at close range.

428
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,428
Which means
I probably know my killer.

429
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:15,930
In fact, you do.

430
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:18,808
He is sitting at this table
right now.

431
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,359
You, Agent Benford.

432
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:33,823
You will kill Agent Noh
on March 15th,

433
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:37,618
with the very gun I assume
you're carrying right now.

434
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:40,538
A SIG-Sauer model P226.

435
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,169
In the call you said you didn't know
who killed me. Now you do.

436
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:50,005
I lied because I didn't want
to bring about

437
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,341
the incident which I told you about.

438
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:56,095
How could you possibly know?

439
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,555
A,

440
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,265
5, 6,

441
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:00,349
1,

442
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:01,308
9,

443
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,060
8, 4.

444
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,524
And...

445
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:10,317
what is that?

446
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:13,153
The serial number of your gun.

447
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:38,679
It will be your gun, Agent Benford,

448
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:41,682
and you will pull the trigger.

449
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,017
And then again,

450
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,435
and then again.

451
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:47,062
You could a found the number
a different way.

452
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,690
You could have hacked
into the Bureau's gun registry.

453
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:53,319
How many times have you
interrogated a suspect?

454
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:55,446
Look into my eyes.

455
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:59,575
Your partner is going to kill you,
intentionally.

456
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:03,579
Why would I do that?

457
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:04,872
Why?

458
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:07,458
Presumably,
in the next few months,

459
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,626
a reason will present itself.

460
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:12,046
Now, you've got
what you've come for.

461
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,589
No, I have more questions.

462
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,758
I am done giving you answers.

463
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:18,010
It's time for you to leave.

464
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:23,849
Don't.

465
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:28,896
You're coming with us, right now!

466
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,606
Move, move!

467
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,109
- Move!
- What are we doing?

468
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:35,819
Cover me!

469
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:38,822
Down the stairs, now!
Down!

470
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:40,491
Come on, come on!

471
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,493
Trust me, I got it.

472
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,417
Back off, now!

473
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:00,678


474
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,475
Put the gun down!

475
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,836
This woman is a material witness

476
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,504
- to a murder.
- There has been no murder.

477
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,342
But there will be.
Will there, Agent Benford?

478
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,303
Let her go.

479
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,979
Nhadra, have your men
lower their guns.

480
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:52,271
Now.

481
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:16,139
All the way down!

482
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,971
- This isn't over.
- It never is.

483
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,936
Put your hands behind your back.

484
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:45,116
Mr Simcoe. Hey.

485
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,952
I have those transfer papers.

486
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,372
- Sorry for all the red tape.
- I appreciate it.

487
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,749
Especially after the inconvenience
I've caused you and your family.

488
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,419
You did nothing wrong.

489
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,463
Are you ready to get Dylan
checked out?

490
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:02,258
You really think there won't be
another blackout?

491
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,262
Not unless we recreate the exact
conditions of our experiment, no.

492
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:10,933
It was an incredibly
brave thing you did,

493
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:13,978
coming forward like that,
taking responsibility.

494
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,191
I think the line between brave
and stupid's a pretty blurry one.

495
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,942
I didn't say it wasn't stupid.

496
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,198
All the same, I'd like to think
I did it for the right reasons.

497
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,325
So, you went to Harvard in'98?

498
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,538
It was one of the best times of my life.
I was doing my doctorate.

499
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,833
I had this beautiful apartment
above a cigar shop.

500
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,877
- Levitt and Pierce?
- That's the one.

501
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,254
I was supposed to go
to Harvard in'98,

502
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,716
and I was gonna live
in the building next door.

503
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,219
- Why didn't you?
- Because Mark got his job.

504
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,513
He was gonna be transfered
to Los Angeles, so...

505
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,221
I decided to be with him instead.

506
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,767
My wife...

507
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:56,229
moved into that building.
That's how I met her.

508
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,278
So, if I had gone,
we probably would have met.

509
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:12,243
Have you heard
of the many-worlds interpretation?

510
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,790
It was coined by a physicist
called Hugh Everett in the'50s.

511
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,377
The idea is, anything that could
have happened in our past actually

512
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,794
did happen in some other universe.

513
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:24,590
All the alternate decisions
and choices you made

514
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:27,009
are still playing themselves out
in another world.

515
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:31,347
If you buy the theory, I suppose,
in some other universe, you...

516
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,099
did go to Harvard.

517
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,436
And we did meet.

518
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:42,900
Of course, that's not
the world we live in.

519
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,154
Thank you again for this.

520
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:48,698
Sure.

521
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,915
You're both very lucky men.

522
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,835
I saved your lives, helped you
avoid an international incident.

523
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,005
- Why are you keeping us from her?
- You don't need to know what she knows.

524
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,798
Let me get you on the flight.

525
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,716
Just a friendly service
Legats provides.

526
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,596
You're not Legats.

527
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,808
If you were Bureau, you never
would have let us off the plane.

528
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,019
And after what went down
in that alley,

529
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,730
this whole thing stinks
like a company job.

530
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,524
We prefer the term
"Central Intelligence Agency."

531
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,573
I hate to break it to you,
but Mosaic is bigger than you.

532
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,660
Bigger than the FBI. Bigger than
any intelligence organisation.

533
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:35,911
You're just a...

534
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:37,872
a tiny spec, Mark.

535
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,374
A flake of dandruff
on the nape of this thing's neck.

536
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:42,334
But if it will make you
feel better...

537
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:44,795
to take a swing at me,

538
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:46,547
then go right ahead.

539
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:49,300
It's not like you've got anything
else to lose.

540
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,350
That call, I would take.

541
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,478
<i>You know what I'm staring at?</i>

542
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:06,400
I'm watching the security camera feed
of your amazing foot screw

543
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,777
<i>in Hong Kong.</i>

544
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:08,776
<i>Shut up!</i>

545
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:11,241
It was sent to me by the damn
US Ambassador to China.

546
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,990
<i>So I'm calling to congratulate you.</i>

547
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,535
You've succeeded
in changing the future.

548
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:21,791
I got it.

549
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,634
Here.

550
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:35,304
Wedeck's orders.

551
00:33:38,724 --> 00:33:40,851
Looks like we finally have
something in common.

552
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,064
Neither of us are FBI.

553
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,662
They have been following you ever
since you destroyed that doll factory.

554
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:02,873
Coming here was a mistake.

555
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,417
I can't protect you.

556
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:11,924
Then I just have to find
someone who can.

557
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:14,657


558
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,685
Can I come in?

559
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,107
Mrs Noh, I think I understand
why you didn't want to talk to me

560
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,567
about our wedding.

561
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,944
- Zoey...
- We need to talk about this.

562
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,113
About what I saw.

563
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:38,742
You were there.

564
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,868
With Mr Noh.

565
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:45,456
I didn't see Demetri.

566
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,376
Then I realized something.

567
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,795
No matter how much I begged you,

568
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:53,966
you'd never come to our wedding.

569
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,678
But you wouldn't miss
your son's funeral.

570
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:03,767
Why didn't you tell us?

571
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,813
Talking about it with you,

572
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,359
with anyone,
that would make it real.

573
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:14,236
Maybe before all this,

574
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:17,615
we would have had difficulties
with you marrying our son,

575
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:19,491
but what I saw that day,

576
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,033
that moment,

577
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,747
the love you have for Demetri...

578
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,085
I want you to know,

579
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,547
we see things differently now,

580
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:37,176
and we'd be proud for you
to be a part of our family.

581
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,679
We wish that was the future.

582
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:43,390
We wish that more than anything.

583
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,935
We can do more than wish, Mrs Noh.

584
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,812
We can change the future.

585
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,283
<i>Answer one question.</i>

586
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,995
<i>Are these the shadows of things
that will be, or that may be?</i>

587
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:08,582
<i>Spirit, hear me,
I am not the man I was.</i>

588
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,335
<i>Why show me this
if I am past of hope?</i>

589
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,546
<i>Assure me that I may yet change
these shadows you show me,</i>

590
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,048
<i>by an altered life.</i>

591
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,342
<i>I will live in the past,
the present and the future,</i>

592
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,260
<i>and not shut out
the lessons they teach.</i>

593
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,098
<i>But tell me that I will...</i>

594
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,311
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:33,941
What are you sorry for?

596
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,192
It's my murder.

597
00:36:36,443 --> 00:36:37,528
My problem.

598
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,948
Meanwhile, I'm sitting here
with your badge in my pocket.

599
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,076
I'm not gonna shoot you, Dem.

600
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,872
I'm not gonna let
this investigation kill you, either.

601
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:50,833
No matter what happens.

602
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,925
Smile, Bryce. Haven't you heard?
It's the most wonderful time of year.

603
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:02,219
What's this?

604
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,762
Open it and find out.

605
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:12,563
<i>It's a lucky cat.
Maneki neko in Japanese.</i>

606
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,065
Depending upon which paw is raised

607
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,609
promises different things
for your future.

608
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,070
What does the right paw indicate?

609
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:22,614
Luck in love.

610
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,659
Thanks, Nicole.

611
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:27,453
Don't worry,

612
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:29,163
you'll find her.

613
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,542
I gotta go.

614
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:41,049
I'm not surveilling you again,
I promise.

615
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,385
I'm here on a personal matter,
I swear.

616
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,678
How can I help you?

617
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:46,472
Do you remember that whole...

618
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,600
not-giving-up thing
we were talking about earlier?

619
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:53,562
If I was to start trying now,
what exactly should I be doing?

620
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:54,938
First of all,

621
00:37:55,063 --> 00:37:57,274
this is for a prenatal vitamin...

622
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:58,650
That's all great.

623
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:03,822
I need something
a little more basic.

624
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,867
I'm actually gonna be
doing this alone

625
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,911
and the whole...

626
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:13,081
penis thing is kind
of a problem for me

627
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:16,668
'cause I don't like them.

628
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,838
You're gay?

629
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,965
- I'm super gay.
- Super gay?

630
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:24,927
And you need a sperm bank?

631
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:27,679
I know of a good one.
Cubit Fertility Clinic,

632
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,806
there's a doctor
by the name of Jane Parker.

633
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:31,975
Just tell her I sent you.
She's great.

634
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:34,937
Thank you, Dr Varley.
I really appreciate it.

635
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:36,104
No problem.

636
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:45,447
I tell you, you're gonna
love the ambulance, Dylan.

637
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:54,248
Mr Simcoe, I'm John.

638
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,667
Partner is Reed, we'll be
transporting you and your son.

639
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,709
Thank you.

640
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,003
- All ready to go?
- Dr Benford.

641
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:03,048
I just came to see you off,
make sure everything went okay.

642
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,133
Are you ready, little man?

643
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:08,095
He's ready, he's just a little shy.

644
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:11,682
I'm not sure if you've had
your training, but Dylan's autistic.

645
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,392
- We've had training.
- OK. Good.

646
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,436
Sweetie, are you ready to get in the
ambulance with these guys and your dad?

647
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:19,147
Come on, let's do it.

648
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,941
There we go.

649
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,528
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
I've got a secret for you.

650
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,197
Cool people call them ambos.

651
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:29,616
- Ambos?
- Ambos, that's right.

652
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,535
- Ambos.
- That's right.

653
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,413
You're gonna go for a ride
in the ambo.

654
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:37,249
Okay, all right.
No restraints, just on the legs.

655
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:38,917
It's alright, buddy.

656
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:40,711
Bye, Dylan.

657
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:43,213
I'll miss you, kiddo.

658
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:46,383
See you in a sec.

659
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:47,551
Thanks, guys.

660
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,556
So I guess this is the part
where we...

661
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:55,559
Wish each other a nice life.

662
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:57,728
Something like that.

663
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,939
Come here.

664
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:11,199
So, the many-worlds theory,
is that something you believe in?

665
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:14,661
Well, many physicists do these days.

666
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:16,371
You didn't answer the question.

667
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,499
And out of respect, I'm...

668
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,169
I'm not going to.

669
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:27,591
Thank you again, Olivia.

670
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:30,844
And goodbye.

671
00:40:34,806 --> 00:40:37,601
Wait. Hang on there.
Easy. Hang on there.

672
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,686
- Just get his legs in.
- No ambo!

673
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,564
Let go of his arm!
You said you were trained.

674
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:45,650
We don't have time for this.
Come on lady, we're on a schedule.

675
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,320
Excuse me?
Bill, can you get down here?

676
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:51,239
I don't know
what's going on here, but...

677
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,705
- No, please, don't hurt her!
- Get in the van, Mr Simcoe.

678
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,374
- I'll come with you. Please.
- Get in the van!

679
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,213
Dylan, it's gonna be okay.

680
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,761
Dad! No, Dad!
