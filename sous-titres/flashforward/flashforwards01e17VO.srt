1
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,801
I moved out of the house.
Olivia and me, we're struggling.

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,513
Daddy and I love each other very much.
But most of all, we love you.

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,166
I need to know exactly
what you saw in your flash-forward.

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,143
I wrote a formula on
your bedroom mirror,

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,271
I think it relates somehow
to the global blackout.

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,702
Tell me what I need to know,

7
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:24,565
- you can walk out of here.
- Who are you?

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,525
You don't want to know the answer.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,362
You, Agent Benford,
you will kill Agent Noh

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,821
on March 15th

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,485
with the very gun
you're carrying right now.

12
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,014
I filed the paperwork
to destroy the gun.

13
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:37,954
The box is here,
but the gun is gone.

14
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,832
Dyson Frost shot a homeless man
with Mark's gun.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,753
- Vreede, I want you to find that gun.
- You know more than you've told the FBI

16
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,255
and what you do know is somehow
related to Demetri's death.

17
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,092
Want to get married tomorrow?
Then we get on a plane. We go to Hawai.

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,177
Maybe we don't ever come home.

19
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,887
Dyson Frost, where are we?

20
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,598
We're closing in,
but he's always one step ahead of us.

21
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:58,517
<i>Benford?</i>

22
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,726
Dyson Frost.
I was anxious about coming in,

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,312
<i>but it's time we talk.
I'll be in touch.</i>

24
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:06,023
Hello, Charlie.

25
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,861
-= Blackout Team =-

26
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,211
Saison 1 - Épisode 17
-= The Garden of Forking Paths =-

27
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:50,571
Charlie-bear, we need you
to tell us what he looked like.

28
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:52,111
He was tall.

29
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,488
Do you remember what he was wearing?

30
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:56,338
A jacket.

31
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:58,021
What color was it?

32
00:01:59,049 --> 00:01:59,994
I don't know.

33
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,182
Did he have glasses or a watch
or anything like that?

34
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:06,714
I don't know.

35
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,753
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

36
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,756
We wouldn't be asking you
if it wasn't important.

37
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:15,092
What you say could help us
find Demetri.

38
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,464
She knows that, Mark. She's trying.

39
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:21,307
Charlie, you're doing really good.

40
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,641
Sometimes...

41
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:27,605
closing our eyes helps us
remember more.

42
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:29,398
You want to do that with me?

43
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:32,860
Good.

44
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,195
Come on.

45
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:38,574
- What do you see now?
- He knew my name.

46
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:41,911
<i>Hello, Charlie.</i>

47
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:44,320
But I didn't know who he was.

48
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:46,854
They make a mean cotton
candy here, don't they?

49
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:50,825
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

50
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,325
Well, I'm not a stranger.

51
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,717
If I were a stranger,
would I know your name?

52
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:00,834
I work with your daddy,

53
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:04,517
and I hear that you're a big reader.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Do you like Dr. Seuss?

55
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,196
Yeah.

56
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:10,648
Me, too.

57
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:12,983
You know, my favorite is

58
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:15,436
"One fish, two fish,
red fish, blue fish."

59
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:17,584
That one is for little kids.

60
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,216
Well, maybe.

61
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,487
You know, even grown-ups
can learn from that book,

62
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,712
'cause Dr. Seuss
has all the answers.

63
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,790
- I like Horton.
- Horton?

64
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:30,084
That's a good one, too.

65
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,128
I mean, Horton's a trouper

66
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,506
had faith to carry his mission
through to the end

67
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:38,134
even when others doubted him.

68
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:42,412
You know, Charlie,
I need you to do something for me.

69
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:49,368
I want you to give this
to your daddy.

70
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,389
Now it's very important.

71
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,982
Okay?

72
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,860
Bye-bye.

73
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:00,905
And then what happened?

74
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,826
Then he left.

75
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,335
- We should get going.
- We're done, right?

76
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,424
You did great.

77
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,278
We're so proud of you.

78
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:30,000
Sorry I didn't know
all the answers, daddy.

79
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,487
What are you talking about?
Come here. You were fantastico.

80
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,604
Yeah, you were a great help.

81
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,361
We should go.

82
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:41,780
It was good to see you.

83
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,256
- Thank you for coming in, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

84
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,253
You know, Charlie, there's one
more thing you could do for me.

85
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,279
I have this jar of jelly beans
on my desk and I hate jelly beans.

86
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,361
I know you probably hate
jelly beans, too...

87
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:03,844
- I don't hate jelly beans.
- You don't hate jelly beans?

88
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:07,133
Really?
Why don't you come help me out, then?

89
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:09,940
- Help him out.
- Come on and help me out,

90
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:11,374
then we'll be right back.

91
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,979
- So what's your favorite kind?
- I like the green ones.

92
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,391
That was fast.

93
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,261
She got so big.

94
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:22,792
She seems okay though, right?

95
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:25,756
I think so...

96
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:29,451
As far as you can tell what's going
on inside the mind of a 6-year-old.

97
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,430
She needs to talk to someone.

98
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:34,655
I really don't want that, Mark.

99
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,596
We have a child psychologist
that works here.

100
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,797
- Why not call her?
- 'Cause she doesn't need therapy.

101
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:42,800
She needs stability.
She needs to feel protected.

102
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,439
She needs to know
there aren't going to be scary men

103
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,888
asking her to deliver messages
to her dad.

104
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,330
She thinks you're gonna die, Mark.

105
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:56,480
Look!

106
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,566
- He let me have all the green ones.
- Yes, he did.

107
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,151
- Do you want one?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,982
- Can mommy have one?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:05,531
No, thank you.

110
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,883
Let's go, sweetie.

111
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:10,327
Zoey Andata to see Alda Hertzog.

112
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:19,676
<i>Officer Stillman to cellblock D.</i>

113
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:22,001
<i>Officer Stillman to cellblock D.</i>

114
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,691
Alda, it's march 15th,

115
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:27,966
the day that Demetri's
supposed to die...

116
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,920
he's gone missing.

117
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:33,841
Maybe he's just in Cabo
with his new girlfriend.

118
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:34,935
Alda, shut up.

119
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:39,223
I need you to tell me
everything that you know...

120
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:42,276
Everything, right now.

121
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,152
- I already have.
- I don't believe you.

122
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:48,581
The only reason

123
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:52,703
that I agreed to represent you
is because you said there was more.

124
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,956
I know that you don't care
if Demetri lives or if he dies.

125
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,055
But I think that you do care
about getting the hell out of here.

126
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,701
Alda, we made a deal.

127
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,523
If you know anything...

128
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,831
Please.

129
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,767
Get me a hearing and we'll talk.

130
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,494
I've been held here for five months
as a material witness,

131
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,122
and I haven't been charged
with crap.

132
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:24,496
- I'm sick of it.
- I know.

133
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,792
I applied for a habeas hearing
a month ago.

134
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:28,989
You know this.

135
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,998
We are just waiting
for a court date.

136
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,108
Guess you should try
to expedite things.

137
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:37,073
There is no way that we would ever
be able to get a hearing today.

138
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:39,351
Even if we could,
there's no judge that would be able

139
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:42,487
- to release you in time.
- Who said anything about being released?

140
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,422
You want me to tell you
what I know about Demetri?

141
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,019
Get me a hearing today.

142
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,388
Mark's gonna meet Frost in Union Station
like the drawing said,

143
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,558
but I want him covered.
We'll pick him up on the way out.

144
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,812
- It's not gonna be that easy.
- The trains stopped, he won't get out.

145
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,322
Frost is a genius, a planner.

146
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,400
He's not gonna walk into
what he knows is a trap.

147
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,652
Vreede, what do you got on the painting
Frost used to send his message?

148
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,225
"Oedipus and the Sphinx"

149
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,989
by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres,
1808.

150
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,783
Is Frost trying to tell us
something?

151
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,181
- It's a bit of a stretch.
- He may be crazy, but he's deliberate.

152
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:18,317
Could be meaning in
everything he does.

153
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:21,166
Why a carnival?
Why Dr. Seuss? Why Oedipus?

154
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,565
- He's in love with his mother?
- Right.

155
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,755
That, and maybe he's trying to tell us
something about self-fulfilling prophecy.

156
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,415
By trying to escape his fate,

157
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,270
Oedipus set into motion
the very events he wanted to avoid.

158
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,904
So by trying not to
get shot on march 15th,

159
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,682
- Dem just walked into Frost's trap?
- Something like that, yeah.

160
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,836
How do you know
that by trying to rescue him,

161
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,770
we're not gonna do the same thing
and end up sealing his fate?

162
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:44,152
I don't.

163
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:47,674
But I promised Demetri
he wasn't going to die today,

164
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:50,050
and I'm keeping that promise.

165
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,872
The man you're about to meet,

166
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,800
he's brilliant
but a little eccentric.

167
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:47,044
We had to fake his death in order
to remove him from the public eye,

168
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,171
and he's been difficult ever since.

169
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,044
So why rely on him?

170
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:53,284
Only a few people
understand the physics

171
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,385
involved in all this.
He's one of them.

172
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,024
Just know
that if he gets too unmanageable,

173
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,837
we may ask you to take care of him.

174
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:02,710
Say the word and consider it done.

175
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:07,346
That's what I like about you, Alda.
Clean, efficient and eager to please.

176
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:19,126
Careful of the dominoes.

177
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,366
- Who's your friend, Hellinger?
- Alda Hertzog,

178
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:36,759
this is Dyson Frost.

179
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:39,221
Dyson helped us engineer
the Raven River experiments.

180
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,468
Helped you?

181
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:44,434
I created them.

182
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:48,774
In any event, he's one of the few
remaining participants still alive.

183
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,484

Are we still on schedule?

184
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,834
October 6th.

185
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,007
I've set up
global monitoring stations

186
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:01,022
to track the waveform's propagation.

187
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,882
So if Simcoe and Campos
find their dark matter,

188
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:08,415
then we're on our way.

189
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,749
Is the QED ready?

190
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,089
The first one is.

191
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,011
The rest will take a bit more time.

192
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,764
That's astounding.

193
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,601
It's hard to imagine you're able
to fit that much microcircuitry

194
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,060
into such a small space.

195
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:29,815
I'm brilliant, right?

196
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,317
<i>There are a few people who understand
the physics involved in all this.</i>

197
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,209
<i>He's one of them. Just know
that if he gets, too unmanageable,</i>

198
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,289
<i>we may ask you to take care of him.</i>

199
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,328
I promise you that when the time comes,
I'll be half a dozen moves ahead of you.

200
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:46,035
Let's hope
that time doesn't come, then.

201
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,168
You can go now.

202
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:56,682
I just have to ask...

203
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:59,569
What's with all the dominoes?

204
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:02,763
This is my garden...

205
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,393
and the white ones

206
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,431
chart the path of my escape.

207
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:11,980
That makes no sense at all.

208
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,403
It does if you live in my head.

209
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:32,835
Careful.

210
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,554
You move too much,
the gun will fire.

211
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,552
I call it the garden
of forking paths.

212
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:44,974
All those lines...

213
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,308
They're futures that branch off
of each

214
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,310
critical decision I made.

215
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,483
For me it started back in the '80s...
A place called Raven River.

216
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,693
We engineered hundreds...

217
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,587
even thousands of flash-forwards.

218
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,657
Sometimes we jump 20 minutes.

219
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,701
Sometimes we jump 20 years.

220
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,746
But every time we jumped,
we saw a different possible future.

221
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,848
Take the day of the blackout.

222
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,290
Had we failed,

223
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:16,545
a different path
would have opened up.

224
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,006
We succeeded, so we move on
to the next decision point...

225
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:21,317
A new path,

226
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,081
which brings us to today...

227
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,755
March 15th...

228
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:29,057
The most important fork of all.

229
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:31,268
My murder?

230
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,187
Our murder.

231
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,784
You see, the thing is, Demetri,

232
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,570
in almost every future,

233
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,572
I don't live past today.

234
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,423
78% of the time,

235
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:47,065
you end up killing me.

236
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,951
Why?

237
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,035
Self-defense, stupidity, bad luck...

238
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,186
I could construct
a hundred scenarios.

239
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:53,540
The point is,

240
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,307
once we've glimpsed it,

241
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:57,618
the future wants to happen.
It gains weight.

242
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,589
It's like atmospheric
pressure bearing down.

243
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,345
If we want to escape that pressure,

244
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,383
we have to do something drastic.

245
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,720
Why the death trap?
Why don't you kill me?

246
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,764
Why even bother using Mark's gun?

247
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,415
I'm attempting to conform
to the predicted future

248
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,185
as closely as I can

249
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,206
while still allowing
for the possibility

250
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:17,814
that we both might live.

251
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,833
I want to come in from the cold,
and you're my insurance.

252
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:23,528
- That makes me feel better.
- Two birds,

253
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,450
one gun.

254
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:27,444
You're insane.

255
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,640
Most oracles are, you know?

256
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:35,693
They see the future,
and the knowledge

257
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,056
ends up destroying them.

258
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:43,507
I'm going now.

259
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,300
This is ridiculous.

260
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,272
You wanted to come in from the cold,
you want to share what you know.

261
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:49,971
Share what you know!

262
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:51,863
Careful.

263
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,853
I don't know what's gonna happen,
Demetri.

264
00:14:57,174 --> 00:14:58,712
But in all likelihood,

265
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:01,650
one of us will die today.

266
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,573
Come back.

267
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:10,700
Doesn't have to work out this way.

268
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:13,078
You hear me?

269
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:14,739
You come back!

270
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,864
<i>Bishop one, how's it going?</i>

271
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,782
We've cloned the station's CCTV

272
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,826
<i>for maximum coverage.
But so far,</i>

273
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,995
no sign of Frost.

274
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,662
Just make sure you don't spook him.

275
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,248
<i>We're being discreet, sir.
I promise.</i>

276
00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:01,167
<i>Last call. This is your last call
for the number 2 train</i>

277
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,905
<i>departing from track 10.</i>

278
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,140
<i>Bishop one,</i>

279
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,059
I see white male in a green army
jacket, approaching kingmaker.

280
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,766
<i>Disregard. He's moving on.</i>

281
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,794
That was the fastest
cholecystectomy I've ever seen.

282
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,165
Trying to catch up.
I got a late start

283
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,210
and a board full of elective cases.

284
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,511
Maneesh, what inhaled anesthetic
did you use?

285
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:47,589
Sevoflurane.

286
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,767
- Does anyone use halothane anymore?
- In developing countries maybe,

287
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:52,969
here it's pretty much
been replaced by newer agents.

288
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:59,017
Why the sudden interest
in old-school anesthesia?

289
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:01,034
It's complicated.

290
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,420
There's this formula
that Lloyd showed me.

291
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,761
He thinks it has something to do
with the blackout.

292
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,306
So you're talking to him again.

293
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,535
He thinks the formula for halothane
has something to do with it.

294
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:19,254
Interesting.

295
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,749
Can you meet me in the PICU?
I need to cannulate a kid for ECMO.

296
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,671
I knew you'd get a same day hearing
if you put your mind to it.

297
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,107
Hold here, please.

298
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,971
Is appendicitis supposed to
hurt on the right or the left?

299
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:37,418
Alda, please. I could
get disbarred for this.

300
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:40,947
Lost job, dead boyfriend.
Hard choice.

301
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,297
You arrange for all
these extra marshals?

302
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:49,708
- You must think I'm a big cheese.
- Don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.

303
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,897
This is standard procedure for all
of my lying psychopathic clients.

304
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,240
So just stay quiet
and follow my lead.

305
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:56,638
I'll be good.

306
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:57,896
I promise.

307
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,365
Dr. Benford?

308
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:07,043
What's happened?

309
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,280
Is Mark okay?

310
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:11,942
I need to talk to you
about a murder.

311
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,552
As a part of the investigation
into Dem's disappearance,

312
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:19,681
we're looking into the shooting
of a homeless man in a shelter downtown.

313
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,513
He didn't have any formal ID on him.

314
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:24,644
- What does this have to do with Dem?
- Mark's gun was used in that murder,

315
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,099
and we have reason the believe
that the man who took Demetri

316
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:28,469
has that gun now.

317
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,263
We were hoping
that if we could ID the guy,

318
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:34,112
we might uncover a connection to Frost
that would lead us to him.

319
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,448
So once you find Frost,
you'll find Demetri.

320
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,949
Right. I went through
the victim's stuff and...

321
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,744
found a disposable cell phone.

322
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,852
The phone had an old text message
sent to your number.

323
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,065
My number?

324
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,000
Why would he possibly
have my number?

325
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,543
It was from October.

326
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,545
The contents were sensitive.

327
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:55,967
It said, "Mark was drinking
in his flash-forward."

328
00:18:58,641 --> 00:18:59,896
Would you mind...

329
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:03,016
Just coming down to the morgue
and taking a look at the body?

330
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,934
You must know this man somehow.

331
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:09,064
Yeah, I'm sure I don't.

332
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:10,891
He knew you,

333
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,026
and anything you know
could help Demetri.

334
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,063
Let me change.

335
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,873
All bishops,
I have an african-american boy,

336
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:30,084
blue shirt, superman backpack,
approaching kingmaker.

337
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,629
Are you Mark Benford?

338
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,632
- That's right.
- Some weird guy

339
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,175
<i>paid me $50 to give you this.</i>

340
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:46,267
<i>Something's going down.</i>

341
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:50,480
Bishop five, pick up that kid outside
the West entrance for questioning.

342
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:52,019
<i>Bishop 5, 10-4.</i>

343
00:19:58,074 --> 00:20:00,406
<i>Don't speak.
I know they're watching you.</i>

344
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,534
They can't hear what I'm saying,
so just listen.

345
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,912
<i>I've got Demetri, and I'll kill him
if you don't do exactly what I say.</i>

346
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,956
Crank it up.

347
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,457
All I hear is ambient noise.

348
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,293
<i>I want to come in,
and I can tell you when</i>

349
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,213
and why
the next blackout will occur.

350
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,497
<i>I want to help you,</i>

351
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:19,384
<i>but because I've parted ways
with my associates, they're gonna do</i>

352
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,594
anything to ensure
that you don't bring me

353
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,805
- <i>in to custody.</i>
- We can protect you.

354
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,000
Don't speak!

355
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:27,475
<i>You speak again and Demetri's dead.</i>

356
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:29,185
If you understand,

357
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,985
<i>say "Figueroa".</i>

358
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:32,147
"Figueroa".

359
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:33,815
He said "Figueroa".

360
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:36,526
It could be Figueroa Street
in downtown L.A.

361
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:39,027
<i>That should
misdirect your friends a bit.</i>

362
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:41,425
<i>Now I'm gonna direct you
to a new location</i>

363
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,868
where we'll meet face-to-face
and discuss the terms of my surrender.

364
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:47,769
<i>When I hang up the phone,
this is what you're going to do.</i>

365
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,355
<i>All right, people.</i>
I want a tap on that cell phone now!

366
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,335
<i>We're scanning frequencies, sir,</i>
but there're too many in the station.

367
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,921
<i>Mark can draw him out, sir.
We need to give him some time.</i>

368
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,424
<i>Time is the one thing we don't have.</i>

369
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:02,051
<i>Now, Mark,
if all my directions are understood,</i>

370
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:03,920
say "Pico."

371
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,180
"Pico".

372
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,892
He said Pico and Figueroa.

373
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,769
I want two SWAT teams
to the intersection of Pico and Figueroa.

374
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:13,771
<i>Perfect. And that number</i>

375
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,149
that I jotted down
on the back of the Polaroid?

376
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,234
<i>Set your watch
to count back from it.</i>

377
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,906
Now you know
how long Demetri has left to live.

378
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,742
<i>Start running, Mark.
We'll see each other soon.</i>

379
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,080
<i>What's he doing?
Where's he going?</i>

380
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,333
He's leaving the concourse.
We can't lose him.

381
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:34,518
Go!

382
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,520
<i>Remember these instructions:</i>

383
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,716
<i>run to the men's room.
Throw the phone away.</i>

384
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,090
<i>If you bring a weapon,
Demetri will die.</i>

385
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,015
<i>There's a panel.
Inside you'll find</i>

386
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,850
<i>a zoomcar access card.</i>

387
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:56,179
- He's not here.
- What the hell is he doing?

388
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,098
I'm here.

389
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:25,426
<i>Start driving north.
I'll give you directions on the way.</i>

390
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:34,507
<i>What the hell is going on out there?</i>

391
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:35,782
He's running.

392
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:42,285
Your Honor, it is imperative
to Ms. Hertzog's well-being

393
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,070
that the metropolitan
detention center

394
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,598
order a CAT scan on her distended
and painful abdomen.

395
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:49,920
Ms. Andata,
the doctor on call at MDC

396
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,725
examined Ms. Hertzog,
not once but twice. Isn't that right?

397
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,885
- That is correct, Your Honor, but...
- And he's found no appendicitis

398
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,959
in either of those examinations.

399
00:22:58,285 --> 00:23:00,290
Now correct me
if I'm misreading the records.

400
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:02,069
I am misreading things?

401
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:03,817
Sorry. That's not what I meant.

402
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:07,610
But appendicitis
is responsible for over 20,000 deaths

403
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:11,389
- in the United States alone, and I...
- That's some very nice research,

404
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:15,059
but I'm afraid it's not relevant
to your motion, which is hereby denied.

405
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:18,479
And, Ms. Andata, I suggest
you think twice before you bring

406
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,067
another frivolous claim
into my courtroom.

407
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:24,736
I will impose sanctions on attorneys
who abuse the process.

408
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:27,081
Understood, Your Honor. Thank you.

409
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,545
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,789
Don't look so worried.
I didn't say we had to win.

411
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,616
Then tell me. Where's Demetri?

412
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:40,175
I don't know.

413
00:23:40,915 --> 00:23:44,589
But in my flash-forward, I heard
they found his body, in building seven.

414
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,674
Building seven?
What does that even mean?

415
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,195
That's all I know.

416
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:51,049
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- You're a smart girl.

417
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:52,805
You'll figure something out.

418
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,489
<i>Holding cell 4.
We got a breach in holding cell 4.</i>

419
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:13,075
<i>If you want to save Demetri,</i>

420
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,243
<i>you're gonna have
to come to me alone.</i>

421
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:18,748
<i>Head north on highway 57
into the Antelope Valley.</i>

422
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:21,872
<i>At the 31st mile marker,
you're gonna turn right</i>

423
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:23,669
<i>on an unmarked dirt road.</i>

424
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:27,419
<i>Follow the road 5 miles
till it comes to an end.</i>

425
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:30,718
<i>I left a compass for you
in the glove compartment.</i>

426
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:34,870
<i>Get a bearing north
and start walking towards</i>

427
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:36,891
<i>the Tehachapi Mountains for 1 mile.</i>

428
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,044
<i>If you make any outgoing calls,
or if anyone follows you,</i>

429
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:42,438
<i>Demetri will die.</i>

430
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:54,200
No dental records,
no identifying scars.

431
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:57,056
Even his fingerprints
were scrubbed off.

432
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:58,326
Scrubbed off?

433
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,011
This guy definitely
did not want to be identified.

434
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,759
Come on. Throw us a bone.

435
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:05,711
Is there anything distinct here
or unusual?

436
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,880
- Demetri is running out of time.
- Well, there is this.

437
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,009
Look at the limbic system.
Huge hippocampus.

438
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:16,173
I'm thinking our John Doe
could have been some kind of savant.

439
00:25:17,304 --> 00:25:19,803
Savants can develop
an enlarged hippocampus

440
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:23,229
- related to their memory capacity.
- Like a "Rain Man" sort of thing?

441
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,497
- Exactly.
- Sorry. I've never seen him in my life.

442
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
You sure?

443
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:31,737
There's a box of stuff
we found under his bed in the shelter.

444
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,357
It had an address book in it.

445
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:36,437
Perhaps there's something in there
that'll explain his connection to you.

446
00:25:36,562 --> 00:25:39,499
I'd do anything to help Demetri,
but I'm not connected to him.

447
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:41,140
Olivia, you are.

448
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:43,618
You just don't know how.

449
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,318
So here we are again, Mark.

450
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:35,486
Time for you and me
to save the world.

451
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:47,188
You got my messages
and followed the instructions.

452
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,606
I'm impressed.

453
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,368
- So I'm flattered.
- Where's Demetri?

454
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:54,493
Most of my associates
wanted you dead months ago.

455
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:56,948
But I resisted

456
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,243
because I wanted to see things
through to this day.

457
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,140
Why me?

458
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:03,579
Because I don't trust
the rest of the FBI.

459
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,207
- Nor should you.
- We found a mole.

460
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:09,544
And you think that makes you safe?

461
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:11,366
You have no idea.

462
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,507
Here.

463
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:17,969
Put those on, and we'll talk.

464
00:27:25,494 --> 00:27:28,373
- Mind if I have a little water first?
- Be my guest.

465
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,982
At this point,
it's Demetri's minutes you're burning.

466
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,879
Gasoline! It burns!

467
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,368
Siphoned from the gas tank.

468
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:43,744
Get up!

469
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:48,541
No more games, Frost.
Where's Demetri?

470
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,960
This is not the way
it was supposed to play out!

471
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:56,672
- Building seven.
- That's it?

472
00:27:56,797 --> 00:27:59,084
There's gotta be
a million building seven in Los Angeles,

473
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:02,224
- and how do we know it is Los Angeles?
- I'll run it through the system.

474
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:05,474
And of course, Alda could be lying.
Demetri told me, he warned me about...

475
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,692
Zoey, stop.

476
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,335
Sit, please.

477
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:14,398
I'm gonna have Janis
flag every building seven

478
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:17,320
in the vicinity of your house, the FBI
and the wedding chapel.

479
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,614
We'll start there, and we'll keep
sweeping until we find him.

480
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:21,741
How?

481
00:28:23,227 --> 00:28:25,036
How could you possibly
do that in time?

482
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:30,019
We have the most sophisticated
search technology

483
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:31,920
in the world.

484
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:35,379
And a team of agents
who won't rest until he's back safely.

485
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:37,654
We're gonna find him.

486
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:40,517
Listen to me!
I'm tired of playing around, Frost!

487
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:43,655
- Where's Demetri?
- You already know where he is!

488
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,931
I gave Charlie all the answers!

489
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,060
You gave my Charlie the answers?
What the hell are you talking about?

490
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,027
Get up. Get up!

491
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:56,411
Start walking.
We're running out of time.

492
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:59,195
I know! The whole world is!

493
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:00,514
Quiet. Walk!

494
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:03,449
But in the end,
you're gonna be saved

495
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,868
by the lady you see every day.

496
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,631
What are you talking about?
What? Start walking.

497
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,301
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

498
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:15,118
Move!

499
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,257
Someone followed you here.

500
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,550
No one followed me.

501
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,520
Not today, Mark.

502
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:44,156
Stay with me, Frost. All right?
You gotta tell me where Demetri is.

503
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:47,181
What's going on, Frost?
What's this all about?

504
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:48,667
What are you doing?

505
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,667
I did what I did...

506
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:53,290
for a reason.

507
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,469
How do I stop this?
What do I need to know?

508
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,118
What do I need to know?

509
00:29:57,243 --> 00:29:59,608
Tell me where Demetri is.
Stay with me, Frost.

510
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,112
Stay with me.
You gotta tell me where Demetri is!

511
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,811
I need Frost's car. Demetri!

512
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:56,579
Damn it!

513
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,486
Damn it.

514
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:07,251
Where have you been, Frost?

515
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:09,492
"Oedipus and the sphinx"

516
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:11,786
by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres.

517
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:13,191
Ingres.

518
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,689
<i>Proceed to the highlighted route.</i>

519
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,351
What brings you guys
to the neuroscience center?

520
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,604
Dr. Ebbing, we're investigating
the murder of a homeless man

521
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,190
in a shelter downtown.
We found something

522
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,970
of yours among the victim's
belongings when he died.

523
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:45,194
My address book,

524
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,988
- obviously, stolen from my office.
- We think the guy may have been

525
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,324
a savant.
Perhaps he was one of your patients.

526
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:54,747
It's possible.
He doesn't look familiar.

527
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,481
Savants are referred to me
from all over the country,

528
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:59,739
and any number of them
have eidetic skills.

529
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:01,240
That's photographic memory.

530
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:03,836
Some of my patients
are like human video cameras.

531
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:05,422
You know, they're compelled

532
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,509
to record staggering quantities
of information,

533
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:11,167
phone books, encyclopedias,

534
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,305
the entire Sunday "new York times."

535
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:16,308
So any one of your patients
could have lifted this phone book.

536
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,799
Exactly.

537
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,855
There's really no one particular person
who maybe stands out as a candidate?

538
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,023
Sorry.

539
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,998
- You're a trauma surgeon?
- Yeah.

540
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:27,945
Savants,

541
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:29,989
not your usual terrain, are they?

542
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:32,325
I guess I'm branching out.

543
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:39,957
<i>Turn left ahead.</i>

544
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,463
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>

545
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,527
Any luck finding Mark?

546
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,071
GPS request just came in
from Antelope Valley.

547
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,157
We could get a lead
on where he was going.

548
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,408
Do they have data?

549
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,160
- We're waiting.
- Why not...

550
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,703
It's not our satellite!

551
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,050
<i>I've got no time for explanations.
I'm at an abandoned army depot 46 miles</i>

552
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,690
northeast of Antelope Valley.

553
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:35,839
I'm standing in front of two dozen
or so warehouses.

554
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:39,058
Dem's inside one of them. If I don't
find him in three minutes, he's dead.

555
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,102
- Building seven.
- Building seven.

556
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,729
Seven? How'd you know?

557
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,899
Alda Hertzog. She told me it was
a very important piece of information.

558
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:48,942
None of these buildings
have numbers!

559
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,195
Yes, they do.

560
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,252
- What?
- Rooftops. <i>Mark, where are you?</i>

561
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:55,824
I'm three buildings up
from the South end of the complex.

562
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,494
They numbered them even/odd.
It's the fourth building on the right.

563
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:00,120
<i>Get an ambulance</i>

564
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,331
just in case.

565
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,932
Are you alone?

566
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,434
- I'm alone.
- Talk to me. What's going on?

567
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,020
- What is this?
- There's a rig with your gun,

568
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,147
and it's pointed at me.
I can't move.

569
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:29,858
You got about two minutes
and change to do something.

570
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,388
- Easy.
- All right.

571
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,988
Garage door auto-firing

572
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,032
- pistol.
- Easy.

573
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,827
There's wires on the barrel-sensors.
You monkey with any of that stuff

574
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,413
- or try to put anything between and...
- It fires.

575
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,706
- Right.
- It fires.

576
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,037
Okay. All right.
What are you doing?

577
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,546
I'll push back against the trigger
mechanism to see if I can try to...

578
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,871
try to do what?

579
00:34:50,996 --> 00:34:53,007
I can't stop the timer,
but maybe I can move

580
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,175
the gun.

581
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,870
This is it.

582
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,895
This is it. My hand.

583
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,063
My gun.

584
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,687
Just like Nhadra said.

585
00:35:16,634 --> 00:35:17,878
85 seconds.

586
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,324
No pressure.

587
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:22,258
Red and blue.

588
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:23,912
Tell zoey,

589
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,457
- tell Zoey I love her, okay?
- Tell her yourself.

590
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:30,711
Frost said Charlie gave me the answers.
"One fish two fish red fish blue fish."

591
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:32,981
"One fish two fish
red fish blue fish."

592
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:35,841
- Is that Dr. Seuss?
- One, two,

593
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,468
red, blue.

594
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,136
If I pull the wires in that order,

595
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,763
maybe I could try

596
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,223
- to disengage the gun.
- Mark.

597
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:45,809
Whichever way this goes,

598
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:49,104
no regrets, okay?
No looking back.

599
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,899
No regrets.

600
00:36:10,592 --> 00:36:11,460
No regrets.

601
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:22,596
It's gonna work.

602
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:23,889
If I can just move

603
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,057
the gun.

604
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,815
Sloppy work, buddy.

605
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,139
Bleeding all over yourself.

606
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,896
I'm just having an off day.

607
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,355
You okay?

608
00:37:13,526 --> 00:37:14,863
I'm friggin' great.

609
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:17,192
You should be.
It's march 15th, and you lived.

610
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,428
Frost said he saw different futures.

611
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:23,416
His map of the future.

612
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:25,506
He called it his,

613
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:27,536
garden of forking paths.

614
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:31,875
- You think it's safe to stand now?
- Only one way to find out.

615
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,770
Stay low.

616
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:36,855
On the count of three.

617
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,006


618
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:46,450
You gotta be kidding me.

619
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,144
Gotta love this guy.

620
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:53,936
Even in death,

621
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:56,305
he manages to screw us.

622
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:05,949
<i>Good thing Mark saved the day,
since all we found was a phone book.</i>

623
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,549
- Can I get a small...
- She'll have a small soy latte,

624
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:11,705
no foam, extra shot, half sugar,
half aspartame.

625
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:13,290
Now you say your thing.

626
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,671
Say it. Say the thing
you were gonna say. You say...

627
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,128
- How do you know my order?
- That's what you say.

628
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,730
I say I have stood behind you
in this line many times.

629
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:24,343
You always order the same way.

630
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,428
I've never ordered
from this cart before.

631
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,409
I have stood behind you here

632
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:30,218
in this line,

633
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:31,666
on this day,

634
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,320
many, many times.

635
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:36,440
And you always order the same way.

636
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:38,000
My name is Gabriel.

637
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,246
- You deserve a break today.
- Okay, hi.

638
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,319
My name is Gabriel.


639
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,315
Don't touch this.
You can't touch this.

640
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,438
It's about
the raven River experiments.

641
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:48,450
- The raven River experiments.
- What?

642
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,036
My friend wanted to talk to you about,
only he's dead now,

643
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,291
and it's up to me.

644
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,997
- What friend?
- My friend.

645
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:57,394
He's dead, although technically
he's still my friend. He texted you.

646
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,058
- What do you know about the text?
- The flash-forwards...

647
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:01,421
the blackout.

648
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,733
Sir, I think,
you need to come and talk to us.

649
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:06,677
No, you don't say that.
You never say that. Can't touch this!

650
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,042
Can't touch this!

651
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,013
Just a few questions.

652
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:11,807
The dominos are falling, Olivia.

653
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:45,376
You got through the day.

654
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:48,260
Boss.

655
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,456
- What was all this?
- This?

656
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:52,567
This could have been
the break we needed,

657
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:54,749
the key to the mosaic investigation.

658
00:39:54,874 --> 00:39:57,131
Frost's personal road map
of the future.

659
00:39:57,389 --> 00:39:59,899
According to Demetri,
the guy had hundreds of flash-forwards.

660
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:02,858
So this crazy-ass map charted
all the moments he saw

661
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,360
- leading up to today and beyond.
- What do you mean?

662
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:08,739
There were events on here
that occurred after April 29th.

663
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:11,241
- You remember any of them?
- A few.

664
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,369
One stood out, though.
It was all the way up by the top,

665
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,961
the furthest one from today.

666
00:40:16,086 --> 00:40:18,319
All the other various branches
seemed to lead to it.

667
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:21,197
December 12, 2016.

668
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,722
And after the date...

669
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:30,552
it just said "the end."

670
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:32,077
The end of what?

671
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:42,981
-= Blackout Team =-
