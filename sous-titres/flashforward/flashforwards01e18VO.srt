1
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,064
They got my daughter. She was here.

2
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:11,449
But Jericho found her
and took her back to Afghanistan.

3
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:13,429
- You're going to Afghanistan?
- Sure I am.

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,807
It's about the Raven River experiments.
My friend wanted to talk to you about.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,971
- He texted you.
- What do you know about the text?

6
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:21,854
The flash-forwards. The blackout.
We can't solve it without you.

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,732
We engineered thousands
of flash-forwards.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,829
We have to protect ourselves
from the effects of another blackout.

9
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:30,321
We have to anchor consciousness
if another wave happens.

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,282
You're gonna be saved
by the lady you see every day.

11
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,414
I have to get pregnant now.
I want that baby.

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,918
I want this specific child.
It was supposed to happen this weekend.

13
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,253
If it's baby-making,
I will take one for the team.

14
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:49,131
- That night in Somalia...
- Demetri, I'm pregnant.

15
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,842
I reviewed your Uncle Teddy's
autopsy x-rays.

16
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,304
You murdered him to send a message.
Message received.

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,182
I should have known.
Two moles, in case one is caught.

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,166
And not one person in the office
would suspect it's you.

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,636
<i>The yellow brick road.
A 6-mile killer obstacle course.</i>

20
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:14,429
<i>Every Quantico graduate dreads it,
but we all do it.</i>

21
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:17,393
<i>I never intended to be an FBI Agent.</i>

22
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:20,438
<i>I was a lawyer and hated my life.</i>

23
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:22,893
<i>Then I had this friend
who joined the bureau.</i>

24
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:25,693
- Stop being such a girl!
- Stop being such a bitch!

25
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:28,983
<i>I never thought of myself
as particularly patriotic.</i>

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,129
<i>But it sounded cool. I like the idea
of being part of something,</i>

27
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:35,798
<i>actually trying to make
the world a safer place.</i>

28
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:37,358
Nice going.

29
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,637
You're not gonna tell everybody
I almost didn't make it, right?

30
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,722
No, I'm just gonna show 'em
this picture.

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,357
Last one to the barbed wire
is a wuss.

32
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,595
That was a $5 camera!

33
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,612
<i>I loved it.
I loved every second of it.</i>

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,339
<i>Quantico made me strong.</i>

35
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:59,243
<i>It taught me what mattered,
and it showed me I'm capable</i>

36
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,023
<i>of tackling problems
I never thought possible.</i>

37
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:09,295
Of course, I've never lived
in Los Angeles, so...

38
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:11,630
we'll see how I survive this.

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,660
I'm sure you'll do just fine.

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,081
Are you married?

41
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:21,807
I don't really have time
for a serious relationship.

42
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:23,281
Good to know.

43
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:25,818
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:28,451
I've been going on and on.

45
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,691
What was your name again?

46
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:32,437
I'm Lita.

47
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,367
We'll take two more.

48
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:42,742
So what do you do?

49
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,166
I'm a headhunter.

50
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,383
I find talented people
like yourself and...

51
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:50,848
offer them opportunities.

52
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,835
I just started at the Bureau,

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,600
and I'm not really looking to quit.

54
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,352
Who said anything about quitting?

55
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:10,350
I know all about your job.
I'm talking about a little multitasking.

56
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,687
-= Blackout Team =-

57
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,865
Saison 1 - Épisode 18
-= Goodbye Yellow Brick Road =-

58
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,077
These are the blueprints and photographs
that Mark found on Frost.

59
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,996
The originals are being analyzed
by forensics right now.

60
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,042
The only other thing of potential
relevance is Frost's final <i>bon mot</i>...

61
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:33,488
"In the end you'll be saved
by the lady you see every day."

62
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:36,173
I can't speak
on be half of everyone,

63
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:40,094
but I'm still contemplating
the unbelievable fact that we had

64
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:42,638
the possible mastermind
of the global blackout

65
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,956
in our hands,

66
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:47,935
and just before he's able to divulge
any real information, he's killed

67
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:50,855
by a terrorist who,
just mere hours before,

68
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,636
was in our custody.
Now how the hell does that happen?

69
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:56,670
I don't know. What I do know
is Demetri Noh is alive.

70
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:58,371
Yeah,

71
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,276
and Aida's free again,
which means Demetri

72
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:04,618
was right all along that she's been
involved since the beginning,

73
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,640
even before you guys
started surveilling her.

74
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,684
Believe me, I want her back
as much as you do.

75
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:12,668
In the meantime, Frost did confirm
that there will be another blackout.

76
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,777
He was coming in from the cold,

77
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,723
and these blueprints are what
he was bringing with him.

78
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:20,275
That alone makes them vital
to our investigation.

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,401
This man was insane.

80
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,241
How do we know that anything
he's even giving us is credible?

81
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,399
Because crazy as he was,
he was always true to his word.

82
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:31,229
If you want to kick over
more anthills...

83
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,647
- This isn't about what I...
- Can we please dial back

84
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,024
the testosterone?

85
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,392
That's enough.

86
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:38,717
Thank you.

87
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:42,031
Janis is running point
on photos and blueprints.

88
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,949
High priority. Shel, Dem said

89
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,578
Frost referenced Raven River as the place
where the flashs started happening.

90
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,023
- See what you can find out about it.
- This tracks something

91
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,166
- I was already running down.
- So keep running.

92
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,420
When Demetri gets back,
he can jump in with you.

93
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,756
Look, we're clearly
on the right track.

94
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,898
The bad guys were obviously desperate
to keep us from getting to Frost.

95
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,486
Let's take that as a sign
we're getting warmer and push on.

96
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,226
Run his labs. Start an IV.

97
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,145
I'll be there in ten minutes.

98
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,068
Bye.

99
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:17,566
It's important!

100
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,197
How did you get in here?

101
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,716
- I know you.
- My husband is FBI.

102
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,739
There's an Agent out front.

103
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,156
- He's gonna take you...
- The pixies. You were there.

104
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:34,448
You were there.
You wore a purple beret.

105
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:37,461
The drink spilled on the lady in front.
She got mad. She got so mad.

106
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:41,298
I was there, too,
with my handler, Barry.

107
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,550
Barry lost his job for taking me
to a pixies concert.

108
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,277
- They closed with "wave of mutilation."
- The summer after med school?

109
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:49,014
I was at Scott's wedding
at the vineyard. Remember?

110
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,642
Your dress was turquoise.
You cried. It was sad.

111
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,978
It was so sad.
They served many corndogs.

112
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,522
I don't know who you are.
What do you want from me?

113
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,984
I'm Gabriel McDowell. I told you that.
I definitely said that already.

114
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,527
You have to remember things.

115
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,696
Like I said, my husband is FBI,
there's an Agent.

116
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,451
- He's gonna take you away.
- He's not your husband. 

117
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,152
- You know Lloyd? Lloyd is.
- What?

118
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,494
You should be with Lloyd.

119
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,704
I tried to stop you,
only you don't know that,

120
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,707
because I only tried to stop you.
I have to tell you all about it.

121
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,002
- It was a Thursday. It's at Raven River.
- Get the hell out of my house!

122
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,177
No, don't go! The proof
of the pudding is in the eating!

123
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:24,633
Don't buy coffee today from the man
that looks like Mr. Clean!

124
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,537
- Don't buy coffee today!
- Dan, there's a man in my house!

125
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:32,933
Janis, thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

126
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,189
I'm worried about your baby.

127
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:36,406
Why?

128
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:38,731
I thought you said
everything looked good.

129
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,596
You're anemic, and you haven't
gained enough weight.

130
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,902
I want you to see a perinatologist

131
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,876
to get a high-resolution ultrasound.

132
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,256
She'll make sure
that the placenta's okay

133
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:50,659
and the baby is growing.

134
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,286
What if it isn't?

135
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:54,813
First things first.

136
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:57,525
Get that ultrasound,
and get it soon.

137
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,558
You've got to protect your baby.

138
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,148
I can't believe
this is happening right now.

139
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,049
Yeah, but, Mark,
he was in our house.

140
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,191
- I could have been killed.
- <i>Charlie must have been terrified.</i>

141
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:11,670
- No, Charlie was already at school.
- <i>Why would this man be stalking you?</i>

142
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:14,668
I don't know. All I know is that there's
something incredibly wrong with him.

143
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:16,769
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- <i>Soon.</i>

144
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,145
Okay. Bye.

145
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,737
Ralph, what happened?

146
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,864
Some teenager driving and texting
jumped a curb

147
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:25,106
and hit a couple people
waiting for coffee out front.

148
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:27,348
He was going, like, 80.
Doesn't look good.

149
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:40,972
<i>Don't buy coffee today from the man
that looks like Mr. Clean!</i>

150
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:43,624
Oh, my God.

151
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,118
Can I help you, hon?

152
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:13,075
I'm looking for some
red flower dragon heads.

153
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,410
You mean some
red dragon flowerhorns?

154
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:16,562
Yeah.

155
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,292
Do you have any here?

156
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,504
I might. Do you have
a freshwater tank or saltwater?

157
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,424
I'm sorry. I was supposed
to ask for Carline.

158
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,838
That's me.

159
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:35,472
I'm Janis.

160
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,516
- Lita sent me to you.
- I know.

161
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,907
So let's get you set up
with an aquarium, shall we?

162
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:42,604
I don't actually
really need an aquarium.

163
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,402
I think a 5-gallon tank
ought to do the trick.

164
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,359
We got your blue coral here,

165
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,571
a power supply, air filter,
water conditioner, a couple of plants

166
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,739
and some incandescent bulbs.

167
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:55,868
- I'm confused.
- If you're going to be coming in here

168
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,579
every couple of weeks to talk to me,
then you need an excuse.

169
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,331
- Yeah, I don't really like fish.
- You do now.

170
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:05,627
So what do you think...
neon tetras or zebrafish?

171
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:08,380
The tetras, I guess.

172
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,601
I'm sorry. What exactly is it
that I'm supposed to be doing?

173
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,844
For now, your job.

174
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,811
Be the best special Agent
at the L.A. Bureau that you can be.

175
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:20,104
Watch, wait, win their trust.

176
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:23,312
And while you're at it, keep us
apprised of what they're up to.

177
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:26,899
Now these swordtails
can be very aggressive.

178
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:29,532
Sometimes they eat each other.

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
Fish are like that.

180
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:33,479
Here we go.

181
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:38,327
The photos that we found on Frost
are platinum prints,

182
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,663
which dates the photos
between 1890 to 1917.

183
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,489
But the guy from the Getty says

184
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:46,126
that it's likely the latter
part of that time period.

185
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,300
We were able to recover
two sets of prints...

186
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:51,156
Frost's, of course,
and Alda Hertzog's.

187
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,483
How would she have gotten
these photos?

188
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,469
Maybe she was with him
before he met with you?

189
00:09:56,677 --> 00:10:00,231
She barely would have had time to make
it to the desert before killing Frost.

190
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:02,100
They must have crossed paths
even earlier.

191
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,353
Another weird thing...

192
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,626
Forensics analyzed these photos

193
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,863
and the blueprints
for trace chemicals,

194
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:12,861
and they found particulate
matter specific to soil

195
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,489
in the Kunar province
of Afghanistan.

196
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:19,243
US department of agriculture
keeps a soil database.

197
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:23,038
What would Frost
be doing in Afghanistan?

198
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:49,481
Don't look so alarmed.
You will only draw more attention.

199
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,172
Who are you?

200
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:56,947
I'm here at the request
of our mutual friend Stanford Wedeck.

201
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,433
- You're Malik?
- You are looking for your daughter.

202
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:02,476
But now is not the time to exchange
biographies. We need to leave.

203
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:04,077
You already said that.

204
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:15,797
Those men over there...

205
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:18,760
One of them is making a phone call.
The best outcome of that call

206
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,175
is a man on his way here
to kidnap you.

207
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,266
The worst... That man with a bomb
strapped to his chest.

208
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:27,936
I believe that is what you call
a lose/lose situation.

209
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,985
You don't blend
as well as you think.

210
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:43,827
Thank you, Professor Corey,
for looking at these.

211
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,079
If these blueprints
can be authenticated,

212
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,665
this would be
an incredibly cool find.

213
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,628
Kind of reminds me a lot
of the antikythera mechanism.

214
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:54,595
I'm not familiar with that.

215
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,364
It's one of the great mysteries
of modern science.

216
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:01,136
It was a bronze artifact discovered
in the Mediterranean in 1901.

217
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,890
Turned out to be this incredibly
sophisticated sort of calculator

218
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,973
from second century BC Greece.

219
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:10,354
They've got it on display at the
National Archeology Museum in Athens.

220
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,648
And you think
this is something like that?

221
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,442
Yeah, looks like it.
The antikythera calculated dates

222
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,129
of solar eclipses.

223
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:21,323
But I'll be damned if I can figure out
what this calculates.

224
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,824
If you'll let me keep these,

225
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:26,958
I'll scan them, do some 3D imaging,
translate the ancient Greek and...

226
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,975
see what I can come up with.

227
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,789
Call me when you know something.

228
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:38,590
Who has copies of these?

229
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,135
We've got an antiquities Professor
studying the originals right now,

230
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,251
and Benford's
got a copy on his board.

231
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,522
Get them back.

232
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,015
What do you mean?

233
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,602
I mean get me the original and destroy
every copy that's been made.

234
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,633
What's so important
about this thing?

235
00:12:51,758 --> 00:12:53,980
I don't recall answering questions

236
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,816
being part of our arrangement.

237
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,909
The information goes one way,
period.

238
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:00,779
Get me these blueprints.

239
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,849
Sweetie, you want me to make you
that frozen pizza?

240
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,684
No. I'm all full on popcorn.

241
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:14,392
Okay.

242
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,354
What are you doing?

243
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:47,470
What are you doing, Janis?

244
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,577
I totally screwed up, Mark.

245
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,158
That's an understatement.

246
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,251
You broke into my office and you're
removing things from the mosaic board.

247
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,377
I know.

248
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,132
I'm an idiot.
Professor Corey called me.

249
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,385
- Professor Corey?
- The antiquities Professor.

250
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,466
He misplaced the blueprints
that I gave him.

251
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:15,484
So make him another copy.

252
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,225
I gave him the originals.
You have the only other copy.

253
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,604
You didn't check
the originals into evidence

254
00:16:22,437 --> 00:16:25,948
I had a doctor's appointment,
so I just brought 'em with me.

255
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:29,217
- How'd you get in?
- You gave me your passcode.

256
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:30,155
When?

257
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:34,439
That time you were
in Washington with Wedeck,

258
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:37,131
and you needed me
to get the Geyer file for you.

259
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,067
Right.

260
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,920
This is a rookie mistake, Janis.

261
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,673
Hand back the blueprints.
You can get your copies tomorrow.

262
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:50,419
You should know better.

263
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:52,973
I know.

264
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:55,133
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:04,522
I'm telling you, Shel, he seemed
to know a lot about me.

266
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,982
Look, there he is again.

267
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,760
And you don't know this guy?

268
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:09,569
No. I would have remembered him.

269
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:12,113
- That's weird.
- And he brought up Raven River again,

270
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,647
like he did the other day.

271
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,501
Do you have any idea what that is?

272
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:17,415
That's an interesting thing.

273
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,273
There's a suspect we were tracking
with the mosaic investigation.

274
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:23,667
He had mentioned something
about Raven River to Demetri,

275
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,285
so I did some research.

276
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,299
That's crazy.
Does Mark know about this?

277
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:29,255
I'm putting the report
together for him now.

278
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,133
There's a few Raven Rivers.
There's one in Wisconsin,

279
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,719
one in Illinois.
There's a tennis club in Ohio

280
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,226
- and a Raven River hospital in Arizona.
- What kind of hospital?

281
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:41,095
Psych hospital. It's been shut down
for about 20 years now,

282
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,421
and there was some controversy
in the late '80s... abuses.

283
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,606
- What kind of patients?
- Schizophrenics,

284
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,401
and they were the first hospital
in the country to deal with autism.

285
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,139
Autism?

286
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:53,154
What about savants?

287
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,835
She was trying to get away from them.
That's why she came home. But Jericho...

288
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,088
They got eyes everywhere.
Now they brought her back here.

289
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,019
- How you know they have not killed her?
- I know.

290
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,094
You have proof?

291
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:17,926
She's alive.

292
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,439
I've seen it.

293
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:24,689
You seem confident in your beliefs.

294
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:26,706
I envy you.

295
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,568
You must know that what you're asking
is no small undertaking.

296
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:34,070
Kandahar is not Baghdad, Mr. Stark.
It's not even Kabul.

297
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,353
Finding a single person anywhere
in this country is next to impossible.

298
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:39,934
There was someone else there,
he can lead us to her.

299
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,408
- Who?
- His name's Khamir Dejan.

300
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:46,207
He's a doctor, friend of Tracy's.
He knows the location where I found her.

301
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,543
We find him, he can lead us there.

302
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,296
It's not that simple. Even if he is
in this region, it will take time.

303
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,507
Where she was,
there was writings on the wall.

304
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:56,718
Does that mean anything to you?

305
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:59,555
Eyes on the Mountain.

306
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,683
It's a medical relief organization,
nongovernmental.

307
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,517
You said that Khamir was a doctor.

308
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:07,139
This group, they have bases
all over the country.

309
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:09,606
If he is working for them,
we can find him.

310
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,253
And the roadblocks?

311
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,638
I know all of them.
I know how to get around them.

312
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:14,778
Where do we start?

313
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,863
We head South towards the mountains.

314
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:27,415
I've seen the test results
from Dr. Weaver.

315
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's have a look, shall we?

316
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,044
There's your baby, and...

317
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,422
- there's the heartbeat.
- Is she okay?

318
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,133
Is she too small?

319
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:39,162
No, the head size is normal.

320
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,632
Placental blood flow, it's okay.

321
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,516
But the abdominal girth
isn't what I'd want to see.

322
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,645
Your work is very demanding, but you're
going to need to take care of yourself.

323
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:52,701
Get eight to nine hours of sleep,
eat a high-protein diet and...

324
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,573
reduce your stress.

325
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,559
Those are not supposed
to be on in here.

326
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,700
I know life is complicated.
Everyone's is. But the health

327
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,537
of your baby depends on your ability
to stay off your feet

328
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,705
and lower your stress.
I'm serious.

329
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,707
Otherwise, you could lose this baby.

330
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:14,337
I'm sorry. I have to take it.
It's my boss.

331
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,224
Professor Corey's
sitting in my office,

332
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:21,052
and he's just given me some
very interesting information.

333
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,183
<i>I think you better get back here.</i>

334
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,034
Professor Corey.

335
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,146
Ms. Hawk. Weirdest thing
happened yesterday.

336
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,808
There was a power failure
in the entire building,

337
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,617
- erased every hard drive in the joint.
- Really?

338
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:39,779
And I can't seem to find
those blueprints you gave me...

339
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:43,074
Which is why

340
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,325
it's a damn good thing I took pictures
on my phone and printed 'em out.

341
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,788
- I wanted to get a head start.
- Great.

342
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:52,292
I did some quick and dirty
3-d imaging

343
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,811
of the device. Seems to be some kind
of mechanical,

344
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:56,629
astronomical clock...

345
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,300
with gears and levers designed
to calculate a certain date,

346
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,552
- or rather, a series of dates.
- What dates?

347
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:04,262
When I do the math,

348
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,556
the first date I keep coming up with
is October 6, 2009...

349
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,084
The date of the blackout.

350
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:18,735
It's Benford. Get Wedeck.
Suspects are on the move.

351
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:21,175
- I'm putting you on speaker.
- What do you got?

352
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,032
Khalid, Omar
and an unidentified Caucasian woman.

353
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,491
We're e-mailing you pictures.

354
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:28,411
Who is she?

355
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:30,755
<i>That's the "unidentified" part,
sweetheart.</i>

356
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,540
Get these to digital forensics

357
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,083
and run 'em by ISOT.

358
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,251
Thanks.

359
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,949
<i>You've had a partial abruption,
Ms. Hawk.</i>

360
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,778
<i>The good news is
you've stopped bleeding.</i>

361
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,072
<i>You're gonna have
towatch your physical activity</i>

362
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,699
<i>from here on out. Do you want to know
the sex of your baby?</i>

363
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,202
<i>Well, considering
the circumstances...</i>

364
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:22,516
You guys okay?

365
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,316
I want out.

366
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,735
It's normal to be upset.

367
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,108
Millions of people
died yesterday, Carline.

368
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:27,673
I lost friends,

369
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,198
people I know and work with.

370
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,826
Nobody told me this was the plan
when I was recruited. You said

371
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,570
there was gonna be an event,
but you never said it'd be like this.

372
00:23:34,695 --> 00:23:37,081
- Did you know this was gonna happen?
- I don't answer questions.

373
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:39,500
We've already been over this.

374
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:43,217
I don't want to do this anymore.

375
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:45,186
I want out <i>now.</i>

376
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,427
I'm really sorry you feel that way,
Janis, but you can't get out.

377
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:52,782
You're in way too deep.

378
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,433
Surely you're bright enough
to realize that.

379
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,699
It's funny.
I never heard you complaining

380
00:23:57,824 --> 00:24:01,355
when you were pocketing all that money.
You didn't think there was a price?

381
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,015
You're a despicable person.

382
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,275
Man up, sweetheart.

383
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:06,059
This is what we do,

384
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:09,167
and even if I wanted to cut you loose,
that's not my call to make.

385
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,286
Then I want to talk to
the person whose call it is.

386
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:12,658
That's not gonna happen...

387
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:15,344
Ever.

388
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:20,918
If I were you,

389
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,376
I'd go on home,

390
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,711
pour yourself
a couple of stiff ones,

391
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,061
lick your wounds,

392
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:29,569
because tomorrow I expect you
back in here spilling your guts.

393
00:24:47,113 --> 00:24:49,646
It's like the setting in one
of those slasher movies.

394
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:52,621
I'm more of a Clint Eastwood
type guy, myself.

395
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,742
I hope you told someone
where we were going.

396
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,267
So they'll know
where to find our bodies?

397
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:09,885
Here you go.

398
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:11,676
Thank you.

399
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,189
Mildew.

400
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,723
I'm gonna look around down here.

401
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:41,906
You call me if you get lost.

402
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:11,321
You're not gonna find...
what you're looking for there, Olivia.

403
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:17,952
I knew you'd be here.

404
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:21,204
You're always here.

405
00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:28,377
I'm heading out.

406
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:30,972
What's up with you?

407
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:32,613
You've been distracted.

408
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:34,008
You haven't been yourself.

409
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,102
You've been coming in late,
disappearing for lengths of time.

410
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,192
What is it?

411
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:54,833
I'm pregnant.

412
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,651
That's...

413
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,421
Congratulations.

414
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:07,079
Your flash-forward
really is coming true.

415
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:10,757
And there was...

416
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:13,673
a question
of the health of the baby.

417
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:15,372
So I just...

418
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,894
I don't know.
I guess I just lost it.

419
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:20,089
I lost my edge.

420
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:23,533
But I'm okay.

421
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:25,977
Everything's good.

422
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:28,588
Great.

423
00:27:29,345 --> 00:27:32,650
Mark, I just hope that you know
you can still count on me.

424
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:37,196
I never doubted that.

425
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:40,453
Thanks.

426
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,279
You know,

427
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:47,081
I can't stop thinking about Frost's

428
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,604
last words...

429
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,998
"In the end, you'll be saved
by the lady you see every day."

430
00:27:51,123 --> 00:27:52,703
What the hell does that mean?

431
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,964
That means I'm gonna save your ass.

432
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:02,056
I don't know. Maybe it means
Olivia's gonna save my ass.

433
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:04,265
Let's go over this again.

434
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:06,225
What do we know about Dyson Frost?

435
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:08,561
We know he went
under the alias "D. Gibbons."

436
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,938
And he played chess brilliantly.

437
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,524
And faked his own death
once upon a time.

438
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,110
<i>D. Gibbons escaped.
We got a white queen.</i>

439
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:19,796
Chess...

440
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:24,242
The lady you see every day.

441
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:28,758
In chess,

442
00:28:30,204 --> 00:28:31,834
the queen's known
as the lady, right?

443
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:00,446
Crazy son

444
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,406
of a bitch was right.

445
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:16,504
Your family?

446
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:18,961
I'm taking you where you want to go.

447
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,165
What else do you need to know?

448
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,322
How about what you saw?
That's a start.

449
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:27,100
My wife and daughter...
we're in a car together.

450
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:30,148
We black out. The car
goes over the embankment.

451
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:33,232
I survive. It doesn't matter
what I saw.

452
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:37,274
A future without them
is no future at all.

453
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:40,703
I'm sorry.

454
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:44,055
You know,

455
00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:47,706
I envy that you believe
in the possibility of good.

456
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:12,768
Taliban?

457
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,781
I don't know.

458
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:16,582
I thought you knew all the factions.

459
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:18,433
Isn't that why Wedeck
sent you to me?

460
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,360
I don't know this one.

461
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:24,447
I'll take care of it.

462
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:48,656
Khamir?

463
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:51,992
How'd you find me?

464
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:53,723
Well, you...

465
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:56,163
Don't blend in as well as you think.

466
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,211
My friend...

467
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:04,680
the one who texted you...
He was here.

468
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,138
We were here.

469
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:08,646
He was here.
We were here together.

470
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:09,771
You okay?

471
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,629
Do you understand now?
Tell... you understand?

472
00:32:12,754 --> 00:32:14,056
I don't understand anything.

473
00:32:14,318 --> 00:32:16,680
How did you know
about the car accident at the hospital?

474
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:18,401
- I saw it.
- What did you mean

475
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,541
when you said that I made a mistake
about Lloyd?

476
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,083
It's what I saw.

477
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:25,150
<i> Lloyd and Olivia sitting in a tree,
k-i-s-s... </i>

478
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:29,347
It's what I saw.

479
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:31,011
You saw it?

480
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,615
- This is where they did it.
- Gabriel, where are you going?

481
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,457
This is where they did it.

482
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:47,778
This is where they did it.

483
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:50,467
- They did what?
- This is where they did it...

484
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:53,778
The experiments.

485
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,443
What experiments?

486
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:58,726
Every other day for two years...

487
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:00,137
We came here.

488
00:33:00,418 --> 00:33:01,770
They put us to sleep.

489
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,194
They put us to sleep.

490
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,110
I never knew where I'd end up.

491
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,532
Sometimes it was a short trip.

492
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:16,166
I was eating a tuna sandwich.

493
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,454
Cat jumped on the table.
Kitty likes tuna.

494
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:21,206
Sometimes it was a long trip.

495
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,076
He watches from there.

496
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:25,962
Who?

497
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
The doctor...

498
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:29,876
Frost.

499
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,108
Dyson Frost?

500
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:42,700
He told us we were special

501
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:45,876
'cause we could remember things...

502
00:33:46,697 --> 00:33:47,858
everything.

503
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:51,677
And then when we came back,
we had to write it all down,

504
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:54,323
every little detail.

505
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,482
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

506
00:33:57,865 --> 00:33:59,260
The flash-forwards?

507
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,673
You're talking about flash-forwards.

508
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:07,099
He said we were special
because we could remember the future.

509
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:10,464
I said that already.
Did I say that already?

510
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,674
- I'm sorry I said that already.
- It's okay.

511
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:17,330
You are special. You're a savant.
You all were.

512
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:19,390
He used you
for your eidetic memories

513
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,279
like human recorders.

514
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,429
When they finished with us...

515
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,186
When they used us all up...

516
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:31,709
he told them to kill us

517
00:34:32,189 --> 00:34:33,570
so we wouldn't tell.

518
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:36,900
He's dead now.

519
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:41,107
You don't have to be afraid of him
anymore.

520
00:34:46,052 --> 00:34:48,291
The early worm catches the bird.

521
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,459
I've been waiting.

522
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,631
Why have you been following me?

523
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:54,596
It's an emergency.

524
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,889
You're going the wrong way.

525
00:34:58,252 --> 00:35:00,186
So I have to turn you around,

526
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:02,641
- 'cause you're going the wrong way.
- What wrong way?

527
00:35:03,153 --> 00:35:05,644
In the futures I saw,
I always saw you.

528
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,731
- Me?
- Yes, and you're always with Lloyd.

529
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:09,797
At Harvard,

530
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,693
by the pipe shop,
I tried to smoke that day,

531
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,737
but I threw up.
And we were friends.

532
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,905
We were friends because
I was the janitor.

533
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,069
I didn't go to Harvard.
I came to California.

534
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:21,296
I went to UCLA. I married Mark.

535
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,204
In the futures I saw,

536
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:25,956
you're supposed to be with Lloyd.

537
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,667
You're always with Lloyd,
not that other one.

538
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,838
Harvard was a fork in the road.

539
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:34,811
You have to listen to me.

540
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:37,858
You have to remember these things,
because they're important.

541
00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:39,970
You have to be here
for things to come.

542
00:35:40,248 --> 00:35:43,265
You're a piece of the puzzle.
They can't solve it without you!

543
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,481
Gentlemen,

544
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:52,274
it's been PET scanned,

545
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:55,027
CT scanned and subjected

546
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,279
to neutron emissions analysis.

547
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,947
What is it, some kind

548
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,242
- of little electronic Kryptonite?
- No, this is more complicated.

549
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:05,763
Our analyst is saying it makes
our current tech look kind of primitive.

550
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:07,539
They have no idea what it is.

551
00:36:07,837 --> 00:36:10,404
That's why I've invited
Simon and Lloyd to join us.

552
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:12,677
Suspect zero has one, too.

553
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,089
You think he
and Dyson Frost were working together?

554
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,926
Possibly. We know that D. Gibbons, Frost
made numerous calls during the blackout.

555
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:20,344
As far as we know,

556
00:36:20,618 --> 00:36:23,729
they were the only two people
in the world awake during the blackout.

557
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:26,433
Suspect zero was wearing a ring,
and Frost

558
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,241
had this one in his possession.

559
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,476
It's a QED.

560
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:35,823
What?

561
00:36:35,948 --> 00:36:38,027
A quantum entanglement device.

562
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,144
My God. It exists.

563
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:44,061
This is what we were discussing
in our flash-forwards.

564
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:46,206
English, gentlemen.
English, please.

565
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,996
Let's start with the basics.

566
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,207
Theoretically, Frost and his pals

567
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,469
ramped up our linear accelerator

568
00:36:52,594 --> 00:36:54,086
to such extreme energies

569
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,880
that it sent shock waves through
the consciousness field

570
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,125
and jolted all
of humanity's awareness

571
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,302
to a different place in space-time,
the flash-forward.

572
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,672
Now suspect zero

573
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:06,922
and Frost were awake during
the time of the blackout,

574
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,934
correct?
They were in some way protected.

575
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,353
- Clearly. So you think this ring...
- is a device

576
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,481
which anchored their minds
to their current location in space-time.

577
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,650
In other words,
it helped them stay conscious.

578
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,430
You're saying this little thing

579
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:21,113
kept those guys from blacking out?

580
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,743
Maybe this is why they were so anxious
to attack our offices on April 29th.

581
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,383
Maybe they weren't coming for me.
But for this.

582
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:32,746
And now that we know that,
we can figure out a way to stop them.

583
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,561
Mr. Vogel?

584
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:56,634
I was told to meet you

585
00:37:56,903 --> 00:37:58,485
by assistant director Bramwell.

586
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,693
Yes, Ms. Hawk.

587
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,278
Please sit.

588
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,577
Congratulations on graduating today.

589
00:38:09,127 --> 00:38:12,033
Surviving Quantico
is no small accomplishment.

590
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:13,707
Thank you.

591
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:17,731
I was told this is about
a special assignment,

592
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,381
but I'm actually starting
in the L.A. office next month.

593
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,675
I'll get right to the point.
I'm not with the bureau.

594
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:26,762
As I'm sure you're aware, historically,
the bureau and the agency

595
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:29,736
haven't always cooperated
as closely as they

596
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:31,424
might have.

597
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:33,393
We're trying to change that.

598
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:34,954
You're CIA.

599
00:38:37,134 --> 00:38:39,454
As a part
of a still-classified operation,

600
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,693
we've assessed your graduating class

601
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,404
and found half a dozen candidates
potentially vulnerable

602
00:38:44,726 --> 00:38:46,917
- to hostile recruitment.
- And I'm one of them?

603
00:38:47,937 --> 00:38:50,827
Your financial situation,
your sexual orientation,

604
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,629
your unconventional upbringing,
they all make you a potential target.

605
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:58,000
That's ridiculous. You're wrong.
I would never betray my country.

606
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:01,598
I would never betray a fellow Agent.
You have the wrong person, Agent.

607
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:03,436
We know.
We've done our homework.

608
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:06,764
Your reputation amongst your classmates
and your instructors is impeccable,

609
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:10,389
and Bramwell says you're one of
the finest students he's seen in years.

610
00:39:14,112 --> 00:39:15,978
- I don't understand.
- We need a dangle.

611
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:19,045
We know something big is going down,
something

612
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:22,338
that will make 9/11 look like
a Fender bender. We need

613
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:24,448
someone on the inside.

614
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:28,467
Now we have reason to believe that
an organization may approach you soon

615
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:30,742
and ask you to be a mole
in the L.A. office.

616
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:32,229
We...

617
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,619
want you to say yes.

618
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:37,749
You want me to be a double Agent?

619
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:39,546
Yes.

620
00:39:43,742 --> 00:39:46,174
I'm not gonna kid you, Janis.
It won't be easy.

621
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,551
They'll manipulate you.

622
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,095
They'll use you in ways
you can't imagine.

623
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,710
You'll know things,
but you won't be able to tell anyone.

624
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,227
You'll be in constant danger.

625
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,062
You'll betray your friends,

626
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,024
and there may come a time when they
ask you to do something which goes

627
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,860
against everything you believe in
and care about. You're gonna have

628
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,196
to do it to win their trust
and stay on the inside.

629
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:12,117
Do you think you're capable of doing
what you have to do?

630
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:20,927
So they have the ring.

631
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,045
It's been on Mark's board
since Utah.

632
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,920
- You're gonna have to get it back.
- How am I supposed to do that?

633
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:27,507
It's in a well-fortified vault

634
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,926
in the basement of the FBI,
for God sakes.

635
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:33,180
You keep asking me to do this impossible
stuff, I'm gonna blow my cover.

636
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,351
I know you've grown to like these people.
They're like family to you,

637
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,104
and this understandably
is hard for you.

638
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:43,928
But you failed
to follow Benford to Frost,

639
00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:46,916
and you failed in destroying
the blueprints, which was

640
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:48,403
most unfortunate.

641
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:51,849
I would not make a third mistake,
Janis.

642
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:55,564
This is where you get to prove
your dedication to the cause, darlin'.

643
00:40:58,172 --> 00:40:59,531
I'll get the ring.

644
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:03,335
And, Janis, one more thing.

645
00:41:04,617 --> 00:41:06,338
We need you to kill Benford.

646
