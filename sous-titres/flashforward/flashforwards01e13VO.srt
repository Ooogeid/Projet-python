1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,924
In my flash-forward,
I saw that I was pregnant.

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,469
I have to conceive him next week
to match what I saw.

3
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,643
There's a guy we've been investigating.
We've been calling him D. Gibbons.

4
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:17,892
- Charlie said: "Gibbons is a bad man."
- You haven't asked her about him?

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,047
I've tried.

6
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:20,853
She's... shut down.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,605
Everything bad we saw was in L.A.

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,371
What if we just ran upped
and moved away?

9
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,068
Ganwar Region, 1991.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,947
There were anecdotal reports
of a mass loss of consciousness.

11
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,783
- Photos show five towers.
- I designed them.

12
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,785
You can't make sense of the tower
without me,

13
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,244
and you know it.

14
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:51,823
Okay, try this one...

15
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,222
It means:

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,890
"I don't eat dairy".

17
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:00,629
Okay. Try this one...

18
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,961
It means: "What did you see?"

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,593
So...

20
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:12,279
I was baking bread.

21
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:13,562
Bread!

22
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,848
And you?

23
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:18,244
I was water-skiing.

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,101
Good for you.

25
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:22,842
I thought this weekend

26
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:24,834
you were supposed to "bake bread".

27
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:29,380
Vogel's little field trip
kind of closed the window on that.

28
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:54,989
I want a gun.

29
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,845
It's not happening.

30
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,314
Going into Somalia without a gun

31
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,787
is like going scuba diving
without an oxygen tank.

32
00:02:03,632 --> 00:02:05,583
You're here in an advisory role.

33
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:07,779
They're here to back us up.

34
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:09,512
I suggest you stick close to 'em.

35
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:12,460
Let's get to the tower
and get out of here.

36
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,742
Come in.

37
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:29,231
- What is that?
- The Hydra...

38
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,650
seven heads,
bad breath, killed by Hercules.

39
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:33,152
Why am I looking at it?

40
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:34,743
D. Gibbons,

41
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:37,031
Dyson Frost,
Simcoe gave us his name.

42
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,161
Here's the rest of the story.
Brilliant, reclusive particle physicist

43
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,347
trained in engineering at M.I.T.,

44
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:45,873
minored in victorian lit.

45
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:47,041
An achiever.

46
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,918
Typical story...
domineering father,

47
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,754
only spoke to him in French
even though they grew up in Wyoming.

48
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,882
Became a chess grand master at 15.

49
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:58,803
- The chess piece you found in pigeon.
- The white queen.

50
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,306
He still plays,
which is weird considering he was killed

51
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,371
in a boating accident in 1990

52
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:07,414
on a boat called
<i>Les monstres de Boisteau</i>...

53
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:09,939
- Boisteau's monster.
- Who's Boisteau?

54
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,441
Pierre Boisteau...
18th century French writer.

55
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:14,777
He had illustrations of monsters
in some

56
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,161
of his books.
Among the more well-known... the Hydra.

57
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,908
The Hydra.
On my board on the 29th.

58
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,037
It's all leading back to frost. Somehow,
he's even part of Charlie's vision.

59
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:26,789
Charlie saw him?

60
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:29,041
D. Gibbons is a bad man.

61
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,711
"D. Gibbons is a bad man." That's all
I've been able to get out of her.

62
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:35,846
Everything we know about him
is coming to a head, and all we've got

63
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,051
are blind alleys and cryptic messages.
What am I supposed to do with that?

64
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,721
Be like Hercules and slay the beast.

65
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:45,243
Keep looking for Dyson Frost.

66
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,230
There it is.

67
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,232
"Abandon hope,
all ye who enter here."

68
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:01,837
Keep movin'.

69
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:05,703
It's not so bad here. A bit sleepy.

70
00:04:06,023 --> 00:04:07,783
A little hotter than I expected.

71
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,018
Awaale, we need you to translate.

72
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,687
Tell them we're aid workers
with Red Panda resources,

73
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:33,397
a relief organization,

74
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:37,651
protected under articles 59 through 63
of the Geneva convention.

75
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,070
He have a right
to humanitarian access.

76
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,141
My name is Abdikalif.

77
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,418
I speak english.

78
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:21,028
You don't need him anymore.

79
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:45,886
I know you.

80
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,931
I saw you on Al Jazeera telling
the world you caused the blackout.

81
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:52,393
Always nice to meet a fan.

82
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,775
You did not cause this.
God caused this.

83
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:03,153
He merely put your finger
on the button.

84
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,613
We are employees...

85
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:08,617
of Red Panda.

86
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,160
We're on a relief mission

87
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,996
to deliver cholera kits.

88
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,289
This man is not a relief worker.

89
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,418
We were having mechanical problems.

90
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,878
If you just let us
continue on to our destination...

91
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,463
Do not lie to me!

92
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,259
This was your destination.

93
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,512
You arrived at your destination.
You came here for a reason...

94
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,348
like the others.

95
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:35,853
What others?

96
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,897
When I was a boy...

97
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,987
the foreigners came to our village,
told us they would bring us electricity.

98
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:49,186
They said five towers would provide
power until the end of time,

99
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,921
that it was a humanitarian act.

100
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,752
But those towers
were not for electricity.

101
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:58,739
They were for something else,
something not humanitarian.

102
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:01,685
I had gone out to tend the goats.

103
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,298
I was not away long,
only a few moments.

104
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,259
But even a single moment
can change...

105
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,556
everything.

106
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,769
What happened...

107
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:18,713
It made no sense.

108
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:22,357
I felt afraid.

109
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,392
They were there, but...

110
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:28,431
they were gone.

111
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,419
But it was all part of God's plan...

112
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:45,219
this I learned from my mother...

113
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:49,433
everything in this life
happens for a purpose.

114
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:53,972
And before the hand of death
could take hold of me, too...

115
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,874
I ran.

116
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,965
Let me go!
Come on. I'm just the pilot!

117
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,574
That man, for instance,

118
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:14,660
is here for a purpose.

119
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:23,680
And now, he has served it.

120
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:29,299
You are here for a reason,

121
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,760
and I will kill you...

122
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:33,123
all of you...

123
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:35,639
if you do not
tell me what that reason is.

124
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:03,689
Damn.

125
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,219
- I'm so sorry.
- It's not a big deal.

126
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,279
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

127
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:20,392
- A little light reading?
- I like the pictures.

128
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,503
Seriously?

129
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:22,697
Orgo?

130
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:25,560
Just shut up for a second.

131
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,106
I'm kind of...

132
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,106
- I'm thinking about possibly...
- Thinking about possibly what?

133
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,409
I'm trying out a pre-med class.

134
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:39,912
So that's the big secret?

135
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:43,124
I don't want people to know about it
because it's really hard,

136
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,292
and I don't want them
to see me fall on my face.

137
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,900
"Dr. Kirby."

138
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:50,255
- It's got a nice ring to it.
- That's very funny. Thank you.

139
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,603
Seriously,
that's the most difficult thing

140
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,760
about becoming a doctor,
is picking the right name.

141
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:59,162
I mean, take me, for instance.
My real name is Martin Goathead.

142
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,644
- You're an idiot.
- Really. Martin Goathead.

143
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,091
I think I like
"Bryce Varley" better.

144
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,232
Of course you do. It sounds rugged.

145
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,694
It's like a guy
that eats protein bars

146
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,576
and climbs mountains...
"Dr. Bryce Varley."

147
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:17,874
Promise me you won't
tell anybody, please.

148
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,606
Nicole, I wouldn't do that to you.

149
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:21,769
Are you sure you're all right?

150
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:24,206
Look at you.
Diagnosing patients already?

151
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,166
I'm fine.

152
00:10:26,654 --> 00:10:29,336
Look, I gotta run, Dr. Kirby.

153
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:31,075
Dr. Goathead.

154
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:37,129
Why don't we just tell 'em who we are
and why we're here.

155
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:38,470
We're not breaking cover.

156
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,705
He's not buying the Red Panda bit,

157
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,335
and I'm not gonna sit around
waiting for a bullet in my head.

158
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:45,587
Right.

159
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:48,256
'cause you're waiting
for three to the chest.

160
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:51,692
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

161
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,574
It doesn't matter if it happens here

162
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,861
or your couch

163
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,145
or in the arms of
your soon-to-be widow.

164
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,707
Let's face it. You're done.

165
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,936
- Thought we said not the face.
- My ball to call.

166
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,035
Let's get to the chopper,

167
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,640
get the guns, neutralize Abdi's men,
then we interrogate 'em.

168
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,858
Let's move.

169
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,104
If all goes well,
you might get that gun.

170
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,538
Now once we start firing,
Abdi's other men are gonna be coming.

171
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,168
Take the shot...

172
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Fire.

173
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:58,008
Let's move!

174
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:08,977
Come on.

175
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:11,681
Simon. Come on.

176
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:14,191
Here they come!

177
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,769
What the hell is that?

178
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:18,945
Fire!

179
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:51,228
They failed me.

180
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:52,771
But you will not.

181
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:57,317
You will fulfill
your part of the plan.

182
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,201
Honey?

183
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,412
Lunch is ready!

184
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:18,213
3-bedroom colonial with a sunporch?

185
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,269
That's right.

186
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:20,642
In Denver.

187
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,926
It's where we could go Denver.

188
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,489
Big fan of the omelet.

189
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,139
It's one hell of an omelet.

190
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,786
But seriously,
I've been doing some research.

191
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,105
There's two major hospitals in Denver,
and they both need surgeons,

192
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,673
and the FBI has
a division in Denver.

193
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,434
We can do this.

194
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:42,028
So this is why we're having lunch.

195
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,903
Well, that, and I wanted
to see your beautiful face.

196
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:47,242
The mile-high city.

197
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,328
I could join the ski police,

198
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:52,327
be home at 5:00.

199
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:55,734
Me by the fire,
you wrapped up...

200
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:59,699
in a vegan tiger skin,
nothing on underneath.

201
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:01,374
Doesn't sound so bad.

202
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:05,302
We don't have to make
any decisions right now,

203
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,401
but I think we should soon.

204
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,958
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about, too.

205
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,554
Something we haven't
been talkin' about.

206
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,317
Charlie, what she saw...
we need to know.

207
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,903
Livy, we've needed
to know for a while now.

208
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,863
I thought
we were gonna give her time.

209
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,658
If she knows something
that can help this investigation,

210
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,400
then that goes way beyond us.

211
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:32,245
What is it you think that she knows?

212
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,102
There are things in this investigation
that keep coming back.

213
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:37,959
- D. Gibbons.
- He's at the center of everything.

214
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,434
I kept thinking I could do this
without involving our family,

215
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,926
but we can't ignore this.
We can't deny this anymore.

216
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,874
Listen, I have people at the FBI office
who know how to talk to kids.

217
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,786
I want to take Charlie down there
tomorrow and just see if maybe...

218
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:55,760
Can you let me talk to her first?

219
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:59,363
You can take her,
but can I try talking to her first?

220
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:05,487
This isn't beyond us, Mark.

221
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,919
I know.

222
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:10,515
And I mean it. Will you take
a look at this stuff?

223
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:15,086
You know, it is one hell
of an omelet.

224
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:22,420
On this continent,

225
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:25,549
a child dies every six seconds
from malnutrition.

226
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:29,135
Your country could easily provide
this food, yet it does not.

227
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,054
That's not true.
Every year,

228
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,147
we send hundreds
of millions of dollars in aid

229
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:35,387
just to have it stolen
by people like you.

230
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:39,938
People who live in heaven shouldn't
judge those who live in hell.

231
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,114
Tell me who you people are,
or I will kill him.

232
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:51,825
Sod off.

233
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:03,076
Who are you?

234
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:04,635
Tell me.

235
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,674
They are CIA,

236
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:10,176
here to investigate the tower.

237
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,560
We are security.

238
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,058
This is your security?

239
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,878
So you are with CIA.

240
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:30,697
- You are not afraid of death.
- I've gotten used to it.

241
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,585
- What do you want with that tower?
- Why have you brought the scientist?

242
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,127
We think what happened on october 6th,
the day of the blackout,

243
00:16:38,252 --> 00:16:40,821
happened before on a smaller scale
in your village

244
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,592
because of the towers.

245
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,644
I came back from herding the goats.

246
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:47,380
I saw them on the ground.
They were dead. It was no blackout.

247
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,384
- How do you know they were dead?
- I saw the black camel.

248
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:52,256
What's the black camel?

249
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,220
Black camel's considered
a bad omen here.

250
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:57,515
Death is a black camel
that kneels at every man's gate.

251
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,103
They were dead.

252
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:06,333
I returned
from the refugee camps changed,

253
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:07,901
a man now.

254
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,951
The bodies of my people were gone,
and all that remained

255
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,804
was a village of ghosts.

256
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:15,905
And there was only one tower left.

257
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:18,843
Word spread that I had lived
when others had died,

258
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,814
and for this, I became feared.

259
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,663
I used this fear
and became what I am now.

260
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,377
God's plan.

261
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,797
And then the day of the blackout,

262
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,327
I had my prophecy. I saw it.

263
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,843
I was making a speech
about the Better Angels.

264
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,161
<i>When again touched
by the Better Angels of our nation.</i>

265
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:39,185
I called myself
"the new face of Somalia."

266
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,017
I was telling the world.
I spoke as a conqueror.

267
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,668
My enemies crushed.

268
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:44,838
God's plan.

269
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:46,773
<i>I'm not willing to wait</i>

270
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,434
<i>one day longer!</i>

271
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,387
There will be one more war
in this land...

272
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:55,528
my war.

273
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,874
I will rule this country.

274
00:17:58,084 --> 00:17:59,584
The Better Angels...

275
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,000
The better warriors will win.

276
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,421
And you will help because you are CIA.
You can get me these things.

277
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:12,151
Planes, tanks, boats.

278
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:14,926
- What I will need to win my war.
- That's not gonna happen.

279
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,597
Planes, tanks, boats!

280
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,683
You will get me these things!

281
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:40,243
It happens every six seconds.

282
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:53,884
Vogel, just make the call.

283
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:56,636
The request alone will tell
our people what's going on.

284
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,763
I'm not going to make the call because
no one's going to pick it up.

285
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,734
It's like i told you before...
there is no cavalry.

286
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,685
We're on our own.
There's gotta be some options here.

287
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,064
- Meeting his demands isn't on of them.
- That's it, we just die?

288
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,611
Janis, come on.
You saw yourself alive on April 29th.

289
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:16,725
And that lunatic actually saw himself
the leader of this country.

290
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,690
Right. Better Angels.

291
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,495
Better Angels.

292
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:31,544
Which will it be?

293
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,667
Wait. Get off him!

294
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:53,483
Which will it be?

295
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,738
- Which will it be?
- Your prophecy is wrong!

296
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,403
What you saw...
it isn't what you saw.

297
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:09,958
I can prove it.

298
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,460
I know about the Better Angels.

299
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,129
Sit down.

300
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,897
You say you know
about the Better Angels.

301
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,567
Tell me what you know.

302
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:39,191
It's from Abraham Lincoln's
inaugural address.

303
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:41,552
- Lincoln was...
- Your president, ended slavery.

304
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:43,726
He was strong.
Not afraid to crush his enemies.

305
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,135
We were fighting a civil war
in our country,

306
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,829
just like your country.

307
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,338
"Better Angels"
was a speech about unity.

308
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:53,459
- About bringing people together.
- You don't know what I saw.

309
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,121
No, I don't, but I might be able
to find someone who did.

310
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:00,696
Can you get on the Internet here?

311
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:07,140
We created a web site

312
00:21:07,924 --> 00:21:11,311
where people can come on and share
their prophecies with each other.

313
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,429
A man was at the assembly
of the African union

314
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:22,614
at a peace conference.
You were speaking.

315
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:24,899
How do you know
what this man says is true?

316
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:27,118
You tell me.
Look, they know your name.

317
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:30,793
They say you were wearing
a wire necklace with an amber bead

318
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:33,416
surrounded by two red ones.
Do you have something like that?

319
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,586
My mother did.

320
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:47,232
I haven't seen that necklace
or my mother since i was a boy.

321
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,702
Someone else says they saw you...
said that you were quoting Lincoln.

322
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,187
"To every living heart and hearthstone,
all over this broad land...

323
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:57,856
"will yet swell
the chorus of the union

324
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,609
"when again touched...

325
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,923
"by the Better Angels
of our nature."

326
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:06,905
You don't need tanks or guns.

327
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,150
Your destiny is to stop the war.

328
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,789
Not start one.

329
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:33,726
Spare!

330
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:36,980
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Market, mommy.

331
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:39,357
- Nice job.
- You want to play?

332
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,006
I think I'll play after.
I want to talk first.

333
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:46,748
Charlie bear...

334
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:54,250
do you remember when Tim Tim talked
to Squirrlio about heroes?

335
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:56,862
When Finnegan the Supershark
trapped them

336
00:22:56,987 --> 00:22:59,751
- in the snow globe of snow doom?
- Squirrlio-zactly!

337
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:05,132
And Tim Tim said that heroes are people
who help people, even when it's hard.

338
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:08,798
Well, I need you
to be like a hero, Charlie.

339
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,264
- How?
- I need you to be brave.

340
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,975
And tell me what you saw
in your flash-forward.

341
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,068
It's okay to be afraid.
It really is. It's okay.

342
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:24,694
But if you tell me,
you might be able to help me.

343
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:28,656
You might be able to help daddy,
help a lot of people we don't even know.

344
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:31,205
If i tell you...

345
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:34,662
something bad will happen.

346
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:38,333
It won't.
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

347
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,984
I promise, okay?
Nothing.

348
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:45,006
Can you tell me what you saw?

349
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,394
<i>Go ahead.
It's your house, too.</i>

350
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:54,390
We were in the kitchen
and Dylan wanted a cookie.

351
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:56,600
Daddy says that you said

352
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,479
"D. Gibbons is a bad man."
Why'd you say that?

353
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:02,523
<i>The man you call
D. Gibbons lied to you.</i>

354
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:06,119
We heard his dad.
He said D. Gibbons lied.

355
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,236
<i>Bad people lie.</i>

356
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:11,365
And Dylan made the magnets say that
on the refrigerator.

357
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,699
<i>Bad people lie.</i>

358
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,482
But you didn't see D. Gibbons?
He wasn't in the house?

359
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:17,805
Keep going, sweetie.
What else did you see?

360
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,296
I heard fireworks

361
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,690
and i went to the back door.

362
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:24,878
I saw a man walk up to another man.

363
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,897
They were wearing suits.

364
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,585
And he said...

365
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:34,229
It's okay, sweetie, you can do it.
What did he say?

366
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:36,598
<i>Mark Benford is dead.</i>

367
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,060
"Mark Benford is dead."

368
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,521
<i>Mark Benford is dead.</i>

369
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,915
- It's not possible.
- It's what she heard.

370
00:24:57,555 --> 00:24:58,788
"Mark Benford is dead."

371
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:01,761
That's why she's been
so frightened to tell us.

372
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:04,081
She's afraid her daddy's gonna die.

373
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,214
That's not gonna happen.

374
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:12,153
On April 29TH, I'm gonna be
in my office, at my board, alive.

375
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:15,096
- Whatever Charlie saw, what she said...
- It's not that.

376
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:18,850
Then what is it?

377
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:23,092
This is the part where I tell you
that we could escape this.

378
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,639
We could go to Denver.
We could go anywhere.

379
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,687
And get away from it all,

380
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:31,009
get away from all of this.

381
00:25:32,977 --> 00:25:35,199
This is the part
where you tell me that you won't.

382
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:50,369
Right.

383
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:55,264
There's gonna be another blackout.

384
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,907
And I have to see this through.

385
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:04,145
I have to try and stop it.

386
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:13,935
I have to try.

387
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:20,071
What happened to the world,
happened in your village first.

388
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:23,680
- At least, that's our operating theory.
- Your people didn't die.

389
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:25,041
They were blacked out.

390
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,182
- They had prophecies?
- That's what we think.

391
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:30,950
We had hoped to find some of them
and talk to them.

392
00:26:31,075 --> 00:26:33,953
The war came when I was gone.
My people, my mother,

393
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:37,178
they must have been driven away.
I saw the black camel.

394
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,610
I thought the devil
had taken their souls.

395
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,743
The Coran...
Chapter 66, verse 6.

396
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,899
"Save yourself and your families
from a fire

397
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,719
"whose fuel is men and stones."

398
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,778
I painted it myself as a warning.

399
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,489
In all my time,
I haven't been in there.

400
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:58,115
Devil or no,

401
00:26:58,381 --> 00:26:59,834
it is an evil place.

402
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:03,204
But there is one thing
that can push a man more than fear.

403
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,330
What's that?

404
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,415
Destiny.

405
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:15,140
You look like you've seen a ghost.

406
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,218
It's entirely the opposite.

407
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:20,684
What I designed was theoretical,
it could only be done in the future,

408
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:23,440
and yet, it's been standing here
for 18 years.

409
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:34,110
Welcome to the future.

410
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:54,338
You said these designs
were stolen from you?

411
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:57,258
This was built in '91,
but you didn't come up

412
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,352
- with the concept till '92.
- I don't know how that's possible.

413
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:02,946
Someone must have invented it
before you.

414
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,308
This is exactly what I designed.

415
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,811
I don't get it. Why would they
leave it behind for somebody to find?

416
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:12,273
They were hauling these things away.
Then the war came.

417
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,443
- Why didn't they come back to finish?
- The war hasn't stopped.

418
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:20,323
Found something.

419
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:21,996
It's a chessboard.

420
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:31,542
- It's been sitting here for 18 years.
- And we have portable power.

421
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,700
Here's to hoping.

422
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:36,986
<i>What did you see?</i>

423
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:43,846
I knew this boy.

424
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,379
- He was my friend.
- What'd he say?

425
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:49,123
He said he saw himself
playing a game.

426
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,961
<i>And did it happen?</i>

427
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:54,773
He said what he saw came true.

428
00:28:57,882 --> 00:28:59,050
<i>What did you see?</i>

429
00:29:05,717 --> 00:29:06,785
This is my mother.

430
00:29:18,604 --> 00:29:20,062
She was looking for me.

431
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,152
She couldn't find me,
but she had hope.

432
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:27,593
She knew I would survive, that...

433
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:31,292
I would become great.

434
00:29:33,744 --> 00:29:36,637
<i>The preceding interviews
from test group "B" confirm</i>

435
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:39,203
<i>that the subjects
uniformly experienced</i>

436
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:41,842
<i>a consciousness shift
two weeks into the future.</i>

437
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:45,007
That's the man who shot at us in Utah.
That's D. Gibbons.

438
00:29:50,297 --> 00:29:51,538
D. Gibbons was here...

439
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,209
- in 1991?
- Conducting an experiment.

440
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,377
You see?

441
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:59,185
God didn't have anything to do
with this.

442
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,257
This was man.

443
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:03,718
Over here!

444
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:26,523
What are you seeing, simon?

445
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:41,547
This tunnel... vacuum systems,

446
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:43,485
the lead shielding...

447
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,926
it's a linear accelerator,
one of five.

448
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,217
Smaller, less powerful versions
than the ones we use at N.L.A.P.

449
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:51,390
They ran a perimeter
around the village.

450
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,639
Somehow,
they unleashed a tachyon burst,

451
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:56,532
creating a beta test of the global
blackout in this village.

452
00:30:56,657 --> 00:30:58,302
You weren't in the village,

453
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:02,192
when the experiment was conducted,
so you couldn't lose consciousness.

454
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:06,156
If it's true, it took five accelerators
to create this beta blackout.

455
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:08,991
There's no way that just one
knocked out the entire world.

456
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,523
How can you possibly say that?

457
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:13,162
Technology moves fast.

458
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,456
Even if you knew the rules,

459
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,583
which you don't,
I don't think they apply anymore.

460
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,882
I got something down here!

461
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:29,845
- Ready?
- Go.

462
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,040
I don't think your people
were driven off by the war.

463
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:11,875
They were shot...

464
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:13,847
Executed, all of them.

465
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,016
Remote village, wartime.

466
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:19,211
Given all the unrest, they knew nobody
would ever find these people.

467
00:32:19,336 --> 00:32:21,271
They showed them tomorrow
and ripped it away.

468
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:34,910
You said God had nothing to do
with this.

469
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:39,331
That it was man.

470
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:41,709
But it was not any man.

471
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:43,884
It was you.

472
00:32:44,955 --> 00:32:46,797
No. Those plans were stolen from me.

473
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:49,641
I said you were sent here
for a reason.

474
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:51,677
Now I know what that reason is.

475
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,304
God delivered you to me...

476
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,139
So I could avenge my people!

477
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,932
Let your end mark a new beginning!

478
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,668
"Better angels."
His vision.

479
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:15,993
This wasn't supposed to happen.

480
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:23,046
You want some cookies
to go with that milk?

481
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,365
I want to leave.

482
00:33:28,724 --> 00:33:30,260
I want to go away

483
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,733
with you and with Charlie.

484
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:36,248
I want to get away from all of this,
from everything that we saw.

485
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:39,979
Yes or no?

486
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,122
Livy...

487
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:46,977
Yes or no?

488
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:56,367
You want to say both, don't you?

489
00:33:58,186 --> 00:34:00,704
It's who you are, Mark.
You can't have it both ways.

490
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:02,873
This is what we signed on for.

491
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,124
You save lives.

492
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,633
I save lives.

493
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,492
- This is howe do it.
- But we saw how we did it.

494
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,757
You're at your office. I'm here
with Charlie hearing you've died.

495
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,802
I love you, Mark.
That doesn't work for me.

496
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:24,561
This is how it happens.

497
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:25,979
Don't say that.

498
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,276
You see, you need things
to play out like you saw.

499
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:34,780
You want them to.
You need to.

500
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,366
You're forgetting
there's another part to what we saw...

501
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:42,621
the part where we're
not together anymore.

502
00:34:42,924 --> 00:34:44,164
I don't want that.

503
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:48,584
You can't have it both ways.

504
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,463
Yes or no?

505
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,454
- Where'd you get that?
- Abdi's men.

506
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:23,764
Brutalized his people,
but they were too scared to say anything

507
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,233
because destiny said
he was their leader.

508
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,917
We changed their destiny today.
Rhum?

509
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:30,921
Yeah.

510
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:38,177
To yet another flash-forward
never coming true.

511
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,931
You okay?

512
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:44,391
Yeah,

513
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:45,609
fine.

514
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,521
So what? I don't have a baby. Who cares?
Lots of people don't have babies.

515
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:51,690
You can still have a baby, right?

516
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,443
Yeah, but I can't have Willa.

517
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:56,043
You named her.

518
00:35:56,395 --> 00:35:57,154


519
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,383
That's nice.

520
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,284
Well, I would have.

521
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,244
It was supposed to happen
this weekend.

522
00:36:05,386 --> 00:36:07,660
And now her window's closed, and...

523
00:36:09,136 --> 00:36:10,660
she's never gonna get here.

524
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:17,606
God.

525
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:19,340
What?

526
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:21,684
It's so stupid.

527
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:23,746
I just saw a mass grave,

528
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:26,850
and all I can think
about is a mythical baby.

529
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,020
Grave, the baby... you're having
a circle of life moment, right?

530
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:33,941
the weekend's not over.

531
00:36:43,123 --> 00:36:44,224
I'm just saying,

532
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,329
if it's baby-making you need,
I will take one for the team.

533
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:51,236
First of all,

534
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:53,447
no offense,
but that's kind of gross.

535
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:55,755
- What?
- Second of all, that's, like,

536
00:36:56,224 --> 00:36:58,215
1,000% wrong.

537
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,466
Desperate times.

538
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,205
- I'm gay.
- I will make you gayer.

539
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,141
What about Zoey?

540
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:10,357
Chances are...

541
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,400
I'm not gonna be around
in a couple of months, okay?

542
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,543
I think it'd be nice if willa was.

543
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,076
Are you serious?

544
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:43,093
How did you get that?

545
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,804
I fixed their satellite TV.

546
00:37:47,878 --> 00:37:50,225
I know you think that I can't
handle weapons,

547
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:52,203
but in my vision...

548
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:57,649
I was killing a man.

549
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,986
Didn't even need a gun.

550
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,697
- How many fingers did you have?
- Enough to do the job.

551
00:38:04,296 --> 00:38:06,575
What about you?
What did you see?

552
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:17,850
Mark Benford is dead.

553
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:23,863
I was doing my job.

554
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,057
What are you doing?

555
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,038
I promised our little snowboarder
that if he held still for his x-ray,

556
00:38:33,163 --> 00:38:35,145
I'd get him a hundred packets
of crackers.

557
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:38,357
I've raided every floor,
and I'm still only on 46.

558
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,108
You are so very good at this.

559
00:38:40,894 --> 00:38:42,402
- What?
- Listening to people,

560
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,655
you know,
figuring out what they need,

561
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,324
bribing them with baked goods.

562
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,077
It's gonna make you
a good doctor one day.

563
00:38:51,116 --> 00:38:54,289
I can ace graham crackers. It's
organic chemistry I'm worried about.

564
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:56,291
Here.

565
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,740
This is for you.

566
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:03,590
Calculator?

567
00:39:03,994 --> 00:39:05,926
That's not just any calculator.

568
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:08,682
I bought that my junior year at Duke

569
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:12,166
right before
I miraculously passed a physics final,

570
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,236
and, ever since then...

571
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:15,894
MCATS, med school,

572
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,654
board exams, that's...
that's been my good luck charm.

573
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:21,537
This is great.

574
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,444
Up until today,
my good luck charm was a brainy smurf.

575
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,006
- You really think I can do this?
- Yeah, I really do.

576
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:32,455
- You not just saying that to be nice?
- Well,

577
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,578
I don't lie,

578
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,497
and I'm not nice.

579
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:38,358
Four years of college...

580
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:40,362
four years of med school...

581
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:44,264
- four years of psychiatricesidency...
- Psychiatry?

582
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,983
Like you said, I'm a good listener.

583
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:48,927
Plus I'm kind of an

584
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,518
expert when it comes to dealing
with people with problems.

585
00:39:52,843 --> 00:39:54,917
So 12 years from now,

586
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:57,495
when I finish my training,
we'll be able to work together.

587
00:39:58,034 --> 00:39:58,925
12 years?

588
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,440
Well, you'll probably be head
of the department by then.

589
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:03,671
About that...

590
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:08,632
earlier today...

591
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:10,490
I lied to you.

592
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,201
What do you mean?

593
00:40:13,717 --> 00:40:16,635
I told you that everything
was fine with me.

594
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:18,629
It's not.

595
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:21,543
12 years from now,

596
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,212
I'm not so sure
that I'm gonna be around.

597
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:29,718
<i>The preceding interviews
from test group "B"</i>

598
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:32,936
<i>confirm that the subjects
uniformly experienced</i>

599
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:36,041
<i>a consciousness shift two weeks
into the future.</i>

600
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:42,933
- What are you doing?
- Couldn't sleep.

601
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:47,176
Just packing up stuff
to take back to the bureau.

602
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:48,862
That all?

603
00:40:51,312 --> 00:40:53,033
Thinking, little things...

604
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,214
life, death,

605
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:56,187
fate.

606
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:57,863
Careful not to ponder too much.

607
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,628
The ancient greeks did it all the time,
usually ended up dead.

608
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:02,738
Well, all of them wound up dead.

609
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:07,798
What the hell?

610
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,175
Hello, Demetri.

611
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,071
My name is Dyson Frost,

612
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:17,974
and I'm recording this message
in 1991.

613
00:41:20,554 --> 00:41:22,521
Got your attention, didn't I?

614
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,065
