1
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:10,927
The bullet ripped up my insides.

2
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,680
They said that it's gonna be almost
impossible for me to get pregnant.

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,433
You will be shot three times.
You, agent Benford,

4
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:18,935
you will kill agent Noh

5
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,311
on March 15th

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,522
with the very gun I assume
you're carrying right now.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,984
We need to talk about what I saw.
It wasn't our wedding, but his funeral.

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,771
We can do more than wish.
We can change the future.

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,031
My therapist gave me this drug
to unlock

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,700
the parts of my flash-forward
I couldn't remember.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,496
We were talking on the phone together.
It's time for you to tell me everything.

12
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,039
Mosaic is bigger than you.

13
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:41,624
You're just a tiny speck.

14
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,169
Agent Vogel has officially joined
the mosaic task force.

15
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,422
If you want to avoid being killed,
you need a better partner than Benford.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,092
The second that Jericho knows
that I'm still alive,

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,593
 they'll kill me.

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,554
Corporal Willingham. I was in Tracy's
convoy when it was attacked.

19
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:58,099
I can't have you drinkin' here.
It doesn't work for me.

20
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,059
Fine. I'll go somewhere else.

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,686
<i>Visitahton rigs will be over</i>

22
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:05,189
<i>in five minutes.</i>

23
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:08,536
- Have you been going to meetings?
- Every Tuesday and Thursday.

24
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:11,195
You've been staying out of trouble?
You haven't been fighting?

25
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:14,967
You know me, Tracy.
I keep my head down.

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,809
It's gonna happen, dad.
You're gonna get paroled.

27
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,747
They just can't say no this time.

28
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,181
<i>Transfer guard call
is to the main gate.</i>

29
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:28,671
I'm gonna make this up to you,

30
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,595
if it's the last thing I ever do.

31
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,509
Just promise
you'll smile at the hearing.

32
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:35,736
Ear to ear.

33
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,916
<i>Visiting hours are over.</i>

34
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,107
Okay, sweetheart.

35
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:54,930
<i>Lockdown in cell B will be
initiated in 30 minutes.</i>

36
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:57,032
Your girl goes to Gloucester high,
right?

37
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:58,909
She's cute.

38
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:01,754
Girls that age...

39
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:04,023
They're in full bloom.

40
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,273
Not quite sure what to do
with their new curves yet, though.

41
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,273
And your daughter...

42
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:12,882
She's got that look in her eye.

43
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,969
Don't you ever, ever
talk about my...

44
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,390
Get off! Get him off.

45
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,237
I'm good, thanks.

46
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:53,089
- What are you doing here?
- You said I couldn't drink at home.

47
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,822
I know you don't want to hear this,

48
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:02,578
but trust me. I've been sitting exactly
where you're sitting right now.

49
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:06,707
- I know what you're going through.
- Please just spare me the AA Talk, dad.

50
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,568
You have no idea.

51
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:17,068
What gives you the right
to come in here...

52
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:19,815
We can talk about this as much
or as little as you want.

53
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,785
But let me just ask you one question
before you shut me

54
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:23,953
out again.

55
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:27,787
If you're so scared
these Jericho guys are after you,

56
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:31,948
and I found you
by walking into the closest bar...

57
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,001
Do you really think
this is a smart move here?

58
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:39,315
Do you?

59
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,480
- Mark is going to shoot you?
- He's not going to shoot me.

60
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,690
You said that woman in Hong Kong
saw a report...

61
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,531
Armed men guard this woman
while she eats dinner, all right?

62
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:57,831
Babe, she's shady.

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,656
Yet she still knows
the serial number to Mark's gun.

64
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,033
That doesn't mean
he's going to pulls the trigger.

65
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,660
He's a prime suspect.

66
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:08,289
Please, don't... don't get all lawyer-y
on me here. All right?

67
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:12,209
Mark is the one who went halfway
across the world. He risked his life,

68
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,436
all to find out who might kill me.

69
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,546
Babe...

70
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:18,090
he's not the guy.

71
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,716
All right?

72
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:26,864
It was your memorial.

73
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,226
I figured it out.

74
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:34,523
What was happening on the beach...
It wasn't our wedding that I saw.

75
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:38,152
Baby, it was your memorial.

76
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:40,863
It doesn't matter.

77
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:44,856
I filed the paperwork
to destroy the gun.

78
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,844
It's already in the evidence locker.

79
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,665
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything is gonna be fine.

80
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,833
Come here.

81
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,858
You gotta trust me.

82
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,135
I'm gonna marry you.

83
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:06,430
Not getting out of it.

84
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:49,890
We need to talk.

85
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:51,180
All right.

86
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:52,305
Come on in.

87
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:57,609
Hypothetically, Mark.
Hypothetically.

88
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:01,879
Even I could come up with a scenario
where I'd want to kill Demetri.

89
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:05,072
No matter how crazy things get,
I'd never hurt Demetri.

90
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,200
But what if Demetri's got a gun
to your head? He's about to pull

91
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,495
the trigger. To save your own life,
do you shoot him?

92
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,023
- Come on.
- Do you kill him?

93
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:14,395
I know you love him,

94
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,750
but I think
you may want to reel it in there.

95
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:20,421
So the question becomes,

96
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,716
what could you possibly do
where Demetri would want you dead?

97
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,427
Do you have some deep,
dark secret worth killing someone over?

98
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:29,013
Then what am I missing here?

99
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,443
Here's a theory...

100
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:32,725
Someone at the bureau's
been leaking information,

101
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:35,227
putting a lot of us in danger.
I don't think Demetri's

102
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,354
the guy, but if he was... I'm sorry.

103
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,857
I thought we were playing
"outrageous accusations".

104
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,695
Go to hell.

105
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,218
<i>... for 69 yards
will break the huddle.</i>

106
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,381
<i>Patterson to work
out of the shotgun,</i>

107
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:00,841
<i>spread formation
two receivers to his right.</i>

108
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,935
<i> Takes the snap, drop back.</i>

109
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,215
<i>Looking, trying to hook up with Samuel,
near side...</i>

110
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:08,427
<i>... by a good 5 yards...</i>

111
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:10,512
Are you Mr. Aaron Stark?

112
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:14,600
The commandant of the marine corps
has entrusted me to express...

113
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,936
I was a marine recon.
I know why you're here.

114
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,028
When and how?

115
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,812
When and how?

116
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,806
Two days ago, near Kunar province.

117
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:35,260
Your daughter's unit
encountered the enemy.

118
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,939
A rocket-propelled grenade
hit her Humvee.

119
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,908
I know they're gonna send a letter.

120
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,795
We're done.

121
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,953
Is that what I think it is?

122
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,972
Grilled peanut butter
and banana sandwiches.

123
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,057
Best thing in the world
for a hangover.

124
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:20,542
I always thought you made
it 'cause I liked it.

125
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,387
Two birds, one stone.

126
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,754
Tracy, there's something
I need to ask you.

127
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,006
The name James Erskine
ring any bells?

128
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,374
No. Should it?

129
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,176
I had Mark do some digging.

130
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,031
Turns out this Jericho outfit...

131
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:36,313
They've got branches
all over the world,

132
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,860
but they're headquartered
out in Santa Monica.

133
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,686
Erskine's head of operations.

134
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,001
Mark also did a background
check on your CO.

135
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,344
Musgrove?

136
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:49,242
Is he dirty?

137
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:52,180
Lieutenant Paul Musgrove was killed
in a helicopter crash

138
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:54,575
two days after your supposed "death."

139
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,102
Please tell me you don't think
that's a coincidence.

140
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:58,164
I don't.

141
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,560
- And I got a buddy at the Pentagon...
- Dad, please.

142
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,293
I appreciate everything,
but this is out of control.

143
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,714
- I should've never listened to Khamir.
- What's he got to do with this?

144
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:14,467
When Jericho started looking for me
again after the blackout,

145
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:17,639
I knew that I had to leave, that it
wasn't safe for anyone to be around me.

146
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,309
A humanitarian relief plane
landed near our village.

147
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,358
They were headed back to the US,

148
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:25,355
and they had room for me onboard,
so they hid me in their cargo hold.

149
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,291
Khamir said that it was a sign,

150
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,160
it's all part of my destiny that I was
supposed to come back here

151
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,901
and bring you back to Afghanistan.

152
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:34,031
What an idiot I've been.

153
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:36,778
Aren't you being a little hard
on yourself here?

154
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,953
Once I got back here,
and I actually saw you,

155
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,180
the thought of bringing you
back to that hellhole,

156
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:44,249
to a place
where you could get killed...

157
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,922
I couldn't live with myself
if anything bad happened to you, dad.

158
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,483
Don't worry, sweetheart.

159
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:51,638
I'm gonna be okay,

160
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:53,091
and so are you.

161
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,259
Trust me.

162
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:01,312
Trust me.

163
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:08,265
So do you want to explain
why you brought me in here again?

164
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,661
April 29th.

165
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:11,985
We were on the phone together.

166
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:15,648
Remember?

167
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:18,700
A lot of things came
up on that call...

168
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,419
The name D. Gibbons,

169
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:22,538
some initials, QED,

170
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,741
and the fact that there's gonna be
another blackout.

171
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,586
You don't have anything
to say about any of that?

172
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:35,102
We have a sketch.

173
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:39,097
We don't know who he is.
But around the time of the blackout,

174
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,473
he was happily cloning credit cards.

175
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:46,587
He assumed the identity
of someone named D. Gibbons.

176
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,942
Based on our call,
you seem to know him.

177
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:54,464
I don't.

178
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,880
No, I don't.

179
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,027
You know what?

180
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:05,083
I don't have the time
to play pissy brit with you.

181
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,232
Let's take a walk.

182
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

183
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,799
- Lunch?
- I'm bringing you a little something.

184
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,319
- You didn't have to do that.
- Well, she did,

185
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,369
and such a generous portion.

186
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:21,513
There's no way you're gonna
finish that whole thing.

187
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,891
Don't worry, Stan. I brought you
something even more delicious.

188
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:28,188
I filed a freedom of
information act request

189
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,236
on everything this office has
on the mosaic investigation.

190
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,637
You do what?

191
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,886
If there's even one word in
there that will keep you safe,

192
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,572
- I have to...
- This is my office.

193
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:40,494
You don't just come in here
and serve my boss papers.

194
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,951
I'm not gonna stop
until we're on that beach together.

195
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,871
Somebody better start
making some sense real soon.

196
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,902
It's pretty simple, actually.

197
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:51,043
I'm going to be reviewing all
of your mosaic-related files.

198
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,645
- She's going to be leaving right now...
- Is this about Mark's gun?

199
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,014
Please tell me that's not
what's going on here.

200
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:00,510
Mosaic's the subject of widespread
national media attention,

201
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,262
which is precisely the type of issue

202
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,158
which qualifies
for expedited processing

203
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:07,903
- under FOIA.
- Tell somebody who cares.

204
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:10,627
Can I recommend you start
with a judge?

205
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:13,687
'cause that's the only way
I'm opening up assified files to you.

206
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:15,734
We could do it that way, Stan.
No problem.

207
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,079
But going into court, it's public,

208
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:22,324
and I'm guessing that "public" is not
going to help your investigation much.

209
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:31,249
Agent Noh will make the files
available for you to review.

210
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:34,847
Thank you.

211
00:12:51,623 --> 00:12:54,465
- Mike! How's everything?
- Can't complain.

212
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:57,491
Like my dad says, if all my problems
could be solved with money,

213
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:58,782
I'm doing good, right?

214
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:00,284
How are you holding up?

215
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,527
Couldn't be better.
Could not be better.

216
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:04,244
That's so great to hear.

217
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:06,222
I think I know why.

218
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:09,947
I got a call last week.
It was my birthday.

219
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:13,695
Blocked number. Person on the other end
of the line doesn't say anything,

220
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,252
but they don't hang up, either.

221
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,768
We just sit on the phone in silence.

222
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,424
Suddenly, it hits me...

223
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:23,888
It's Tracy.

224
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:26,740
She's alive, isn't she?

225
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:37,335
She's at my house right now.

226
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,778
Can you believe that?
It's come true.

227
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,322
It's come true.

228
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,163
What are we doing here?

229
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:56,602
You're gonna take me through
everything you saw...

230
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:59,087
- You've got to be joking.
- And where you saw it.

231
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:02,299
We were on the phone together.
You heard everything I said.

232
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,593
But I don't know why you said it

233
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,426
or what you saw during the rest
of your vision, for that matter.

234
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:10,833
So if you want to help me stop
another blackout from happening,

235
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:12,427
or even if you don't,

236
00:14:13,414 --> 00:14:16,188
you're still gonna walk me through it.
You got that?

237
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,191
So let's move it.

238
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:27,948
This doesn't bother you?

239
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,304
Start at the beginning.

240
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:33,650
I got a text message.

241
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,405
I was getting up from the bed.

242
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,710
I'm sorry, are these
details really necessary?

243
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:40,540
Do you think I want to hear 'em?

244
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,425
I noticed that I had a text
message on my phone.

245
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,249
It was from Simon. It was a formula,
or part of a formula.

246
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:50,590
I'm not sure.

247
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,835
I had it written out here
on the mirror.

248
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,812
Sorry, I have to make a call.

249
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:00,995
The mirror?

250
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,909
I used lipstick.

251
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:06,514
I had a sense there was
a woman in the room,

252
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,738
but I swear to God,
I had no idea it was Olivia.

253
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,701
The next thing I did was dial a number.
I didn't know it was yours.

254
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:14,639
You said it wasn't a good time.

255
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,373
I asked if you'd been drinking.

256
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,788
You didn't take that very well.

257
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:20,669
<i>- Go to hell, Lloyd.
- We need to talk.</i>

258
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,004
<i>- About what?
- The QED.</i>

259
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,384
On the phone call, you said
you were close to cracking the QED.

260
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,527
- Yeah, it's latin. It means...
- <i>Quod erat demonstrandum.</i>

261
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:32,472
"That which was to be demonstrated."

262
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Could be,

263
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:37,435
but could be QED...
Quantum electrodynamics.

264
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,104
Actually, wait, no.

265
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,580
Well, I said "the QED."
You wouldn't put a definite article

266
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:45,569
in front of the latin meaning
or the discipline.

267
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,862
But, you would put it
in front of a formula.

268
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:50,459
- The one on the mirror?
- Absolutely.

269
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,934
Sorry to keep you waiting,
miss Hawk.

270
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,360
Is there anything in here
about prior medical histories?

271
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:05,691
We need to discuss a couple of things
before we go any further.

272
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:08,758
I have a letter here
from your obstetrician.

273
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:11,254
The injury that you sustained
when you were shot

274
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,305
makes pregnancy unlikely for you.

275
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,391
Your OB thinks it's too soon
to pursue this, and frankly, I agree.

276
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,685
What do you mean, you agree?

277
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:22,606
I think we have a better chance
of succeeding if we wait.

278
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,323
In my flash-forward,
I saw that I was pregnant.

279
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,159
I was into my second trimester,
which means...

280
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,580
- I have to get pregnant now.
- You're not thinking this through.

281
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,459
You're wrong about that, because
I can't stop thinking about this.

282
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,569
I know that there are risks involved,
but no amount of research...

283
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,551
or statistics is gonna change the fact
that I want that baby.

284
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:54,832
Not a different baby
two years from now

285
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:58,292
when I'm more sure about
my life or whatever.

286
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,060
I want this specific child.

287
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:04,987
This is my baby.

288
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:13,994
Thank you.

289
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:19,435
I told you to drop this.

290
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,040
- You told me to trust you, and I do.
- Then drop it.

291
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,834
I've already found something
in Alda Hertzog's deposition

292
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,003
- that may help us.
- Drop it.

293
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,213
What if it were me?

294
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,969
What if I didn't see anything?
Would you listen if I told you to stop?

295
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:38,522
Fine.

296
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:41,846
You want to dig, you keep digging.

297
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:46,189
But serving my boss with papers,
trying to smear my partner,

298
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,021
that is way the hell over the line.

299
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,444
I'm going to do whatever I can
to prevent your murder.

300
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:48,435
<i>Present arms!</i>

301
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,709
<i>Ready. Aim.</i>

302
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:53,047
<i>Fire!</i>

303
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,279
Sweetheart, I'm home.

304
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:33,922
Somethin' burning?

305
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,090
Trace?

306
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:36,236
What?

307
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:41,684
Trace?

308
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:45,725
Tracy?

309
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:47,435
Tracy, where are you?

310
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,215
<i>She's alive, isn't she?</i>

311
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,609
As we spoke,
I walked down the stairs.

312
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:22,072
By then I was standing here.

313
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:26,474
I heard a little girl's voice.
I presume that was your daughter.

314
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,774
- <i>Go ahead. It's your house, too.</i>
- She went into the kitchen with Dylan.

315
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:33,064
You started explaining something.

316
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,234
<i>Well, it's only theoretical,
but I'm close to cracking it.</i>

317
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:39,320
<i>You need to hurry.
There's gonna be another blackout.</i>

318
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,499
I hung up. I sat down on the couch.

319
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:44,168
The last thing I remember
was that I heard a voice...

320
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:47,977
before I could see who it was,
I woke up on the floor at NLAP.

321
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:50,476
Wait. You skipped something.
Why were you so adamant

322
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:52,333
when you started talking
about D. Gibbons?

323
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,003
<i>The man you call D. Gibbons
lied to you.</i>

324
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,631
- I don't know. I don't know him.
- I didn't ask if you knew him.

325
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,162
I asked, why were you so adamant?

326
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,509
I don't know.

327
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:09,017
You know this man.
Not in the future, right now.

328
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,385
Well, I don't.

329
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,858
I was angry because I was on the phone
with some drunk.

330
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:14,183
You called me.

331
00:21:14,912 --> 00:21:17,494
I was important to what was going on.
You're not telling me everything.

332
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:20,236
I don't know any D. Gibbons.
- You said D. Gibbons was a liar.

333
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,554
He is a liar!

334
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,703
So you do know him.

335
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:39,255
I've been trying to reach you.
What's up?

336
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,299
I talked to jack.
He said you were movin'?

337
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,178
Yes, sir. My old man got me a job closer
to home. Can't say no to family, right?

338
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,440
Good on you.

339
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:50,197
Nothing more important than family.

340
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,668
I'm glad I caught you. Let me buy you
a burger before you take off.

341
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,356
Come on.

342
00:21:57,665 --> 00:21:59,436
All right, a quick bite.

343
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:03,655
Did you know I went to prison?

344
00:22:05,544 --> 00:22:06,574
You serious?

345
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:09,922
Two and a half years.

346
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:13,915
Got into a bar fight,
hit a guy a little too hard.

347
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:16,501
Damn. I didn't know that, Aaron.

348
00:22:19,077 --> 00:22:20,380
Where is this place?

349
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,349
Tell you one thing...
Prison, especially where I was,

350
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:26,629
It changes you,
makes you a capable man.

351
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:30,134
- Capable of what?
- Anything. Everything.

352
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:33,059
You feel like an animal.

353
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:36,980
- Guess you do what you gotta do, right?
- Exactly. That's what I think.

354
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:38,949
But the trick, Mike,

355
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:41,208
is leaving that animal inside
once they let you out.

356
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,265
That animal's got no place in the world.
I've worked real hard

357
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,159
to keep him locked up.

358
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:55,999
But you know what?
Today, I'm gonna let him out.

359
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,402
Where is she, Mike?

360
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:17,651
Where's my daughter?

361
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:19,647
I don't know
what you're talking about!

362
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,188
I know you tipped off Jericho!

363
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:29,044
- Where'd they take her, Mike?
- Dude, I don't...

364
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:30,968
Where'd they take her, Mike?

365
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:33,068
You break an arm like this,
it never heals right.

366
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:34,704
You're gonna get us both killed!

367
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:35,872
You first!

368
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,551
Everything's out of control at work.
You know, wedeck's not talking to me.

369
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:44,934
Why not?

370
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:46,267
Zoey...

371
00:23:47,865 --> 00:23:49,677
Ambushed him with F.O.I.A. Papers.

372
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,504
She thinks alda has some
information about my murder.

373
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:53,730
That's crazy.

374
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:56,976
It's like she's acting like
she loves you or something.

375
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:58,735
All right, Janis.

376
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:02,774
Where were you today, by the way?

377
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,534
I was at a fertility clinic.

378
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:11,169
Okay.

379
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,832
Yeah, I know.
I practically had to beg them

380
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,665
to take me on as a client.

381
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:20,861
Did they?

382
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:23,851
All right.

383
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:26,339
I pushed pretty hard.

384
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:29,028
But I have to conceive
this baby next week

385
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:30,340
to match what I saw.

386
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:32,471
Next week?

387
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:36,660
Well, that's... That's great.

388
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:39,364
That's great.

389
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:43,574
Aren't you...

390
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,858
Aren't you scared, though

391
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,322
The whole mom thing I mean, with our
line of work and all?

392
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,405
Yeah, I know,
but that's kind of my point.

393
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,492
I don't want my life to just be

394
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,786
about being an FBI agent.

395
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,681
And if I want that life,
I have to start living it right now.

396
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,801
When I got shot and
I was lying there

397
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:06,546
Listening for the ambulance,

398
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,508
The only thing I could
think about was that baby

399
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:13,719
And the possibility that I
wouldn't get to have her,

400
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:16,222
That I would miss
dressing her in pink...

401
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,567
That I would never get
to brush her hair.

402
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,426
Broke my heart.

403
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:29,104
Janis, don't get me
wrong here, but...

404
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,184
- She doesn't exist yet.
- Yes, she does.

405
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:36,868
I know she does.

406
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:41,336
She's out there.
Making her way toward me.

407
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,571
I've spent almost
every waking moment

408
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,305
Thinking about who she's gonna be.

409
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:50,510
I can't wait to meet her.

410
00:25:51,232 --> 00:25:53,009
You're gonna be an awesome mom.

411
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,550
Thanks, Dem.

412
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:58,155
We both have to fight
for the futures we want.

413
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,517
Get rid of that gun.

414
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:08,024
The man you call D. Gibbons
his real name is Dyson Frost.

415
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,150
Dyson Frost?

416
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,852
- How'd you know him?
- I heard him give a lecture on the wave

417
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:14,433
structure of matter once.

418
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,575
He was on sabbatical at oxford.

419
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,661
I was doing research on wave
mechanics, and I had to sit

420
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,021
there and listen to him take credit for
work I'd done but hadn't published yet.

421
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:26,939
I mean, it was indisputably mine, but I
had no way of proving he'd got

422
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:29,170
his hands on it. Bastard.

423
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:31,172
So D. Gibbons is a liar.

424
00:26:31,726 --> 00:26:34,211
Some time after I read his obituary,
I remember thinking,

425
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:36,219
<i>"good riddance."</i>

426
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,596
But obviously, he's still alive.

427
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,116
And at some point assumed the
identity of D. Gibbons.

428
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:43,446
Charlie said, <i>"D.
Gibbons is a bad man."</i>

429
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:46,002
I thought maybe...

430
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,525
You said it to her...
in your vision.

431
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:51,655
No, I didn't.

432
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,647
- You haven't asked her about it?
- I've tried.

433
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,127
She's shut down.

434
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,453
Well, it seems I'm not the only
person you need to talk to.

435
00:27:09,953 --> 00:27:13,839
These men who kidnapped you did they
tell you why they took you?

436
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:15,422
What they wanted?

437
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,343
Was it revenge?

438
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:21,514
Okay, so they torture
you for 72 hours,

439
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,600
Cut off your friend's finger
yet they never told you why?

440
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,650
Made any demands,
threatened you in any way?

441
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:29,715
They didn't threaten me.

442
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:34,761
They threatened Dylan.

443
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:40,199
Lying to me won't keep him safe.
Talking to me will.

444
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:42,518
I gave them everything...

445
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:47,456
Energy levels, equipment settings,
Monitoring parameters.

446
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:50,626
Could they use any of it
to cause another blackout?

447
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,310
That's what I'm afraid of,

448
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,155
Especially after what I
said to you in my vision.

449
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:01,456
This guy...

450
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:03,486
Dyson Frost...

451
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,827
He's the key.

452
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:09,999
We find him, maybe we can stop
this thing from happening again.

453
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:16,716
I need your help, Lloyd.

454
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:23,786
I'll do whatever I can.

455
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,421
I got some interesting
information from lloyd

456
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:32,110
about Dyson Frost,
also known as D. Gibbons.

457
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,317
According to Simcoe, Dyson Frost

458
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:37,256
wrote this seminal paper about
something called <i>"the mirror test."</i>

459
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,949
What the hell is a <i>mirror test</i>?

460
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:42,345
It's a test that determines recognition
of consciousness among species

461
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:45,306
humans, elephants, crows.

462
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:46,525
Crows...

463
00:28:48,261 --> 00:28:49,091
Somalia?

464
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:52,111
Everything points to it, Stan.
The crow die off in somalia.

465
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:54,412
We found towers in
the satellite photos.

466
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,150
We need to be there.

467
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:58,277
I spoke to a team
leader at Red Panda.

468
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:00,948
They fly in and out
all the time safely.

469
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:05,201
Bird-watching in somalia? How am I gonna
sell that to washington?

470
00:29:06,922 --> 00:29:07,929
You don't.

471
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,784
It's always better to
beg for forgiveness

472
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:14,935
Than ask for permission.

473
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:26,529
<i>This is mark. Leave it here.
I'll get back to you. </i>

474
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,754
<i>Mark, it's me. Some serious
stuff has gone down,</i>

475
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:32,118
<i>and I need you to run a
background check on that guy</i>

476
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:34,565
<i>James Erskine, the head of Jericho.</i>

477
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:37,237
<i>Get back to me as soon as you can.</i>

478
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:38,901
<i>Thanks, buddy. Appreciate it.</i>

479
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:47,206
What the hell?

480
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:00,623
- James Erskine?
- Yes?

481
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:03,345
Good afternoon, sir. I'm with
the department of water and power.

482
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,424
Computer is telling me
we've got some surges

483
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,921
affecting some houses. Do you mind if
I take a look At the main line out back?

484
00:30:09,046 --> 00:30:10,907
Take a look.
I need you to get it fixed.

485
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,983
We need the power turned on.
Come on.

486
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,319
We're throwing a birthday party here,
and it's like the middle ages.

487
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,459
Good afternoon, miss Hertzog.

488
00:30:34,712 --> 00:30:35,742
Do I know you?

489
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:38,252
I'm Zoey Andata.

490
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,433
You met my fiance Demetri Noh.

491
00:30:41,936 --> 00:30:44,467
Remind me to send you a condolence
card In a couple months.

492
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:47,553
You can send me a wedding present
instead. Nothing's gonna happen to Dem.

493
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,903
All prognostic evidence
to the contrary.

494
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:52,737
We've already seen that
the future can be changed,

495
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,931
And I think you're gonna
help me change it.

496
00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:57,494
I've been going over the transcripts
of your interrogation,

497
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:59,857
and I think you know more
than you've told the FBI,

498
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,781
And I think that what you do know

499
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:03,892
Is somehow related
to Demetri's death.

500
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:06,849
And you think I'd give up
this information to you because...

501
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:08,810
I'm a believer in true love?

502
00:31:09,565 --> 00:31:12,453
Ma'am, if you let me represent you,
The only thing you need to believe in

503
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,059
is attorney/client privilege.

504
00:31:14,184 --> 00:31:17,416
Right. A fed's girlfriend
is going to exonerate me.

505
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:19,322
Let me ask you a question.

506
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:23,337
In your flash-forward,
were you in prison?

507
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:34,061
You gonna fix this thing already,
or do I have to call somebody else?

508
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:38,687
I'm not here to fix your power.

509
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,611
What?

510
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,565
I'm here to get my daughter back.

511
00:31:44,012 --> 00:31:46,445
I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about.

512
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,691
Tracy stark.

513
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:52,368
I know you took her.
Now you're gonna give her back.

514
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:54,453
Daddy,

515
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,235
when are they gonna fix the power?

516
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,333
Soon, baby. Soon.
I'll be right there.

517
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,130
I can't give you your daughter back.

518
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:07,049
Then we go to war.

519
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:10,953
I can't because I don't know who she is
or what you're talkin' about.

520
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:14,223
And if that means we're at war,
then we're at war.

521
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,435
But if this is your opening salvo,
buddy, I'd consider surrendering.

522
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,857
You know the guys
you really gotta be afraid of?

523
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,542
The ones who got
nothing left to lose.

524
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:32,999


525
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,412
"You're going to Somalia without me?

526
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,940
No one knows
that case better than me"

527
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:41,917
I understand...

528
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,419
But you're staying here.

529
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,882
And it isn't because
you're irrational,

530
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,798
erratic and frequently stupid.

531
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,759
It's because you're essential.
I don't like you, but,

532
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,802
I need you.

533
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:54,082
Listen, Janis, Demetri,

534
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,223
If they don't make it back,
it's a tragedy.

535
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,434
But if you don't,
it's a catastrophe.

536
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,324
The truth is, Mark,

537
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:02,980
our entire investigation hinges
on what's in your head.

538
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:07,276
And I'm here to make sure
you don't lose it before april 29th.

539
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,994
But in Hong-Kong,
you said mosaic was bigger than me.

540
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:13,654
I lied. I'm cia. I do that.

541
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:16,535
That's why no one trusts you folk.

542
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,203
I don't need 'em to trust me.

543
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:21,341
I just need them to do what I say.

544
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:23,661
You're staying here.

545
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,224
It's me.

546
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:36,221
Just had a visit from the father.

547
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,641
- <i>You're kidding me.</i>
- I thought your guy, what's his name?

548
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,309
- <i>Willingham.</i>
- Yes Willingham.

549
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,938
- I thought he keep an eye on him.
- <i>We ended the surveillance this week.</i>

550
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,819
- <i>You want the dad taken off the board?
</i>- The package is secure?

551
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,129
<i>We need to talk to her,
make sure she stays alive.</i>

552
00:33:49,254 --> 00:33:51,096
<i>It arrived in Kandahar this morning.</i>

553
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:53,686
Then get rid <i>of the father</i>.

554
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:55,209
<i>Daddy?</i>

555
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,993
Gotta go. It's my turn
in the bounce house. I come, baby.

556
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,853
Kandahar.

557
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:29,650
They're calling you to kill me,
Mikey.

558
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:31,819
Too bad you got places to be.

559
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,107
You people with the FBI

560
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:37,658
found out about Somalia.
As CIA,

561
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,162
I can get us there.

562
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:41,954
That's what being a joint task force
is all about.

563
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,376
Now you know the deal.

564
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,403
Ganwar region, 1991...

565
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,419
crows fell from the sky.
There were anecdotal reports

566
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,546
of a mass loss of consciousness.

567
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,677
Archived satellite photos show
five towers

568
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:56,260
running a perimeter
around the village in question.

569
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,554
One of those towers
remains standing.

570
00:34:58,828 --> 00:35:01,098
Our goal is to access that tower
and determine

571
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:03,926
If and how a blackout occurred.

572
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,020
- Are we using Mark's red panda plan?
- No.

573
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,539
Mark wanted to work with red panda.

574
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,432
We're going as red panda.

575
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:13,182
That violates about
a dozen international treaties.

576
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:15,198
Are you sure
we want to go down that road?

577
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,354
This is international intelligence,
Agent Hawk

578
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,366
CIA jurisdiction.
It's my ball to call.

579
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:21,152
Great.

580
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,570
When do we leave?

581
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:25,289
When we leave is classified.

582
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:28,558
The tower you're investigating
is based on my designs...

583
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:30,377
designs that were stolen from me

584
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,463
when I was 13 years old.

585
00:35:33,226 --> 00:35:35,174
Our plan is to document

586
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,426
the site extensively
for your review.

587
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,756
You can't document
something you don't understand.

588
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:42,347
You need me on-site.
You showed me the towers

589
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,308
Because
you didn't know what they were.

590
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,144
- I'm the one who told you.
- Do you know anything about Somalia?

591
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:49,980
A bit dry. Gorgeous beaches.

592
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,421
It's a failed state.

593
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:54,359
They haven't had
a functioning government since 1991.

594
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,680
I saw "black hawk down." I get it.

595
00:35:57,325 --> 00:35:59,948
The fact is, you can't make sense
of the tower without me,

596
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:01,408
and you know it.

597
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:06,945
Learn it,

598
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,449
cover to cover.
And stop by medical and get your shots,

599
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:11,600
Cholera,

600
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:13,709
typhus and ten other bugs
you never heard of.

601
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:16,213
Just be warned,
we will be off the reservation.

602
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:18,509
If things go sideways,
there is no cavalry.

603
00:36:19,236 --> 00:36:20,514
See you on the tarmac.

604
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,894
Came to take you home.
It's been a long day.

605
00:36:32,644 --> 00:36:34,044
Not finished here yet.

606
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,748
Oh, you're finished.

607
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,565
I say you're finished.

608
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:40,248
Let's go home.

609
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:47,584
You...

610
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:51,281
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

611
00:36:52,617 --> 00:36:54,539
It was about doing everything
that I can

612
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:57,130
to make sure you're on that beach
on our wedding day.

613
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:02,177
I needed those files because...

614
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:05,459
I'm representing Alda Hertzog.

615
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:08,350
- You're what?
- She has information about your death,

616
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,228
and I want to know what it is.
So I made a deal with her.

617
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,896
I get her a hearing.

618
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,899
- She gives me the details.
- She is a terrorist, zoey!

619
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,420
A suspected terrorist, dem,

620
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:21,201
with information that might
save the lifeof the man that I love,

621
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:22,656
What you're doing here.

622
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,412
Baby, I would do anything,

623
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:25,406
anything.

624
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:28,039
If I thought it could save your life,
I'd do anything.

625
00:37:31,226 --> 00:37:32,398
I'm scared.

626
00:37:36,995 --> 00:37:38,297
I don't want you to die.

627
00:37:41,624 --> 00:37:42,984
Baby, I love you.

628
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:46,183
I love you, too.

629
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,337
I love you.

630
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:01,079
Come with me.

631
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:03,844
There's something
I gotta take care of.

632
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,786
This is Mark. Leave it here.
I'll get back to you.

633
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,495
Just calling to let you
know that things have

634
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:16,343
escalated a little bit
with tracy's...

635
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,502
friends.

636
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:18,575
But

637
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:19,934
it's okay.

638
00:38:20,895 --> 00:38:21,891
I'm good.

639
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,755
Things are...

640
00:38:24,657 --> 00:38:27,200
happening just the way
they're supposed to.

641
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,683
Buttercream frosting.
Irina,

642
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:33,605
this cake is outstanding.

643
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:41,693
I'm gonna be going off the grid
for a little while.

644
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,150
If you need me...

645
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:46,267
- Sorry, man.
- Take her out of here.

646
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,575
These people went too far, and

647
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,193
I'm not gonna lay down.

648
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:53,556
It's my time to make a move.

649
00:38:58,026 --> 00:39:00,087
I'm in this thing all the way
to the end.

650
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:04,763
How'd you find me?

651
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:07,052
I'll always find you, kiddo.

652
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:11,473
So long, buddy.

653
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,566
It's a service weapon,
formerly belonging to Agent Benford.

654
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:23,205
Serial number

655
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,974
A-5-6-1-9-8-4.

656
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,201
- That's the one.
- I'll bring it right out.

657
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,462
- And, demetri?
- Yeah?

658
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:31,118
I have a blowtorch if you want.

659
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,243
Thanks man.

660
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,052
Figured I'd just rent a boat and throw
it out In the middle of the ocean, but,

661
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:41,920
the thought of watching it melt...
not bad.

662
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:44,667
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,240
I can be a little...

664
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:49,748
Confrontational at times.

665
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:51,555
You?

666
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:53,252
No.

667
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:55,865
It's one of the things
you love about me though, right?

668
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,682
It is. It's right up there with

669
00:39:58,151 --> 00:40:00,105
clipping the toenails in bed.

670
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,046
Jerk.

671
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:06,945
It's gone.

672
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:09,855
What are you talking about?

673
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,658
The box is here.

674
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,148
The slip is here.

675
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:14,871
But the gun is gone.
