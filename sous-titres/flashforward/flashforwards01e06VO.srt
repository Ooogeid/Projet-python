1
00:00:00,565 --> 00:00:02,629
<i>
</i>

2
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:04,427
<i>
</i>

3
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:06,297
<i>
</i>

4
00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:10,634
The last time Mark had a problem,
he was away from home

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,763
- testifying in one of his cases.
- Why can't you remember everything?

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,640
Because I was loaded, okay?

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,933
Before he turned around,
the flash-forward ended.

8
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:20,144
- I don't think he saw me.
- His son's your patient.

9
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,105
My son's condition makes him
a little hard to read. Dylan's autistic.

10
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:26,400
You're panicked over what might happen.
But we've gotta use these flash-forwards

11
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,110
- to our advantage.
- Mark.

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,863
We got our funding.
Mosaic's still alive.

13
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,814
I know what caused
the flash-forwards.

14
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,933
- You don't believe me.
- Of course I do.

15
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,460
The world's greatest mystery's
been solved by a boozer

16
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:03,229
on a train bound for Los Angeles.

17
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:06,348
Can you connect to the internet
with that? Real quick.

18
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:09,860
Do an image search
for "quantum physicist genius."

19
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,316
Go on. I'll wait.

20
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:18,494
Which popped up first?
Me winning the Robert Wilson award

21
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,789
or the jaunty one of me holding
lab goggles over my genitals?

22
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,711
Hold up. You really...

23
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,088
- I'm obviously wasting my time.
- I'm sorry.

24
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:31,841
I've just heard
that line a hundred times before.

25
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,468
- You genuinely want to know?
- Of course.

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,012
The flash-forwards
were caused by you.

27
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:40,079
It's simple quantum
mechanics, really.

28
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:43,702
Whenever a heavenly body carries
such an intense force of attraction,

29
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:45,577
the universe just goes...

30
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:46,936
bananas.

31
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:50,901
- Sounds technical.
- Helps if you have a PhD or two.

32
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:54,082
If my calculations are correct,
your dark energy could bring

33
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,031
about another catastrophe
at any moment.

34
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:01,056
Luckily, I've pinpointed
the one location on Earth

35
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:03,811
that has an irresistible enough force
to counteract you.

36
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,186
Let me guess...

37
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:08,405
- Your sleeper car.
- Grab your purse.

38
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:10,045
We've not a moment to lose.

39
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:13,674
I thought for sure that would work.

40
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,801
A 21-year-old sorority girl, maybe.

41
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:19,889
But, I've learned
never to go anywhere.

42
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,640
Unless I'm gonna get the real thing.

43
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,159
The actual cause?

44
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,485
I have a theory, but...

45
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,048
the science is a little complicated.

46
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:33,573
I'm a complicated girl.
I can handle it.

47
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:36,864
The most basic concept you need
to understand is quantum superpositions.

48
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:39,700
Are you aware
of the double slit experiment?

49
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,119
- There was that one time in college...
- What about Schrödinger's cat?

50
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,538
No, I'm not that kinky.

51
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:46,582
Close your eyes.

52
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,059
Give me your hand.

53
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:58,761
Now... imagine you have a cat...

54
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:01,870
B.B.L.'s a liter in the field
and only one P.I.V.

55
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:03,468
We need access here!

56
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,938
A teeny, tiny cat...

57
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,357
- What have we got?
- A gunshot wound to the abdomen.

58
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,819
- We need to set up a peripheral.
- We need access here!

59
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:16,821
That fits in the palm of your hand.

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,743
You also have a poisonous sardine.

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,870
Once we close your palm,

62
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,622
there are two possible scenarios.

63
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,835
Bring the code cart.
Come on, let's go.

64
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,069
Clear.

65
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,967
Either the cat eats the sardine and dies
or doesn't eat it the sardine and lives.

66
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,679
- No response.
- Going again.

67
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,348
Quantum physics says.

68
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,226
Until we open your hand
to discover the cat's fate,

69
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,311
both eventualities occur
at the same time.

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,280
Clear.

71
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:53,774
Still no response.

72
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:55,317
C.P.R.

73
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,737
For us, the cat is
both living and deceased.

74
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,490
- But how can that be?
- The miracle of quantum mechanics.

75
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,815
The observer gets to decide.

76
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,911
The kitty's already
made up its mind.

77
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:07,538
Alive or dead?

78
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,558
See for yourself.

79
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,259
"Scary Monsters and Super Creeps"

80
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,675
Hemoglobin's holding at 12.

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,883
Hallelujah.

82
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:27,516
Fascia's closed.

83
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:30,561
"O" silk on a driver to Dr. Varley.

84
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,231
I'm gonna be honest. A few hours ago,
I didn't think we'd get this far.

85
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,793
Close the skin.

86
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:37,918
Let me know when she wakes up.

87
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:48,404
<i>This is Mark. Leave it here.
I'll get back to you.</i>

88
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,156
Hi. It's me. Where are you?

89
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,910
I have been calling and calling.

90
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:58,691
I tried Demetri and Stan.
I just can't get through.

91
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:02,300
I tried the office,
and they're just stonewalling me.

92
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:04,136
After this thing with Janis,

93
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,097
I don't know, I'm worried.

94
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:08,937
Can you just call me?

95
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:10,253
Please?

96
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,634
I love you.

97
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:32,122
Again, Daddy, again.

98
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,678
- You're not bored with this one?
- No!

99
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:36,794
Cards. Make the cards.

100
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,964
Okay. I'll turn around,
and you choose.

101
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:44,336
So, Dylan,

102
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:47,905
you know it's almost time
for you to leave the hospital.

103
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,476
We're gonna go to Palo Alto.

104
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,684
Which one?

105
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,187
- Which one?
- Did you pick a card?

106
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:57,815
Okay, now look at it

107
00:05:58,165 --> 00:05:59,274
and remember.

108
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,826
Now it's just you and me.

109
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:14,849
I was thinking that the best idea is
you come and live in my house with me.

110
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:22,131
Cards.

111
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,023
We all lived there
before your mother and I...

112
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:28,589
I mean, you'll have your own room.
It'll be great.

113
00:06:29,651 --> 00:06:30,889
- Cards!
- Please.

114
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:33,434
I need you to go along with this.

115
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,489
Is this your card?

116
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,821
It's my house, too.

117
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:47,538
Hey, buddy.

118
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:50,116
- Almost time for tric or treating.
- That's today?

119
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,432
Yeah, it's the 31st. It's Halloween.

120
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,622
- The kids go from room...
- I just forgot to get him a costume.

121
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:57,750
I'll be right back, okay?

122
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Excuse me.

123
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:04,501
- Playing cards, bud?
- It's my house, too.

124
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,036
- How's Janis?
- Two uniformed cops outside her room.

125
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,619
Only her doctor and FBI badges
are allowed inside.

126
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:14,892
- Good work.
- No one will be able to get to her.

127
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:17,437
But what about you guys?

128
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,646
Whoever it was that came
after you last night,

129
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,955
- what's to stop them from trying again?
- Nothing.

130
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:40,893
Are you okay?
What happened?

131
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:42,582
 It's nothing. It's nothing.

132
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,953
But you have blood on your shirt.

133
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,333
Well, now listen.

134
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,812
There's a room full of
FBI agents that need a doctor

135
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,937
to tell 'em if Janis
is gonna make it.

136
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,979
- Oh. Okay.
- All right.

137
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:00,608
- Hi.
- Hey.

138
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,686
We had her in surgery
for five hours.

139
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:05,609
The bullet did some damage, but
there shouldn't be any lasting effects.

140
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:06,693
And?

141
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,246
And she's in recovery.
She's sedated.

142
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,030
We'll know more when she wakes up.

143
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,588
You saved her life.
Thank you.

144
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,512
All right, everybody, it's been
a long night for all of us.

145
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,663
It'll be a while before
we know anything more.

146
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,833
The hospital doesn't need us
clogging things up.

147
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,174
So I got your numbers.
Get some rest.

148
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,868
I'll call you if I hear anything.

149
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:26,296
You, too, Demetri.

150
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,212
I'm sorry, boss, no. I'm either
staying here to see her through,

151
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:32,490
or I'm going out and finding
who did this to us.

152
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,782
There are already
two dozen agents working this

153
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:37,098
who didn't have a grenade
launched at 'em last night.

154
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:40,184
Now I'm serious.
Get outta here.

155
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,698
And if it helps,
consider it an order.

156
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:43,627
Come on.

157
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:49,985
You tired?

158
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,174
Well, Wedeck told us to go home.

159
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,132
No. He said for us
to get out of the hospital.

160
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,845
- It's a surface wound. Just leave it.
- Are you kidding me?

161
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,109
I want to see what
those D.C. doctors did.

162
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:03,667
Livy, it's nothing.

163
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,752
You want to tell me what happened?

164
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:07,646
- You don't...
- I want to know.

165
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:12,889
We were attacked.

166
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,833
Pretty bad firefight.

167
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:19,016
Wedeck and Demetri
killed two of them.

168
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,455
The others escaped.

169
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,251
It's gotta be connected to
the guys who came after Janis.

170
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:26,905
Simultaneous attacks.

171
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,262
Because you're
investigating the blackout?

172
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:31,595
Why would anyone want
to kill you because of that?

173
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,572
I don't know.
I don't know.

174
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,682
Still trying to figure it all out.

175
00:09:38,384 --> 00:09:40,832
Oh, see? I knew
I shouldn't have told you.

176
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:46,677
No, it's not that. It's...

177
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,815
When they brought Janis in,

178
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,295
I couldn't get ahold of you.

179
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,617
My imagination just ran wild...

180
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:56,212
not knowing where you were,

181
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:58,776
not knowing what was going on.

182
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,261
It was horrible.

183
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,738
But I'm here,

184
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:07,396
and I'm okay, all right?

185
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,559
I'm all right.

186
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:13,150
We have just been so...

187
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,395
obsessed with what we saw,

188
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,407
and with the future,

189
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,391
with what might or might not happen.

190
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,381
And it's a distraction.

191
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:24,571
It's just pulling us out of today,
and today, right now

192
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,667
this moment is all we have, babe.

193
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,556
It's all we have.

194
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,637
I don't want to miss it.

195
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:35,451
Me neither.

196
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:48,796
Hey, Dewey.

197
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:50,611
How is she?

198
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:52,444
A lot better than these guys.

199
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,694
Attagirl, Janis.

200
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:54,883
Do you mind?

201
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,835
Got no I.D...

202
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,618
No cell phone, no keys.

203
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:04,663
No fingerprints, no dental records.

204
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,165
It's like our guys
in the parking garage in D.C.

205
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,406
We got nothing.

206
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,200
Got nothing.

207
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,232
Which means
we're dealing with real pros.

208
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,760
What about,
um, medical history, Dewey?

209
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,751
So far just one removed
appendix here,

210
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,264
one Achilles surgery there.

211
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,766
I'm checking for radial keratotomy scars
as we speak.

212
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:35,504
What?

213
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,237
You doing okay in here?

214
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:39,024
Yeah. Why?

215
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,593
You put yourself on Mosaic.

216
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:46,540
You think there's anybody in the office
who doesn't know by now?

217
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,789
But the point is,

218
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:50,758
you just got shot at 12 hours ago.

219
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:52,627
Now you're standing in a morgue...

220
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:54,963
acting kind of weird.

221
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:01,583
You've been acting kind of weird for
a couple of weeks yourself, all right?

222
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,521
So...

223
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:05,891
You want to talk about our feelings,
or you want to get back to work?

224
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,225
Work sounds good.

225
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,001
This guy's right eye is
covered with corneal scarring.

226
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,767
No big surprise there.

227
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:17,652
What assassin worth his salt
doesn't get LASIK?

228
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,897
Should practically be
a union requirement.

229
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:20,822
Wait.

230
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:24,636
You see that?

231
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,974
Looks like a hand stamp from a bar.

232
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,841
No, it's a blue hand.

233
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,074
It's a clue from Mark's board.

234
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:36,295
<i>Something about Baltimore...
A hand... a blue hand.</i>

235
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:41,155
This son of a bitch is
gonna be useful after all.

236
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,014
That costume is super fly.

237
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,355
It was the last thing
they had left in his size.

238
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,019
I like it. Really, it's cool.

239
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,314
Although he doesn't seem
to like this very much.

240
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,447
Yeah, it's hard to tell with him.

241
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:58,733
I think he's mad at
me about the move.

242
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,143
I was wondering
if in the next couple of days

243
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:04,320
Dr. Benford might come by
so we could, uh...

244
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,198
Yeah, say our good-byes.

245
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,285
Yeah, sure, I'll let her know.

246
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:10,634
Great, thanks.

247
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,463
- Hey.
- Hey.

248
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:24,120
I'm glad she's okay.

249
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:27,556
It's pretty scary stuff
for all of us.

250
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:31,059
Listen,

251
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,478
it's been a rough week,
and maybe I said some things

252
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,894
that were

253
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:37,983
out of line. Um...

254
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:43,113
Let's take a deep breath and...

255
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,900
get back on track here, hmm?

256
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,244
This only takes quarters.

257
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,321
I got it.

258
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:56,877
- There.
- Thank you.

259
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,254
We're even now.

260
00:14:04,362 --> 00:14:05,832
The guys who came after you,

261
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:07,960
the guys who shot Janis, all Asian.

262
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,935
Why don't I head over
to Huang's office,

263
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,181
see if blue hand has
some special significance

264
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:14,908
- in Cantonese or Mandarin?
- Mandarin? Come on, man.

265
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,522
According to the CIA,
China might have caused the blackout.

266
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,265
If they did, trying to blow up
a team of federal agents

267
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,844
- seems a little showy, don't you think?
- Well, in their minds,

268
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:25,071
it could be as simple
as neutralizing a threat.

269
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,614
Then why come after us?

270
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,123
The CIA agent who testified
at the hearings yesterday

271
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:32,370
is fine, but Mark talks
about D. Gibbons, Suspect Zero,

272
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,845
the crows, for the first time
outside of this office,

273
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,543
and then 8 hours later, it's...

274
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:39,028
China is a dead end.

275
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,671
I don't want blue hand
to become one, too.

276
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,507
Do you know where you are?

277
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:46,111
I am in a hospital?

278
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:48,653
Very good.
Do you know who I am?

279
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:59,473
But for some weird reason,

280
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,389
I get the feeling that your husband
is a little bit of a neat freak.

281
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:06,806
I don't know.
Something about how

282
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,619
he doesn't like his black pens
to touch his blue pens.

283
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,706
Does that sound familiar?

284
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,507
She's back.

285
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,751
You're an amazing doctor.

286
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:22,352
An overworked one.

287
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:25,984
- I wish I could be with you tonight.
- We'll take pictures.

288
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:28,541
Can you make sure
she doesn't eat too much candy?

289
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,762
- Sure.
- Like, couple of pieces

290
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,350
20.

291
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:34,612
I'll see what I can do.

292
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:37,578
Bye.

293
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,599
When Mark had you pin
the blue hand card to the board,

294
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:44,085
he knew it was related
to the word "Baltimore."

295
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,829
That's what I'm saying. 

296
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:48,695
Okay, Baltimore Street
is 5 miles away.

297
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,850
Let's go.

298
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,766
But you were attacked in D.C.

299
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:54,156
So Baltimore, Maryland,
is the better bet.

300
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:57,207
But the guy who had the blue hand
stamp on him was in L.A.

301
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,666
Baltimore St is in Silver Lake.
If I'm wrong... 

302
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:02,245
We've wasted an hour.
What?

303
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,321
You believe in these visions?

304
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,227
It's complicated.

305
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:09,775
No, I get it.

306
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:13,597
If I hadn't had a flash-forward,

307
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,725
I'd be doing everything I could
to prove those visions weren't true.

308
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:19,548
If we had anything
to go on at all here,

309
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,771
any real-life lead whatsoever,

310
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,567
believe me, I'd be the first 
talking to ballistics or forensics.

311
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,850
But we don't.

312
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,488
I want to find the animals
that are trying to kill us,

313
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,449
and Baltimore St. is the only thing
I can think of.

314
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,907
Come on.

315
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:38,954
I'll buy you a sandwich
from the Cuban place.

316
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:40,624
Sold.

317
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,376
One hour.

318
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,086
Trick or treat!

319
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,385
<i>Super shark has Monkey-See and Monkey-Do
in his helmet! He's trying to eat them!</i>

320
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,556
- Daddy, that pulls.
- Happy Halloween! I've almost got it.

321
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:57,874
I can't believe
you don't have a costume.

322
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,628
- You always have a costume.
- I've been busy, lately.

323
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,865
I can finish 
if you want to get in it.

324
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,005
Thanks, Nicole,
but I'm not wearing a costume.

325
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,430
You could go
as Tim-Tim's dad, Jim-Tim.

326
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,321
What does Tim-Tim's dad look like?

327
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,335
Don't say a word, Obi-Wan.

328
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,498
You've got to be kidding me.

329
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:27,011
Was that a kangaroo?

330
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:30,130
That is the best costume
I have ever seen.

331
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,893
Got some milk from the nurses.

332
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,615
I'm sorry.
I seem to have lost my son.

333
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,910
- What's he look like?
- He's about this big, wearing...

334
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:48,701
A pimp's outfit.

335
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:52,170
- I turned for a second.
- Not seen but there're tons of kids.

336
00:17:52,295 --> 00:17:54,656
- Check the nurses' station.
- Thank you.

337
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,575
Sir, you don't have
to stay here with me.

338
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:01,687
I'm sure after 
that happened last night,

339
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,123
the office is chaotic.

340
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,054
I'm right where I need to be.

341
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,060
I just feel really uncomfortable
in this gown...

342
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,294
I associate those crappy gowns

343
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:15,635
with my wife delivering our son.

344
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:18,253
After you've seen
a thing like that...

345
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:19,694
Was it awful?

346
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,584
Just the opposite.
It's... primal.

347
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:27,608
You feel like you're at the beginning
of something... miraculous...

348
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,795
A new life.

349
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:36,114
You'll see.

350
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,280
What's that?

351
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,330
That little monitor up there.

352
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:48,245
Sorry, we take you back to the O.R.
Bring the type specific.

353
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,794
Blood count's dropping.
Get her on a portable.

354
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,767
- What happened?
- I don't know.

355
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:00,845
Times Square.

356
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:03,391
April 29th.

357
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,644
The estimates on the Mosaic 
have us at half a million people.

358
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:09,979
The ball is gonna drop
and everything.

359
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:12,766
Half a million people
going to their future.

360
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:15,904
It's a glorified New Year's party.

361
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,699
- Do you have something better to do?
- You could say that.

362
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,855
Who is she?

363
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:25,513
Come on.
I told you mine.

364
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:28,791
He...

365
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,628
had a neck like an ox...

366
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,381
smelled like a meat locker.

367
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:38,884
What were you guys doing?

368
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,179
I had my hands around his neck.

369
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,387
I don't know where I was

370
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,444
or who the man was...

371
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:50,842
But I felt my thumbs

372
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,058
press down on his trachea...

373
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:54,797
until something

374
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:56,653
snapped.

375
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:01,859
And then I let go...

376
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:05,995
Looked down at his lifeless body,

377
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:10,123
quite satisfied.

378
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:15,900
Aren't you glad you asked?

379
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,507


380
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,221
- I found this on the south exit camera.
- That's him.

381
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,635
- How long ago was this?
- 17 minutes.

382
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:26,530
Where could he be heading
at this time of night?

383
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:28,678
I have no idea.

384
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:41,503
You getting on?

385
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,722
Then get on. We gotta go.

386
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,365
Hey, kid, you gotta pay the fare!

387
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,627
You gotta pay the fare.
Now do you have it or not?

388
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,530
Are you lost?

389
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:03,594
To our friends,
at 25696 Sawyer Court,

390
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:07,264
Los Angeles, California, 90024.

391
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,761
He's brain damaged?

392
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:12,186
I'm gonna put you down like a sick dog
if you don't shut up.

393
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:16,117
- It's my house, too.
- That's your house?

394
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,962
- You know that address?
- Yeah, and he's gonna need a transfer.

395
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:23,396
That's $1.55.

396
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,271
Don't worry, kid.

397
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:33,374
Do you know any magic tricks?

398
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:36,193
No, <i>mijo,</i> I don't do magic.

399
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:41,341
You said an hour.
It's been over three.

400
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:44,802
She's back in surgery.

401
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:47,347
- She'll pull through.
- Why?

402
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:50,016
She had a flash-forward,
so she has a future?

403
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:53,122
450 out,
and she's tachy in the 130s.

404
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,854
What are we waiting for?
We only have one real option here.

405
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,190
5-0 Vicryl.

406
00:21:58,296 --> 00:22:01,373
- With all due respect, Dr. Benford...
- We're gonna do a B-lynch.

407
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,323
Did I tell you about the night before
she and I graduated from Quantico?

408
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:09,118
We're at some dorm room
getting hammered. I get us a beer.

409
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,361
We finish.
She gets us a couple more...

410
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:12,861
Then a couple of shots,

411
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:14,313
and I'm starting to worry

412
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:16,829
that nerdy little girl's
gonna have to have her stomach pumped.

413
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:18,989
Maybe not a B-lynch
will contain the bleeding.

414
00:22:19,114 --> 00:22:20,786
It's a far less invasive procedure.

415
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:24,043
Gives her a fighting chance of
still having a normal, healthy uterus.

416
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:24,968
Barely.

417
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:29,138
Next thing I know, it's 4:00 A.M.

418
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,350
I wake up on linoleum,
got a foot in the toilet.

419
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:35,346
I look over.
Janis is at the kitchen table

420
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,432
playing quarters against herself.

421
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,676
Her insides are stronger
than any bullet.

422
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:41,719
- I'll tell you that much.
- Be honest.

423
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:44,696
Would you be making the same decision
if you didn't know this patient?

424
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,416
5-0 Vicryl.

425
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,370
Let me get this straight.

426
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:55,580
You blacked out after five drinks,

427
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,594
and you keep your badge?

428
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:58,826
That's...

429
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:00,086
You know why?

430
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,466
Because I'm always right
about everything.

431
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:15,415
It's like the hand on Mark's board.

432
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,301
Trick or treat!

433
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:24,235
Dig in, cowboy, princess.

434
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,819
A very cool costume.

435
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,976
It's my house, too.

436
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:45,673
You really should see a dentist.

437
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,418
My parents couldn't afford braces.

438
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,922
- Thanks for coming out tonight.
- I love Halloween.

439
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,281
And I was worried about you.

440
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:01,098
It's good to see you out
doing normal stuff.

441
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:03,410
I think it's a good idea

442
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:05,224
- for all of us to start...
- Let's go!

443
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,715
Paying a little bit more...

444
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,018


445
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:27,882
Watch her.

446
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:37,140
Stop!
Stay where you are!

447
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:47,527
Same hand,
only this one's missing some fingers.

448
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:48,861
And,

449
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:51,031
the other way.

450
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:53,680
That was the orientation
on our assailant.

451
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,006
Am I crazy, or does it look
like it's pointing that way?

452
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,460
Stop right there! FBI!

453
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:05,327
Wasn't my...

454
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:06,839
It wasn't my idea!

455
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,083
I didn't throw any eggs!
I just threw some toilet paper!

456
00:26:14,812 --> 00:26:17,655
- Where did you get this mask?
- 99 cents store, man.

457
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:19,516
You're not gonna call my dad?

458
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:33,674
I'll be right there.

459
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,731
Makes sense.

460
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:37,887
You run an underground club, you want to
make sure only the right people find it.

461
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,224
If the hand's positioning
is the direction,

462
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,099
why the missing fingers?

463
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,926
The last hand had three fingers?

464
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:44,857
Right.

465
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:47,106
We just drove three blocks.

466
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:52,860
That's it.

467
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,185
Nice.

468
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,155
Sorry, but I tried Olivia first.

469
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,656
- She's in surgery.
- You did the right thing.

470
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,276
He came out of nowhere,
and he had on this hospital bracelet

471
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:04,090
that I was able to get off
and call his dad. He's on his way over.

472
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:07,541
I'm Mark.
What's your name?

473
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,019
My name is Dylan.

474
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:14,135
My favorite book is
"Harry Potter, Prisoners of Azkaban".

475
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,758
My dad does magic.

476
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:22,086
Does your dad know you're here?

477
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:23,516
This is my house, too.

478
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,096
No, Dylan, this is my house, and

479
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:29,105
I'm trying to find out
how you got here from the hospital.

480
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,462
<i>Go ahead.</i>
<i>It's your house, too.</i>

481
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,471
How do you know this address?

482
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,334
<i>"To our friends</i>

483
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:50,251
<i>"at 25696 Sawyer Court,</i>

484
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,044
<i>"Los Angeles, California,</i>

485
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:53,713
<i>"90024."</i>

486
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:56,841
- Hey, Dylan!
- Hi, Charlie.

487
00:27:57,401 --> 00:27:59,179
Nuts to you, Squirrelio!

488
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:00,738
- Toot, toot!
- Toot, toot!

489
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:05,683
What was that?

490
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:07,361
It's from the cartoon.

491
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,603
Do you know Dylan from school?

492
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,815
He's just my friend.

493
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:15,897
What?

494
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:17,933
Excuse me.

495
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,197
Hello.
I think my son is here.

496
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,491
He's right here.
Come on in.

497
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,205
- Are you all right?
- Don't worry, he seems fine.

498
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,159
He slipped out of the hospital.
I can't believe he'd wander off.

499
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:33,142
Thank you for taking
such good care of him, Mr...

500
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:34,969
Benford.
Mark Benford.

501
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,089
And I didn't catch your name.

502
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:40,982
Lloyd Simcoe.

503
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,532
This is my son Dylan.

504
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:54,329
- Wait.
- Benford?

505
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,901
Are you somehow related to Olivia,

506
00:28:58,658 --> 00:28:59,973
Dr. Benford?

507
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,823
I'm her husband.

508
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:05,254
Of course.
That makes perfect sense.

509
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:09,163
Your name being Benford,
her name being Benford.

510
00:29:11,554 --> 00:29:12,810
Trick or treat!

511
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,166
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

512
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,887
You're her.

513
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,046
Not yet.

514
00:29:46,941 --> 00:29:49,668
Charlie, why don't we double check
your candy in the kitchen?

515
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:51,112
Nicole, you want to come?

516
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:52,237
Good idea.

517
00:29:57,717 --> 00:29:58,754
What's going on?

518
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:00,940
I thought you might know.

519
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:02,925
Dylan came here.

520
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,731
- Why?
- This is my house, too.

521
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,763
<i>It's your house, too, Dylan.</i>

522
00:30:11,761 --> 00:30:13,209
He keeps saying that.

523
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,568
Dylan is autistic.

524
00:30:16,187 --> 00:30:18,650
- The repetitive speech...
- I don't need a diagnosis.

525
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:24,912
- Now I understand.
- What?

526
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:26,397
Why I made her...

527
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:28,768
- Why I made you so...
- Uncomfortable?

528
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:31,376
Okay, clearly,

529
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:34,248
this is an unusual situation.

530
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,015
- No kidding.
- Don't be like that.

531
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,255
I can make this comfortable
for everybody.

532
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,435
You leave,

533
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:45,440
you don't come back.

534
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:57,582
I'm very sorry if we've caused you
any inconvenience.

535
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:01,529
Thank you...

536
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,154
Both...
for the kindness you've shown Dylan.

537
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:18,021
Thank you.

538
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,209
It's my house, too.

539
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:23,547
- Come on.
- Good night, Olivia.

540
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:26,197
- Come on, Dylan. Let's go.
- Good night, Dylan.

541
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,498
Looks like the party's over.

542
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,699
Definitely over.

543
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:39,246
These came from a friend
of yours named Maya...

544
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,958
"Worried about you."

545
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:45,626
You okay?

546
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,580
When I got shot...

547
00:32:56,253 --> 00:32:57,335
the bullet...

548
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,917
bounced around all over the place.

549
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,357
The only thing they said
they could do without...

550
00:33:05,806 --> 00:33:07,600
taking the whole thing out...

551
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:13,824
Olivia did this thing
called a B-lynch.

552
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:17,883
But with all the scarring...

553
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:24,524
They said that it's gonna
be almost impossible...

554
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:31,382
Why am I crying?

555
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,483
I never even wanted to have a baby.

556
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,900
It's gonna be all right.

557
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,189


558
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,197
I can see why you like him.
He's very charming.

559
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:55,893
I don't like him. Come on.

560
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:58,609
Can you stop so we can
actually talk about this?

561
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:02,258
I don't like him.

562
00:34:02,383 --> 00:34:05,419
- He's the father of one of my patients.
- I know who he is.

563
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:08,461
I want to know how his son
found his way here.

564
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,755
I have no idea.

565
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:10,793
Really?

566
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:15,188
I'm a little confused,

567
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:18,392
because I thought you said
you had Dylan moved off your rotation.

568
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,900
- I did.
- You did?

569
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:26,620
Then why are you listed
as the attending on his wristband?

570
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:27,648
Oh, God.

571
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,188
I had nothing to do with that.
My boss made the decision.

572
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,528
Your boss also tell you
not to say anything about it?

573
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:35,490
No, I didn't say anything about it

574
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,909
because I thought it would make
a horrendous situation that much worse.

575
00:34:39,192 --> 00:34:41,116
So you thought hiding it
was a better plan.

576
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:44,331
That's not what was going on, Mark.
Don't turn me into someone I'm not.

577
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,416
Don't you turn this around
and make it about me.

578
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:49,760
The man you might be sleeping with in
six months' time was in our living room,

579
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:52,209
and I sure as hell didn't bring him
into our lives. You did!

580
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:53,590
That's not fair.

581
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:54,821
Just be honest.

582
00:34:55,475 --> 00:34:57,260
Just be honest.

583
00:34:57,753 --> 00:34:59,523
Have you been talking
to him at work?

584
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:01,506
Come on!

585
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,058
Come on, Mark.

586
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,519
Have you done anything else
I should know about?

587
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,330
- Mark, don't interrogate me.
- Then be honest with me!

588
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:09,338
I am!

589
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:13,860
- Are you being honest with me?
- What are you talking about?

590
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:16,265
All the old patterns are back, Mark.

591
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,032
You're out of the house
all the time.

592
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:22,691
You're more and more secretive.

593
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,845
So I'm asking you the same thing
that you asked me...

594
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,791
Be honest.

595
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:31,486
Are you hiding anything from me?

596
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:45,642
In my flash-forward...

597
00:35:48,268 --> 00:35:49,328
I was drinking.

598
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:00,824
Here we are again.

599
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:04,522
- This isn't like before.
- The lying's already started.

600
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:07,342
What? No, it hasn't.
This isn't the same.

601
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,785
Don't condemn me for
something I haven't done yet.

602
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,335
Did you even hear
what you just said?

603
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:16,724
You've been punishing me this whole time
for an imaginary relationship.

604
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,426
But when it comes back to you,
you want to be let off the hook.

605
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,106
But our past together, Mark...

606
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:26,417
All we've been through
with your drinking...

607
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:28,768
That's real.

608
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,726
That still hurts.

609
00:36:34,636 --> 00:36:36,286
I'm not going through it again.

610
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:39,479
I promise you...

611
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:40,947
I'm not gonna drink.

612
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,998
But it's not about the drinking.

613
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,318
You know that.

614
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,162
It's about trust.

615
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,666
It's about trust, and we don't
trust each other anymore.

616
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:55,760
So...

617
00:36:56,158 --> 00:36:59,380
everything we said
at the hospital today about...

618
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:01,743
only living in the moment, well...

619
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:04,971
All that was a lie?

620
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,484
It's not a lie.

621
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:10,754
It's what I want.

622
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:14,480
I just don't know
if it's possible anymore...

623
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:17,844
Not now...

624
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:20,831
Not with us.

625
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:39,115
Am I missing something?

626
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,341
On the same night our guy tries
to kill Janis, he's hanging out here?

627
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:44,276
I don't know,

628
00:37:44,603 --> 00:37:46,461
but they found this
on one of the bodies.

629
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:48,321
Remember the Rutherford case?

630
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:51,684
<i>We were talking about a case
that I don't think even exists yet...</i>

631
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,485
<i>The Rutherford case.</i>

632
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:57,524
It begins tonight.

633
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,591
All right.

634
00:38:17,386 --> 00:38:18,503
It was quite a day.

635
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,297
Is it gonna be Halloween
again tomorrow?

636
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:26,371
Just today.

637
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:29,674
Good, 'cause it was kind of scary.

638
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:36,654
Yes, it was.

639
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,159
I'll see you in the morning.

640
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,619
Thanks for coming to get me, daddy.

641
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,464
Damn it, Simon.
You scared me half to death.

642
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,246
Did you ever take the train
down the coastline?

643
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:51,323
Breathtaking.

644
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:54,640
What do you want?

645
00:40:56,277 --> 00:40:57,871
You disappear to Los Angeles.

646
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,454
You don't return my calls.

647
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:02,587
I'm worried about you.
We all are.

648
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:04,444
Yeah, well,
I made it perfectly clear.

649
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:06,588
I don't want to see
any of you right now.

650
00:41:06,895 --> 00:41:08,045
I don't care.

651
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:09,800
We have to talk.

652
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,491
Our experiment killed
20 million people, Simon.

653
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:16,347
What more is there to say?

654
