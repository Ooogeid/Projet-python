2
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:04,856
A Cup of Team

3
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:07,640
synchro :
Baje, kiry, olala.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,690
Tr : chocolate.

5
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,360
This is my home.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,379
My son picked up that parcel.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,315
My job to keep this stuff
outside the house,

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,120
not let it in the door.

9
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:31,804
I let 'em down.

10
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:40,577
It's Mary Bousfield's kidney.

11
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:41,720
Half of it.

12
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:43,255
Half? Jesus.

13
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:45,897
Get it off my table!

14
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,040
This letter came with the package.

15
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,186
It's handwritten, addressed to you.

16
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,720
I think it's safe to assume
it's from the killer.

17
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:02,307
What's it say?

18
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,840
It says, "Mr Miles, sir,

19
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:10,261
I send you half the kidney
I took from one woman,

20
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,261
reserved it for you."

21
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:15,800
"The other piece I fried and ate.
It was very nice."

22
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,623
"I may send you the bloody
knife that took it out

23
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:20,520
if you only wait a while longer."

24
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:23,320
"Catch me when you can."

25
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,480
Exactly the same
as what the Ripper wrote.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,320
What? I've done my research
as well, you know.

27
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,360
Handwriting's unusual,
the way he's shaped the letters.

28
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:34,412
It's eastern European.

29
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:39,177
I've done a lot of courses.

30
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:57,373
A woman was murdered in {\one of }your van{\s}.
We need to find the driver quickly.

31
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,793
With all due respect, Mr Maduro,
you don't have a filing system.

32
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,067
If you can't help
we'll get the VAT man.

33
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:05,486
No! No! VAT - not necessary!

34
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:09,520
I need a secretary, but how do I ask
someone to work in this place?

35
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,520
No, I have a filing system!
Please, let me think!

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,140
- Mr Maduro...
- It is coming to me!

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,000
The night before last, you say. KFC.

38
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,255
I have many drivers.
All hard workers, you know.

39
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:25,052
Poles, Albanians -
you know what I'm saying.

40
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:28,922
- That's off the books, then?
- Everyone wants cash, don't they?

41
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,014
KFC.

42
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,009
I told you I have system.

43
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,742
Driver's name will be in there.

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,156
- We're going to release Buchan.
- No no no! Charge him.

45
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:49,808
- What? We've no evidence of collusion.
- I'll think of something.

46
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:52,301
We believe the killer
relies on him for advice.

47
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:55,485
Mary Kelly is his most complex
murder. He'll have questions.

48
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:57,705
We give him his mentor back,
let him get in touch.

49
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,961
Fine. We put him on surveillance.

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,902
DI Chandler.

51
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,121
I've got a name for the driver
of the van, sir.

52
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,841
Works at the hospital.

53
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,353
Have you got a pen?
I'll have to spell it.

54
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:10,720
- Go ahead.
- Anthony Pricha.

55
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,880
Buchan - out.

56
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,640
- Am I free?
- Yeah.

57
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:24,826
I failed you all.

58
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:28,512
I failed poor Mary,
failed the inquiry...

59
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:31,043
failed all those
who had faith in me.

60
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:32,163
Shut up.

61
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,819
Dr Cohen, this is DS Miles.
Do you have a minute?

62
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,826
Yeah, but if this is about
Emma Jones,

63
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:42,760
you should talk to Dr Phillips.
He treated her when she came in.

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,544
John, this is DI Chandler, the detective
I was telling you about.

65
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm afraid Emma Jones
is still in a coma.

66
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:50,443
But I'd be happy to help if I can.

67
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,760
We're looking for a porter,
Anthony Pricha.

68
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,285
The morgue man?

69
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:57,392
The morgue man?

70
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:59,720
I'll show you where to find him.

71
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:34,089
Hello?

72
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:40,240
Great. He's not here.

73
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,581
Wait a moment.

74
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:57,958
This is Anthony Pricha.

75
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,683
So you're the morgue man?

76
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:07,405
You must enjoy
the company of the dead.

77
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,307
The dead... I don't care.

78
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:11,120
I want to sleep.

79
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,363
You're 23,

80
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,160
- is that right?
- Yes.

81
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:20,603
I don't look too good
for my age. But come on,

82
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:22,480
23?

83
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,273
- What've you been playing at, son?
- I lived through a war.

84
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,120
- In Kosovo?
- Yes.

85
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:33,261
And I... see my family killed.

86
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:35,600
I see my house burned.

87
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:37,504
I am shot.

88
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,595
For them, I'm dead man.

89
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:44,500
But I live. I come to England.

90
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:47,120
I work. I eat.

91
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:48,880
But I am dead man.

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,520
You must get flashbacks.

93
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:52,023
Nightmares.

94
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:56,919
I bet sometimes you feel like
you're going to explode.

95
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,920
So what do you do then?
Do you go and look for a woman?

96
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,339
For woman, you need time.
You need money.

97
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,341
Why waste time and money, eh?

98
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:08,161
You can do what you like
once they're dead.

99
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,507
I don't know what you say to me.

100
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:16,927
How long have you worked
for AC Maduro Health & Safety?

101
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,664
- I no work there.
- Driving vans for Mr Maduro?

102
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:21,200
I do not know Mr Maduro.

103
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:23,720
- He knows you. He hired you.
- No.

104
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:24,960
Not me.

105
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:29,373
All right, Anthony. Tell me
about the work you do.

106
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:31,766
<i>I work in hospital.</i>

107
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:33,986
I work in kitchen in Brick Lane.

108
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,560
Sometimes I work in factory,
but it's no good there I think.

109
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,640
- They do not always pay.
- But Maduro pays, cash in hand.

110
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:43,747
I do not know him.
If I know him, I tell you.

111
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:46,334
Have you heard of Jack the Ripper?

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,176
The experts reckon he was
a foreign fella like yourself.

113
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,796
I no work for Maduro.
No work for Jack.

114
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:55,840
There's a Russian.
He knows where to get jobs,

115
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,560
but he's bad man I think.

116
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,624
You're going to stop with all
this helpless asylum-seeker crap

117
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:03,251
and start answering
the bloody questions,

118
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:06,607
or you'll regret the day
you set foot in this country.

119
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,127
My mother is dead.

120
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:10,343
My father is dead.

121
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,891
My brother, my sisters are dead.

122
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:15,394
What can you do to me?

123
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:17,972
I have nothing for you to take!

124
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:26,080
We need Maduro to ID Pricha,
and get past this whole pretence

125
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,790
- of him not knowing about the van.
- I'll fetch him myself.

126
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,640
McCormack, trace the parcel. See if
anyone remembers Pricha sending it{\ to Miles}.

127
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Guv.

128
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,657
I hate witnesses.

129
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:38,368
Necessary evil.

130
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,061
They're all boss-eyed,
with memories like goldfish.

131
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,231
Can't make a case without them.

132
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,347
OK.

133
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:55,920
Take your time.
Look at each man carefully.

134
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:59,040
When you're satisfied,
tell me which man you hired

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
to drive for your company.

136
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,920
You made a mistake.
This is the wrong line-up.

137
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
Anthony is not even there.

138
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:22,760
Yeah, I remember that parcel.

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,560
- Really?
- I remember him.

140
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,773
I KNEW he was up to something.
You can tell, innit?

141
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:31,143
Didn't like him at all.
He made me think of the devil.

142
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:34,800
- What do you mean, the devil?
- Like an evil presence, you know?

143
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:39,052
He has this parcel, and he wants to know
his first-class post 100% reliable.

144
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:40,800
He doesn't want
his parcel go missing.

145
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,800
I tell him about recorded delivery,
he don't want to know.

146
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,640
I say "You've got legs, why not walk it?
It's only round the corner, innit?"

147
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,000
I didn't see why he had to post it
when he could have easily taken it.

148
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,800
- Can you describe this man?
- 5'9",

149
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,760
medium build, not fat or nothing,

150
00:08:57,713 --> 00:08:59,902
staring eyes, like a wolf.

151
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,190
He had a hat on, one of those blue
felt ones with a little peak.

152
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:08,280
Big moustache. I thought maybe he
wasn't English, but he sounded OK.

153
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,494
And the colour of his hair,
his eyes?

154
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:13,480
- Dark. Very dark. All over.
- You mean black?

155
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,362
I mean his aura.

156
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:19,360
If you saw him again,
would you recognise him?

157
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,720
Yes, I would. Want to see him?

158
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:25,080
- We have CCTV.
- I don't believe this.

159
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,273
That's fantastic, Mrs Buki.

160
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,560
I wish all witnesses were like you.

161
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:34,695
No, not him.

162
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:37,440
It's further on, actually.

163
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
That's him.

164
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,022
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. That's who gave me the parcel.

165
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:47,242
See? That moustache and the hat?

166
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,640
Stop. That's the man I hire.

167
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:55,656
That's Anthony.

168
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,560
The killer stole Pricha's identity

169
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:10,401
and used false documents to obtain
a job at AC Maduro Health & Safety.

170
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:14,030
The Anthony Pricha we arrested
had no idea his ID had been taken.

171
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,690
He's a genuine refugee,
and has no connection to the murders.

172
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,810
THIS is the man who sent half of
Mary Bousfield's kidney to DS Miles.

173
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,160
THIS... is the man Mr Maduro hired.

174
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,143
It's the same man.

175
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,382
This is our killer.

176
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:35,253
I know him!

177
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,160
- I mean, I've seen him before.
- Get the mug books.

178
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:40,129
Find him.

179
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,669
I've seen him. I know it. I remember
those eyes. They gave me the creeps.

180
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:46,545
Give him some air!

181
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:50,360
Take your time.
Look at one face at a time.

182
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,445
Saw his face recently.

183
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:56,320
There was a picture...

184
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,840
I know him. I just know it. I...

185
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,870
- Is that him?
- Yeah!

186
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, that's him.

187
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:25,920
That's Severin Klosowski,

188
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,360
- hanged 1903 for poisoning his wife.
- Oh, no.

189
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,600
Abberline, the detective who chased
the Ripper, said he was the one.

190
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,210
We're not getting any closer
to this guy, and he knows it.

191
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,720
- Sorry, sir.
- it's all right.

192
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:44,291
Be on Traffic tomorrow.

193
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,230
Nothing remains
of no.29 Hanbury Street.

194
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:01,576
And this is as close as we can get

195
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:04,720
to where the body of Annie Chapman
was found in the back yard.

196
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:07,059
Annie Chapman had three children,

197
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:11,864
Emily Ruth, Annie Georgina
and John. Poor John was a cripple,

198
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:15,800
and Emily died of meningitis.

199
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,340
Annie took to drink, and

200
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:22,077
- her marriage fell apart,
- Oh, get to the murder!

201
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:24,320
Isn't it enough for you
that the poor woman died?

202
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,680
The New Ripper's been
killing them round here.

203
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,149
Why don't you take us
to those murder sites?

204
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:32,109
- At least they exist!
- Yeah! Come on!

205
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,493
This is a classic Ripper tour.

206
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:38,994
Where's your decency,
your compassion?

207
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:43,349
What? Murder is not entertainment!

208
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:45,915
Go home.

209
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,396
- Crawl back under your rocks!
- Show us the murder sites!

210
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:50,648
No.

211
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:53,369
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,236
I can't do this any more.

213
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:59,172
- At least give us our money back.
- We paid our money!

214
00:12:59,297 --> 00:13:00,597
Here! Come back!

215
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,760
<i>Police have come under fire
for being slow to react</i>

216
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,321
<i>to the spate of Jack the Ripper
copycat murders in the east end.</i>

217
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,319
<i>- Fear has gripped Whitechapel...
- It's one week since Mary Bousfield</i>

218
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:26,398
<i>a community support officer,
found murdered in Mitre Square,</i>

219
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:29,298
<i>thought to be the third victim
of the Jack the Ripper copycat...</i>

220
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:32,274
<i>waiting game, if they are right
about the theory...</i>

221
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,644
<i>according to leading Ripper experts,</i>

222
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:37,664
<i>the final murder will take place
on November 9.</i>

223
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,865
<i>All the police know is
that the victim will have red hair</i>

224
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:44,029
<i>and the murder will be acted out
in London's east end.'</i>

225
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,149
<i>The Ripper destroyed her face.</i>

226
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:49,035
<i>He cut off her breasts, gutted her</i>

227
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:51,605
<i>and stripped the skin
from her thighs.</i>

228
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:54,464
<i>Mary's heart was cut out
and never found.</i>

229
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:57,275
<i>- Police are now...
- ... happen anywhere,</i>

230
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:00,633
<i>and police are no nearer
to pinpointing where that might be.</i>

231
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,253
<i>All we know is this.</i>

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,830
<i>"Mary Kelly had long red hair,</i>

233
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,597
<i>and her last meal consisted
of fish and potatoes.</i>

234
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:12,240
<i>Public concern focuses on the lack
of perceived police presence</i>

235
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,157
<i>in the east end...
Police are under enormous pressure</i>

236
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:18,127
<i>to catch the killer
before he strikes again...</i>

237
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:43,522
Where's McCormack?

238
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:46,319
Interviewing his third Ripper
of the day.

239
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,520
- All the loonies are confessing.
- I know.

240
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,505
Sanders is on the Buchan shift.

241
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:54,038
Everyone else is out interviewing
Mary Bousfield's friends.

242
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,000
The DI seems to be living here.
D'you think he's all right?

243
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:00,379
No.

244
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:09,255
I know what you need.

245
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:17,076
You got to eat.

246
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:20,369
You got to focus.
You got to eat.

247
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:23,995
What, you got no appetite?

248
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:37,908
We've got two days until he copies
the murder of Mary Kelly.

249
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,880
I've been out all night,
retracing his steps,

250
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:46,718
over and over, trying to work out
how he's going to do it.

251
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:51,560
This murder could happen
anywhere, in any flat.

252
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,020
She was torn apart. He completely...

253
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:56,824
he completely ripped her to pieces.

254
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:02,988
- You were right about me.
- All PR and paperwork.

255
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:07,640
I can't hide it any more.
I'm - I'm not up to it.

256
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:11,098
I don't think there's one of us
that finds it easy.

257
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,598
When we're at the scene,
we get on with it.

258
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:16,062
There's a process. We're trained.

259
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,000
But once we're on our own,
it's different.

260
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,784
McCormack dreams of his perfect pub.

261
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:24,160
Sanders takes his kids out.

262
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,040
He thinks we don't know,
but Kent has a little cry

263
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,160
in the bogs or the car park.

264
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:33,934
You say you're not up to it. Being up to
it has got nothing to do with the dead.

265
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,720
Being up to it's turning up next
morning at 9:00 am no matter what.

266
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:40,453
So eat up, sir.

267
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:53,800
What about you? What do you do?

268
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,447
When I get home I go straight down
to my garden, to my pond.

269
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:03,083
I've got a nice bit of seating there,
away from the house, a bit of privacy,

270
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,181
and I feed my fish.

271
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,534
I got carp, real beauties.

272
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:10,782
They come up,
take the food out of my hand.

273
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,599
Them fish save me,

274
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,120
my job, my marriage.

275
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:19,518
You want to get yourself some fish.

276
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,738
Better than crying in car parks.

277
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:36,359
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

278
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:40,106
- Glad you made it, sir.
- For some time...

279
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,889
- Thought you should see this.
- What's happening?

280
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,759
It's not a Ripper tour.
It's something else.

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,650
Many of you have read
my best-selling book

282
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:52,040
Like other authorities on Jack,
I have long believed

283
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,444
that Mary Kelly was the last victim
of the Ripper.

284
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:57,958
Well...

285
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:02,449
I was wrong.

286
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,693
I would like it to be known that in my
expert opinion, Mary Kelly was not...

287
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:12,440
murdered by the Ripper.

288
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:15,616
Kelly was murdered in her lodgings
on her bed,

289
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,240
but Jack always killed
in the street.

290
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,951
Mary was torn to pieces
in a frenzy, but Jack...

291
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,921
always had an objective
and he was controlled.

292
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,348
I believe Catherine Eddowes was
Jack's last victim, here...

293
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:30,600
in Mitre Square.

294
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,280
After her, there were no more
Ripper killings.

295
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,240
Do you truly believe that?

296
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,505
I'm prepared to destroy
my life's work and start again,

297
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:43,694
such is the force of my conviction.

298
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:48,448
He's lost the plot.

299
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,125
No.

300
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,191
I know what he's doing.

301
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:04,022
Are you going to be OK?

302
00:19:05,158 --> 00:19:07,708
That's all I could think of
to stop him.

303
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:10,389
It's not much,
but it's all I've got.

304
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,400
- There's still your inquiry, though.
- Nobody else wants my job.

305
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
They just want to stand back
and watch me go down in flames.

306
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:20,715
Tell me Joe...

307
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:23,996
- who do you think was {\Jack }the Ripper?
- What does it matter?

308
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:25,216
I'm serious.

309
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:28,080
If you can't decide who he{\the Ripper} is,
how will you catch your killer?

310
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,160
{\It's completely}Irrelevant.

311
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,973
The killer's decided
who the Ripper was.

312
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,240
You've got to see things
through his eyes.

313
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:36,573
This is your last chance.

314
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,040
Who killed Mary Kelly?

315
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,875
I've done all I can, Joe.

316
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,215
It's down to you now.

317
00:19:57,003 --> 00:20:00,741
Oh, lovely! Oh, look at that!
It's a board game!

318
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:03,481
It's like a game,
and helpful to the inquiry.

319
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,399
- We'll play it!
- Happy birthday, Skip.

320
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:09,743
- I'll get it.
- Hey, give him a beer.

321
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:14,245
Joe! Lovely. Come in.

322
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:18,840
- Did you come on your own?
- Yeah.

323
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:21,584
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks!

324
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:24,704
You could have brought
a friend, or a... partner.

325
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:28,330
- You think I'm gay?
- Wouldn't matter if you were.

326
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,550
I'm not gay.

327
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:31,619
No one is on the Job, obviously.

328
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,426
{\But }Don't{\you} worry.
My boys are above all that.

329
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:34,982
I appreciate{\your openness and} inclusivity!

330
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:39,440
Come and have a drink, and thanks
for the fish food. Very thoughtful.

331
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:44,255
- He's obviously covering his tracks.
- Buchan's trying to prevent a murder

332
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,154
by convincing the killer
Mary Kelly never happened.

333
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:49,956
- You can't change history.
- He's trying to save a life.

334
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:53,526
You should have seen him
burning his books. He was gutted.

335
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:58,680
- You must change {\may have to change}your mind about him.
- Irritating, interfering, pompous -

336
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,693
I thought you'd appreciate
the importance of a man's reputation,

337
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:04,187
and what it costs him
when he loses it.

338
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:11,440
Buchan's destroyed a name he took 20
years to build. That means something.

339
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:13,464
Yeah, all right.

340
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:16,520
Maybe he didn't know who he was
talking to on the website.

341
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:19,616
- He's an unwitting accomplice.
- Yeah, all right.

342
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,440
So if Buchan doesn't lead
to the killer...

343
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,939
where does that leave us?

344
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,110
I mean, the next killing's
tomorrow night.

345
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:36,596
I'm going to check on my fish.

346
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,971
- Beer?
- Oh, cheers.

347
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:49,621
Cheers.

348
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,345
If you'd been a copper back then,

349
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:58,385
if you were Abberline,

350
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,003
who would you fancy for the Ripper?

351
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:03,720
- Yeah, I've thought about that a lot.
- Yeah, me too.

352
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:06,680
What if the original Jack
was also wearing disguises?

353
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:08,788
What if Jack was a woman?

354
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:11,680
A crazed abortionist,
stealing uteruses?

355
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,717
- Yeah, that's likely.
- Nurses make great serial killers.

356
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,676
Jill the Ripper.

357
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:21,967
Can't have kids herself,
so she steals women's wombs,

358
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,197
stops them from having
what she can't have.

359
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:26,417
No. Women poison, or they shoot.

360
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,073
Their victims are usually
the very young or the very old.

361
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:31,357
All right then. Whodunit?

362
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,439
Well, I think Jack would have been
in his thirties.

363
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,002
He was local, lived alone,

364
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,469
probably in the area
where the murderers took place.

365
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:41,598
He was a labourer, shabbily dressed,

366
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:43,789
well known to the prostitutes,
who trusted him.

367
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:46,564
He knew two victims quite well,
Catherine Eddowes and Mary Kelly,

368
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:50,209
- since he mutilated their faces.
- OK. You've given me a profile.

369
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:53,105
- So now give me a name.
- George Hutchinson.

370
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,484
A witness saw him with Mary Kelly
before she died.

371
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:59,000
After that witness gave her
statement, Hutchinson gave another,

372
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:01,480
saying he'd seen her
going off with another man.

373
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,121
Hutchinson's statement
was incredibly detailed,

374
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:07,613
even down to the man's
horseshoe-shaped tiepin.

375
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,798
And we know what witnesses are like.
No memory, and boss-eyed.

376
00:23:10,918 --> 00:23:13,479
He talked about the colour
of the man's spats,

377
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,339
the fact that he was carrying a parcel
covered in American cloth,

378
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,991
he remembered the brown
kid gloves he had...

379
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:21,761
To 2:00 am, by an unlit passageway?
Please.

380
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,728
He invented that man,
without question,

381
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:25,960
to avoid being the last person
to see Mary Kelly alive.

382
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,937
- Was Hutchinson ever a suspect?
- No.

383
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:33,564
The police believed his story about
a posh man in an astrakhan coat.

384
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:36,984
They went looking for somebody
quite unlike Hutchinson.

385
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:39,478
I still prefer my mad bird theory.

386
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:54,072
Fire Investigation
have identified the accelerants

387
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,440
- used in the Wilkes St fire.
- They took their{\ bloody} time.

388
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,880
Benzoin, phenyl, collodion.
That mean anything to you?

389
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:03,972
Maduro had them in his vans!
Come on.

390
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,356
- Where to, Maduro's?
- No. Wilkes Street.

391
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:22,304
I think the killer set fire to this
building the night of the first murder,

392
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:24,924
to set the right
historical atmosphere.

393
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:29,159
But he had no blueprints
to work from, no coroner's report.

394
00:24:30,661 --> 00:24:32,111
He was improvising,

395
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:35,057
so he might have made a mistake.

396
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:40,752
It says here
there were three seats of fire.

397
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:42,733
There...

398
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:44,866
There...

399
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:47,955
and over there.

400
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,170
- He knew what he was doing, then?
- No, just the opposite.

401
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:56,021
A professional arsonist would set one
blaze and completely gut the building.

402
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:58,560
This guy didn't trust his tools.
He went belt and braces.

403
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:02,846
He set too many fires, which ate up
all the oxygen in the room...

404
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,842
and stopped the fire from spreading.

405
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:16,000
The killer stopped e-mailing Buchan
after the first murder, didn't he?

406
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:18,526
Yeah, the same night as the fire.

407
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,647
I think I know why, then.

408
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:29,000
Could be his computer.

409
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,120
Get this examined.

410
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:40,046
Miles, we think we found
the killer's computer, at Wilkes St.

411
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,520
<i>That's great, boss.</i>

412
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,880
- So are you coming in?
<i>- No. I've something to do.</i>

413
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:47,169
George Hutchinson lived
in the Victoria Working Men's Home,

414
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:49,461
at the epicenter
of where the murders took place.

415
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,741
It's a block of flats now.
I'll knock on a few doors.

416
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:54,880
- Call it my eureka moment.
- He's had a eureka moment.

417
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,320
Don't go in without backup.
It's a rough estate.

418
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,257
I'll be fine, Mother.

419
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:02,155
We'd better go and hold his hand.

420
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:16,801
<i>-Yeah, man, who that?</i>
- It's me, mate, innit?

421
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:49,503
Excuse me? Hello?

422
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:51,919
Hello?

423
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:54,201
Can I... I was wondering -

424
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,720
Excuse me? Thanks for stopping.

425
00:27:01,014 --> 00:27:04,080
Could I ask some questions
about some of your neighbours?

426
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:07,713
I'm down on whores,
and I shan't quit rippin' 'em

427
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,720
till I do... get... buckled.

428
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:11,560
You say?

429
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,960
My God!

430
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:50,520
You've got a head injury.
You need to go to hospital.

431
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,265
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're as pretty as me now.

432
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:56,485
Not quite. I didn't hit every step
on the way down.

433
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:01,824
You ready, sir?

434
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:03,763
Do it.

435
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:25,120
Bloody hell.

436
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,881
Miles! In here.

437
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,234
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

438
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:18,200
Bloody hell. Sir!

439
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:20,920
There's more.

440
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:30,836
I can't believe this.

441
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:32,229
Oh, my God.

442
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:36,477
Bloody hell.

443
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:47,177
It's the leather apron.

444
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:07,320
I want Socos in here now. We need to
go through every inch of this place.

445
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:13,214
It's all here. Look.
Every last detail.

446
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,225
Is there anything about Mary Kelly?

447
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:18,475
Nothing we don't know. She lived
in Miller's Court with a Joe Barnet.

448
00:30:18,595 --> 00:30:21,760
- Her last meal was fish and potatoes.
- That's really going to help.

449
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:25,465
- Miller's Court's over the road.
- Not now. It's a car park.

450
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:27,018
What do you want me to say?

451
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:29,480
All we know is he's going
to rip her apart in her flat,

452
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,461
on her bed,
and recreate what happened...

453
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:34,381
- The victim'll have long red hair?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

454
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:37,811
I think I've found her.

455
00:30:38,577 --> 00:30:41,827
I've seen her before.
She's a nurse from the hospital.

456
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,917
Get her ID'd and under protection.
Go. Now.

457
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,494
McCormack, go with him.

458
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:49,359
There must be something{\ amongst all this }
that tells us who the guy is.

459
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,303
Excuse me, love?

460
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,080
Excuse me. Do you know this woman?
I need to find her.

461
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:12,054
<i>... physician, named Aesclepius,</i>

462
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:15,624
<i>who enraged the gods by bringing
a dead man back to life.</i>

463
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,654
<i>As punishment
for this manmade miracle,</i>

464
00:31:18,774 --> 00:31:20,459
<i>Zeus killed Aesclepius.</i>

465
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,979
<i>But from respect for his ability,</i>

466
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:26,534
<i>placed the dead physician's soul
amongst the stars...</i>

467
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,891
This is a nightmare. There are
dozens of birth certificates.

468
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:34,480
- One of them must be his.
- I don't recognise any names.

469
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,810
Yeah. Kent?

470
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:40,160
Her name is Frances Coles.
She's a midwife.

471
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,174
They've ID'd her.
Frances Coles, a midwife.

472
00:31:43,294 --> 00:31:44,640
Have you made contact?

473
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,600
<i>- She's not answering.</i>
- He can't get her on the phone.

474
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
Her address is Clerkenwell Rd...

475
00:31:50,164 --> 00:31:52,640
- They've got an address.
- Send a tactical unit.

476
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,129
We'll meet you there.

477
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:57,069
No! We need to find HIM.
The answer must be here somewhere.

478
00:31:57,189 --> 00:32:00,280
The last murder will be tonight.
Something must point to who he is.

479
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,480
These are obviously
false identities.

480
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,880
I think the real man disappeared
years ago, and we're left with this.

481
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:10,378
As far as we're concerned, he's an
unidentified person. A John Doe.

482
00:32:10,692 --> 00:32:12,192
John Doe? Oh my God!

483
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,360
You know what the police called
a John Doe of Jewish origin in 1888?

484
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,170
- What?
- David Cohen.

485
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,480
- Who's David Cohen?
- Dr David Cohen!

486
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:28,339
- We can postpone if you like.
- No, don't be silly. Come in.

487
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:30,736
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

488
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,920
I don't want to be alone tonight,
anyway.

489
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:37,974
- Where's John?
- Couldn't get away from A&E.

490
00:32:39,303 --> 00:32:41,280
- Typical.
- He said to say sorry.

491
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:43,880
He wanted me
to really look after you.

492
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,040
I really hope you like fish pie.

493
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
I love it.

494
00:33:12,454 --> 00:33:15,360
- Yeah.
- We're just about to go in now, sir.

495
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:17,704
They're going in.

496
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,487
That was wonderful. Thank you.

497
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:23,440
Great. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

498
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:26,160
Where's your bathroom?

499
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:28,640
It's through the bedroom
and on the left.

500
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,427
I hope you like ice cream.

501
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,334
Any thoughts on music?

502
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:17,480
Clear.

503
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,160
- Clear?
- Clear.

504
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:24,520
- All clear, boss.
- Shit.

505
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:34,440
- She's not here.
- What do you mean?

506
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,520
It's empty.

507
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,134
Search the flat for anything
that might tell us where she is.

508
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:42,680
Mum, dad, brothers, sisters,
boyfriends, whatever.

509
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,160
I want every address within
a 5 min. walk of where I am now.

510
00:35:46,462 --> 00:35:49,280
She's close, I know it. Just round
the corner, just like Mary Kelly.

511
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,690
We need to look for an address
where she might be. Go!

512
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:09,026
Yes, yes, yes! Kent!

513
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,960
- Got an address book, sir.
- They found an address book.

514
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,680
- Somerford St?
- No. No, no. Nearer.

515
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:21,927
- How about Leonard St?
- Leonard St? It's miles away.

516
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,703
Nearer than that, come on guys!

517
00:36:23,823 --> 00:36:26,400
Hutchinson lived
a stone's throw from Mary Kelly.

518
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:29,814
- The address must be a street away.
- Like Wentworth St?

519
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:32,400
Wentworth or Dawes St.
It's as near as that.

520
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,160
Come on, we're running out of time.

521
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,584
If we get this wrong, she's dead.

522
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,240
- I've got one. Got one.
- Hang on a sec.

523
00:36:42,231 --> 00:36:43,760
It's Bethnal Green. Sorry.

524
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,554
Come here, you bitch!

525
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:51,667
I've found one.
Could be a boyfriend, really close.

526
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:54,840
A man called John Phillips,
237 Chapel Wharf Buildings,

527
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,721
<i>Flower and Dean St.</i>

528
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:59,763
- Flower and Dean. Spot on.
- Got it!

529
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:05,033
How do you know
she's going to be there?

530
00:37:05,153 --> 00:37:06,309
I know him now.

531
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:09,279
- I can feel it, Miles. Trust me.
- All right.

532
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,552
- Dr Phillips's flat.
- 237. Fifth floor.

533
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:55,040
Who are you?

534
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:03,680
Gotcha, you bastard!

535
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:23,560
Check the girl. I'm all right.
Check the girl.

536
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:31,408
You all right?

537
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:34,480
Sure?

538
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:36,080
Miles, she's fine.

539
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:44,014
Miles? She's fine...

540
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:54,691
Emergency assistance required.
DS Miles is down.

541
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:57,361
Suspect on the run.
He's wearing scrubs.

542
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:02,384
Just... just hang on. Please.

543
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:04,955
Just hang on.

544
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,968
OK. You're going to be OK.

545
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:19,730
You've failed.

546
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,800
With due respect, sir,
I saved 2 lives.

547
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,639
That lunatic is still free.
How long till he kills again?

548
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:26,974
- What atrocities are still to come?
- He won't kill again.

549
00:39:27,094 --> 00:39:30,094
Why should he stop?
We don't even know who he is.

550
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:32,498
We know nothing
about his real identity.

551
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:36,618
9 November is over. He doesn't get
another chance to kill a Mary Kelly.

552
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:39,160
He's failed.
Nothing left to live for.

553
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:41,680
He'll want to die
and preserve his anonymity.

554
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,275
He wants to be a myth,
like the first Jack.

555
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:47,371
I think if we monitor suicides in
the capital over the next 2 weeks,

556
00:39:47,491 --> 00:39:49,640
- he'll turn up.
- Well, it's not your call any more.

557
00:39:49,985 --> 00:39:52,920
{\Incompetent: The Officer
who let the ripper escape}

558
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:56,040
You could have been great.
We had such ambition for you.

559
00:39:57,443 --> 00:39:58,443
But now...

560
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:02,480
I'm going to have to cut you loose.

561
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,640
Nothing but a DI.

562
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,410
Thank you.

563
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:27,138
Your mother said I'd find you here.

564
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:28,906
Hello, Joe.

565
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
How are you?

566
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,100
I have to know.

567
00:41:35,922 --> 00:41:37,672
You looked into his eyes.

568
00:41:38,702 --> 00:41:40,052
What was he like?

569
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:42,360
He was just a man.

570
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:47,360
And I'm always amazed
at the evil men do.

571
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:50,813
Will you drink to her?

572
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:53,926
Yes, of course.

573
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:01,916
To you, Mary.

574
00:42:11,277 --> 00:42:12,827
What will you do now?

575
00:42:13,189 --> 00:42:15,040
My investigating days are not over.

576
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:18,071
Wherever there's a mystery,
the unexplained,

577
00:42:18,191 --> 00:42:20,880
the whiff of conspiracy,
I'll be there.

578
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,440
I'm sure you're the right
man for the job.

579
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:26,172
Join me.

580
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,461
We'd make a great team.

581
00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:30,880
Boss!

582
00:42:31,472 --> 00:42:32,572
We gotta go!

583
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:37,889
- Would you like a lift?
- No, no no.

584
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:40,509
You're very kind,
but I prefer the bus.

585
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:43,440
You see all of human life that way.

586
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:05,531
It's not all serial killers
and car chases

587
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:08,440
- and saving the girl, you know.
- I know that.

588
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:13,000
Gangland murder. Drug-related.
Domestic. Aggravated burglary.

589
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,934
Knock on the head for no reason
on a Friday night - Whitechapel.

590
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:17,680
- You up for that?
- I'm here.

591
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,590
Two tea bags and milk, Skip.
Green tea, sir.

592
00:43:21,526 --> 00:43:22,776
Want a biscuit?

593
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:25,240
They're wholemeal. Help you think.

594
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,221
What have we got?

595
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:31,240
Stab wound to the chest.
Looks like a mugging gone bad.

596
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:32,644
It might be.

597
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,825
Perhaps the killer wants us
to dismiss it as a random attack,

598
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:39,695
- so we don't dig any deeper.
- Don't start.

599
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:42,555
Don't you have a nice desk to go to?

600
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,920
No, I don't. Let's go.

601
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:47,240
With the greatest respect,

602
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,885
9 times out of 10, if it looks
like a mugging, it's a mugging.

603
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,689
And if it looks like a domestic,
it's a domestic.

604
00:43:52,809 --> 00:43:54,854
- But it wasn't last time{\, was it}?
- No, fair enough,

605
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:58,474
but the exception proves the rule.
If this is an exception?

606
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:07,076
