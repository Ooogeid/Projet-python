1
00:00:00,204 --> 00:00:03,231
We have a dead woman in Whitechapel.
Ready to head up your first murder?

2
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:04,334
Oh, yes.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,996
DI Chandler. DS Miles.
You worked a murder scene before?

4
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:08,760
I think the killer knelt
by her head,

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,564
then cut her throat left to right.{\with his right hand.}

6
00:00:11,684 --> 00:00:14,120
The man who killed your lady
was copying Jack The Ripper.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,920
The man who's attacking these women

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,609
in 2008 is his biggest fan.
We have a copycat.

9
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,560
- Detach yourself.
- If another woman dies?

10
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:23,121
Then, we never
had this conversation.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,604
You were right.
So, all you've got to do now

12
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:30,729
is solve the unsolvable and catch
the most famous serial killer ever.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
I'm here to see the commander.

14
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:21,996
The murder of Alice Graves
is an exact recreation

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,990
of the murder of Annie Chapman.

16
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,767
Alice Graves was found in a backyard
with her throat cut

17
00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:30,876
and body horribly mutilated,
just like Annie Chapman in 1888.

18
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:34,398
It was virtually identical,
down to the date,

19
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:37,756
the time, the things left
at her feet, the envelope nearby.

20
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:42,218
The pathologist was sure that who ever
did this had no{\specialist} medical knowledge.

21
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,156
He can handle a knife and the gore,
but he's an amateur,

22
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:47,516
working from coroner's reports
of the Ripper's victims.

23
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:50,134
I think we get the picture,
Inspector.

24
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:54,166
If he is copying Jack The Ripper,
as you say,

25
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,825
then we can expect
three more murders.

26
00:01:57,003 --> 00:02:00,436
- Not if we can stop him.
- When did you identify this pattern?

27
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:02,280
Eight days ago.

28
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:04,036
And Alice Graves died when?

29
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:06,933
Yesterday morning.

30
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:10,764
If you knew a murder
was going to happen,

31
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,634
we should have been told.

32
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:19,229
It was only a theory up until
yesterday. I didn't have any proof.

33
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:24,479
Joe, wait.

34
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,716
- At least I know where I stand.
- I'm protecting you.

35
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:31,680
I'm under pressure to replace you
with a more senior officer.

36
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,615
So, replace me.
And when I'm debriefed,

37
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,796
don't expect me to lie about
what you knew and when you knew it.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Fine.

39
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:40,347
Stay on it.

40
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,402
But don't run to me
once the press get hold of it.

41
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:46,156
My obligation to you ends
when it hits the headlines.

42
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,169
Good luck, Joe.

Read them carefully.

55
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,961
Look for anything to get us
inside the killer's head.

56
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,519
One of these books is his Bible.

57
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:29,891
I can't remember
the last time I read a book.

claim overtime for that, Fitz

60
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:39,574
- What do we know about Alice Graves?
- She was 36 years old,

61
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,894
she had three children... separated.

62
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,001
She saw an alcoholic -
and definitely on the game.

63
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:47,671
She was badly bruised around the face
sometime before death.

64
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:49,380
Find out who did that and {\what it was about.}why.

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,316
Sarah Smith, who found her,
must know something.

66
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:55,356
We've got to appeal for witnesses,
broaden the enquiry.

67
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:56,840
You can go on TV.
No.

68
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,036
Yeah.
No!

69
00:03:58,161 --> 00:03:59,596
I could go.
NO!

70
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,303
There're three murders to go.

71
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:03,364
We can't let on to the press.
It'll create panic.

72
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,546
We'll have every crackpot
owning up to being

73
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,556
Jack and the Home Office
will be on our backs.

74
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,756
- You don't know that'll happen.
- I do. History tells us so.

75
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,756
I know what happens next.

76
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,033
I go and get some proper food!

77
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:18,290

- Sir, can I have a word?
- Sure.

88
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:30,840
By the way...
I saved a book for you.

89
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,275
- Jill The Ripper.
- Terrific.

90
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:36,796
I had a word with Sarah {\Smith}last night.
The tom who found the body.

91
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:39,281
She's very jumpy.
She said all the girls are. But...

92
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,356
there's a regular, a soldier,

93
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:43,756
who's beating girls,
threatening to gut them.

94
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,288
And get this. He carries a bayonet.

95
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:50,027
- Did Sarah Smith give you a name?
- No. They call him The Squaddie.

96
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:52,661
He's always boasting about
how he guards the queen.

97
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,882
Sarah said he WAS OK,
but he went out to

98
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,284
Helmand Province
and ain't been the same since.

99
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:00,156
He don't want sex any more.
Just gets off on scaring 'em.

100
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:02,636
Only the real desperate toms'll
go with him. Fitz?

101
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,270
- You got that envelope?
- Yeah.

102
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:09,722
This was found beside
the body of Alice Graves.

103
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:12,836
It's the regimental crest
from the Household Division,

104
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,356
based at Clarence Barracks.

105
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:18,232
We got a prime suspect for you.

106
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,924
The guards are on inspection at 3pm.

107
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:27,147
There's no way Sarah
would do anything official.

108
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:29,200
This is the best I could manage.

109
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,116
Thanks for meeting us, girls.

110
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,996
This is my colleague,
Detective Inspector Chandler.

111
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:37,684
Ladies.
Shall we watch the show.

112
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,400
Squad... shun!

113
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:44,876
Squad... stand at ease!

114
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,436
- Squad...!
- Third from the right.

115
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,778
Shun!

116
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,240
That's him.

117
00:06:57,814 --> 00:06:58,836
Innit?

118
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,720
It's definitely him.

119
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:11,390
Excuse me? DC McCormack.

120
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:14,084
Oh, yes. Er... I got your message.

121
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:16,760
Alice Graves.

122
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:18,285
I pulled her file.

123
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:20,811
Come with me.

124
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,723
- Oh. She went to the Larkin Trust.
- Is that a hostel?

125
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:28,248
No. It's an organisation
for women with alcohol problems.

126
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:31,339
- It's... a bit out of date.
- The address is still good.

127
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:34,414
We need to know about
her last admission to A&E.

128
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:36,996
She came in with facial injuries.

129
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,279
Nothing serious. Some bruises
sustained in a fight with a client.

130
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,640
She was a prostitute.
Did she know who the guy was?

131
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:48,251
She was so drunk when she came in,
she could hardly speak.

132
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:51,636
But she did say
something about... a soldier?

133
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:56,119
OK. Good. Thanks very much.

134
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,516
Thank you.

135
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:01,908
Hello!

136
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,033
This is unofficial. OK?

137
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:07,593
- Purely advisory.
- Yes, yes. Absolutely.

138
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:09,440
I'll be the very soul of discretion.

139
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:11,515
My Watson to your Holmes?

140
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,035
We found this at the scene,

141
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,964
with a portion of regimental crest
on the envelope...

142
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,956
... which was placed
next to Alice's body.

143
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,183
There was a torn envelope
by Annie Chapman's body,

144
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:31,596
but it was a red herring.

145
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:33,965
It had nothing to do with Jack.

146
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:36,349
The first victim thought
her attacker was a soldier.

147
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,281
One wound could have been made
by a bayonet.

148
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,636
And now this regimental mark
on the envelope.

149
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:43,797
It all points to
the killer being a soldier.

150
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:46,887
He's creating the world for you.

151
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,916
The same murders,
the same mysterious suspects.

152
00:08:50,084 --> 00:08:52,634
The same... mysterious lines
of enquiry.

153
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:57,156
He wants you to think he's a soldier,
or a man in a leather apron.

154
00:08:57,321 --> 00:09:01,071
Because, if you're looking for them,
you're not looking for him.

155
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,876
He wants to make you
his Inspector Abberline.

156
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:08,237
The policeman who
couldn't catch the Ripper.

157
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:11,116
The point of being Jack The Ripper
was to get away with it.

158
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:13,066
And never be found.

159
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,076
I can't believe the guy's left no
trace. We've nothing from Forensics.

160
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:20,915
It's like he knows what we look for
and how we find it.

161
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,420
Or he's a phantom.
Then, the police were so desperate,

162
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:26,442
they even considered photographing
the eyes of the victims.

163
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,851
They thought their dying retinas
might have held an image of the killer.

164
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:33,556
Could you imagine? A picture
of Jack in the eyes of the dead.

165
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,775
So... what couldn't wait?

166
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:49,633
- I wanted to check her eyes.
- We've gone over every inch of her.

167
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:52,076
- There's nothing.
- Not her eyelids, her eyes.

168
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,403
- That's off the peg?
- I know.

169
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,721
Got two pairs of trousers, too,
to even up the wear.

170
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:05,161
- You look like the boss.
- His suits are handmade.

171
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:07,631
- Savile Row.
- Wind the skipper up.

172
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,180
Your attention, please. Ladies.

173
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,146
Private John Leary.

174
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:16,035
History of violence against women.

175
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,585
He threatened a teenager
with a knife in Germany

176
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,290
and he wounded a young woman
in Aldershot.

177
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,013
His regiment have dealt
with everything up until now.

178
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:26,154
They describe him as'troubled'.

179
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:27,920
Now, his leaves don't tally exactly

180
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,830
with the murders,
but we can't rule him out.

181
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,596
He's a very naughty boy.

182
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:35,469
You get all that, Boss?
Yes, I heard.

183
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:37,205
Bring him in.

184
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,617
We've found the killer's DNA
on Alice Graves,

185
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,200
so we'll get a sample from Leary.

186
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,996
- What DNA? The body was clean?
- It was on her eyeballs.

187
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:45,938
How did it get there?

188
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:48,703
He wanted to leave his image
on her dying eyes.

189
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:50,316
So he licked them.

190
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:09,064
<i>Are you a regular client
of prostitutes?</i>

191
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,260
<i>John Leary.</i>

192
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:13,747
Private. 2-4-1-9-6-0-3-4.

193
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,716
Did you know
the prostitute Alice Graves?

194
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:20,237
John Leary. Private.
2-4-1-9-6-0-3-4.

195
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:22,297
Do you know the crack house
near Brick Lane

196
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,016
where Alice Graves' body was found?

197
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,360
John Leary...{\Private.}

198
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,356
Jesus Christ! You haven't been captured
by the bloody enemy!

199
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:30,138
This isn't Afghanistan
and you're not

200
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,214
- the bloody SAS!
- this all we'll get?

201
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,406
- He's{\not obliged to} can't say anything
that may incriminate him.

202
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,378
If he wants to play Guantanomo Bay,

203
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:39,000
can we shock his bollocks
till he chats?

204
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,476
- That's not funny, Detective.
- Oh, really? I'm laughing.

205
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:43,749
You know the house.
Did you take Alice there?

206
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:45,116
- John Leary.
- We know!

207
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:48,196
You used to beat her up.
Was that not enough for you any more?

208
00:11:48,364 --> 00:11:49,516
John Leary. Private.

209
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:53,157
2-4-1-9-6-0-3-4.

210
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:56,742
<i>Private John Leary of the Queen's
Foot Guard,</i>

211
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,327
<i>based at Clarence Barracks,</i>

212
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,378
<i>was arrested by police
this afternoon</i>

213
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:03,596
<i>- and is being held on suspicion...</i>
- We're missing a trick.

214
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:06,642
An appeal on here
could jog a few memories,

215
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:08,958
turn up all kinds of witnesses.

216
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:11,744
We've had this through
from Forensics.

217
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,800
Bayonet's clean.
No blood traces at all.

218
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:14,864
Shit!

219
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,608
And the eyeball DNA's
been contaminated.

220
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,614
I've had to release Leary.

221
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:23,377
Leary's not in the clear yet!

222
00:12:24,603 --> 00:12:26,003
He just got lucky.

223
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:32,254
- What is it, Skip?
- Eyeball DNA's contaminated.

224
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,982
Bayonet's clean.

225
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:35,913
- Oh, you're joking!
- Oh, no!

226
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:37,038
Oh, what?

227
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,301
Why is the Director of Forensic Science
suddenly signing off on the evidence?

228
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,036
Why is he doing labwork?

229
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,636
That's unheard of.
The director doing labwork?

230
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:49,575
- It's a cover-up!
- Well...

231
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,245
The original Jack was a cover-up.

232
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,960
In my 342-page book,

233
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:57,608
the original Jack
was a Masonic conspiracy

234
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,333
to protect the Duke of Clarence.

235
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,276
He had married a Catholic whore

236
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:04,636
and the other women
were all witnesses at the wedding.

237
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:07,305
Who's the Duke of Clarence?
Is that Charles?

238
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,975
- Charles!
- No!

239
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:10,938
Listen!

240
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:13,826
The whores were witnesses
to a wedding

241
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:15,798
the palace wanted to keep secret.

242
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:18,076
So, the palace had the girls killed.

243
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:20,828
- That was the conspiracy then.
- So, what is it now?

244
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,045
If we knew that, wouldn't be
much of a conspiracy.

245
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,418
It's just one theory
out of hundreds.

246
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:28,516
My book has Jack as a sailor
who went to live in Jamaica.

247
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:31,424
- In my book, Jack's a woman.
- Maybe, though,

248
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:34,979
- the palace has something to hide.
- Yeah. Hold on a minute.

249
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,192
Alice Graves...

250
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,116
used this support unit for alchies.

251
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:41,898
And guess who the patron was.

252
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,063
Princess Diana.

253
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:48,123
You want a conspiracy?

254
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:50,173
You want a wedding
that's been covered up?

255
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:52,362
This... is the mother.

256
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,899
Don't mess... with the masons.

257
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,213
Leary is a good suspect.

258
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:02,813
We'll get the evidence cos he did
it. No-one's covering anything up.

259
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:05,511
So, no more conspiracies,
no more masons.

260
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,486
And no more Scotch, either.

261
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:29,560
- Yes?
- Turn on the news.

262
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:34,896
<i>... happened to these murders.</i>

263
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:38,218
<i>The tabloids are reporting
that Jack The Ripper is back</i>

264
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:40,800
<i>and killing women again
in the east end of London.</i>

265
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,360
Sources also suggest
that the police,

266
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,360
<i>already under fire for being
slow to react to the case,</i>

267
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:49,358
<i>are looking into a possible
Masonic connection.</i>

268
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:51,428
<i>You have a leak, Sort it out.</i>

269
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:56,238
<i>The murder of Alice Graves
is likely to be the second</i>

270
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:59,200
<i>in a series of five planned attacks.</i>

271
00:15:09,196 --> 00:15:10,622
- You happy now?
- What?

272
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,960
Someone has compromised
the entire investigation.

273
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,063
What are you insinuating?
I'm not the leak!

274
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:17,580
- You wanted rid of me at the start.
- I'd do that?

275
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,373
I am staying till we get an arrest.
So, the hell with you{\ with your dirty tricks}.

276
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:23,278
I've been doing this job
for 20 years.

277
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:25,197
I have to trust
the loyalty of my men.

278
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:27,720
Would I risk that
for a streak of piss like you?

279
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:31,317
You'll screw this investigation up
without my help.

280
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,128
I will find your leak for you.
And you will apologise!

281
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,850
I like single malts,
not that blended shit.

282
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,640
Now that this is out in the open,
we'll be inundated

283
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,398
with false leads, false confessions
and false alarms.

284
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:50,520
Not to mention the public
getting in our way.

285
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:53,993
The press are offering cash for clues.
They want to beat us to The Ripper.

286
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,918
The Home Office is under pressure,
the commissioner is under pressure,

287
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,198
Which means that we are
under 24-hour scrutiny.

288
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:01,600
We cannot make any mistakes,
we cannot be fallible.

289
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,440
- Fally who?
- I know there's been talk

290
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:07,520
about conspiracies and masons
and cover-ups. I want it to stop now.

291
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:11,720
We need to get back on track. Which is
why I've asked an impartial expert

292
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,758
to come in and talk to you today.

293
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:14,878
Mr Buchan?

294
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:17,120
Not the Ripperologist!

295
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,797
Are you out of your mind?

296
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:23,560
We need an objective view.
A step back.

297
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,621
He's a step back, all right.

298
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,193
It's fine.

299
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:34,727
- Should I just begin?
- Yes. Go ahead.

300
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,758
Imagine. Whitechapel, 1888.

301
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:43,478
A place so terrible that Jack London
called it the Abyss.

302
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,358
Ed, the Masons.

303
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,938
Yes. Yes.

304
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,554
There is no conspiracy. The Masonic
conspiracy of Jack The Ripper

305
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,838
is the biggest load of bunkum
ever to taint true Ripperology.

306
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,160
Based on a total disregard
of the known facts of the case.

307
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,960
Crime conspiracy is the last resort
of an investigator.

308
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:07,068
It's a way of saying it's not
your fault you can't solve it.

309
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:10,666
Well, why did the director
handle the evidence?

310
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:13,398
- Good point.
- It was a favour to me, actually.

311
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:14,960
I wanted the best.

312
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,228
Eyes front!

313
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,400
- It doesn't explain the Larkin Trust.
- Alice Graves.

314
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,958
- She used to go there.
- So did Cathy Lane. I checked.

315
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:25,600
May I...?

316
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,278
It's another myth,

317
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:35,098
that the canonical victims
knew each other.

318
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:38,092
He'll be recreating pea soupers
for us next.

319
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:40,336
Clever boy.

320
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:52,475
You don't have to keep
turning them. Let them cook.

321
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:55,000
- I'm still in charge.
- Who's for another beer?

322
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,600
- Please, Fitz.
- No. No, thank you.

323
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,440
- You found your pub in the country yet?
- Yeah. Saw a lovely place in Sussex.

324
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:07,468
- Don't come cheap.
- Tell me about it.

325
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:10,286
We're already re-mortgaged
up to the hilt as it is.

326
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,456
Still, the money from the papers
must help. Right?

327
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:20,920
What? Is...
Is that what I'm about, is it?

328
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,730
I'm just saying.

329
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:25,718
I understand why you did it.

330
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:29,213
Can't live your dream
on a pension, can you?

331
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,880
A few bob in my pocket
and screw you guys?

332
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,140
Yeah, right.

333
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:35,665
I'm outta here.

334
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:38,297
What's up? Where are you going?

335
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,898
He thinks I'm the leak. Thinks
I sold you out for a few grand.

336
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:44,718
Don't be daft.
Come on. Have a beer.

337
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:46,278
They're on me.

338
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:47,627
Since when?

339
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,040
Never see your wallet
in the bar, do we?

340
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,414
Well, it's... just a beer.

341
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:57,631
That's your guilty conscience, Fitz.

342
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:00,703
- It's a beer.
- Come on, Fitz.

343
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:03,073
I can see it in your face. Tell us.

344
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,642
I didn't do it for the money.

345
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:15,120
I did it so we could get a new DI.

346
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,160
I did it for you, Skip.

347
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:22,040
It's what you wanted, innit?

348
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,444
Here.

349
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:26,887
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:28,358
Hey, Ray!

351
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:37,308
Can I borrow this for further study?

352
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:40,728
- I'll return it in the morning.
- Out of the question.

353
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,880
I understand. Absolutely.

354
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,044
The double event is imminent.
The night Jack killed not one,

355
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:52,764
but two women
in the space of 45 minutes.

356
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,920
Catherine Eddowes was killed
in Mitre Square, on the cobbles.

357
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,203
It's the only murder site
that still exists.

358
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,400
You can stand
on that exact spot today.

359
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:06,120
He'll definitely be tempted by that.
It's so authentic.

360
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:09,118
There's CCTV in Mitre Square.
It's completely overlooked.

361
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:12,320
He wouldn't be so stupid. He'd be
caught in minutes. Game over.

362
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:16,560
Mitre Square's too important,
and he gets to take away her kidney.

363
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:18,428
He can't do it. It's impossible.

364
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:21,400
I'd definitely regard Mitre Square
as a probable murder site.

365
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:25,227
All right. I'll keep an eye on it.
But we're gonna focus on Private Leary.

366
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:27,520
- Watch every move he makes.
- It's not him.

367
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:30,195
He fits the description
of Emma Jones's attacker.

368
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:32,878
We know he assaulted
Alice Graves before her murder.

369
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,958
He's our prime suspect.

370
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:38,400
Then you have to ask yourself,
will there be a double event or not?

371
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:41,691
- What do you mean?
- There's a growing body of thought

372
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:44,160
that Jack was not responsible
for both murders.

373
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:47,600
I thought Elizabeth Stride and Catherine
Eddowes were definite, canonical.

374
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:50,161
It's a recent theory,
not mainstream.

375
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,681
Liz Stride had her throat cut,
but she wasn't mutilated.

376
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:56,101
The classic theory is,
he must have been disturbed,

377
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,000
so found another victim
to sate himself.

378
00:20:58,386 --> 00:20:59,386
But...

379
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,973
No signs of strangulation.

380
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:06,219
The coroner found a dissimilarity

381
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,760
with how her throat was cut,
believed a different weapon was used.

382
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:11,640
No mutilation, different MO,
different signature.

383
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:14,680
Her death could have been a coincidence,
erroneously linked to Jack.

384
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,998
So, a classic Ripper fan
will kill twice,

385
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:19,040
but if it's an alternative theorist,
once.

386
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:21,160
- In essence, yes.
- So, which one is he?

387
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,360
- That's up to you, Joe.
- You're the expert!

388
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,449
- But it's your investigation.
- Oh, Jesus!

389
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:29,387
All I have is...

390
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
history.

391
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:36,838
I've got... nothing... tangible.

392
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:38,624
Nothing...

393
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,465
Nothing right now...

394
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,578
right here to help me. I mean...

395
00:21:51,741 --> 00:21:54,728
It was a dead woman in Whitechapel,
a simple domestic.

396
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:55,898
I wasn't...

397
00:21:58,238 --> 00:22:00,679
I'm not supposed to be doing this.

398
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:05,958
Look.

399
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,454
My... whole career...

400
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,860
... has been mapped out
by other people.

401
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,380
Just trying to fast-track me
on to...

402
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,008
I'm the wrong man for this job.

403
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:25,360
But if we catch this man
tomorrow night,

404
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,199
you will be the man who captured
The Ripper... for ever.

405
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:33,038
No-one catches The Ripper.

406
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,279
History says so.

407
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:09,584
Have a good, long look, Mary.
Take your time.

408
00:23:10,615 --> 00:23:13,400
None of them jump out at me.
It was very dark.

409
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:17,511
I only remember seeing the knife.
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:23,710
How about him?

411
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:27,480
Ring any bell?

412
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,240
Maybe... It's possible.

413
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:36,960
- It could be him.
- Good girl.

414
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:44,440
Mary's just picked out Leary.

415
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,877
That's a positive ID
from Mary and Sarah Smith.

416
00:23:46,997 --> 00:23:49,440
Good. Let's go ahead with it, then.

417
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:54,187
We need to catch
Private Leary in the act.

418
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,549
As we know, the time's important
to him. If he's our killer,

419
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,840
he'll attempt the 1st murder at 1am
tonight in Henriques Street.

420
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:04,680
McCormack, I want you there. Kent and
Sanders, you'll be in Clarence Barracks.

421
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:08,360
The MOD have agreed access, so you
can watch the accommodation block.

422
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,040
I'll be out front with the boss.

423
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:12,240
The second murder was
in Mitre Square at 1:45.

424
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,603
There'll no doubt be a public
presence of press an onlookers.

425
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:19,080
We'll have uniforms there. And Leary
is under observation from now on.

426
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:23,095
Our objective is surveillance.
We don't make a move until he does.

427
00:24:24,536 --> 00:24:25,586
This is it.

428
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:27,333
No mistakes.

429
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:33,638
When we get Leary,

430
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:36,440
let his nibs read him his rights.
Give him his moment.

431
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:44,126
# NEIL DIAMOND: Sweet Caroline

432
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,359
<i># Reachin' out</i>

433
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,916
<i># Touchin' me</i>

434
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:54,901
<i># Touchin' you... #</i>
Could you turn that off, please?

435
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,350
<i># Sweet Caroline... #</i>

436
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,883
Sorry.

437
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:11,813
- All right, darling?
- You take care tonight, ladies.

438
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:22,537
All quiet here, sir.

439
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:26,120
Kent, only use the radio
when something's happening.

440
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,471
<i>Out.</i>

441
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:53,760
- We're right about Leary?
- Yeah, we are right.

442
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,680
It's the one thing
you and I agree on.

443
00:25:58,164 --> 00:26:01,066
Mitre Square, please give
your situation report.

444
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,257
Mitre Square, north side.
Everything under control. Over.

445
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:05,600
- All right?
- Fine.

446
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,480
Mitre Square. All clear
on the south side. Over.

447
00:26:10,057 --> 00:26:11,840
McCormack. Situation report.

448
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,639
Pissed off... cold...
and very thirsty, sir.

449
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:34,879
Shit.

450
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:38,320
We're up.
Suspect in military clothing.

451
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:42,400
He's coming down the scaffolding.
Rear of the barracks.

452
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:44,483
<i>OK. All units, here we go.</i>

453
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:03,309
Suspect is AWOL. On the move.

454
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:05,979
<i>Heading towards you, Kent.
He has a bag.</i>

455
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,278
Kent? Have you got him in sight?

456
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:12,527
<i>Kent! Have you got him in sight?</i>

457
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:15,979
Trailing suspect on foot.

458
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:39,243
<i>Kent. Situation report.</i>

459
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:42,953
<i>For God's sake, Kent.
Can you see him?</i>

460
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:03,160
Suspect is heading towards
perimeter wall near you, sir.

461
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:05,480
<i>Now wearing a baseball cap
and a dark jacket.</i>

462
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,400
He's got accomplices. It IS a bloody
conspiracy. We're on the move.

463
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:23,265
He's got into a dark car.
Can't read the registration.

464
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:25,983
Looks like two male IC-1s
as a company.

465
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:28,203
He must be heading for the kill.

466
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:44,119
Tailing suspect heading west.
All units, stand by.

467
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:47,240
This doesn't make sense.
It's the wrong direction!

468
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,160
The murder sites are east!
What's he doing?

469
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:51,916
- He's trying to lose us.
- Well, stick with him!

470
00:28:52,036 --> 00:28:53,986
What do you think I'm doing?!

471
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:03,919
He's messing with us.

472
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:11,323
What's he doing now?

473
00:29:11,525 --> 00:29:12,925
He's turning back!

474
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:16,400
Trailing suspect east.
All units, stand by.

475
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,161
Trailing suspect east.

476
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:33,295
- What's going on?
- What's he playing at?

477
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,760
Are you trying to frame
Private Leary?

478
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,674
<i>This is Mitre Square.
We've had a disturbance.</i>

479
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:42,963
It's the bloody press.
We've been set up.

480
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,450
Yet you're no closer
to catching the murderer.

481
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,489
There's a disturbance
t Mitre Square,

482
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:50,909
They say they got the Ripper,
but no one's been killed.

483
00:30:04,617 --> 00:30:06,016
Out of the way!

484
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:08,399
Move! Police! Move!

485
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,825
Please! For God's sake!

486
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,223
Joe! Thank God!

487
00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:26,253
Joe!

488
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,670
Is anybody in the square?
IS ANYBODY IN THE SQUARE?

489
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:19,503
It's Mary.

490
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:21,424
He got Mary.

491
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,079
This is impossible.
There's nobody here!

492
00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:30,862
He ain't human.

493
00:31:31,377 --> 00:31:32,477
He can't be.

494
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,279
Joe... Thank God.

495
00:32:06,454 --> 00:32:08,880
I didn't get their numbers,
but I wish to lodge a complaint.

496
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,203
Joe, I want to complain
against the two gorillas

497
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:13,080
who arrested me
and threw me in the van.

498
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,960
Mother'll be in a terrible state,
wondering where I am.

499
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,679
Joe, do you think
I could have my laces back?

500
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,249
Not yet, Mr Buchan.

501
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,779
This way, Mr Buchan.

502
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:30,205
I see.

503
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:40,800
Where were you
at 1:30am this morning?

504
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:42,919
I was staking out the exact spot

505
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,839
where Catherine Eddowes
was murdered in 1888.

506
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:48,166
You were hiding from the police.

507
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:52,206
I wanted to catch The Ripper.
I've been hunting him all my life,

508
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:54,320
and now here he is again,
made flesh.

509
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,120
He is my nemesis.

510
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:59,480
He's mine to bring to justice.
So, that's why you wanted to help.

511
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,320
To get an inside track
on the investigation of yourself.

512
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm sorry, {\ Joe.}

513
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,720
Having committed
the offence of obstruction

514
00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:08,919
by entering a restricted area,

515
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,949
you were escorted from the square
at 1:41am.

516
00:33:12,687 --> 00:33:14,344
By the gorillas. Correct.

517
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:16,200
Was there anyone else in the {\actual}
square?

518
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:22,238
Look. I caused a bit of a ruckus
and I'm sorry about that. But...

519
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:24,640
he didn't even show up.
So, no harm done.

520
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:27,626
At 1:45 am...

521
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:31,735
the body of a woman was found
in Mitre Square.

522
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,979
The body of a woman?

523
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:39,880
That's impossible. He... he
couldn't have. There was no time.

524
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,280
He had four minutes. But -
All he needed was a distraction!

525
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,520
Like the mini riot that you caused.

526
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:46,899
Me?

527
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:52,040
- You think he used me?
- You made it possible!

528
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:53,520
His accomplice!

529
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,009
I am Edward Buchan,

530
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,418
respected authority
on Jack The Ripper.

531
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:07,938
I am not a killer.

532
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:10,113
Nor do I serve one.

533
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:12,920
How dare you?

534
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:29,508
Mrs Buchan?
Police.

535
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:33,240
We have a warrant to search yours
and your son's premises. May I come in?

536
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,790
He subscribes to
Caravan International.

537
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,534
- Looks like he pays his bills on time.
- Yeah, course he does. He's a saint.

538
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:58,575
He's in a dispute
with the council...

539
00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:00,679
over a neighbour's plans
for an extension.

540
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,593
I mean, it's not really...

541
00:35:02,713 --> 00:35:04,645
Where's all the Ripper stuff, then?

542
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:06,792
I thought he was
the world's foremost expert.

543
00:35:06,912 --> 00:35:09,012
Does he keep it all in his head?

544
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,649
Mrs Buchan?

545
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:20,136
- {\Mrs Buchan,} What's down here?
- That's my son's study.

546
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:22,720
- I haven't got a key.
- Got a screwdriver?

547
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:26,645
Ta very much.

548
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,950
Bloody hell.

549
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:56,759
I knew it.

550
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:10,318
It's like an incident room -
from 1888.

551
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:12,000
It's a killer's lair.

552
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,930
Look at all this.

553
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,240
He's a Ripperologist.
This is what he does for a living.

554
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:29,161
He's even got his own website.

555
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:33,520
Look. This ain't from 1888.

556
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:37,200
He was helping the investigation.
This doesn't prove anything.

557
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,003
He's involved. I'll prove it.
I've got a nose for this.

558
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:41,823
You haven't - obviously!

559
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:48,019
He cut her throat first.

560
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:50,720
It's savage.
Right through to the vertebrae.

561
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:54,542
The abdomen has been
completely opened up.

562
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:56,591
There's a stab wound in the liver.

563
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:58,161
Genital mutilation.

564
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:02,614
The colon's been cut away and the
kidney and uterus have been removed.

565
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,600
Exactly the same as
Catherine Eddowes in 1888.

566
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,610
However, when you come to her face,

567
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,655
the injuries are completely
different.

568
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:12,370
There were V-shaped marks
made on Catherine Eddowes.

569
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,740
Whereas here...

570
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:16,520
Well, he's clearly tried
to slice Mary's face off.

571
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:18,468
<i>In my experience,</i>

572
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:21,359
<i>this kind of severe
facial mutilation</i>

573
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,742
strongly indicates a relationship
between the killer and his victim.

574
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:28,368
They may well have known each other.

575
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:31,240
{\Catherine Eddowes}She said she knew who The Ripper
was and would claim the reward.

576
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:34,317
Mary Bousfield got a good look
at Cathy Lane's killer.

577
00:37:34,437 --> 00:37:36,687
And he got a good look at her, too.

578
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:38,646
Bastard!

579
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,290
- What have we got?
- OK.

580
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:04,540
This is the CCTV from Mitre Square.

581
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,320
It shows all eight cameras from
both the north and south sides.

582
00:38:09,401 --> 00:38:12,640
Here, on the south side, they find
Buchan hiding and make the arrest,

583
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:15,600
taking him around the square
to the north side.

584
00:38:16,783 --> 00:38:19,362
All the press and onlookers
follow Buchan's arrest,

585
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:21,432
leaving the south side clear.

586
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:25,254
This creates a diversion
for the killer to dump Mary's body.

587
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:29,280
He enters the square through these
shutters on the south-east corner

588
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,890
and drags Mary's body
into the square.

589
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,644
Jesus! We were minutes away.

590
00:38:36,902 --> 00:38:39,040
The shutters here
lead to an underground car park

591
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:41,081
entered from Fenchurch Street.

592
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:43,245
We're getting the tapes
from the council.

593
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:46,115
He must have used a vehicle
for his getaway.

594
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:47,992
- Excellent work.
- Thank you, sir.

595
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:50,040
<i>{\I've got }Got the printouts
from Buchan's {\message boards.} mails.</i>

596
00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:51,857
It worked like this.

597
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:53,833
Someone - Jack2000 or Springhill -

598
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:55,589
would ask {\a question} about the murders.

599
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,641
Like, was there a double event?

600
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:01,400
Buchan gives some longwinded answer,
then somebody else writes in -

601
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,803
Slasher Jack,
with a different theory -

602
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:06,480
Buchan replies,
on and on and on it goes.

603
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:09,375
- How many people were on the site?
- About 100, but look at this

604
00:39:09,495 --> 00:39:12,361
One name had a regular Q&A
with our friend Buchan.

605
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:14,681
50 times more than any other user.

606
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,240
I told you. I got a nose for this.

607
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,445
- Can Computer Crime trace this?
- They can try. But look.

608
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:23,815
The last contact was on the night
of the first murder.

609
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:31,401
You do Buchan's interviews
from now on.

610
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,160
- Yes, sir.
- I owe you a bottle.

611
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,342
- You haven't shaved.
- Sorry, sir. I haven't been home yet.

612
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,412
You look like a drowning man.

613
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,520
{\Everything's under control.}I control.

614
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,480
Many would like your place at this table
you could at least change your shirt.

615
00:40:10,935 --> 00:40:12,635
Why did you ask me here?

616
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:15,713
I gave your late father my word.

617
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,383
A place at the table.

618
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:20,364
In time, at the top of the force.

619
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,434
But in the current climate...

620
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,880
I have my own position to consider.
I did warn you.

621
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:28,741
I understand.
You need to take a step back.

622
00:40:29,314 --> 00:40:32,240
Unless I catch The Ripper, in which
case, you'll be standing by my side.

623
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:36,560
Nobody asked you
to sacrifice yourself.

624
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,803
Work the shift, go home.

625
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:41,973
You have a sergeant. Use him.
Let him shoulder it.

626
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:46,401
Protect yourself enough that, when it's
over, you still have some standing.

627
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,036
Do you {\even} know their name?

628
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,714
- Whose names?
- The victims!

629
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,560
{\Your problem is,} you can't see it's irrelevant.

630
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:56,679
Mary Bousfield. He cut out her kidney
and sliced her face off!

631
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:58,840
We are eating!

632
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,000
I do apologise.

633
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,825
- Where is Detective Inspector Chandler?
- Busy.

634
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,479
Ripperfan.

635
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:33,120
Oh. The message boards.

636
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:35,514
I've no inkling
as to who these people are.

637
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:38,400
You're happy to discuss how to
cut up women with 'em.

638
00:41:38,692 --> 00:41:41,442
I simply relate
the historical facts to them

639
00:41:41,678 --> 00:41:44,328
and, if necessary,
correct their thinking.

640
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:46,520
Read it.

641
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:49,894
<i>An inch below
the crease of the thigh</i>

642
00:41:50,014 --> 00:41:52,160
was a cut extending from

643
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,370
<i>the anterior spine of the ileum</i>

644
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:58,021
<i>- obliquely down the inner side of...</i>
- The left thigh. Yes. Yes.

645
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,962
That is from the autopsy performed by
Dr Brown on Catherine Eddowes -

646
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:04,427
That... is murder pornography.

647
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,565
This information
is in the public domain.

648
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:09,840
I don't tell them
what to do with it.

649
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:11,751
Someone like Ripperfan...

650
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:16,262
who is so interested in
your opinion of the double event...

651
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:19,561
... and shared your belief
that Catherine Eddowes

652
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:23,461
- was the only Ripper victim that night.
- I know what you're implying.

653
00:42:23,581 --> 00:42:25,760
You think he's the killer
and I'm in it with him.

654
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,360
Why would I do that?

655
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,680
Tell me about marks
on Catherine Eddowes' face.

656
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:32,451
Well... OK.

657
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:36,761
The autopsy report states that she
had distinctive marks to her face.

658
00:42:36,881 --> 00:42:39,441
Like... inverted Vs on her cheeks.

659
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:42,880
And the tip of her nose was cut off,
as well as cuts to her eyelids.

660
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:46,924
Some Ripperologists think
that these are Masonic markings.

661
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:50,391
- But you've got your own theory.
<i>- Well, yes, I do.</i>

662
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:53,561
I think he tried
to cut Catherine's face off.

663
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:58,200
You see, cutting down like so would
cut the eyelids, remove the nose

664
00:42:58,487 --> 00:42:59,960
and cut into the cheek.

665
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:02,480
I can't be certain,
but it does make sense.

666
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:03,841
Yeah, it does.

667
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:06,908
It did to Ripperfan.

668
00:43:08,387 --> 00:43:10,200
Cos he did exactly
what you told him to.

669
00:43:11,142 --> 00:43:12,942
He sliced Mary's face off.

670
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:17,494
<i>Ripperfan's the killer.
And you're his, what? Mentor?</i>

671
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:19,433
<i>Sounding board?</i>

672
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:20,931
<i>Special advisor?</i>

673
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:22,480
You tell me.

674
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:55,021
The CCTV from the car park
in Fenchurch Street shows a van.

675
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:58,900
It's from A C Maduro, Health And Safety,
a small medical supply company.

676
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,620
The MD is a Mr Maduro.

677
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,940
He's stopped all his vans,
but he's not happy at all.

678
00:44:04,681 --> 00:44:08,161
If such a murder had occurred in one
of my vans, I would have noticed.

679
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,474
The vans are clean.
There is no blood.

680
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:12,160
You'll have to just bear with us, {\please, sir.}

681
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:14,421
I need my vans back on the road.

682
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:16,774
We supply organ transportation.

683
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:19,120
Not just body bags
and rubber gloves.

684
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:21,760
And we have
urgent medical transfers.

685
00:44:22,053 --> 00:44:23,053
Over here!

686
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:26,445
Positive signs of blood
all over this van.

687
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:29,368
We've got a murder scene!

688
00:44:29,777 --> 00:44:31,560
I want a thorough
search of this van.

689
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:37,080
- What do you want?
- I asked to see Joe.

690
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:38,280
{\Well, you've} got me.

691
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:41,731
So, I am the lowest of the low now.

692
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:45,640
I don't have to be here, you know.
What do you want? Stand back!

693
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:49,591
Ask Joe, has the killer
sent the kidney yet?

694
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:51,640
Mary Bousfield's kidney?

695
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,650
It's bound to be the next step.

696
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,378
He'll post it to someone
involved in the hunt.

697
00:44:56,498 --> 00:44:58,200
Someone he regards as his nemesis.

698
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:07,659
Who was driving this van
the night before last?

699
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:11,320
I'll have to check. I have my own
filing system. It's a bit complex.

700
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:12,607
Sir?

701
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,441
- These were in the van.
- Contact Fire Investigation.

702
00:45:18,561 --> 00:45:20,600
Chase up which accelerant
was used in the fire.

703
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,761
Sure.

704
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,119
Sir?

705
00:45:35,729 --> 00:45:38,831
- It's for you, Dad.
- Have you got his pen, Jamie?

706
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:44,800
Will you stop?

707
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:46,480
- Get ready.
- Out!

708
00:45:46,641 --> 00:45:48,000
Out! Everybody out! OUT!

709
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,800
We have two days until he copies
the murder of Mary Kelly.

710
00:45:58,001 --> 00:46:01,281
- The murder could happen anywhere.
- The next victim will have red hair?

711
00:46:01,401 --> 00:46:03,720
Get Tactical there.
We'll meet you there.
