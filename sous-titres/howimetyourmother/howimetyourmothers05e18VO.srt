1
00:00:00,827 --> 00:00:03,295
<i>Lily has always
been one of those people</i>

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,254
<i>who loves their birthday.
Loves it.</i>

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,140
It's my birthday!

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:15,925
<i>So it's a good thing
she married Marshall.</i>

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,200
It's still my birthday!

6
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,105
<i>Because he loves planning birthdays.</i>

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,983
<i>Feliz cumpleaños, baby.</i>

8
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:29,500
The theme of this today's
birthday breakfast in bed is...

9
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,033
"Spanish Interlude"

10
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,786
And...

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,390
How on Earth did we end up

12
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:42,124
in the lyrical rolling hills
of Northern Spain?

13
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:46,128
Baby, tonight is going
to be so much fun.

14
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,328
Just the five of us, black-tie dinner,
and Ted is picking up

15
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,759
your favorite cognac pumpkin
cheesecake from Edgar's.

16
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:56,472
Okay, I am off to run your super secret
birthday errand.

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,603
And I'm taking this guy with me because
I don't like how he's looking at you.

18
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:08,626
A new camera!

19
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:11,112
Thank you, Marshall.
I love it!

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,730
Well, little bonus:

21
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,434
I took some naked pictures
of myself before I wrapped it.

22
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:16,701
Put a bow on it.

23
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:18,327
There wasn't a bow on it.

24
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:19,896
Wrong "it."

25
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,542
Thank you, honey. I'm going to get some
great shots of our little group with.

26
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:29,714
<i>Now, kids, you've seen your Aunt Lily's
photo albums: leather bound,</i>

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,440
<i>acid free paper,</i>

28
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:33,946
<i>adorable handwritten captions.</i>

29
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:36,765
<i>And most importantly,
the group shot.</i>

30
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,462
<i>Cute photo, right, kids?</i>

31
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:40,162
<i>What you don't see is what happened</i>

32
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,309
<i>ten seconds
before this picture was taken.</i>

33
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,830
I want to get
the perfect group shot.

34
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:47,007
Marshall, sit between
Barney and Robin.

35
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:48,132
Why?

36
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,169
You know, light,

37
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:52,104
color, balance, aperture...

38
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,183
You're just saying camera words.
Wait, you don't want Barney and me

39
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:57,199
to look like a couple
in this picture, do you?

40
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:59,687
Of course I don't!
You two aren't going to last!

41
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:02,601
- I'm going for timeless here.
- How dare you?

42
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,166
- That is so rude!
- It's true.

43
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,179
Totally true, we're running
on fumes here, but still rude.

44
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,596
<i>We hated Lily's group shots.</i>

45
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:15,437
Okay, maybe I get a little bossy,

46
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,636
but I just want
to remember those times.

47
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,064
Like tonight.

48
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,599
I can't imagine
a better birthday than,

49
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,893
than being here with just
my four best friends.

50
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,097
And Ted's here now.

51
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:34,832
Happy birthday!
This is Amanda.

52
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,765
And Amanda...

53
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,456
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-,
Jojo13

54
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,700
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

55
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:55,601
Ted, you were supposed
to bring a cheesecake,

56
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:58,928
but instead you brought two grocery bags
and a woman we've never seen before.

57
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,906
Hi. I'm Marshall.
Welcome to our home.

58
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,056
Start talking.

59
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:05,392
Amanda's going to make
Lily a cake. She's a chef.

60
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:09,157
We met when I was at a restaurant
last week and I sent some soup back.

61
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:12,442
Lucky, she's got such pretty hair
I didn't mind eating a little bit of it.

62
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,401
They call me "The Shedder" at work.

63
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:17,714
I'm so glad you're
making my birthday cake!

64
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,293
In honor of Lily's 32nd birthday,

65
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:24,330
I've got a lot of great games
planned, starting with...

66
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:26,622
"Lil-ial Pursuit."

67
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,124
Okay, who's got number one?

68
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,072
I do.

69
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:33,335
Of course you do.
Okay, Amanda goes first.

70
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,632
32 seconds on the clock

71
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,326
to answer as many questions
as possible.

72
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,635
And...

73
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,888
Go! Question one:
What is Lily's favorite color?

74
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,813
Well, she's wearing pink,
so I'm going to say pink.

75
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:48,477
That's Robin.

76
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:51,397
Her...

77
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,858
favorite color is...

78
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,026
elbow.

79
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,488
I believe Ted was mouthing
the word "yellow."

80
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,210
Which also would have been wrong.

81
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,369
This game is called

82
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,081
"Gilding The Lily."

83
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,652
- Nice.
- Thank you.

84
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:13,979
You've all written down your favorite
things about the birthday girl.

85
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,630
And Lilypad,
you guess who wrote what.

86
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:20,384
"Lily makes everyone in her life,
from her friends to her students..."

87
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,970
She's a kindergarten teacher
that's what he means by that.

88
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:26,765
"... feel loved. She makes the best
oatmeal raisin cookies ever,

89
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,684
can recite
every line from Goonies..."

90
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,296
She saw Goonies in the theater
right after her parents separated.

91
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,023
After that,
she had real trouble trusting people...

92
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,776
"She's the strongest person
I've ever met.

93
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,252
"I can't imagine
my life without her.

94
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:41,697
I love you, Lily."

95
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,701
Of course it was me.

96
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,312
That's so sweet.

97
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,360
Lily, you try to guess
who wrote this.

98
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,381
"You seem really nice."

99
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:03,427
I'm going to guess Amanda.

100
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,887
That was me.

101
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,497
And I meant every word.

102
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,458
Well, I should get back
to that cake.

103
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,728
Let me know if you need anything.

104
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,652
Quick!
Let's do the photo!

105
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,360
Everybody around the fireplace.

106
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,656
Hang on, I'll let Amanda know.

107
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,026
That's okay. She's busy in the kitchen.
Let's not bother her. Come on.

108
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,909
Hang on a second.
You...

109
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,328
You don't want Amanda in the photo.

110
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:33,801
It's just, you know,
auto-focus, shutter speed, zoom...

111
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,663
Lily, what's going on?

112
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:37,338
Who wants a party hat?

113
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:39,974
Look, I'm a bird!

114
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:41,876
Let's all be birds.

115
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,467
Tell me the truth.

116
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,597
Of course not. I'm not going
to let another one of your dumb skanks

117
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,522
ruin my precious memories.

118
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,303
Lily, what are you talking about?

119
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:59,739
Ted, you always do this.

120
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:03,570
You bring girls that we barely know
to all our big group events.

121
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,378
- I do not.
- Really?

122
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,883
Well, let's just take a little walk

123
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:10,183
down Random Skank Lane.

124
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:13,052
Or, we could just keep on
a-strolling down

125
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,707
Best Birthday Ever Avenue.

126
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:17,781
Do I get a vote?
Skank Lane! Skank Lane!

127
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,517
Guys, I've composed a song
for the evening.

128
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,838
Follow along.
The chorus goes like this:

129
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,050
<i>Happy, happy Lily day!</i>

130
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,262
Christmas morning, four years ago.

131
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,838
<i>Our first Christmas together,
just the five of us.</i>

132
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,261
Here's
another fun little trivia game.

133
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:37,771
It's called <i>Name That Bitch</i>.

134
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,278
It is San...

135
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,551
Wrong. You're thinking of Santa,
'cause it was Christmas.

136
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:50,123
Fun fact, each year,
my mother has Easter tea

137
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,910
with her friend Bunny.

138
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,079
Not that fun.

139
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,020
I remember her name.
It's Sarah.

140
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,876
Close.
It's Leilani.

141
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,659
She just had to come to Christmas
because you said,

142
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:03,797
"Guys, she might be the one."

143
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:05,716
And she's not the only

144
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,334
"might be the one."

145
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,307
<i>New Year's Eve, 2007.</i>

146
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,608
<i>Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall</i>

147
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,533
<i>and "She's the One" Emily.</i>

148
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,366
<i>Robin's Uncle Cecil's funeral.</i>

149
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:20,191
<i>Marshall, Lily,
Robin, Barney, Ted and...</i>

150
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:24,390
<i>"this just proves you find the one
when you're not looking" Isabel.</i>

151
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,192
<i>My appendix surgery.</i>

152
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:28,967
<i>Robin, Marshall,
Barney, Lily, Ted, and...</i>

153
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:32,326
<i>Well, this one you admitted
you were just trying to bang.</i>

154
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,494
Respect.

155
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:37,289
Remember this yoga instructor
you brought to my last birthday?

156
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:38,532
<i>... you!</i>

157
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:40,042
Thanks.

158
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,003
You won't believe who just came in.

159
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,495
Don't look!

160
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,258
Why aren't you looking?
It's Slash from Guns N' Roses!

161
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,429
Group shot!

162
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:54,619
And we got it.

163
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:57,924
We got a picture with Slash
on my birthday.

164
00:07:58,049 --> 00:07:59,299
Awesome, right?

165
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,730
We know how this ends.

166
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,148
Wrong!

167
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:07,369
<i>You know what's funny about it?
He was grabbing my ass.</i>

168
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:10,427
<i>- Really? He was grabbing my ass, too.
- He was grabbing my ass, too.</i>

169
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:12,074
How many hands does he have?

170
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,201
No wonder
he's such a good guitarist.

171
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,995
I'm sorry dude,
I thought that you were Lily.

172
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:19,331
Wait, look at these pictures again.

173
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,663
<i>Barney has the same pose
in each shot</i>

174
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:23,988
<i>and these are, like, years apart.</i>

175
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,544
Yes, about that,

176
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,792
I never take a bad picture.

177
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,638
Never have, never will.

178
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,558
There has to be
a bad picture of you.

179
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,765
Not one.

180
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,812
The elementary school?
Everyone has bad pictures from school.

181
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,105
Not the Barnacle.

182
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:46,900
<i>I always look</i>

183
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,142
drop dead, stone cold amazing.

184
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:52,656
Unlike Marshall,
who just looks dead, stoned and cold.

185
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,708
<i>He was right, kids.
Marshall does a lot of things well,</i>

186
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,230
<i>but he does not take a good picture.</i>

187
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:04,185
They're not all bad, okay?
Like...

188
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,926
Here, look at this one.
My eyes are open.

189
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,882
You did put a bow on it.

190
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,049
Chip and dip?

191
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,217
Sure.

192
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,298
Got it!
A bad picture.

193
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:18,515
Is it though?

194
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,937
Wait!
You were eating a chip!

195
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:25,898
Where's the chip?

196
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,283
It is physically impossible for me
to take a bad picture.

197
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:31,361
I don't know why.
Ask God.

198
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,888
I'm sorry about Amanda.
I'm going to say it.

199
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,826
You are being a birthday brat.

200
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,914
You're all bent out of shape just 'cause
you think I ruined a couple pictures.

201
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,708
These girls have ruined

202
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,375
so many events,

203
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,671
or are you forgetting Paris?

204
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,131
What happened in Paris?

205
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,252
It was junior year
and I was studying abroad in Paris,

206
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,261
and I hadn't seen Marshall
for two months.

207
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,577
Two months.

208
00:09:57,702 --> 00:09:59,812
And I had just started having sex.

209
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,267
I wasn't ready
to stop for two months.

210
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:05,187
And Marshall was coming
to visit over spring break.

211
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,687
And at the last minute,

212
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,620
Ted decided to come

213
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:12,765
with the girl he had just
gotten back together with, Karen.

214
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:14,382
Karen.

215
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:17,241
I am so excited you're here.

216
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,284
I'm so excited to go to Paris.

217
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,215
I'm so excited to have sex again.

218
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,484
But just before
the plane took off...

219
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,668
Wait,

220
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:27,501
I want to tell you something.

221
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,524
Really?

222
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,837
'Cause I think I want to tell you
the same thing.

223
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,017
Is your thing, I had sex with
my philosophy professor last night?

224
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,551
'Cause that's my thing.

225
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,703
And thus began the longest seven
and a half hours of Marshall's life.

226
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:56,446
- When I picked them up at the airport.
- Ted broke up with me.

227
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:58,573
I need to sleep in your room
this week.

228
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,242
Marshall can bunk with Ted.

229
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,708
Two months!

230
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,958
My balls were bleu! Bleu!

231
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,536
This will come as no shock,

232
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:14,752
but the rest of the trip
was terrible.

233
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:26,220
And all I wanted was
a romantic kiss picture

234
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:27,966
in front of the Eiffel Tower,

235
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:29,911
which I actually did get.

236
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:33,544
It just happened to be between
Karen and Francois,

237
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,548
our waiter from the day before.

238
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,173
Wow, that's just awful.

239
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,076
Just...

240
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,205
Oopsies! I dropped my phone.

241
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,068
- You picking it up for me?
- Sure.

242
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:44,703
Smile, you son of a bitch!

243
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:45,764
Got it!

244
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,290
Did you, though?

245
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:54,171
Wait. How do you do that?
You weren't even standing up!

246
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,734
The camera loves me, Robin.

247
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,973
More than loves me.
The camera lusts after me.

248
00:11:58,098 --> 00:12:00,371
The camera wants to put
on some nice lingerie,

249
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:01,942
pop in an Al Green CD,

250
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:04,181
dim the lights and do all the work
while I lie

251
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,817
there with my eyes closed.

252
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:08,143
I'm sorry about Paris and

253
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,782
all the ruined group shots,

254
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:11,282
but when you're single,

255
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:14,016
you got to hope that each next new girl
is the one.

256
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,090
- Erin. Irene. And Sarah.
- Emily. Or Isabel.

257
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:19,406
It's Leilani.
What is wrong with you?

258
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,856
At the time, yes, I thought each
of these girls could be the one,

259
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:25,369
but I got to stay hopeful.
What's the alternative?

260
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,180
Here's the alternative.
How about

261
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:29,206
no more random skanks
at my birthday!

262
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:31,917
Hey, sweetie!

263
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,169
Do you guys have a cooling rack?

264
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,506
Drawer under the oven.
Can't wait. You're just the best!

265
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,968
Ted, I'm sorry.
I gonna have to agree with Lily on this.

266
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,428
These kind of events

267
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,556
are hard for a new person.
That's why I didn't bring Don tonight.

268
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:48,517
When I lived in Japan,

269
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,990
this guy, for our third date,
brought me to his brother's wedding.

270
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:55,259
Now, I a total stranger,

271
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:58,527
am in that Japanese couple's wedding
picture for all eternity.

272
00:13:04,021 --> 00:13:06,535
Yeah, Ted,
I think you should listen to Robin.

273
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,329
Right, right, 'cause...
'cause Robin's your best friend.

274
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,581
- Exactly.
- Your best friend in the whole world.

275
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,372
- Absolutely.
- Careful, Lily. It's a trap.

276
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:16,711
And before she was your best friend,
what was she?

277
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,321
Oh, that's right.

278
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:20,465
One of my random skanks.

279
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:22,657
Yes, Ted.

280
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:24,274
This particular skank...

281
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,614
... happened to work out,
but she's the skanky exception,

282
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:30,475
- not the skanky rule.
- I'm crying a little bit.

283
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,872
Hey, guys, that about wraps up
this whole skank conversation.

284
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:36,831
Let's get back to the birthday song!

285
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:40,485
Barney, your part goes like this.

286
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:43,100
She's cute.

287
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:45,807
She's cute.

288
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,420
She's cute.

289
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,094
I bring girls
to these events because

290
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,292
you guys are important to me.
You're my family.

291
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:59,117
Your part goes like this.

292
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:01,426
And nice.

293
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:03,441
And nice.

294
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:06,720
And also nice!

295
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,545
Yes. We're a family.

296
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,684
So why can't these events
ever just be us?

297
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:16,532
Like the time we celebrated
Marshall passing the bar exam.

298
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:17,772
Hey, guys.

299
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,525
This is the disgusting,
smelly hippie I'm dating.

300
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,403
I did not say that!

301
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,946
You might as well have.

302
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,031
Hey, guys.

303
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,447
This is Strawberry.

304
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:30,577
Should we order more food?

305
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,733
No, Strawberry's not eating.

306
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:34,748
I'm a vegetarian.

307
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,669
Let's all raise a glass.

308
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:42,951
For the last three years,

309
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:45,037
Marshall has been working so hard,

310
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,510
and I am so proud of you.

311
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,011
Meat is murder!

312
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:53,373
I admit it.

313
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:56,394
Strawberry was a mistake.
How could I have known that going in?

314
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,954
Her name was Strawberry.

315
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,728
If it's a big deal, Amanda doesn't have
to be in the photo.

316
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:05,820
But I promise she's not gonna ruin
your birthday. Just give her a chance.

317
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,150
See, look, guys.
We're all friends again!

318
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,101
Now let's work on those harmonies.

319
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,744
Happy happy Lily day!

320
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,711
Happy happy Lily day...

321
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,001
All done.

322
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:20,001
I hope you like it.

323
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:26,415
"Happy 42nd birthday,

324
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:27,645
" Lori."

325
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:33,247
Kids, you know how I've told you about
Lily's "you're dead to me" look.

326
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:36,716
That expression she gets just before
she explodes in white-hot rage?

327
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:37,782
Well,

328
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:39,271
this wasn't it.

329
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:46,106
But this was Marshall's.

330
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:47,794
"42nd"?

331
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:49,573
Does this

332
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,036
hot piece of ass look 42 to you?

333
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:52,899
Or!

334
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,036
Or

335
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,708
does she look like her name is Lori?

336
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,583
- No, Marshall, it's okay.
- No, Lily, it's not okay. Ted,

337
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,606
get this stranger out of my house!

338
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:03,336
I am so sorry.

339
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,255
Out!

340
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:21,855
Happy, happy Lily day.

341
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,107
Happy, happy Lily day

342
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:30,614
Well...

343
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:33,843
Amanda refused to come back.
She thinks you guys hate her.

344
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,619
Marshall, you have to go apologize.

345
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:38,390
You ruin Lily's birthday

346
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,097
and you want me to apologize?

347
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:42,626
If anything,
you should apologize to me.

348
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,210
What are you talking about?

349
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,679
Ted, you bring girls
to these intimate events

350
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:48,858
it makes them think
that things are serious.

351
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:51,426
And then when you break up with them,
you know who they turn to?

352
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,096
Me. I've been
your girlfriend cleanup crew for years.

353
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,107
February, 2005.

354
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:00,763
I had just come back from a marathon
study session at the law library.

355
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,605
Hey, Natalie, where's, where's Ted?

356
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:05,110
We broke up...

357
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,137
again!

358
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:12,458
Won't you sit with me for
a little while?

359
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,513
Just sit?

360
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,452
Man, you know what?
I've been up for, like, 36 hours.

361
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:22,457
Just for a few minutes.

362
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:31,526
And at first,
I was completely sympathetic.

363
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,969
But damn it, Ted, over the years,
you made me cynical.

364
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,422
You know what?
I'm going to go get us some Rocky Road,

365
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:40,785
and we're just going to sit here
and talk it out until it makes sense.

366
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:43,961
I just thought
we had something so special,

367
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,109
you know?

368
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,394
Me, too. Yeah.

369
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:50,441
But, you know,
life goes on, sweetheart.

370
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,354
I don't know how I'm going
to put my life back together after this.

371
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,100
Oh, shut up.

372
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,104
I'm sorry my search for true love
has been such an inconvenience

373
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:02,803
to you guys.
You know what?

374
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:06,292
Maybe your precious pictures would look
a lot better if I wasn't in them.

375
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,837
Look better if Marshall
weren't in them. Cheap shot.

376
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:10,255
Cheap shot.

377
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,394
You know what these pictures are, Lily?
They're a big, fat lie.

378
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,482
They're posed.

379
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:17,387
They're touched up. They're what you
want our life to be, not what it is.

380
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,325
- That's not true!
- Oh, yeah?

381
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,559
Look at this one.
Halloween, two years ago.

382
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,520
You got in a fight 'cause
you didn't want to dress up as penguins.

383
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,805
It's not just that she didn't want to.
It's that she called penguins "lame."

384
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,059
Penguins.

385
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,972
And yet, here you are,
smiling like nothing's wrong,

386
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:34,612
completely phony.

387
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,131
Robin's birthday, three years ago.

388
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:41,411
Robin had a cold and you made her change
out of her pajama's for the picture.

389
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,247
And then you pinched my cheeks
to get some color in them.

390
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,052
Yeah, but you look pretty.

391
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:49,627
And then,
we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.

392
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:53,381
- Actually, that was a nice night.
- Yeah, it was.

393
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,999
Yeah, I guess it was.

394
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,354
Hey, look at this one.

395
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,222
This is the first picture the three
of us ever took together.

396
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,682
That's right. It was.

397
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:05,059
Yeah, you remember how it happened?

398
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,798
Okay, ready?

399
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:07,854
Wait.

400
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,150
What pose should we do?
Buddy cop picture?

401
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,194
What about, '80s sitcom

402
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,642
about two roommates
who never agree on anything?

403
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:17,906
Nice.

404
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:20,052
Okay, one, two...

405
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:24,496
Hi, Marshall.
Ready for the movie?

406
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:27,693
Yeah. Just a second though, okay?
We're about to make history.

407
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:30,330
We're about to take
our first ever roommate picture.

408
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,629
Why don't you get in the picture,
too?

409
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:33,713
Really?

410
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:35,769
What you doing, Ted?

411
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:38,134
- What if we break up?
- What if you don't?

412
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:40,887
Come on.

413
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,963
I forgot all about that.

414
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,822
Marshall and I had just been dating
a few weeks

415
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:53,092
and you invited me into the picture.

416
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:55,471
I liked you.

417
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,902
- We have to get Amanda back.
- Really?

418
00:19:58,027 --> 00:19:59,422
Ted, you believed in me.

419
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:01,332
It's my turn to believe in you.

420
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:03,605
For all I know, she's the one.

421
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:05,328
Thanks, Lil.

422
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:08,351
I think Lori's age
has made her very wise.

423
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:11,832
They say your forties are when
you really get to know yourself.

424
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:15,421
So, your Aunt Lily called Amanda.

425
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,423
All right, people, gather around.

426
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,815
Let's make a memory.

427
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:21,334
Okay, Marshall.
Marshall, try this.

428
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,853
Keep your eyes closed
until the last second,

429
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:25,787
and when I say so, open them.

430
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:29,221
- Barney, it's a hole in your jacket?
- What? Where?

431
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,237
Now, Marshall!

432
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,416
Damn it!

433
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,238
Name that bitch.

434
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,001
Birth... a?

435
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:43,074
Bertha?

436
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,154
No, it was my birthday.

437
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,288
Your brain makes associations
in a very obvious way.

438
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,831
All right, people.

439
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,839
Gather around.
Let's make a memory.

440
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,261
What's in this dip you made?

441
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:56,913
'Cause it tastes like...

442
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:58,272
cilantro.

443
00:20:58,397 --> 00:20:59,151
And

444
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,929
you know that cilantro makes me...

445
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:04,437
Yes!
