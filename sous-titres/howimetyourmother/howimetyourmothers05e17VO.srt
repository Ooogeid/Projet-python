00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,743
<i>Kids, on a warm March evening
in 2010</i>

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:05,909
<i>a New York City police boat
pulled a 34-year-old white male</i>

3
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:08,409
<i>out of the Hudson River:
your Uncle Barney.</i>

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,677
Let's hear the story.
From the beginning.

5
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,013
It all started a week ago.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,974
<i>I was making time
at the local watering hole.</i>

7
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:19,308
<i>Enter...</i>

8
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:20,938
<i>a dame.</i>

9
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,112
Nothing sexier than a man
in a fine cravat.

10
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:34,950
Except for a woman
who appreciates a fine cravat.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,622
How about we just call it a tie?

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,254
A cravat is a kind of tie.

13
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,009
- I get it.
- Anyway,

14
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,841
next thing you know,
I get her back to my place.

15
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:54,624
When I get in bed with a man,

16
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:58,184
my body becomes a machine
fueled by desire, lust

17
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,477
and a singular hunger to satisfy

18
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,769
my lover's every carnal need.

19
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,899
Good thing the cleaning lady
is coming tomorrow.

20
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,809
Well, good night.

21
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:12,987
What? Wait, what?

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,275
I thought your body was going
to become a machine

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,820
fueled by desire, lust
and a singular hunger

24
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,495
to satisfy my every carnal need.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,349
I really think that Don and I
are hitting our stride as a news team.

26
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:44,016
All credit
goes to this lady on my left.

27
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,310
That story you did on which rodents
to avoid on the subway...

28
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:49,277
The answer may surprise you.

29
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,048
It's all of them.

30
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,737
I got to run. I'll see you.

31
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,214
It's good to meet you.

32
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,224
That guy is awesome.

33
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,509
He's funny, he's smart,
he's handsome.

34
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,457
Scoop him up
before someone else does.

35
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,626
I hope you're not talking about you.

36
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,190
It has been four months
since you broke up with Barney.

37
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,422
Maybe it's time
to put yourself back out there.

38
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,676
Exactly. Barney's dating again,
and he couldn't be happier.

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,636
I couldn't be more unhappy.

40
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,096
All night long,
she's hot and heavy for me.

41
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,391
I get her back to my place,
and she just bolts?

42
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,755
I mean, at least,
when I run out on a girl,

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,726
I have the common courtesy
to sleep with her first.

44
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,254
It's called manners.

45
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,279
She read that book

46
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:33,986
<i>Of Course You're Still Single,
Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut</i>.

47
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:39,408
It's this book that helps single girls
find a husband.

48
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:43,746
It's Robin's copy.
I leafed through it a little bit.

49
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,602
Fine.

50
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,308
When you were with this girl,

51
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:55,424
did she subtly slip the word
"sex" into conversation?

52
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,976
I'm in the inter-sex-tion,

53
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:02,223
and I only have a couple of sex
before the light changes.

54
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,474
I mean, everyone's honking at me,

55
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,386
and it totally sex,

56
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,308
but I can't turn around

57
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,607
because a jogger slipped
and fell in horse sex-crement.

58
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,241
Go on. Go on.

59
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,030
Did she make excuses
to establish physical contact with you?

60
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,051
Is this cashmere?

61
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,575
Cashmere?

62
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,909
This is hand-spun virgin merino.

63
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,999
The fibers in this suit

64
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,667
are less than 12 microns thick.

65
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,763
12 microns.

66
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,205
I love a tiny fiber.

67
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:38,439
Well, you're in luck,
because mine's the tiniest.

68
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:40,777
And the more you touch it,

69
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,079
the softer it gets.

70
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,401
She did that, too.

71
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,741
Here is the final test.

72
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,480
Next time you see her,
ask her out for the following night.

73
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:56,342
The book says that's forbidden,

74
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,886
so she'll probably give you
some lame excuse like this:

75
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,208
"I can't do anything tomorrow night.

76
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,438
"I've already made plans
to clean my garbage disposal

77
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,081
"and treat myself to a bubble bath.

78
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,777
"But how about next week sometime?"

79
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:11,427
You're trying that
<i>Of Course You're Still Single,</i>

80
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,586
<i>Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut</i>
crap on me.

81
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,670
It's not crap.

82
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,591
It is a brillant book!

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,510
It scares away guys
who are only interested in getting laid.

84
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:24,889
Why not just say you have a kid?

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,815
You'd be surprised how many jerks
there are out there.

86
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:30,476
That's why the book says
never sleep on the first date.

87
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:31,939
- Totally.
- On the second.

88
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,601
- Of course.
- Or on the third.

89
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,185
- Or on the fourth.
- Just tell me how many dates!

90
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:37,860
17.

91
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:42,870
Excuse me, is anyone using this?

92
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:50,838
Here it is:
no sex until after 17 dates.

93
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:55,132
If you're not going to take her out
on 17 dates, you should just give it up.

94
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,823
She is gonna give it up, not me.

95
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:01,884
Because, thanks to Ted's book...

96
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,552
That's Robin's.

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,243
I can stay two steps ahead of her
at all times.

98
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:08,766
There's a loophole in here somewhere
and I'm going to find it.

99
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:14,969
<i>Listen...</i>

100
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:17,566
you wanna go out Saturday night?

101
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,179
- Saturday night...
- Is he asking you out?

102
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:21,444
Say yes!

103
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,617
It's really sweet of you to ask,

104
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,910
and you're a great guy...

105
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:31,996
- I will go out with you.
- Robin, are you okay?

106
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:34,707
I just had a little cold.

107
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,812
That's probably what you're hearing.
But Saturday night sounds great.

108
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,879
We can even go to a steak house,

109
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,945
and you can bring home
some prime rib for my friend.

110
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,718
Gotta go. Love you. Bye.

111
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,388
What the hell are you thinking?

112
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,477
You've got to do this, okay?

113
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:51,544
A great guy like Don is rare.

114
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:53,642
And speaking of rare,

115
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,312
prime rib! Don't forget. Thank you.

116
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,934
I don't believe it.

117
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:03,570
This is her!

118
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,198
She wrote the book.

119
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:08,993
Her name must be Anita.

120
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,164
My plan was to sleep with her,
but this changes everything.

121
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:15,866
New plan:

122
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,937
I'm going to sleep with her.

123
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:23,674
Boy, this girl
that Barney's going after,

124
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:25,883
she kind of sounds
like the anti-Barney.

125
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,584
I love how the universe
decided to bring those two together.

126
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:33,024
Actually, Anita's going after Barney
because I told her to.

127
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:42,151
Wait, you sicced Anita on Barney?

128
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,875
- How do you even know her?
- She was on my show.

129
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,115
But, um, if you had
to summarize your book

130
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,159
in 30 words or less...

131
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,307
I'll summarize it in one word.

132
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:53,579
That word

133
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:54,788
is "no."

134
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:56,123
By saying no

135
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,168
constantly and consistently,
you empower yourself

136
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:02,131
while simultaneously
turning any jerk

137
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,007
into a submissive,
sniveling, puddle of a man.

138
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,641
And isn't that every girl's dream?

139
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,763
After the break, we're going to talk
about your new book,

140
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,892
<i>Of Course You Don't Have
a Retirement Plan Yet,</i>

141
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,934
<i>Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut,</i>
due out in June.

142
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:17,811
We'll be right back.

143
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,329
We're clear.

144
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:22,274
- You guys want any coffee?
- You know what, that'd be great.

145
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,442
You?

146
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,364
What about you? You dating anyone?

147
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,625
Dating's not really my bag
right now.

148
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,205
Somebody broke your heart?

149
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:39,084
And then, I told her everything.
It just came pouring out.

150
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,375
And by the end of it...

151
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,794
This Barney needs
to be taught a lesson.

152
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:45,714
You say the word,
and I will destroy him.

153
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:49,051
- What do you mean?
- I can use the power of "no"

154
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,854
to break your friend, Barney.

155
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:54,765
- Just say the word.
- That stuff doesn't really work.

156
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,267
- Does it?
- I didn't know what you wanted,

157
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,043
so I got you a cappuccino,
an espresso, a latte, a decaf...

158
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,190
And this is a Turkish coffee.

159
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,480
- Think about it.
- <i>I didn't think I would think about it,</i>

160
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:09,988
<i>but... I thought about it.</i>

161
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,810
This Pilates instructor
was off the charts.

162
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,105
Picture Robin, but younger.

163
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:20,856
And bigger boobs.

164
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,890
Maybe not bigger, but more shapely.

165
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,179
And bigger.

166
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,344
I get her up against the StairMaster,
and we...

167
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,928
- Do it.
- Spoilers.

168
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,680
- Anyway, we do it.
- It's done.

169
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:45,691
I know, it was stupid,

170
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,742
but you have to understand, back then,
I was really upset about the breakup.

171
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,613
I was going though
my mourning period.

172
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:55,492
There was a lot of scotch and a lot
of long nights at the shooting range.

173
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:57,817
I hope those weren't
the same nights.

174
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,792
It's not like I remember
all of them.

175
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:05,460
Did you know that Robin
was going through a mourning period?

176
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,547
- She seemed fine after the breakup.
- You know how she is.

177
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,377
She keeps her emotions to herself.

178
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,866
But yeah, I caught her crying
a couple times.

179
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:14,273
She cried?

180
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:16,220
Like, real tears?

181
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:18,651
But that means...

182
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:24,938
<i>And then, Marshall realized
what a jackass he had been to Robin.</i>

183
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:28,150
Exactly. Barney's dating again,
and he couldn't be happier.

184
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:29,443
I mean,

185
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:32,110
that guy has been active.

186
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:34,656
Sexually.

187
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:36,116
He's been...

188
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:40,946
You know?

189
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:42,643
It's like...

190
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,762
How could you let me do that?

191
00:09:57,007 --> 00:10:00,641
You're supposed to stop me
from embarrassing myself in public.

192
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:03,667
I know,
but that song's kind of catchy.

193
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,694
Damn it.

194
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,489
I've read that thing cover to cover,
and I can't find a loophole.

195
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,416
What am I going to do?

196
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,731
Well,
there is one other option, but...

197
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:21,578
you're not ready.

198
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,169
Tell me.

199
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,926
If you have to seal the deal
in one date,

200
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,001
it's got to be
one doozy of a date, right?

201
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,463
I'm not talking dinner and a movie.
I'm not talking mini-golf.

202
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:32,881
I'm talking...

203
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,872
17 dates worth of romance

204
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:37,678
wrapped up
into one incredible night.

205
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,805
I'm talking about...

206
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,265
a superdate.

207
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,899
A superdate?

208
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:47,729
That sounds kind of lame.
What if we call it a megadate?

209
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:49,926
If you want my help,
it's a superdate.

210
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:51,731
- All right.
- Leave it to me.

211
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:55,388
- I'll plan the whole thing.
- You're going to plan the whole thing?

212
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,498
I bet
it'll be all gooey and romantic.

213
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,116
Gooey and romantic?

214
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,124
Gooey and romantic?

215
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:05,472
<i>You don't have to take her... </i>

216
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,323
<i>To Paris or Peru.</i>

217
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:10,800
Ted, what are you doing?

218
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:15,536
<i>You just have to make her
understand...</i>

219
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:17,602
Ted, people are looking at us.

220
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:21,608
<i>What she means to you.</i>

221
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,067
God, really?
You're going to do this right now?

222
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,982
<i>On your superdate,</i>

223
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:31,109
<i>Troubles of the world</i>

224
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:34,757
<i>will simply have to wait.</i>

225
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:38,381
<i>For wonders and amazement</i>

226
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:41,955
<i>served upon a silver plate,</i>

227
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,010
<i>hurry up now, don't be late.</i>

228
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:49,874
<i>'Cause hand in hand
you'll find a land...</i>

229
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:56,907
<i>where paradise awaits.</i>

230
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,356
And then boom!

231
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,601
Fireworks
over the Manhattan skyline!

232
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:05,152
You kiss her.

233
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:08,594
<i>And that's your...</i>

234
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:12,488
<i>superdate.</i>

235
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:23,179
That sounds gooey and romantic.

236
00:12:28,723 --> 00:12:30,623
- Strip club?
- Strip club.

237
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:34,126
<i>Finally,
the night of the big dates arrived.</i>

238
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,670
So, tonight's the big night.

239
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,757
Where's the D-bag taking you?
That's not a good nickname for Don.

240
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,968
- I'll think of a better one.
- You know, that, I just... I canceled.

241
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,014
What do you mean you...

242
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:49,017
- What's wrong?
- Robin canceled her date.

243
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,978
What? She was totally psyched for it
like an hour ago.

244
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:57,610
You look like the classiest,

245
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,986
most expensive prostitute ever.

246
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:01,363
Thank you.

247
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,616
I take it
you're excited to go out with Don?

248
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,452
You know what? I kinda am.
Don't tell Marshall.

249
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:10,277
I won't.
I bet you'll have a nice time tonight.

250
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:12,099
Not, however, a super time.

251
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:16,002
A super time will be had
by Barney on his date with Anita.

252
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,478
Carriage ride,

253
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:20,298
dinner at <i>Le Tombeur des Culottes</i>.

254
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,931
They're calling it a superdate,
so...

255
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:27,954
How could you do that?!

256
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,725
Robin just got over
her mourning period!

257
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,727
She seemed
so happy after the breakup.

258
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,250
So unobservant.

259
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,425
Such a guy.

260
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,483
She was obviously crushed.

261
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:40,712
Wait, but that would mean...

262
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:46,074
<i>And then I realized
what a jackass I'd been to Robin.</i>

263
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,119
Whatcha singing?

264
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,876
Just a ditty I wrote about girls
Barney's been banging lately.

265
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,087
- Well, count me in for a verse.
- Great.

266
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:04,593
God.
Where is she?

267
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,386
I think she's in the restroom.

268
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,558
Guys, I'm fine.

269
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,567
Dude.

270
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:22,509
Why would you do that?

271
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,784
Because I'm angry at you.

272
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,782
I'm angry at me.
I'm angry at Ted.

273
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,951
And frankly,
I'm still angry at the Empire.

274
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:32,162
Why are you angry at me?

275
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,667
Dude, you've been a real jerk
in front of Robin

276
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,541
while she's been have
her mourning period.

277
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:39,669
She hasn't been going through
any mourning period.

278
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:42,510
- So unobservant.
- Such a guy.

279
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:45,754
Barney, sit down,
you need to hear some stuff.

280
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:49,346
- What, is she upset or something?
- Of course she's upset.

281
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,515
Take a look at yourself,
you dumb slut.

282
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:55,602
<i>And then Aunt Lily told Barney
every excruciating detail</i>

283
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,646
<i>of what he hadn't been seeing.</i>

284
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,804
You should've seen this girl.

285
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,443
I'm leaving.

286
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:05,163
So...

287
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,188
we get up to my place...

288
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,566
I can't believe Robin's been upset.

289
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:45,485
I can't believe you threw up
in your Stormtrooper helmet.

290
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,127
I did something worse in it
after <i>The Phantom Menace</i> premiere.

291
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:53,613
So, she's been this way
ever since we broke up?

292
00:15:53,738 --> 00:15:55,711
Actually, she was doing much better

293
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:58,915
until you decided to go
on this stupid superdate with Anita.

294
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:02,752
And now she's off,
sulking God knows where.

295
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:04,754
I know where.

296
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:15,391
Barney, what's up?

297
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:18,836
Thought you were going
on some big date.

298
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,937
Robin, I know you're upset.

299
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,040
What?

300
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:24,858
I have...
I've never been happier.

301
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,835
And this Anita sounds lovely.

302
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,708
I am so glad that you two just...

303
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,414
randomly happened
to find each other.

304
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:34,534
It just warms my frickin' heart.

305
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,139
So, you're not upset?

306
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,047
Of course I'm upset, Barney.

307
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,615
Don't you see how constantly
talking about your conquests

308
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,178
makes me feel
like I'm just another number to you?

309
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,679
But you're not that.

310
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,342
You know,
and now you're taking Anita,

311
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,994
who you barely know,
on this amazing date,

312
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,520
when I never got treated that way.

313
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,444
It just...

314
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,601
it just sucks, that's all.
It just sucks.

315
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,396
I knew I was bad
at being a boyfriend,

316
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:21,956
but I had no idea I'd be so much worse
at being an ex-boyfriend.

317
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:26,217
I'm sorry.

318
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:29,631
What can I do?

319
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:31,631
Nothing.

320
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:34,469
You've already proven
I'm not important.

321
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,882
Stop that, I'm serious.

322
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,507
Ask me for anything.

323
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:42,310
- Don't sleep with Anita.
- Done.

324
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:44,709
Barney, of course
you're going to sleep with her.

325
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:47,441
Why else would you be taking her
on this superdate?

326
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,396
She's not going on the superdate,
Robin.

327
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:52,404
You are.

328
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:56,475
<i>Your Uncle Barney
finally gave Aunt Robin</i>

329
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,750
<i>the superdate she truly deserved.</i>

330
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:01,371
<i>With a guy she truly deserved.</i>

331
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:05,730
<i>Of course,
there was still one loose end.</i>

332
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:09,838
I meant to call you.

333
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,399
Well, I'm breaking all my rules
coming down here, but...

334
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:16,928
nobody stands me up like that.
So, are we going out or what?

335
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,398
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,669
I made a promise to a friend.

337
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:23,309
I have to say no.

338
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:27,942
I see.

339
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,442
You're trying the "no" thing on me.

340
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,610
You think that'll work?

341
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:35,024
'Cause it won't.

342
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,083
How about this.
I'll cut you a deal.

343
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,368
Maybe...

344
00:18:40,014 --> 00:18:41,114
you might...

345
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,414
get lucky after the 12th date.

346
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,678
The 11th date.
Fifth date.

347
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,669
Tonight.
Tonight before dinner.

348
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:52,740
How about you?
You interested?

349
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:55,341
Come on, Barney.

350
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,859
I'm sorry, Anita.

351
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,762
The answer is no.

352
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:00,741
Well, good.

353
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:03,057
Because my answer is no, too.

354
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,061
Here's my final offer.

355
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:39,135
And that's my story.

356
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:42,999
Well, here's a $500 ticket
for jumping in the river.

357
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:45,131
I hope it was worth it.

358
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,164
I hope so, too.

359
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,709
It's an old wives' tale.

360
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,425
How did the big date go?

361
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,007
Pretty well.

362
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:31,247
Pretty... pretty well.

363
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,106
Like how "pretty well"?

364
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,181
Guys, come on.

365
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,200
It was fine.

366
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:39,076
You know, it was nice.

367
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,352
We had a good time.

368
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:42,627
Let's just...

369
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:44,450
let's just leave it.

370
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:47,912
Although,

371
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,973
one interesting thing did happen.
