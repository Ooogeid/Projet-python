1
00:00:00,726 --> 00:00:04,175
<i>2009, I'd been dating
my high school girlfriend Karen</i>

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,193
<i>for a few weeks. My friends couldn't
have been less excited.</i>

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:09,304
- Hey, everybody.
- Hello.

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,064
Sorry, we can't stay long.

5
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:13,930
- What a shame!
- That is sad!

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,515
- Are those real diamond earrings?
- Yes.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,801
Yes, they are.

8
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:20,693
- Thank you.
- I didn't say I liked them.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,763
I got a great deal on them, so...

10
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:26,134
Cool. I'm sure
all the exploited diamond miners

11
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,996
in Sierra Leone
would give you a high five

12
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:30,947
if they still had all their fingers.
But really pretty.

13
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:33,103
Meet me upstairs.

14
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:36,285
They only need one finger
to give her what I'm thinking.

15
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:38,871
Karen's a douche.

16
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:42,249
- Thanks for sugarcoating.
- "Douche"is sugarcoating it.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,852
Believe it or not, my friends
do not get a vote on who I date.

18
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:48,839
It's my life.
I call the shots.

19
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,736
- Ted, now!
- Yeah, coming!

20
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:55,754
I don't know what Ted sees
in that horrible woman.

21
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:58,517
I mean, yeah,
she's got boobs, but...

22
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,892
I guess I get it.

23
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,413
I think it's 'cause
they met in high school.

24
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:04,397
She was his first real girlfriend.

25
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,329
We look at Karen and see a jerk.

26
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:08,508
Ted looks at Karen
and sees the first person to touch

27
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,487
his wiener besides himself,
his mom, and his pediatrician.

28
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,281
It's almost 2:00 A.M.
I better get ready for work.

29
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,714
How can they call that thing
you're on a "morning show"?

30
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:20,109
4:00 A.M. is still
the middle of the night.

31
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:21,580
I don't see how you do it.

32
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,335
It's been almost a month.

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,918
I'm used to it.
Plus the show's not half bad, right?

34
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,528
- Totally.
- I've never seen it.

35
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:30,631
Have you guys ever watched it?

36
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:32,561
- Of course!
- I've never seen it.

37
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:34,301
What is your favorite segment?

38
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,672
- Weather.
- Never...

39
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:38,014
- You guys have never seen my show.
- Sorry.

40
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,230
Never seen it.

41
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:42,281
It's dull and generic

42
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,703
and we get spanked in the ratings
by that Korean channel

43
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:47,424
that only shows Kim Jong Il
riding a horse,

44
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,985
but guys,

45
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,537
it would mean so much to me
if just once I knew my friends

46
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:52,862
were out there watching.

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,112
I'll tell you what.
This Friday morning,

48
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:59,346
everyone can come
to our place 3:30 A.M.

49
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:01,954
We'll all put on Pjs.
We'll watch Robin's show.

50
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,256
What?

51
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,958
- You guys are the best.
- We just want to support you.

52
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,604
I just want to go to sleep!

53
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:11,881
I hate Robin
for not being more successful.

54
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,312
Sad announcement:

55
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,555
Karen broke up with me.

56
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:23,164
Go ahead.

57
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,089
I knew you were listening!

58
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,659
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

59
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:43,918
We shouldn't be celebrating.

60
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:46,040
Ted's just been through
a bad break-up.

61
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,471
Buddy, tell us everything.
Tell us what happened.

62
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:51,453
Seriously, spare no details.

63
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:53,840
What did she say?
What did you say?

64
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:55,703
How did it feel?

65
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:59,553
If you were to do it again,
all over, would you maybe...?

66
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,332
How did it happen?

67
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:05,576
It was the stupidest thing.
I mean,

68
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:08,562
we were just hanging out,
you know, being funny...

69
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:11,654
You're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

70
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,653
No, you're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

71
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:17,571
Wait. What is this?

72
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:20,456
Looks like one of Robin's earrings.

73
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,479
That's weird.
You're the...

74
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:25,120
- How did it get in your bed?
- I don't know.

75
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:29,190
- Have you been sleeping with Robin?
- What? No, of course not!

76
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:31,669
It probably got mixed in
with the laundry or something.

77
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,392
Why should I believe you?

78
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:36,408
Maybe because
I've always been faithful to you

79
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,293
while you've cheated on me,
like, six times, bitch.

80
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,305
- Cold-blooded!
- Right? Right?

81
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:45,099
I totally should have said that.

82
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,240
Why should I believe you?

83
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,480
Maybe because I've always been
faithful to you while you...

84
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:54,524
I love you...

85
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:57,691
I knew this was a mistake.

86
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,777
That's it. It's over.

87
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,791
And that was it.

88
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:04,201
She left.

89
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:05,692
What a story.

90
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:08,247
So brave of you to share that.

91
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,875
Wait.Those are your pajamas?

92
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:14,023
- You sleep in a pajama suit?
- Of course.

93
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:16,735
- What do you think I sleep in?
- A coffin.

94
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,925
Dude, that doesn't look
comfortable at all.

95
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,955
- You're wearing a tie.
- First of all, it's a sleeping cravat.

96
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,599
Second, it's not about comfort.

97
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:29,143
It's about looking good
all the time.

98
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,478
Why do you have to look good
all the time?

99
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,106
Let me tell you a little story

100
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,982
about something happened
a couple months.

101
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,883
We were just having a
"Who's hornier" contest

102
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:49,803
and we spilled massage oil
all over ourselves.

103
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:52,249
- Nice pajamas.
- Can we use your shower?

104
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,963
That's not a memory.
That's from a porn movie.

105
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,841
- Not just any movie.
- That's the exact scene from...

106
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:03,156
Never mind.

107
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,732
The point is it could happen.

108
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:07,326
And if it did,

109
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,067
and I didn't look my absolute best
for those greasy sluts,

110
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:11,435
I'd regret it forever.

111
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:15,202
I'm sorry, dude, but that is
just the most ridiculous

112
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,900
sleeping attire
I've ever seen in my life. Anyway...

113
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:21,070
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!

114
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:22,905
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!

115
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,920
You know how in the future
we're always saying

116
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,440
"Remember when Marshall
wore a nightgown"? This is that time!

117
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:29,623
- It's a nightshirt.
- You can call it

118
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:31,607
a Ninja Star Danger Jock
if you want.

119
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,638
Doesn't make you any
less of a cross-dresser.

120
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:35,691
Whatever, dude. It's comfy.

121
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,671
So, flying to Neverland
with Peter and Tink, was that amazing?

122
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,839
Let me go next!
Was it nice

123
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,019
to finally get out of that
crowded bed and take

124
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:46,220
Charlie to the chocolate factory?
Oh, me, me!

125
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,095
Something about Scrooge!

126
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,969
Come on, guys.
I'm carrying the team.

127
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,751
I don't know.
I lived with Marshall for 12 years.

128
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,523
Any time he's wearing clothes at all,
it's a victory.

129
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,820
- Ted, show's about to start!
- Be right there!

130
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:19,254
<i>Good morning, New York.
I'm Robin...</i>

131
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,596
Marshall, I just found
Robin's earring on your dresser.

132
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:26,969
Did you have something to do
with the other being in my bed?

133
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,141
- What are you talking about?
- You've hated Karen.

134
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:31,098
You've been telling me
to break up with her.

135
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:34,935
You did it. You put the earring
in my bed so that Karen would find it.

136
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,062
- No, Ted, I would never...
- Admit it!

137
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,289
- There's nothing to admit!
- Why was Robin's earring

138
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:41,483
- on your dresser?
- He was accessorizing!

139
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,570
Marshall, I swear to God,
if you don't tell me the truth now...

140
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,323
Wait!
Marshall didn't do it.

141
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:49,901
I did.

142
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:51,910
I broke you and Karen up.

143
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:01,587
You broke me and Karen up?
Are you insane?

144
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,007
- What gives you the right to do that?
- I did it for your own good.

145
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,427
You just weren't seeing
how awful she was.

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,846
She failed the Front Porch Test.

147
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,013
What's the Front Porch Test?

148
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:16,902
Ted, you, me, and Marshall
have been best friends since college.

149
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:19,938
Think about how much
we all mean to each other.

150
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,233
So when I picture the future,
I picture us all together.

151
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:26,079
<i>How we'll all be retired,
sipping tea</i>

152
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:29,707
<i>on the front porch of our beach house,
playing bridge all day.</i>

153
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,436
Bridges are wild.

154
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,052
Four of a bridge
beats a royal bridge.

155
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,665
I see your bridge
and I raise you three bridges.

156
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:39,878
Bridge!

157
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:40,876
I win!

158
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,295
You have no idea
how to play bridge, do you?

159
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:46,048
- We're gonna take a class.
- It's important to stay active.

160
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,074
So whenever you've been dating
somebody for a while,

161
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,929
I do the Front Porch Test.

162
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:55,766
You know, how is this person gonna fit
in with our group over the years?

163
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,393
And when I think
about Karen there...

164
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,860
Bridge!

165
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:00,854
I win!

166
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,357
Fantastic. Another game of bridge.

167
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,192
Don't read a book or anything.

168
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:06,868
Look, dear...

169
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:08,487
dolphins.

170
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,167
They seem happy.

171
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,934
I guess the chemical runoff
from this elitist beach front property

172
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,701
hasn't rotted out
their blowholes yet.

173
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,069
It will.
That water will kill you.

174
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:19,832
It is a toxic deathtrap.

175
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,302
- I'm gonna take a dip.
- I'll join you.

176
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,005
Karen failed the Front Porch Test.
She had to go.

177
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,330
I can't believe you did that.

178
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,553
Think about how awesome you, me,
and Marshall are.

179
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,097
Seriously think about it.

180
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,436
- We're pretty awesome.
- We're totally awesome!

181
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,728
So whoever you marry, whoever

182
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:45,689
joins Team Awesome,

183
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,193
the bar is set pretty damn high.

184
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:51,989
Look, I'm not saying
what I did was right, but...

185
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,574
You're better off without her.

186
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,076
And if Clarence the angel
says it's true, it must be true.

187
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,537
Okay, you know what?
Fine, make your little jokes.

188
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:00,422
Why would you wear
something like that?

189
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:03,097
- Lots of reasons.
- I bet you can't name five.

190
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:05,043
One: No need to wear
anything underneath.

191
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,317
I can vouch for that.
Will you cross your legs?

192
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,201
Two: Sexy.

193
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,426
I can vouch for that.
Will you uncross your legs, buddy?

194
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:16,680
Three: My Grandpa Olaf
wore one and he lived to be 107.

195
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,724
Four: No elastic waistband

196
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,031
leaving its judgmental pink teeth marks
around my Thanksgiving belly.

197
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:23,199
And five:

198
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:25,957
Every night when I go to sleep,

199
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:29,466
it's the freest, most wonderful
feeling in the world.

200
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:30,652
I feel...

201
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:32,673
like I'm flying.

202
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:40,287
So that's how
I go to bed every night:

203
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:43,829
happy, weightless.
With a heart full of joy.

204
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:45,751
What about you?

205
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:50,047
I have to lie perfectly still
so I don't wrinkle my suit-jamas.

206
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,722
But at least
I'm not wearing a dress.

207
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,109
So... how mad are you?

208
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,553
I don't know.
I mean,

209
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:02,487
I guess if you guys feel
that strongly about Karen,

210
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,185
then maybe it was for the best.

211
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:05,887
I really am sorry.

212
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:09,023
I hated doing that again,
but Karen had to go.

213
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,720
"Again"?

214
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:15,112
Wait. How many times have you
broken me up with a girlfriend?

215
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,405
Never! Six.

216
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:19,159
- Like who?
- No one! Angie.

217
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:21,923
Sophomore year.

218
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,290
She was just using you
to get back at her ex,

219
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,458
and you clearly didn't see it, so...

220
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,519
one day when she was taking a nap...

221
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,610
Creed?

222
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,470
Oh, my God,
I have to break up with her.

223
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,943
So that's where my Creed CD went.

224
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,351
Who else?

225
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,948
Remember that weird sci-fi girl

226
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:01,284
who wanted you to propose
after, like, two months?

227
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:05,329
You barely even liked her, but
you were still thinking about it, so...

228
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:10,043
Listen, Ted, you're great,

229
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,946
and this is so difficult,

230
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:15,382
but I think we're looking
for different things.

231
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,175
So, live long and prosper.

232
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,712
Or whatever.

233
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,351
That was you?

234
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,144
This is insane!

235
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,231
Ted, I did those things to help you.

236
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,149
You're a commitment junkie.

237
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:35,736
You fall in love with these women,
even if they don't deserve you.

238
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:38,363
What if one of those women
was the mother of my children?

239
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,200
If there was ever the tiniest chance
of that, I swear I didn't do anything.

240
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,493
Like with Victoria or Stella.

241
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,536
Or Robin.

242
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:48,977
Or Robin.

243
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,257
Did you break us up, too?

244
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:56,255
Did you break us up, too?!

245
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,633
Stop talking to me
like I'm your enemy!

246
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,022
You weep for these women,
but you have the luxury

247
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:04,040
of not knowing what I know:

248
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:05,973
that those breakups, while tragic,

249
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,391
probably saved you

250
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,478
from a crappy
and very expensive first marriage.

251
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,189
Did you break me and Robin up?

252
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,456
You don't want the truth
because deep down,

253
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:16,484
you want me out there
watching out for you.

254
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:19,563
And deep down,
you know that none of those women

255
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,563
were ever gonna be
the mother of your children.

256
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,242
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- I did what I had to do.

257
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,744
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- You're damn right I did!

258
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,003
Your grandpa Olaf was a wise man.

259
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:43,594
- You broke me and Robin up?
- No, it's not...

260
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,029
I cannot believe this.
I need another drink.

261
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:48,100
I feel a little breeze down there.

262
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,289
- It's nice.
- You think that's something?

263
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:51,993
Stand over this heating vent.

264
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,832
It's like your junk
is on a tropical island.

265
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:58,734
Little Barney says "Mahalo".

266
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,779
Seriously, what is wrong
with you, Lily?

267
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,283
- How could you do that?
- I did this because I care about you!

268
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,369
I am so glad
that is the one you watched!

269
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,204
Dear God, what happened to you?

270
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,789
- You didn't watch my show?
- The show.

271
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:16,914
Sorry.

272
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:18,797
Something special happen?

273
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,424
Same old, same old.

274
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,177
Lily just told us
that she broke you and me up.

275
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,176
What? Broke-broke us up?

276
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:30,725
What does that even mean? And why
are these guys wearing nightgowns?

277
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,108
- Nightshirts.
- It's called a nightshirt, Robin.

278
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,808
Turns out Lily has taken it
upon herself to sabotage

279
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,774
many of my relationships,
including ours.

280
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,317
Robin was different.

281
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,608
I didn't want you two to break up,

282
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:44,336
but you wanted completely
different things out of life

283
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:45,991
and refused to deal with it.

284
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,660
I could just picture
that front porch.

285
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:50,662
Two of hearts.

286
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,287
Just like the hearts of
the two children I never had

287
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,031
because my lovely wife hates kids.

288
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,690
A deuce.

289
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:00,785
Exactly what my career dropped

290
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,924
once I decided to settle down
and marry Ted.

291
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:05,218
Bridge!

292
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:06,470
I win.

293
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:11,056
I do not like that scenario one bit.

294
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:14,852
All I tried to do was get you guys
to talk about your issues.

295
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:17,219
I didn't know
I was feeding you the words

296
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,227
that would lead to your breakup.

297
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:22,359
Here's a fun question, just for fun.

298
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:24,862
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

299
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:27,097
You know what's fun?

300
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:28,408
Fun questions.

301
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,035
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

302
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,496
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

303
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,444
Where do you see yourself?

304
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,668
Not to put words in your mouth,
but you probably want to be married.

305
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:41,713
I probably want to be married.

306
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,882
You probably want to be
in Tokyo or Paris.

307
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,177
I probably want to be in Argentina.

308
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,346
Argentina?

309
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,138
Or Tokyo or Paris.

310
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:54,433
We have an expiration date,
don't we?

311
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:56,175
Oh, my God.

312
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,112
You can't manipulate people
like that!

313
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01,298
I've known you 12 years,
and I can honestly say,

314
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:03,192
I have never been
more furious at you!

315
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:06,112
- Look, I didn't mean to...
- I don't even want to hear it!

316
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:09,359
Settle down!
Let's just settle down!

317
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:11,101
Now, I have one question.

318
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,285
What do these bad boys
feel like in bed?

319
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,932
Come on. Let's go see.

320
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,083
So, if it weren't for you,
Ted and I might still be dating?

321
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:22,087
Or you would have
stayed together far too long,

322
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:24,922
had an incredibly bitter breakup

323
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,851
and not even remained friends,

324
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,677
and then you and I would
never have become best friends.

325
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,419
Don't even say that.

326
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,006
Stop hugging!

327
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:38,102
You had no right
to interfere in my relationships.

328
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:40,736
You got lucky.
Okay? You met the love of your life

329
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:42,690
in a dorm hallway when you were 18.

330
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,877
But that doesn't give you the right
to play God

331
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,820
to the rest of us mortals down here
who are still looking for someone.

332
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,653
You're so concerned about who you
and Marshall are gonna end up

333
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:53,202
on that front porch with.
You know what?

334
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,326
You can have it to yourselves.

335
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:04,705
- What happened to your jacket?
- Oh, soot, bread crumbs, placenta.

336
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:07,631
Did you at least TiVo it?

337
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:12,092
So you're this comfy every night,

338
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,114
and Lily still has sex with you?

339
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,592
That's what marriage is all about,
man, unconditional love.

340
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:20,443
You can wear whatever you want
and still get laid.

341
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:22,980
Tell me more about being married.

342
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,882
Sometimes, when you're married,

343
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:29,320
you wake up to the smell
of breakfast already on the table.

344
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,646
- And coffee, too?
- And coffee, too.

345
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:34,902
Sometimes, she'll
even put out a vase

346
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,827
of freshly cut flowers.

347
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,580
I love flowers.

348
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,100
And sometimes,

349
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:43,581
when you're worried you've made
all the wrong decisions in life

350
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:45,839
and you're not nearly
the man you want to be,

351
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,431
what does she do then?

352
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:50,220
She tells you that you're great

353
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:52,051
and it's all gonna be okay.

354
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:53,623
That's wonderful.

355
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:58,182
And she'll help you find
other girls to have sex with?

356
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:03,212
I mean, I guess.

357
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:06,049
Maybe if you agreed upon
that beforehand, yeah.

358
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,785
Little guy had a big day.

359
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,946
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

360
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,795
Sweet dreams, slugger.

361
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:31,836
<i>The next night,
I was still angry at your aunt Lily.</i>

362
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:32,961
<i>Until...</i>

363
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:36,782
What are you...?

364
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:41,433
Lily came by
and explained everything.

365
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,186
And she gave me this note for you.

366
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,442
<i>"Ted, I'm sorry.</i>

367
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,211
<i>"It doesn't matter to me
who you marry.</i>

368
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:56,710
<i>"I know they'll be awesome
because they'll think you are.</i>

369
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,675
<i>"To show I mean it, I put
together a little surprise</i>

370
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,482
<i>"for you and Karen upstairs.</i>

371
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:02,872
<i>"Love, Lily."</i>

372
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,833
<i>"P.S. Sorry the envelope
was already open.</i>

373
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,710
<i>"I had to read what she wrote.</i>

374
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:08,835
<i>"Marshall."</i>

375
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:11,214
Sabotaging our relationship?

376
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,960
I got to say, even using the
specially-ordered extra-low bar

377
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,709
by which I judge your friends,

378
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,512
Lily really outdid herself
this time.

379
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,848
Obviously,
we can't ever see her again.

380
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:23,809
I know.
It's a big loss, right?

381
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,893
Remember your old college roommate?

382
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:34,695
He was married
to that shrill little idiot girl.

383
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:39,116
It's been so long.

384
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,682
God, I hated him.

385
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:43,268
Anyway, here's his obituary.

386
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:47,042
I realized,
maybe it shouldn't matter

387
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,168
what my friends think
of my girlfriend,

388
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,838
but it sure as hell matters
what my girlfriend thinks of my friends.

389
00:18:54,728 --> 00:18:56,521
- So you ended it?
- Yeah.

390
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:00,393
So if you want to be my plus one,

391
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:02,080
Lily's a damn good cook.

392
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,850
Beef pot pie, mac and cheese,

393
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:07,768
homemade buttermilk biscuits.

394
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,981
No wonder Marshall dies at 68.

395
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:13,692
Thank you.

396
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:16,643
<i>So, Robin and I enjoyed
a gourmet dinner.</i>

397
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,517
<i>For her it was breakfast.</i>

398
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:21,920
<i>And we ended up doing exactly
what Lily wanted us to do all along:</i>

399
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,225
<i>we talked about our relationship.</i>

400
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:28,373
So, Lily broke us up, sort of.

401
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,170
Kind of makes you wonder.

402
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:35,703
I mean, if it weren't for her,

403
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:37,925
would we still be dating right now?

404
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:39,260
Maybe.

405
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,472
But Lily was right.

406
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,892
We weren't ready. We both need
to move on, do our own thing.

407
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,643
Still do, I guess.

408
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:54,114
We should make a pact.

409
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:57,578
If the years go by,
and we both turn 40,

410
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:58,947
and we're still single...

411
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:10,083
Will you be my backup wife?

412
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,831
A girl always dreams
of hearing those words.

413
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,626
A million times, yes!

414
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,557
All right, it's a deal.

415
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,949
So, should we set up
some ground rules for this?

416
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:31,513
- Like what?
- I don't know.

417
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:33,916
Like neither one of us
can get super fat. Stuff like that.

418
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,133
Okay, I only have one:
you can't wear a nightshirt.

419
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:38,110
I will never wear a nightshirt.

420
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:57,589
Never mind.
