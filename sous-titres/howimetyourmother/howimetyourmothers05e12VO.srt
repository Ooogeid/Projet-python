1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,378
<i>Kids, you never know when you're about
to meet someone really important.</i>

2
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:06,714
<i>It's not like life gives you
a warning.</i>

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,607
<i>You just look up and there they are.</i>

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,595
Come on, we're going to
go get trashed on the roof.

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:13,888
<i>No, not that dude.</i>

6
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:15,835
<i>Her.</i>

7
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,992
I'm good, Boomer.

8
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,686
My name's not Boomer.

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,254
In my head, it is.

10
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:25,887
Gentlemen, I'm a faculty member,
and you're underage,

11
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:28,212
so it's my duty to confiscate this

12
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,125
and this and...

13
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:31,781
hard lemonade?

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,158
You know what?
You can keep that.

15
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:38,704
I swear, every week I get asked
by some frat guy to a kegger, and I say,

16
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:41,724
"I'm a PhD candidate writing
a dissertation entitled

17
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:44,145
'Foreign Direct Investment
and Intergenerational Linkages

18
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,908
in Consumption Behavior.'"

19
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:47,713
And what does Frat Guy say to that?

20
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,173
"That's hot."

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,384
Actually, that is kind of hot.

22
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,012
Ted, I have a confession.

23
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,014
I recognize you.

24
00:00:57,645 --> 00:00:59,910
Do you rember the first day
of classes last semester?

25
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:01,386
Econ 305?

26
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:04,855
<i>Kids, you remember
the wrong classroom story.</i>

27
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:08,609
<i>I thought I was in Architecture 101,
but it was Econ 305.</i>

28
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,779
<i>Of course, what I didn't know was</i>

29
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,863
<i>that your mother was
somewhere in that class,</i>

30
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:15,374
<i>and she thought
I was a complete idiot.</i>

31
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,845
I thought you were a complete idiot.

32
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,970
But a very cute idiot.

33
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:23,599
So...

34
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:26,210
do you ever date cute idiots?

35
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:27,920
Almost exclusively.

36
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,034
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

37
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,184
.:: La Fabrique ::.

38
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,853
She's a PhD candidate,

39
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,700
she reads philosophy for fun,

40
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:49,692
she does the Sunday crossword
every week and finishes it.

41
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,654
Ted, I am so happy for you...
Sorry,

42
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,922
not for you, happy I'm not you.

43
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:59,243
Long story short:
I have a date tonight.

44
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,375
Thanks, New York,
I'll try not to screw it up.

45
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,028
What's going on?
There's a huge line outside MacLaren's.

46
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:13,591
And why is it almost entirely dudes?

47
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,136
Only two things could cause
that kind of commotion.

48
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:18,345
Boobs.

49
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,994
<i>She's my cherry pie...</i>

50
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:22,808
Ladies and gentlemen,

51
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,771
MacLaren's has hired
a hot bartender.

52
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,939
<i>Sweet cherry pie, yeah.</i>

53
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,702
Look at all these guys.

54
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,488
The sidewalk's going to smell
like pee-pee now.

55
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:38,828
Well, we'd better start
looking for a new bar.

56
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:40,701
What, are you crazy?

57
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:43,255
It is a hot bartender.

58
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,944
Do you know how long
I have been waiting to land a...

59
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,461
My friends, I have been
with many women in my day.

60
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,711
Lawyers, teachers, poets, doctors,

61
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:59,592
professional equestrians,
amateur equestrians...

62
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:03,140
A butcher, a baker,
a candlestick maker...

63
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:05,732
Yes, we're
to the rhyming section now...

64
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:09,762
a math professor, a tax assessor,
a weight guesser...

65
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,682
A puppeteer, a blackjack dealer,

66
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:15,557
a stay-at-home mom...
that's a job, too, guys...

67
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,447
- a circuit court judge...
- Get to the point!

68
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,839
I have never, ever

69
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:23,572
scored a hot bartender

70
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,538
until tonight.

71
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:27,331
She's really not that hot.

72
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,774
Is someone jealous
of all the attention?

73
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,569
Did somebody fancy herself
the hottest girl in the bar?

74
00:03:33,694 --> 00:03:36,487
Gosh, no. Shut up!

75
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:40,425
- Wish me luck.
- It's never going to happen.

76
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,612
Barney, she's just going
to pretend to like you

77
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:45,015
the same way she hypnotized
all these geniuses.

78
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,309
But guess who's not going
to fall under her spell?

79
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,305
I'm gonna be all,
"Drop the act, baby doll.

80
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,953
Daddy needs a gin and tonic."

81
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:54,233
Then when she brings it, I'm gonna just
spit it out and say, "Try again."

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,380
Boom! Alpha dog is
right where he belongs:

83
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,310
on top, then after a few minutes,
on the bottom.

84
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:02,285
Why should I do all the work?

85
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:05,244
What's happening?

86
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,507
New superhot bartender.

87
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:14,545
See? Marshall doesn't think
she's hot either.

88
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:15,671
He does.

89
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,367
Baby, you don't have to pretend

90
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:19,996
other women aren't attractive
just for my sake.

91
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,680
I know, and if that woman
were anywhere near as hot

92
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,721
as the woman I'm married
to, then I'd admit it, but she's not.

93
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,010
Baby, you're so sweet,
but compared to that woman,

94
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,271
I am a big bag
three days old garbage.

95
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,500
Well, I call 'em like
I see 'em, and...

96
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,938
I just think you're the most
beautiful woman in the world.

97
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,162
See, that's just annoying.

98
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,575
Oh, my God, you are so funny.

99
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,495
- That'll be $6.75.
- Here's a 50, keep the change.

100
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:50,080
Thank you.

101
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:51,696
Amateurs.

102
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,759
- What do you want?
- Drop the act, baby doll...

103
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:56,884
wait, what?

104
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,448
Are you gonna order a drink or are you
just gonna stand there looking stupid?

105
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,527
I don't know how to make an um.
Is that equal parts vodka

106
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,496
and get-the-hell-out-of-my-face?

107
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,835
Bobbie, what's going on?

108
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,228
Later that night, I embarked
upon a very important first date.

109
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,590
- How are you?
- Good.

110
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,868
<i>It's funny,
sometimes you walk into a place</i>

111
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:20,110
<i>you've never been before,
but you get the feeling</i>

112
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,548
<i>you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.</i>

113
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,604
<i>And kids, that's the first time I ever
saw your mother's little yellow bus.</i>

114
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:29,870
<i>You know the one.</i>

115
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,762
<i>It's right behind you.</i>

116
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,230
This is cute.

117
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,755
Actually, it's my roommate's.

118
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:46,303
<i>So, there I was, kids, standing
in your mother's apartment,</i>

119
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:49,473
<i>Never mind the fact that I was
on a date with her roommate Cindy.</i>

120
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,641
Sorry,

121
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:53,102
I shouldn't be messing
with your roommate's stuff.

122
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,258
What's she like?

123
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:57,285
<i>I didn't know it,
but I was about to hear</i>

124
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,442
<i>the very first description
of the woman I'd one day marry.</i>

125
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,939
She's a whore.

126
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,155
I think she's a dominatrix.
What?

127
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:08,492
Okay, I'm sorry,
none of that is true.

128
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,912
- I have a bit of a roommate complex.
- Why?

129
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,748
Guys are always falling
in love with her.

130
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:16,917
Look at me.

131
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:18,743
I promise you

132
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,823
I am not going to fall
in love with your roommate.

133
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:22,948
<i>Oops.</i>

134
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:27,204
Okay, now that you've had
a closer look, admit it:

135
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:30,097
That bartender is
the hottest woman in this bar.

136
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,515
Second hottest.

137
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:34,114
I repeat...

138
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,690
Baby, how could you
not want to hit that?

139
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,067
Iwant to hit that.

140
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,248
If you don't want to hit that,
I'm sorry, but you might be gay.

141
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:45,348
Hell, yeah, I'm gay.

142
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:46,675
Gay for you.

143
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,963
Whatever.
Did you find out why

144
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:52,369
I'm the one guy in this
entire bar she seems to despise?

145
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,287
I did...

146
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,998
You're not going to like the answer.

147
00:06:56,474 --> 00:07:00,461
My last three boyfriends were
Wall Street guys... bastards,

148
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,981
so I vowed never again to date
a guy who wears suits.

149
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:07,829
Okay, well, that's easy.

150
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:09,636
All I have to do is
stop wearing suits.

151
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,990
That's all?

152
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:13,223
Come on, you're never not in a suit.

153
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,852
True...

154
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:21,315
but for those... I mean, for that...
I mean, for her...

155
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,172
I will stop wearing...

156
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,045
- wait for it...
- We know you're going to say "suits."

157
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:30,657
... suits.

158
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:34,497
<i>Meanwhile, Cindy and I
were having a lovely evening,</i>

159
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,872
<i>except she wasn't kidding
about her roommate complex.</i>

160
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,083
And another weird thing
about my roommate:

161
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,336
She does these bizarre paintings
of robots playing sports.

162
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,080
That is weird.

163
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,319
<i>I was lying.
That sounded awesome.</i>

164
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:49,282
<i>Your mother's
Robot Volleyball watercolor</i>

165
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:51,470
<i>is hanging up
in the den as we speak.</i>

166
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,510
And she has this crazy habit

167
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:55,891
of making breakfast food
sing show tunes.

168
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:57,625
That's just bizarre.

169
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,541
<i>Your mother's rendition
of "Memories"</i>

170
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,953
<i>as performed by an
English muffin is, to this day,</i>

171
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:04,641
<i>the most hauntingly beautiful
thing I've ever heard.</i>

172
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,353
Look, I'm sold.

173
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,279
I hate this girl.

174
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:10,716
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,617
Look, she's not that bad.
I just get a little jealous.

176
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,349
I don't know why.

177
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:16,662
You're awesome.

178
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:19,528
<i>But not as awesome as your mother.</i>

179
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:21,941
<i>And speaking of things
that are less awesome,</i>

180
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,586
<i>your Uncle Barney
had officially suited down.</i>

181
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,714
I am so sorry, I misjudged you.

182
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,066
If there is one type of person
that I cannot stand,

183
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,594
it is a man in a suits.

184
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:36,294
That and a woman
who has no respect for herself.

185
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,140
Suits and insecure women.
I hate 'em.

186
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,314
Just hate 'em.

187
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,122
How was your date with Cindy?

188
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:52,197
Well, last night was
great, today not so much.

189
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,448
What, why?

190
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:55,857
I found out the school's policy

191
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,927
about students and professors
dating is really strict.

192
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:00,581
I could lose my scholarship.

193
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:03,298
Yeah, but it's not
like you're in my class.

194
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:05,210
We're not even
in the same department.

195
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:07,713
I'm sorry, but I just can't risk it.

196
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,359
She's completely
overreacting, right?

197
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,435
Actually, Ted, she has a point.

198
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,893
Yeah, and think about it.
If the rules are that strict,

199
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:18,531
you could be putting
your job in jeopardy.

200
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:21,310
I think, I think you got
to let this one go, buddy.

201
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:24,800
Let's try this again:
she's completely overreacting, right?

202
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,862
<i>Of course, they were right.
I had to let it go,</i>

203
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,625
<i>but as your Uncle Barney
was about to find out,</i>

204
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,271
<i>it's not so easy to let things go.</i>

205
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,386
<i>Suit up.</i>

206
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:50,911
<i>Now, none of us had ever seen Barney
go this long without suiting up,</i>

207
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,886
<i>and kids, it wasn't pretty.</i>

208
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,220
So sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.

209
00:09:56,647 --> 00:10:00,090
You know, today I had that presentation
on offshore dividend tax implications?

210
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:03,477
Sure, I was totally paying attention
when you talked about that.

211
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:06,023
Right,
so I fire up the PowerPoint...

212
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,507
<i>Suit up.</i>

213
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,692
We're going to order some food.

214
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,026
Okay, be out in a sec.

215
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,079
Out of the way!

216
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,500
Stay with me.
It's not your time.

217
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,673
<i>If anyone could fix something like this,
it was Barney's personal tailor,</i>

218
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,430
<i>TV's Tim Gunn.</i>

219
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:14,364
I'm sorry, Barney.

220
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:16,189
I couldn't make it work.

221
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:19,674
So young.

222
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,015
There's nothing else you could do?

223
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:27,894
But there is another suit
that can use the buttons from your suit.

224
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,279
That can...

225
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,175
Like an organ donor?

226
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,451
Your suit's death
could mean another suit's life.

227
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,015
But I...

228
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:40,741
Do it.

229
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,710
You're doing the right thing.

230
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,332
Please don't cry on this.

231
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,125
- It's silk.
- I'm sorry.

232
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:51,688
I know.

233
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,250
We cremated the remains.

234
00:11:58,173 --> 00:11:59,646
His buttons saved the life

235
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,970
of a sick little jacket
on the Upper East Side.

236
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:06,269
Well, at least now
you can finally drop this quest

237
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,268
for the so-called Hot Bartender.

238
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:13,400
My suit gave its life
for this cause,

239
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,363
and I will not rest until those...

240
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,454
I mean, that...
I mean,

241
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:21,238
is mine.

242
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:27,537
He's absolutely right.

243
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,166
Who, the guy kissing a jar
full of dead suit ashes, that guy?

244
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,340
What if Cindy is the woman I'm supposed
to marry, and I'm just giving up?

245
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,881
So long, elegant,
yet welcoming home in Westchester

246
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:41,048
with a sensible mortgage I can handle
without dipping into my savings.

247
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:44,002
Bye-bye, two kids I raised with a stern,
yet loving hand,

248
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,777
finding the perfect balance
between father and friend.

249
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:50,143
Adios, triplet schnauzers,
Frank, Lloyd and Wright.

250
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,462
The point is,

251
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,439
I'm not giving up, either!

252
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,153
I don't know why I just did that.

253
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:05,158
Barney,
I'm so sorry about your friend.

254
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,465
Tell me about him.

255
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:09,236
He was Italian.

256
00:13:10,298 --> 00:13:11,793
Classy, elegant.

257
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,674
And boy,
did he have a way with the ladies.

258
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,300
They just couldn't say no.

259
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,171
- How old was he?
- Seven.

260
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,207
I miss him so much!

261
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:24,386
You shouldn't be alone tonight.

262
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,658
I'm gonna end my shift early.

263
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:30,642
Thank you, old friend.

264
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,584
You're going out with a bang.

265
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,236
Come on, Marshall.
Just admit that she's hotter than me.

266
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:39,661
I won't be hurt.

267
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:40,923
Can't do it.

268
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:43,424
- You're hotter.
- She's a goddess!

269
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:44,923
Her skin glows.

270
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:46,922
Her legs go for miles.

271
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:48,197
And that ass?

272
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,561
I would wear that thing for a hat.

273
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,615
Last night in bed, I'll admit it,

274
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,986
she popped into my head
a couple of times.

275
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,481
What are you try...

276
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,526
Like,
you think she's hotter than me?

277
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:02,883
I never said that.

278
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,049
- You do.
- It's apples and oranges.

279
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:07,987
She's younger than you.

280
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:09,809
I'm just saying, like,

281
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,925
me in my prime
versus her in her prime.

282
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,522
You guys,
her hotness isn't even real!

283
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:20,536
It's circumstantial hotness.

284
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:21,693
Watch.

285
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:37,696
II suppose you think
she's hotter than me, too.

286
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,800
What the hell are you doing?

287
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,510
You're not allowed back here.

288
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,639
Carl, look, I don't want to go back.

289
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,301
Please, don't make me go back.

290
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,626
You got to go.

291
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:58,230
I was somebody back there!

292
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:00,899
Everybody loved me.

293
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:13,078
Can we talk?

294
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:16,164
My roommate's about to get out
of the shower. Let's talk in my room.

295
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,220
Cindy, I know the University Rulebook
says we can't date.

296
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,765
But it also says, "Don't teach drunk,"
and I do that all the time.

297
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:35,214
The point is,

298
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,518
I like you.

299
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,025
I do.
You're sweet, you're funny.

300
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,788
You're writing a dissertation,

301
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:43,321
Foreign Direct Investment
and Intergenerational Linkages

302
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:45,986
and Consumption Behavior.
I mean, that is hot.

303
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,255
I know this sounds crazy, but...

304
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:53,235
I feel like our paths
are supposed to cross somehow.

305
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,955
I don't want
to miss out on knowing you.

306
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,784
I don't want
to miss out on knowing you, either.

307
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:03,589
I got to tell you,

308
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:07,941
Just from looking around your room,
I can tell we have a ton in common.

309
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,217
Really?

310
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,377
The Unicorns?

311
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,611
Who Will Cut Our Hair
When We're Gone?

312
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,486
I have never met anyone else
who has this album.

313
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,851
That's my roommate's.
I borrowed it.

314
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,106
What about this?
World's End by T.C. Boyle?

315
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,481
That was a birthday gift...
from my roommate.

316
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:27,027
Haven't checked it out yet.

317
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:30,093
You should.
It's a good read.

318
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,033
What about this?
It's ridiculous.

319
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,236
You play bass?
Seriously, ask my friends.

320
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,538
I always say, my ideal woman...

321
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,299
does not play bass,
because this is clearly your roommate's.

322
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,002
She's in a band.

323
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,339
Damn, that's cool.

324
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,672
This is unbelievable.

325
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:52,304
You picked out the only three things
in here that are my roommate's.

326
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:56,056
- Does your roommate's band...
- Get out.

327
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,393
<i>Kids, as you probably guessed,</i>

328
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,687
<i>that wasn't the night
I met your mother.</i>

329
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:07,275
<i>Although I think
I glimpsed her foot.</i>

330
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:12,531
<i>But I did get a little bit closer
to meeting the woman of my dreams.</i>

331
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:14,387
And your mom...

332
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,749
<i>well, she got
her yellow umbrella back.</i>

333
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,475
It was just so special,

334
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,318
you know?

335
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,417
I feel like we should give him
a moment of silence.

336
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:27,236
Followed by, like,
20 minutes of grunting.

337
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,609
I'm gonna make you feel all better.

338
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,008
- Let me just go freshen up.
- All right.

339
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:38,264
Wait, that's not the bathroom!

340
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:41,547
Are these yours?

341
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:45,059
I'm suit-sitting for someone.

342
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:47,440
Barney, you lied to me.

343
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,412
You have to choose right now.

344
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:53,780
Me... or the suits.

345
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:02,848
<i>You're thinkin', "What's Barney
been drinkin'?" That girl's smokin' hot!</i>

346
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,012
<i>I coulda nailed her, but it's not
a failure. There's one thing she is not</i>

347
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:09,344
<i>To score a ten would be just fine,</i>

348
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:11,969
<i>but I'd rather be dressed
to the nines!</i>

349
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,510
<i>It's a truth you can't refute...</i>

350
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,551
<i>Nothin' suits me like a suit!</i>

351
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,645
<i>Picture a world Where all the boys
and girls are impeccably well-dressed!</i>

352
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,524
<i>That delivery guy in a jacket and tie.
That puppy in a double breast!</i>

353
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,549
<i>That eighties dude with muttonchops!</i>

354
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,612
<i>That baby with a lollipop!</i>

355
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:37,859
<i>That lady cop who's kinda cute!</i>

356
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,538
<i>Nothing suits them like a suit!</i>

357
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,859
<i>A wingman I can wear!</i>

358
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:47,858
<i>They're so debonair!</i>

359
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:51,713
<i>The perfect way to snare a girl
with daddy issues!</i>

360
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:53,706
<i>In navy blue or black!</i>

361
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,009
<i>Check out this perfect rack</i>

362
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,197
<i>I want to give them a squeeze!</i>

363
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:00,372
<i>Really!</i>

364
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,989
<i>Then answer these questions,</i>

365
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:05,927
<i>If you please.</i>

366
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,695
<i>What would you do if you had to choose
between your suits and a pot of gold?</i>

367
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,546
<i>What would you say if you gave
your suits and you'd never grow old?</i>

368
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,476
<i>What would you pick: one million chicks,
or a single three-piece suit?</i>

369
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:24,454
It's moot.

370
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,281
<i>What if peace
were within your reach?</i>

371
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:28,666
I'm gonna stop you right there.
It's suits.

372
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,627
Come on,
get your head out of your ass.

373
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,260
<i>Two, three, four!</i>

374
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,005
<i>Girls will go and girls will come,</i>

375
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,733
<i>but there's only one absolute!</i>

376
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,922
<i>Every bro on the go needs to know</i>

377
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,826
<i>that there's no accepted substitute!</i>

378
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,507
<i>I'm sorry, suits, let's make amends,</i>

379
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:51,859
<i>my Sunday best are my best friends!</i>

380
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,885
<i>Send Casual Friday down</i>

381
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,863
<i>the laundry chute...</i>

382
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,178
<i>'Cause nothing suits</i>

383
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,722
<i>the undisputed!</i>

384
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:10,814
<i>Oft-saluted suitor of repute...</i>

385
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:22,662
Wait for it.

386
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:46,619
Then again, she is pretty hot.

387
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:48,246
I choose you, baby.

388
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:51,471
First thing tomorrow,
I'm getting rid of these suits.

389
00:20:52,355 --> 00:20:53,084
Really?

390
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:01,435
You guys are fine.
