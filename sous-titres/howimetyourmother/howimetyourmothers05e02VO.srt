1
00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:02,752
<i>This is the story
of two blind dates.</i>

2
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:04,571
<i>One in 2009...</i>

3
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:09,427
<i>And one seven years earlier.</i>

4
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:13,905
<i>In all that time, my dating routine
remained more or less the same...</i>

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,528
<i>... until the fall of 2009,</i>

6
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,896
<i>when I finally had a date
that was different.</i>

7
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:25,399
<i>Because it was exactly the same.</i>

8
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,318
<i>I was on a blind date
with the same woman</i>

9
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:30,729
<i>I went on a blind date with
seven years earlier.</i>

10
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:34,166
It's nice to meet you.

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,577
<i>And she didn't remember it.
But then again...</i>

12
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:38,395
It's nice to meet you, too.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,720
<i>Neither did i.</i>

14
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:41,332
Do you want...

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,833
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,261
.:: La Fabrique ::.

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,430
Guess who just got four tickets

18
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,433
to the "Origins of Chewbacca"
Star Wars exhibit?

19
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,936
- Why?
- No, I said, "guess who?"

20
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,004
I heard you.

21
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,475
Yeah, isn't it a little
early in our relationship

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,733
to do something that
would end our relationship?

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,294
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:11,356
It can be our first
double date as couples!

25
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:14,949
It sounds awesome! Is the original
Chewbacca going to be there?

26
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,867
Peter Mayhew, in the fur.

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,530
Who's with me?

28
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,864
Do you think they'll have Wookiee
to English dictionaries there?

29
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,625
I mean, even just an everyday
phrase book would be helpful.

30
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:28,420
We're not going to
the "Origins of Chewbacca"exhibit.

31
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:31,632
It's in Houston this year.
Everyone knows that.

32
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:34,468
I just wanted to get
rid of the girls.

33
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,886
Where are you taking me?

34
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:39,306
<i>This wasn't the first time your uncle
Barney had kidnapped one of us.</i>

35
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:41,243
Wait a second.

36
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,907
The "Origins of Chewbacca"
exhibit's in Montreal this year.

37
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,532
Everyone knows that.

38
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,482
Where are you taking me?

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,344
My guy in the da's office scored us

40
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:52,736
front row seats
to a lethal injection.

41
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:55,033
We're still stopping
for chili dogs first.

42
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,031
Stop the cab.

43
00:01:56,753 --> 00:01:58,534
Where are you taking me?

44
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:04,790
Why are we here?

45
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,193
Marshall, now that
Robin and I are together,

46
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:10,337
I've learned a lot about relationships
by watching you and Lily.

47
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,032
- Thanks, man.
- You're a terrible couple.

48
00:02:13,157 --> 00:02:14,948
Lily has taken
all the man out of you.

49
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:17,013
I used to think that's just
every relationship.

50
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,111
What I've got with Robin
proves that you can

51
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:22,222
have a girlfriend and fully
functioning male genitalia

52
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:23,897
all at the same time.

53
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:26,608
Right. So, if Robin knew
that you were here,

54
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,355
she'ld be completely fine with it?

55
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,610
Are you kidding?

56
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:31,920
She'd sprint down here
with a purse full of singles

57
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:34,545
and a poncho
for the 10:30 jell-o show.

58
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:37,032
Bt-dub, I called ahead...
It's lime.

59
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,524
<i>Meanwhile, Jen and I were
in my favorite first date restaurant...</i>

60
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,029
<i>For the second time.</i>

61
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:44,163
What do you do?

62
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,665
I'm between jobs...
Banking cris.

63
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:50,252
I'm between jobs...
Internet bubble burst.

64
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:53,729
Makes me realize I should go
into something more stable...

65
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:55,004
Like banking.

66
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:58,051
- So what about you?
- I'm an architect.

67
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:01,033
Hopefully, one day,
I can use my own humble brush

68
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:04,054
on the masterpiece that is
Manhattan's skyline.

69
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,185
I teach architecture.

70
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:10,451
Get 50% off at the bookstore,
so that's pretty sweet.

71
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,693
Married!

72
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,024
What is wrong with you?

73
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,783
You're just looking.

74
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,927
It's like fantasizing
about other women.

75
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:22,075
It's harmless.

76
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,031
Wait.

77
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,663
Don't tell me you don't fantasize
about other women.

78
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,373
I do!

79
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,293
It's just not that easy.

80
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,461
False.

81
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:35,328
I once fantasized about
that silhouette chick

82
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,453
you see on a truck's mudflaps.

83
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:39,328
Took me less than a mile.

84
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,616
Not everyone is you, OK?

85
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,972
Even when I do start to have
a dirty thought like that...

86
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:47,267
It seems so much like cheating
on Lily that I feel guilty.

87
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,723
So first, I need to have
a different fantasy.

88
00:03:58,795 --> 00:03:59,613
Bad news.

89
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:02,269
Lily has a rare and fatal
hiccup disorder

90
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:04,076
that's apparently
medically legitimate.

91
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:06,121
What?! How could this be?!

92
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,979
Beats me, but it says it right here

93
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:10,080
on this doctor clipboard
that doctors have.

94
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,521
It's time, baby.

95
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,832
I will never love again.

96
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,091
No, Marshall, you must.

97
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:33,316
And after
an appropriate number of years,

98
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:35,107
you should find someone else.

99
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:38,819
Someone like that busty delivery girl
from that one time.

100
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:42,799
And... plow her like a cornfield.

101
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,286
And so, Marshall, to honor Lily,

102
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,206
you must find that busty
delivery girl from that one time

103
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:54,876
and plow her like a cornfield.

104
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,182
Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.

105
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:17,997
This one's for you, Lil.

106
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:20,527
Where do I sign?

107
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:27,784
And then watch out,
because it is on!

108
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:32,205
That is the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

109
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,041
Dude, Lily gets you in real life.

110
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,250
- She has no business in your fantasies.
- It's all I know, OK?

111
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,756
- I can't help it.
- I accept your invitation.

112
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:45,427
From this day forward, I will be
the wingman of your mind.

113
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:49,450
Now, focus on the next dancer.
Put Lily completely out of your mind.

114
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,811
<i>Hello men, say hello to...</i>

115
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,351
<i>Jasmine.</i>

116
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:05,655
Is it just me or does that
stripper look exactly like...?

117
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,158
Ted, we found a stripper
who looks exactly like Lily!

118
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,229
- I can't talk right now.
- I'm speechless, too.

119
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,455
Everything's as perky
as we've always imagined!

120
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,831
Stop looking at her.

121
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,417
I got to go.
Take a picture.

122
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,206
I will. But first, I'm going
to make Marshall

123
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,256
watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant
between his wife's Tatas.

124
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,229
I'll kill you!

125
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:30,180
- Sorry about that.
- So, any thoughts on food?

126
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,851
Yeah. You want to share the oysters?

127
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:36,978
I would love to share the oysters.

128
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,120
Good. 'cause if you didn't...

129
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,495
... that would be mighty shellfish.

130
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:45,487
That's bad.

131
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:47,113
That's why it's funny!

132
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,809
We've been on this date before. 

133
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,917
We've been on this exact
blind date before.

134
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:02,045
In this exact same restaurant.

135
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,590
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
I don't remember that going that well.

136
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:06,937
Me, neither.

137
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,636
I remember thinking
that you were a little snobby.

138
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:11,753
Wait, you...

139
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:14,349
You dress your cats up
in weird costumes.

140
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,185
They're not weird.
See, you're being snobby again.

141
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,061
Oh, my god.
Do you realize what this means?

142
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:21,736
Since our first date,

143
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:23,947
we've done a complete lap

144
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:26,219
of all the single people in New York

145
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:28,655
only to end up back here,
with each other.

146
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:32,742
We're going to die alone, aren't we?

147
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,078
Well, you've got your cats.

148
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,538
This is insane.

149
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:40,124
Wait, I got to ask.
Why did you think I was snobby?

150
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:45,223
Wait... Okay... Yeah, we were
sitting over there...

151
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:50,885
Maine lobster.
They spelled "main" without the "e."

152
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:54,013
Good to know we're not getting
the crappy understudy lobsters, right?

153
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,059
Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half
lobster will be played by...

154
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,102
I get it.

155
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,107
Pointing out spelling errors in a menu
makes you seem kind of snooty.

156
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:07,068
I had no idea.

157
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,413
What about me?
Aside from the cats,

158
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:11,989
how did I come across?

159
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:14,826
That's right... the check.
The check came

160
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,037
and, of course, I was going to pay,

161
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,163
but you didn't do the check dance.

162
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:42,103
Guys want to wave the girl off
and, you know, look like a big shot.

163
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:44,772
I had no idea.

164
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:48,016
This is good. We're learning stuff.
You know what we should do?

165
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,162
We should retrace
the rest of that night

166
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:52,939
and figure out what else
we do wrong on first dates.

167
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:54,993
'Cause let's be honest...

168
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,784
We are scaring people off, Jen.

169
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,743
We really are.

170
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:00,663
Okay, I'm in.

171
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,373
- Great.
- Where'd we go next?

172
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,500
I think we went to Maclaren's.

173
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:12,967
I didn't really talk about
my cats that much, did i?

174
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,627
And then, there's Tabby-Gail Adams,
the jester of the group.

175
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:21,145
Tone down the kitty talk.

176
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,594
Check.

177
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:26,397
You will not believe
who we saw tonight.

178
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,733
We saw the third doppelganger!

179
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:32,004
<i>I should explain.</i>

180
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,102
<i>Over the years we had spotted
two strangers</i>

181
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:36,365
<i>who looked exactly like
members of our group.</i>

182
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:40,761
<i>Lesbian Robin.</i>

183
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,695
<i>And moustache Marshall.</i>

184
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:51,448
<i>By the following summer, we would find
the remaing two doppelgangers.</i>

185
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:52,590
<i>I'll get to that.</i>

186
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,250
Ladies, meet stripper Lily.

187
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,223
Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it.

188
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:02,766
But she looks just like you.

189
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,601
So you went to a strip club?

190
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:06,103
Busted.

191
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,730
And there was a stripper
who looked exactly like me?

192
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,066
Babe, look, before you get mad...

193
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:11,983
Awesome!

194
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,541
I bet the guys were going crazy.

195
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,781
I bet they wanted to touch her so bad.
But all you can do is look,

196
00:10:18,138 --> 00:10:20,742
unless you go into the back room,
but honey, you got to pay.

197
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:22,494
So...

198
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,698
Strip club.

199
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,323
Marshall made me go.

200
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,704
So what did I do wrong next?

201
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,634
Let me have it.
I'm here to learn.

202
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:34,693
I kept dropping hints
that I was cold,

203
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:36,683
but you didn't offer me your jacket.

204
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,562
It's a little brisk out tonight!

205
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:41,145
Not really.

206
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:42,336
Really?

207
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:44,161
I can't feel my fingers.

208
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,603
I'm pretty impervious
to stuff like that.

209
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,103
I couldn't admit I was cold.

210
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:52,518
I didn't want to seem like a wimp
compared to your action hero ex,

211
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:54,405
who you wouldn't stop talking about.

212
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,321
After a day of fighting fires,
Jim would love to come home

213
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,585
and unwind working
on his '68 camaro.

214
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,311
That or bare-knuckle boxing,

215
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:03,196
which he learned
in the marine corps.

216
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:06,232
I had an aunt in the coast guard.

217
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:09,986
So no talking about the ex.

218
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:13,170
Not even about
his shockingly small wiener?

219
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:14,289
See?

220
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:16,614
Why didn't you lead off with that?

221
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:22,232
Was there a shower on stage?
Sometimes there's a shower on stage.

222
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:24,870
I bet stripper me would get
in there with another girl

223
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:26,495
and just go bananas.

224
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:27,685
See?

225
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,360
We got to have
a bros' night at a strip club

226
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,331
and our ladies
are totally cool with it.

227
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:33,636
I'm not cool with it.

228
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,614
Because they understand it's healthy

229
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:38,269
- for us to do that from time to time.
- It's disgusting.

230
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:39,645
Because it's harmless.

231
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,550
Did one of your whores
tell you that?

232
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,252
Marshall shouldn't have to go
to trouble

233
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:46,870
to have an innocent fantasy.

234
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,691
Trouble?
What trouble?

235
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:49,790
It's nothing.

236
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,583
Tell her.
We're all friends here.

237
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,908
No, we're not.

238
00:11:58,202 --> 00:11:59,758
Sometimes I think about other women.

239
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:00,926
It happens.

240
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:03,757
But even when I do, I feel so guilty

241
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:05,832
that I have to imagine you...

242
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,892
passing away first,
because even in a fantasy world,

243
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,977
I could never cheat on you.
You're...

244
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,351
You're just my life, baby.

245
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:14,726
And I love you.

246
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,068
You kill me off?

247
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,243
Fantasize about other girls
all you want,

248
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:23,073
but could you maybe not murder me?

249
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,074
Murder?
No! Baby, no.

250
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:28,133
You develop a chronic illness!
I spare no expense for your care!

251
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:31,601
I even set up a foundation in your name.
We're, like, this close to a cure.

252
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:33,955
Remember?

253
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:36,753
I do remember.

254
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:39,520
We went in here for a drink
with your friends, who I loved...

255
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:41,925
Or hated, depending
if you're still friends with them.

256
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:44,261
- You loved them.
- They're family, Ted.

257
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,363
Let's go in
and see what they remember.

258
00:12:46,488 --> 00:12:48,065
They are my best friends, so...

259
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,322
don't be surprised
if they suddenly "can't think"

260
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:51,869
of anything I do wrong.

261
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,896
Did he juggle? Bad puns?

262
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,601
Expect a standing ovation

263
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,295
for picking up a $19 check?

264
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,524
Let's not forget

265
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,371
the menu typo gold mine.

266
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,395
Keep pannin' that river, buddy.

267
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,553
It is a lot cheaper
than buying a condom.

268
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,320
Actually, you know what it was?

269
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,954
I remember him coming across
as kind of a player.

270
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,289
- Me?
- Ted?

271
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,250
We were all sitting over there...

272
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,048
And here's a picture of my cats
dressed up like Batman villains.

273
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,458
You got the Joker,

274
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,134
the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...

275
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,608
What about Catwoman?

276
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:28,432
That would've been good.

277
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:34,436
Nice.

278
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,022
Wait, no!

279
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,274
I remember that.
I was not checking out a girl.

280
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:48,492
Nice.

281
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,161
We're checking out
moustache Marshall.

282
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,831
Gosh,
I thought you were such a jerk.

283
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,124
I'm so sorry.

284
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:00,087
It's nice to know "past me"
wasn't a total jackass!

285
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,839
"Present you" isn't so bad, either.

286
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:07,692
Thank you very much.

287
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:13,506
I remember this.

288
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:16,961
And there's the Chrysler building.

289
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,486
And the Empire State building.

290
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,435
And at 12:00,

291
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,143
a rotund couple going
at it against the glass.

292
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:27,612
That's kind of sweet.

293
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,740
Look.

294
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:30,717
Snack break.

295
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:33,045
Good for them.

296
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:35,823
Letting a guy eat pizza off your back,
that's love.

297
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:40,392
So...

298
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:44,402
I know this wasn't
the best first date of all time, but...

299
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:46,466
I'm glad we stuck it out.

300
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:47,884
Me too.

301
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,613
That was really great.

302
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:58,103
What went wrong?

303
00:14:58,387 --> 00:14:59,637
I remember now.

304
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,030
So would you maybe...

305
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,067
Want to go out again?

306
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,743
I would.
Will you call me?

307
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:14,953
Absolutely.

308
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,643
Promise?

309
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:17,706
Promise.

310
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:21,892
I have been so...

311
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:23,753
busy.

312
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:25,922
Good night.

313
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:35,967
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:38,018
I know I'm seven years late
with this call,

315
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,478
but I was an idiot back then.

316
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,063
You saw the goatee.

317
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,524
The truth is,
I had a great time tonight,

318
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,317
and I'd love to see you again.

319
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,151
There are two kinds of guys.

320
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:51,330
The guys that you want to call you,
who don't,

321
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:53,867
and the guys you don't want to call you,
who always do.

322
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:56,150
And somehow, right now...

323
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:57,370
you're both.

324
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:03,594
You should be able to fantasize
about another woman

325
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:06,919
without feeling guilty, or,
you know, killing me off.

326
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:08,465
I wish I could,

327
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,534
but I've been doing this
for so long,

328
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:13,094
I'm all confused
about death and sex.

329
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:15,520
Every time I drive past a cemetery,

330
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:16,931
I'm sportin' a partial.

331
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,310
All right, we got to fix this.

332
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:23,655
When stripper Lily gets out here,

333
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,940
you have my permission
to fantasize about her.

334
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,117
And since she's basically me,

335
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,652
maybe you won't feel guilty.

336
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,270
Thanks, baby.
I'm so lucky I have you.

337
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:33,545
And stripper you.

338
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,899
Bring out stripper Lily!

339
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:42,040
I don't come here that much.

340
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,879
Here's the usual
and I'll send over the other one

341
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,760
as soon as she's done stretching.

342
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,494
Thank you, kindly stranger.

343
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:53,698
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

344
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:57,517
<i>Didn't see you come in.
I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy.</i>

345
00:16:58,096 --> 00:17:00,321
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together</i>

346
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:02,132
<i>for Jasmine.</i>

347
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,609
I am hot!

348
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:13,154
Crawl for it, stripper me.

349
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,740
This is awesome.
Baby, can I get another hundred?

350
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:17,078
That was a hundred?

351
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,503
She crawls fast.

352
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:22,665
Look, Jen, I wish I could go back

353
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,956
and talk some sense into 2002 Ted,

354
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,386
but that guy's a lost cause.

355
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:28,636
He's 24.

356
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:31,672
He thinks a facial hair
makes him look like Johnny Depp.

357
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,232
He has no idea what a great girl
he's missing out on.

358
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,223
But I've learned a lot since then.

359
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:39,013
I've learned a lot tonight.

360
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,961
The only thing that we've learned
is that, seven years ago,

361
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,764
it was a mistake for us to go out.

362
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:46,104
I guess it was a mistake for us
to go out tonight.

363
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:47,472
No, it wasn't.

364
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:50,258
I had a great time tonight.
And seven years ago,

365
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,985
if you think about it,
we didn't miss by that much.

366
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,081
If a couple things had gone
a little bit differently...

367
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:58,908
Who knows?

368
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,578
You're the best.

369
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,355
You are the best.

370
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:49,750
My girlfriend is at a strip club with me
and she couldn't care less.

371
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:51,331
I do care, Barney.

372
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,122
We're dating now!
That changes things.

373
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,132
We've to have
a serious talk about this.

374
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:57,770
Just the best.

375
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,422
Girlfriend trouble?
I wish I could help,

376
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:02,754
but my unbelievably cool wife
just bought us

377
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,898
a private dance
with her stripper body double.

378
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,174
So if you need me,

379
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,977
I'll be grinded like some pepper,

380
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:09,442
in the champagne room.

381
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:13,216
Just the best.

382
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,780
Now what?

383
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,866
I just remembered
why I didn't call you.

384
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,034
Why?

385
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,807
I can't believe
I'm gonna screw this up again, but...

386
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:30,013
I like finding typos in menus.

387
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:31,333
What?

388
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:34,451
And I know my shellfish pun is stupid,
but the truth is...

389
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:37,089
I'm not suddenly gonna stop
making stupid jokes.

390
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,613
Now that you mention it...

391
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:42,712
I'm never going to stop
talking about my cats.

392
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:45,197
They're funny, and adorable,

393
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:47,850
and totally worth
having to take six benadryl a day.

394
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,800
Shouldn't we...

395
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,675
hold out for the person who...

396
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,733
doesn't just tolerate
our little quirks,

397
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:57,443
but actually kind of likes them?

398
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:00,065
Even if it means...

399
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,365
finding ourselves on another blind date
with each other, seven years from now?

400
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:06,049
Dear God,
I hope that doesn't happen.

401
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:10,804
Well...

402
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:13,834
Good luck out there, Jen.

403
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,119
You too, Ted.

404
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,841
You'll find your shellfish lady.

405
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:25,448
<i>And kids,</i>

406
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:27,542
<i>when I told your mother
that shellfish joke,</i>

407
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,868
<i>she did laugh.</i>

408
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,803
<i>And I swear,
it was only, like, 30% pity.</i>

409
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:43,030
Looks like Jasmine's having a hard time
getting out of those boots.

410
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,026
What did you say, buddy?

411
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:48,965
Who?

412
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,739
I am this Lily.

413
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,527
We married long time.

414
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,077
May I have monies for shopping?
