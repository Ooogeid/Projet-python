1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:02,945
<i>In the spring of 2009,
I've been hired to design</i>

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,379
<i>a new headquarters
for Goliath National Bank.</i>

3
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:07,713
<i>And I was eager to add
as much of my voice</i>

4
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:10,073
<i>as an architect
into the plans as possible.</i>

5
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:13,878
Woodbeams bathed
in natural light in the atrium.

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:17,308
They're gonna love it!

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,115
<i>There was only one problem</i>

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,129
<i>and his name was Bilson.</i>

9
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,161
Wood?

10
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:23,889
Natural light?

11
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,985
Natural light reminds the workers
that there's an outside world

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,260
where they had family and friends.

13
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:32,907
We want to crush that!

14
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:36,245
You show up in the dark,
you go home in the dark.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,538
You spend your whole damn day
in the dark!

16
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:42,422
I need to hear Lily's voice.

17
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:44,032
Who said you could leave?

18
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,047
<i>Bilson was killing
every original idea I had.</i>

19
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:51,069
<i>Then, one day
GNB took him off the project</i>

20
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:54,058
<i>and created a new task force
to oversee my designs.</i>

21
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:55,513
<i>Suddenly, everything changed.</i>

22
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,516
We'll have a rooftop zen garden
for quiet contemplation.

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,002
We'll have a reflecting pool
in the lobby where...

24
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,479
local children
can come to make wishes.

25
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:05,189
The New GNB,

26
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:06,824
a place of work.

27
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,443
That you can call "home".

28
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,371
Thank you, and...

29
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:14,828
welcome home.

30
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,415
<i>Everything was going great,</i>

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
<i>until one day, in the elevator.</i>

32
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,780
Yeah, it's Ted.

33
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,773
No, no.
I did not approve that change

34
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,226
for the blueprints
for the new GNB headquarters

35
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:41,366
for which I'm the head architect,
at only 30 years old.

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,278
Yes, I'm single,
and I give to charity.

37
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:47,273
What does that have to do
with anything?

38
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,109
All right, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.

39
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,487
You know that was a fake phone call?

40
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,790
Yes, and I also know

41
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,743
that the new GNB headquarters project
was scrapped last month.

42
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:01,151
Nice try.

43
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,647
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

44
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,795
Check out
Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars.

45
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,218
If I could nail any celebrity it would
definitely be Scarlett Johansson.

46
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:25,664
Hot, talented, and nobody does
that many Woody Allen movies

47
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:27,313
without serious daddy issues.

48
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:29,815
If I could nail any celebrity,
it would be Lily.

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,617
She's the star of my heart.

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,870
For me, it would be Hugh Jackman.

51
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,375
You know, I don't know, celebrities,

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,830
they're into some really
weird sex stuff. Trust me.

53
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:42,655
How would you know that?

54
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:45,921
This is embarassing, but I...

55
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:48,727
I went home
with a celebrity one night.

56
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,961
Oh my God! Seriously?

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,319
Yeah, he wanted to do
this really freaky thing with me,

58
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:56,759
so I left. That's it. End of story.

59
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,827
No, no, not end of story

60
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:02,527
I need to know who, what,
when, and in where. Spill it!

61
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:05,639
Lily, please settle down.
You're swallowing to much air.

62
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,622
But before you go any further,

63
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:10,397
I'm flattered, but technically,
I'm not a celebrity.

64
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,643
Plus, for the last time,
I put the mask on as a joke.

65
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:15,903
OK, not you Barney.

66
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:17,505
OK, who is it?

67
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,617
Now you give Lily the hiccups.

68
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,068
OK, I won't tell you
anything specific.

69
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:25,666
But all I'll say

70
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,207
is he is Canadian born,
but you definitely know this guy.

71
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,355
And he got me back to his place

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,128
by offering to show me
a very unique collection.

73
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:34,671
What do you mean collection?

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,219
You know some people collect
like stamps or coins,

75
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,884
it's like that. But I'm not telling.

76
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,045
At least tell us the weird thing
he wanted to do.

77
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,234
I don't know what you call it here,
but we have a name for it in Canada.

78
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,351
Look, I've already said too much.

79
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,255
So, mystery celebrity
who collects a mystery item

80
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,859
asked you to do
a mystery Canadian sex act.

81
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,902
- Yes.
- Tell us!

82
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,445
OK, I'll tell you.

83
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,158
But only if you guess
all three parts correctly.

84
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,703
- That's just impossible.
- Exactly.

85
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,295
I don't even know
any Canadian sex acts.

86
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,991
You got your "Sloppy Dog Sled",

87
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,376
your "Alberta Fur Trapper",
your "Full Mounty".

88
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,919
How do you know all these?

89
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,463
Canadiansexacts.org,
it's bookmarked on the top right.

90
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,458
- Dot org?
- Yeah. It's not for profit.

91
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,635
They really just wanna get
the information out there.

92
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:25,723
So I just had
the weirdest conversation.

93
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,279
This woman at GNB told me

94
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:29,655
that the new bank building
was scrapped last month.

95
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,130
It's crazy, right?

96
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,439
Wait, what's that look?

97
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,030
- Should we tell him?
- Not me.

98
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,212
- We should.
- No.

99
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:38,566
- There was no look.
- Guys! What the hell?

100
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,182
It's time that you know the truth.

101
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,533
A few weeks ago,
Bilson called us into his office.

102
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,745
We're scrapping the plan
for the new GNB headquarters.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,247
This recession is killing us.

104
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,917
We're cutting
anything non-essential.

105
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,384
And I have a lot of tough choices
to make at the

106
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:57,900
bi-quarterly retreat in St. Croix.

107
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,571
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.

108
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,924
Not when he hears it
coming from his best friend.

109
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,304
- I have to tell him?
- I have to tell him?

110
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,291
- Tell him, you're his best friend.
- I'm not, you're his best friend.

111
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,330
- I'm not, you're his best friend.
- Quiet, here he comes.

112
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:14,480
The white dude or the Asian fellow?
See, I barely know the guy.

113
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,900
- Ted, what's up?
- How're you doing?

114
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,441
I'm frustrated.

115
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,412
Anything innovative
I put in my designs,

116
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,650
Bilson just hacks out
with a machette.

117
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:25,699
I hate having to answer
to a guy like that.

118
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,845
- You should drop the project.
- You should totally drop the project.

119
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,675
- It's beneath you.
- Then it's settled.

120
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,152
Ted Mosby's new chapter!
May the wind be at your back...

121
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:36,499
Are you kidding? They just laid off
another architect at my firm.

122
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:38,816
I mean, Bilson is
a pain sure, but...

123
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:41,430
without this project,
I'm probably out of a job.

124
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,645
Right... it's funny
that you mentioned the project.

125
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,244
- Because...
- You're nailing it.

126
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:47,777
Keep up the good work buddy.

127
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:49,960
Your hair and teeth
look fantastic today,

128
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,142
you're shining like a diamond!

129
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:54,898
Thank you.

130
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:56,425
I needed that.

131
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,805
I'm gonna head upstairs
and keep working.

132
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,902
I got to find a way to introduce
some wood into Bilson's dark atrium.

133
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:05,347
I think you know what I meant.

134
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,326
- What was that?
- What?

135
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:12,996
I have a thought. OK, we're paying
Ted's firm for two more months

136
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:15,666
of design work no matter what,
so couldn't we just let him

137
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:17,875
keep working and not tell him?

138
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,213
He's had a rough year. Let's let the guy
be happy a little while longer.

139
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,202
What you're suggesting
is an elaborate, long-term lie

140
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,012
that requires tremendous commitment.

141
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,222
A nice guy like you
can't pull that off.

142
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,559
- Sure I can.
- Lie to me right now.

143
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:37,813
- I have a spaceship.
- What kind of fuel powers it?

144
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,485
Okay, I don't have a spaceship.

145
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,475
Stand your ground!
If someone questions you,

146
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,105
distract them from the original lie
with more lies.

147
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,198
Here, let me demonstrate.
I own a pony.

148
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:49,950
Ask me a question.

149
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:55,932
- What color is your pony?
- Well, when I first got Dandelion,

150
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:58,005
she was a deep, chestnut brown,

151
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,060
but, sadly, her stable
is located near a chemical plant,

152
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:02,930
which contaminated
the drinking water.

153
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,305
So over time, she's turned a sickly,
grayish-white color

154
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,427
and there's nothing
that the vet can do to fix her.

155
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:11,030
My God!

156
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:13,891
That's horrible.
Is Dandelion going to be okay?

157
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,389
All right. You are good!

158
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,731
Dandelion's not even sick, is she?

159
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:26,570
So the building's really dead
and you guys lied to me.

160
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,656
We just did it to protect you, Ted.

161
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,505
I can't believe this.
I just got screwed by my 2 best friends

162
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,394
and I didn't even know it.

163
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,999
In Canada,
that's called a "Sneaky Snowplow".

164
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:45,422
That building was my dream job,
and now, it's just gone.

165
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,673
We're so sorry.

166
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:48,611
Yeah, I need a drink.

167
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,270
Poor Ted.

168
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:54,086
Would I seem heartless if I switched us
back to Canadian Sex Acts?

169
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:56,343
- Not at all.
- I'm surprised you waited this long.

170
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,352
What the hell is a
"Two-Hand Zamboni"?

171
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,125
Let's just say, the only thing

172
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,004
the woman is wearing
is skates on her hands.

173
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:05,943
A "Manitoba Milk Bag"?

174
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,234
Okay, it's like a "Chicago Mustache",
but the person on the bottom

175
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,656
is wearing a snowsuit.

176
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,450
A "Newfoundland Lobster Trap"?

177
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,094
Don't know. Don't want to know.
Those Newfies are out of control.

178
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,039
Okay, I'm gonna make my first guess.

179
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,799
Okay, but I'll only tell you

180
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:24,503
if you correctly guess the person,
the act and the collection.

181
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,340
Okay, I'm gonna go.

182
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,535
Bryan Adams.

183
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,842
He collects baseball cards,

184
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:33,890
and he wanted to do
a "Greasy Kayak".

185
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,848
Wayne Gretzky, vintage Hot Wheels,

186
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:40,803
a "Squatting Eskimo".

187
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,229
Kiefer Sutherland,
souvenir shot glasses,

188
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:47,502
and a "Sticky Flapjack".

189
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:50,837
That I would have done.

190
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,315
Wait.

191
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,867
Wait, if they pulled the plug
on the project a month ago,

192
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:56,814
why have I been going in once a week

193
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:58,912
to meet with
the New Headquarters Task Force?

194
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,150
Well, obviously you couldn't come in
and pitch to Bilson.

195
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,085
So, we... invented the task force.

196
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,630
Then it was just a question of putting
together the team.

197
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:12,301
<i>You know Roy Waterman,
Vice President of Capital and Risk,</i>

198
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:14,595
<i>he's actually...</i>

199
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,005
<i>Roy the janitor.</i>

200
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,431
Excuse me, Roy.

201
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,404
How'd you like to make
a few extra bucks?

202
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,686
How naked do I have to get?

203
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:26,773
<i>Louisa Mendoza,
Executive Vice President of Assets,</i>

204
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:28,942
<i>she's actually...</i>

205
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:30,777
<i>Louisa the lunch lady.</i>

206
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,914
Louisa, I need your help
with something,

207
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,823
but you can't tell anybody.

208
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:40,444
Exactly.
This is a big secret.

209
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:42,080
How do you say "secret" in Spanish?

210
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,576
Ah, yes. <i>Albondigas</i>.

211
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:50,774
This will be our little <i>albondigas</i>.

212
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:55,272
Can I have
a couple meatballs, please?

213
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,389
<i>And Arthur Nasmith, the eccentric genius
guru of corporate investments,</i>

214
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:01,475
<i>he's actually...</i>

215
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,145
<i>Crazy Arty,
15th Street's own one-man band.</i>

216
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,147
Excuse me.
Do you have a minute to talk?

217
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,025
Actually, my assistant, Reginald,
makes all my appointments.

218
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,913
<i>We rounded up the group
with a few interns</i>

219
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:21,954
<i>and payed everyone 50 bucks to act super
interested in what you were saying.</i>

220
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,546
Reginald,
get me out of this for next week.

221
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,263
That was some
of the most inspired design work.

222
00:10:34,388 --> 00:10:37,427
I've done in my entire career.
I was so excited.

223
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,905
Alex Trebek, a "Musty Goaltender",

224
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,435
- Beanie Babies!
- Nope.

225
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,603
- Damn it!
- Wait.

226
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,273
So that explains the thing
that happened with Louisa.

227
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,358
- Good job, buddy.
- Nice!

228
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,474
Listen, Louisa.

229
00:10:56,599 --> 00:11:00,533
What are we going to do about this?

230
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,347
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

231
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:06,254
I know you feel it, too.

232
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:09,304
What the hell.

233
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,135
No, this is wrong!

234
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:26,268
For God's sake,
you're on the task force!

235
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:31,440
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

236
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:36,069
You know how you played third base
for the GNB softball team.

237
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,335
There is no GNB softball team.

238
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,635
We just rented out a field,

239
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,575
rounded up a bunch of guys
and told them to make you the hero.

240
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,912
So my game-winning walk was a lie?

241
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,620
We're sorry, but we knew
that you'd be out of work soon,

242
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:53,295
we just wanted to make you feel good.
That's what friends do.

243
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,564
Lie to each other?

244
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,922
Sometimes, yeah,
to protect each other's feelings.

245
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,927
No way! You never lie to your friends.
I would never not be honest with you.

246
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,222
Really? What about that open mic night
at the comedy club?

247
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:06,705
<i>Are you like me, folks?</i>

248
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,575
<i>Have you ever thought about how many
different kinds of fish there are?</i>

249
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,149
<i>And the names of those fish?</i>

250
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,360
<i>Let's take a little ride.</i>

251
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,032
<i>"Trout."</i>

252
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:22,775
<i>Am I right?</i>

253
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,154
<i>"Sturgeon." I don't think so, pal.</i>

254
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,001
<i>"Salmon."</i>

255
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,447
<i>I'm going to say that again...</i>

256
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:30,804
<i>Salmon.</i>

257
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:33,041
<i>Who thought that was
a good idea, right?</i>

258
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:36,360
"Bass." This guy over here knows
what I'm talking about.

259
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,205
<i>"Halibut."</i>

260
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:40,849
<i>Thank you, good night.</i>

261
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,972
- How was it?
- You were great. Really funny.

262
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,552
You killed...

263
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:51,098
everyone's Thursday night.

264
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:55,635
Time out.
You didn't like the fish list?

265
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,734
It was horrible!
You just read a list of fish.

266
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:03,947
Anyway...

267
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:08,160
you guys just proved my point, okay?
You lied to me to protect my feelings.

268
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,850
This is completely different!
I just wasted a month of my life

269
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,335
working on a dead project.

270
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,961
That's time I could've spent
trying to bring my firm new business.

271
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,875
Instead, I'm going to go
in there tomorrow morning.

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,835
I'm probably going to get fired.
Best case scenario,

273
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,862
my boss is going to ream me out
in front of everybody.

274
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:29,850
- Back home, we call that a Sas...
- "Saskatoon Totem Pole." It's on here.

275
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,313
Good morning, lying bastards.

276
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,276
Anything you want to lie about
before I head off to work to get fired?

277
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,027
- Nice shirt.
- You're the devil.

278
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,618
Ted, what if we told you
that we found you a new project at GNB

279
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:47,159
where you would be
redesigning part of the 20th floor.

280
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,744
If that's a lie,
it's an incredibly dull one.

281
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,125
- What exactly would I be doing?
- This is the 18th Floor E.T.R.

282
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,617
Basically,
Bilson wants a room just like this,

283
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:59,421
only two stories up, on our floor.

284
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,841
- Wait, what's an E.T.R.?
- It's the Employee Transition Room.

285
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,307
- What does that mean?
- Well, it's a space

286
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:07,466
where a supervisor and employee

287
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:09,319
engage in a knowledge transfer

288
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:12,058
about an impending
vocational paradigm shift.

289
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,394
People get fired in here.

290
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,063
That's horrible!

291
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,143
Why do you need a room
specifically for firing people?

292
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,035
GNB feels that people need a safe,

293
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,613
secure space to deal with the news.

294
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:27,865
It gets pretty real in here.

295
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:16,559
<i>So I reluctantly agreed
to design a room</i>

296
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:19,991
<i>where people would be fired.
But I was determined to make it my own.</i>

297
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,920
Now, when you leave
the dismissal space,

298
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,530
you'll exit into what I'm calling

299
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:27,342
"the Rebirth Tranquility Hallway".

300
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,390
Here, you'll find
a soothing oval chamber

301
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,163
with a trained grief counselor.

302
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:36,393
It's right here,
past the New Beginnings Fountain.

303
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,975
And there you have it.
Instead of a drab, dark prison cell,

304
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:43,942
a nurturing womb...

305
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,250
birthing you into a new life.

306
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,948
- I love it.
- Really?

307
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:53,785
- Nice work, Ted.
- Thank you.

308
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,289
Can you add some of these touches to
the existing 18th Floor E.T.R. as well?

309
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,332
- Absolutely.
- Great.

310
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,805
Let's take a look.

311
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:08,091
- Okay, so I'm thinking this wall...
- You're fired!

312
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:10,290
- What?
- I wanted this room!

313
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,305
This exact room two floors up!

314
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,056
- But...
- You're fired!

315
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,626
Now, get the hell out of here.

316
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:22,063
Hey, honey.

317
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,475
Anyone from the band Rush,

318
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,033
a "Montreal Meatpie",
and superhero lunch boxes.

319
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:37,298
Rick Moranis,

320
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:39,448
"The Reverse Rick Moranis",

321
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:40,915
antique Judaica.

322
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:42,988
I give up.

323
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,075
I've been guessing for three days.

324
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,238
I'm done.

325
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:48,965
If that means I never get to know,
so be it.

326
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,829
- Fine.
- Tell us!

327
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,534
- You really want to know?
- Yes!

328
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:59,893
But this information
does not leave this table.

329
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:04,630
Oh, my, God.
I am so excited.

330
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,734
- I'm gonna read it.
- Read it.

331
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,330
- Read it.
- I'm gonna read it. Here we go.

332
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:13,270
"The Frozen Snowshoe,

333
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:17,030
"Old King Clancy, Harvey's trays."

334
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:20,747
Right.

335
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:23,792
I don't know
what any of those words mean.

336
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,299
Is one of those supposed
to be a celebrity?

337
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:29,392
Who the hell...

338
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:31,424
is Old King Clancy?

339
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,735
No, that's not the person,
that's the sex act.

340
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,944
It's the same
as a Sacramento Turtleneck,

341
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,515
except with maple syrup.

342
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,075
So the celebrity was Harvey Straze?

343
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,313
No, that's what he collected.
Harvey's trays.

344
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:48,775
Those classic orange trays you get
whenever you eat at Harvey's.

345
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,335
The restaurant?

346
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,690
Come on, you're road tripping down
the Trans-Canada Highway,

347
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:57,247
you get a hunger on
between Milverton and Wawa,

348
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,425
where you gonna strap
on a feed bag, huh?

349
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,975
Harvey's. Over 12,000 served!

350
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,666
So the celebrity was...

351
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,918
The Frozen Snowshoe.

352
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:11,435
Oh, my God! You guys have never
heard of The Frozen Snowshoe?

353
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,217
He's only the most famous
professional wrestler in Canada.

354
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,681
I met him after he defeated
Reckless Rick Rogers

355
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,288
in the Kamloops Memorial
Arena back in '02.

356
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:22,684
Classic match.

357
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,612
So you're saying The Frozen Snowshoe

358
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:28,794
invited you back to his place

359
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,032
to look at Harvey's trays,

360
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:34,070
and asked you to do
an Old King Clancy?

361
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,239
Exactly.

362
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,911
And I'm serious,
you cannot tell anyone.

363
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,075
My hiccups are gone.

364
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,662
Possibly forever.

365
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,975
Canada! You did it again.

366
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:48,735
You even found a way to ruin this.

367
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,756
Why? Why do we let you be a country?

368
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:54,751
Hey, Mister Whisper.

369
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:57,761
Shouldn't you be upstairs
designing your big fancy E.T.R.?

370
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:00,221
- I'm off the project.
- What?

371
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,849
- Bilson fired me.
- You're kidding me.

372
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,205
So what does this mean
for you at your firm?

373
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,171
- Are you gonna get laid off?
- Actually,

374
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:09,606
I just quit.

375
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:10,607
Why?

376
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,068
Because I can't work for big,
heartless corporate clients anymore.

377
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,205
When I was pitching
to your "task force",

378
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,491
I was doing the most inspired work
of my career. In a way,

379
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,863
you idiots reminded me
how much fun my job can be

380
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:25,821
when I'm not answering
to the Bilsons of the world, so...

381
00:19:25,946 --> 00:19:27,101
I quit.

382
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,739
- They fired you, didn't they?
- Yes, sir.

383
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,754
But I got a sweet severance package
and I've made a big decision.

384
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,634
I'm gonna start my own firm.

385
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,803
- That's exciting.
- In this economy?

386
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,097
So you're not mad?

387
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:46,184
As it turns out, I'm grateful.

388
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:50,605
How'd it all go down
between you and Bilson?

389
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:54,275
After he proposed
a vocational paradigm shift,

390
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,305
I made an impromptu presentation
using a four-pronged approach

391
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,906
- that really brought him to his knees.
- Hit him with a chair?

392
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,449
- Yep
- That's my boy.

393
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:07,747
And this one, I got on the drive
from Milverton to Wawa.

394
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:12,502
That's pretty impressive,
The Frozen Snowshoe.

395
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,546
Please, we're friends.
Just call me "Shoe".

396
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:16,788
Have a seat.

397
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:23,447
So, Shoe...

398
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,786
How would you like to give me...

399
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:30,502
an "Old King Clancy"?

400
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:35,483
I think you should go.
