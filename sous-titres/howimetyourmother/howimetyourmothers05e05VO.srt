1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:03,417
<i>Kids, as you know,
aunt Robin grew up in Canada.</i>

2
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:06,207
<i>That meant sometimes
she dressed a little differently.</i>

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:07,626
Okay, let's do this!

4
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:11,516
<i>Sometimes she talked
a little differently.</i>

5
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:14,712
Ted, this hydro bill is bigger
than Louis Cyr's biceps.

6
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:17,433
What, you leave the garburator
on all night, eh?

7
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:20,645
<i>She hung out at different bars</i>

8
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:23,036
<i>and enjoyed leisure time
a little differently?</i>

9
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:25,311
You want to go?
You want to go?!

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,241
Make fun of the great
white north all you want.

11
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,102
It's the best country in the world.

12
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,775
Social experiment.

13
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:35,611
U.s.a.!

14
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,385
You know what,
what does that even prove, okay?

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,579
You chant anything,
people will join in.

16
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,171
Canada!

17
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:51,591
Okay, they won't chant anything.

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,135
Shrimp fried rice!

19
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:03,478
Shrimp fried rice!
Totally.

20
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,111
Anyway, speaking of food,

21
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:08,924
Marshall, I've got some bad news.
Just read online, Gazzola's is closing.

22
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:10,985
What's that?

23
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:14,223
A filthy mecca of spectacular
if undercooked pizza

24
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:17,214
located at 316 kinzie street,
chicago, illinois.

25
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:20,047
Back in college, Ted and I used
to take these crazy road trips

26
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:22,738
from Connecticut  to Chicago
just for a Gazzola's pizza.

27
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:24,599
- 22 hours.
- No map.

28
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:26,844
We'd just jump in
the Fiero and drive.

29
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,571
We were like Lewis and Clark,

30
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:30,481
if they peed in empty soda bottles

31
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:32,424
and had a bong made
out of a cantaloupe.

32
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,798
Man, those Gazzola trips,

33
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:37,595
that's...
that's when we really became bros.

34
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:39,707
We ate nothing but jerky.

35
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,418
Drank nothing but Tantrum.

36
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:42,642
Tantrum.

37
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,984
<i>Tantrum was a soft drink with
the highest caffeine content</i>

38
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,154
<i>legally available over the counter.</i>

39
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:52,015
<i>It was eventually discontinued
after an extensive study by the FDA.</i>

40
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:58,799
Man, we went through
a whole case of Tantrum one trip.

41
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:01,306
I was color-blind for
two weeks after that.

42
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:04,414
That's the reason that I pass out
when I hear church bells.

43
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,404
It's probably a good thing
they're closing Gazzola's.

44
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:09,214
Those trips were brutal, right?

45
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:12,473
The long hours in the car,
the motion sickness, the smell.

46
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,297
What time are we leaving
for Gazzola's ?

47
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:16,060
I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.

48
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,796
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

49
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,230
.:: La Fabrique ::.

50
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,275
I am ready to hit the road.
I got baby wipes.

51
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:35,540
I got a variety of jerky.
I got six cans of Tantrum.

52
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:39,240
Well, four. One burned through the can,
the other one I drank already.

53
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,890
Tantrum!

54
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:42,786
I am so psyched!

55
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:45,895
Marshall and I haven't done something,
just the two of us, for so long.

56
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,792
Ever since he got married, he's
turned from an "I" to a "We."

57
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,877
- What do you mean?
- Think about it.

58
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,505
Haven't seen you all week.
How you doing?

59
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:55,082
We're doing great.

60
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:58,760
- Did you watch the jets game?
- We most certainly did.

61
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,387
How'd things go at the doctor?

62
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:04,236
We no longer have
a hemorrhoid problem.

63
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:11,189
You will not believe this.
I've been talking to my lawyer.

64
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:14,052
You know that guy I had a slight
disagreement with at the hoser hut?

65
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:15,610
He's filing assault charges.

66
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:16,778
Come on!

67
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,530
I broke his nose with a chair.

68
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,783
And now, apparently,
I may end up getting deported.

69
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,078
My god, that sucks! I'm gonna go do
push-ups in the kitchen.

70
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:30,041
Well, there's only one possible
way to avoid getting deported.

71
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,857
My lawyer said I could
become an American citizen.

72
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:34,916
Perfect. Problem solved.
Welcome aboard.

73
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,594
Well, it's not that simple.

74
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,811
I'm a Canadian.
I was born there.

75
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,135
My family's there.
It's who I am.

76
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,763
I know, and it's provided us
with a lot of laughs.

77
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:47,127
But, Robin, if you want to live here,
work here

78
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:50,270
and throw chairs at people here,
you have to do this.

79
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:52,772
Well, there's a citizenship
test tomorrow.

80
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,041
- I'll think about it.
- No, no, you have to do it.

81
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,740
I'll help you study.
We're gonna stay up all night long.

82
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,281
I'm gonna drill you,
and then we're gonna study.

83
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,904
No, seriously.
We're gonna do some cramming

84
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:05,451
and then we're gonna study.

85
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,454
- Seriously. We're gonna bone up on...
- Okay, Barney. Sorry.

86
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,123
- It's a rich area.
- It is.

87
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,711
But you know,
it's not going to be easy, this test.

88
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,919
It's not like the Canadian
citizenship test.

89
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:16,838
How do you know
the Canadian test is easy?

90
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:18,507
It's Canada.

91
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:21,148
Question one: do you want
to be Canadian?

92
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:23,217
Question two: really?

93
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,556
Ted, Ted, check it out!

94
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,436
I got black coffee on the left,
I got Tantrum on the right!

95
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,007
- Do you have a phone book?!
- Yes, I do!

96
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,226
Why they make phone books anymore.
Everything's online, right?

97
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,945
All right, let's hit the road.

98
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:43,531
- You invited Lily?
- We most certainly did!

99
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:49,120
- He did the "We" thing.
- Yeah, I heard him. 

100
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:53,063
Road trip!

101
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,251
So you guys want to talk
about bitches?

102
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:57,045
I'm kidding.
They're called women.

103
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,622
All right, next stop: Chicago.

104
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,029
I have to pee.

105
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,473
- Couldn't you have gone before we left?
- I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.

106
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:18,650
Don't worry, we'll get out on the road,
it'll be just like old times.

107
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:20,276
<i>It wasn't.</i>

108
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,880
Sugar snap pea?

109
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,664
Pea...
That reminds me, I have to pee.

110
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,376
OK, straight, straight, straight.

111
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,155
Now, wait, a little to the left.

112
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,130
We'll pass a state trooper.

113
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,467
Punch buggy yellow!

114
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:46,636
Yellow... that reminds me,
I have to pee.

115
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,517
Thank you!

116
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,821
You can't have to go again.
It's not humanly possible.

117
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:02,819
I was just going to say maybe we should
listen to something.

118
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,613
That's a great idea.
I think I have some jerky boys.

119
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,198
<i>Good-bye, Sparky.</i>

120
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:10,082
It's an audio book
about a boy and his dog.

121
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,036
It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck Cry.

122
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:15,815
<i>Good-bye Sparky, by Nick Leotti.</i>

123
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,701
<i>Read to you by Kenny Rogers.</i>

124
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,190
<i>Chapter one:
when I first saw Sparky,</i>

125
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,615
<i>he reminded me of my favorite comb;</i>

126
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,593
<i>he was missing a lot of teeth,
but I loved him anyway.</i>

127
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,928
<i>Mother was fit to be tied</i>

128
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:31,474
every time he used
her prized rhododendron

129
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,905
to do his business.

130
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,375
That reminds me, I have to pee.

131
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:38,813
"How many stars are on the flag?"

132
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,481
50, one for each state.

133
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:43,067
"What are the first ten amendments
to the constitution called?"

134
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:44,504
The bill of rights.

135
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,571
I know all this. I'm ready.

136
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:49,678
Ready for the test maybe,
but ready to be an American?

137
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:51,465
Not on your sweet life.

138
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,412
For you to be an American,
we got to get the Canadian out of you.

139
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,540
That's why I've created
these questions.

140
00:06:57,714 --> 00:07:00,585
Question one: "Who is this?"

141
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,963
- Queen Elizabeth II.
- No, the answer is Elton John.

142
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:07,967
Question two:
"what the hell is this?"

143
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,428
Curling, it's a sport played...

144
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:14,182
Wrong. The answer is
"I don't care, it's dumb."

145
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:16,441
Let's go buy something
that's bad for us

146
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,853
and then sue the people
who made it. That's American.

147
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,400
<i>... because Sparky loved
chasing a ball,</i>

148
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,511
<i>and it didn't much matter what kind.</i>

149
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:27,382
<i>Tennis ball, baseball, wiffle ball,</i>

150
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:29,781
<i>golf ball, basketball,</i>

151
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:31,588
<i>beach ball, gum ball,</i>

152
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:34,310
<i>a grapefruit, which isn't
actually a ball,</i>

153
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:36,145
<i>but it's round like a ball...</i>

154
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,752
<i>A football, which isn't round,</i>

155
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,913
<i>but it's still technically a ball...</i>

156
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:41,447
<i>Indian rubber ball...</i>

157
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:43,631
<i>This ends disk seven.</i>

158
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,480
<i>The audio book continues
on disk eight.</i>

159
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,891
<i>Disk eight.</i>

160
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:52,971
<i>Lacrosse ball, volleyball...</i>

161
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:55,599
My god, Lily, please
tell me you have to go pee!

162
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,409
Yeah, I do.

163
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:00,813
<i>It was the worst trip ever,
but then it got worse.</i>

164
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,857
Well, don't worry, the
il l next exit's the hotel.

165
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,400
We can go there.

166
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:07,486
Crumpet manor is listed

167
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,988
in the American registry
of historic bed-and-breakfasts.

168
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,493
Our door is opened
on christmas day, 1881.

169
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,454
And we have catered
to couples ever since.

170
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:21,304
Well, I mean, single people
can have fun here, too, right?

171
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:24,081
I suppose I could arrange
a little recreation.

172
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:26,189
Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?

173
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:31,789
<i>And by the end of the night, Barney
had turned Robin into a real American.</i>

174
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,429
I want to say... Jefferson?

175
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,966
Correct. Archie Bunker's neighbor
was George Jefferson.

176
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,832
Boo-ya! I am nailing this.
God, I'm buzzing on America right now!

177
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,442
All right, hold your horses.

178
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,279
Now to prove that you are
as American as apple pie

179
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:50,002
and the childhood obesity
it leads to...

180
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,248
Who is this?

181
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:54,492
That, Barney,

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,982
is the American actor,
beloved by millions,

183
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:02,707
<i>the "Hey, Vern" guy from the
popular series Of Ernest films.</i>

184
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,760
And his name...

185
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:07,238
Jeff Foxworthy.

186
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,016
Jeff Foxworthy?

187
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,716
No, it's Jim Varney.

188
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,986
You're kidding me.
You don't know that?

189
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:15,638
That's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass.

190
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,930
End of story.
Now shut your stupid face.

191
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:20,347
Not only are you wrong,

192
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,350
but you are belligerently
sticking to your guns

193
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,229
and insulting me in the process.

194
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,549
You are an American.

195
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:35,990
Look who's back
from the wishing well.

196
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,784
It didn't work, I'm still here.

197
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:42,371
Marshall, what are we doing?
We should be on the road.

198
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,724
Look, Ted, we're not
in college anymore,

199
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:46,401
We don't have to drive all night.

200
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:47,543
They have a spa.

201
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:49,754
What kind of
treatments do you offer?

202
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,506
All our spa treatments
are designed for couples.

203
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:54,654
Would you be interested

204
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,095
in the two-person,
cornmeal body scrub?

205
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,326
<i>And then finally, it happened...</i>

206
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:03,551
<i>Marshall and Lily globbed
into one big married glob.</i>

207
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,645
We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!

208
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,257
I got to dial back on the Tantrum.

209
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:16,701
<i>I'm gonna be an American, y'all.</i>

210
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,369
<i>Maybe I'll rob a liquor store.
Maybe I won't. My choice.</i>

211
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:23,878
Learn English!

212
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:28,410
<i>The Hoser Hut.</i>

213
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,041
I could duck in for a drink.

214
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,574
That life's behind me.
Forget it.

215
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:37,843
I could in for just one beer.
What's the harm in that?

216
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:39,626
It's a free country.

217
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,433
God, I miss it.

218
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,258
Sorry about what I said before.

219
00:11:01,383 --> 00:11:03,489
You want to go to the store
and get some beer?

220
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,850
Lily is asleep.

221
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:09,167
I suppose
I could reschedule my pedicure.

222
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:11,228
What the hell?

223
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:13,762
But only light beer
because we have a hike in the morning.

224
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:19,845
Why are we pulling to the highway?

225
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,058
Where exactly are we going
to get this beer?

226
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:27,519
Chicago.

227
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,010
What are you doing?
We can't just leave Lily.

228
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,568
When she wakes up, she'll freak!

229
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,261
She'll have a back rub and a crumpet.
She'll be fine.

230
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:39,406
Relax. Have some fun.

231
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,634
I just abandoned my wife.

232
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,510
How am I supposed to have fun?

233
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,545
- You think Lily's pissed?
- If she's pissed, she's pissed.

234
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:58,233
<i>When Barney finally tracked down
your Aunt Robin,</i>

235
00:11:58,358 --> 00:11:59,676
<i>it wasn't a pretty sight.</i>

236
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,428
Good morning.

237
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,477
What happened last night?

238
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:09,873
You...

239
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:11,331
went Canadian.

240
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:13,440
How Canadian?

241
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:16,083
This Canadian.

242
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,175
That's supposed to be
a dramatic view of the Toronto sky...

243
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,783
you're in Toronto.

244
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:29,703
It's coming back to me.

245
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:33,052
I went into the Hoser Hut...

246
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:36,671
And I met this women's curling team.

247
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,469
We started drinking. And the next thing
I know, they're inviting me

248
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,428
to a Bryan Adams/Rich Little
double bill in Toronto.

249
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,055
How did you find me, anyway?

250
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,757
You called me,
said you were never coming back.

251
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:51,436
So, I jumped on a plane,
flew across the Atlantic...

252
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,355
Canada isn't across the Atlantic.

253
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,913
You're talking nonsense.

254
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:56,233
Listen...

255
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,820
You slipped up. It's fine.
The test is in a few hours.

256
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,135
I'm not taking the test.

257
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,657
God, you're still drunk.

258
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,119
Look, I appreciate your help, but...

259
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:08,670
who am I kidding?

260
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:09,945
I'm Canadian.

261
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,373
I always will be.

262
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,046
Now, that's ridiculous.

263
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:17,432
We're gonna get some coffee in you,
we'll sober you up,

264
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:19,635
and get you back to New York
for that test.

265
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,540
But, before any of that,

266
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:23,617
we're gonna do it on this bed,

267
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:25,095
'cause... Hotel room.

268
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:29,197
Let's get some coffee.

269
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,602
A little rubbery,
room temperature...

270
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:34,065
Kind of gross.

271
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,042
You're making me wonder
if this pizza's worth the 22-hour drive.

272
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:38,692
Just like old times!

273
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,067
I feel so young again
except for the chest pains.

274
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,823
But the crust is so good.
What is the secret to this crust?

275
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,576
It's no big secret.
It's made of cornmeal.

276
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:49,995
Cornmeal...

277
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:53,313
We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!

278
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:57,195
I can't believe
you guys are closing.

279
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,890
I can't believe we're still open.

280
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:00,322
Gotcha!

281
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,189
These are getting bigger.

282
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,447
It's like an entire country
without a tailor.

283
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:10,696
Give me two coffees.

284
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:12,021
$3.50, please.

285
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,060
What did you think
of the game last night?

286
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,103
What game?

287
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,820
The Leafs beat Edmonton.

288
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:19,191
Beauchemin went five hole in OT.

289
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:22,447
- I guess I missed it.
- Sorry. You're American.

290
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,988
- Here's your change.
- I'm not American.

291
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,384
American money?
Didn't watch the Leafs game?

292
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,445
No "please" or "thank you"
for the coffee?

293
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,411
You sure don't seem like a Canadian.

294
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:35,884
What's wrong?

295
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:38,285
Other than the fact
that this five-dollar bill

296
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,794
they gave you is blue.

297
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,090
I'm not American, and apparently,
I'm not Canadian either.

298
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:47,635
And there's kids playing hockey

299
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,741
on the back. It's like you want us
to make fun of you.

300
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,449
I don't want this anymore.

301
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:58,355
Don't look at it.
That's a rookie mistake.

302
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,045
We shouldn't have left Lily.

303
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,900
If you're worried,
why don't you call her?

304
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,852
I have.
I left her, like, 20 messages.

305
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:07,280
I said, "I'm sorry.
Please forgive me. It's Ted's fault!".

306
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,951
- What exactly is "Ted's fault"?
- This! This whole thing!

307
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,395
We were having a nice trip,
and then you kidnapped me.

308
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,831
- You didn't let me put on underwear!
- We never used to put on underwear!

309
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,294
That was the fun
of a bro's trip to Gazzola's!

310
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:25,799
We left everything, and everyone behind.
It was just you and me!

311
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,010
But now it's
like you've disappeared into Lily.

312
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,011
Not true.

313
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,437
True. You're not upset
because you're worried she's mad.

314
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:34,708
but because you'd rather be with her,
eating muffins,

315
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,940
than here with me,
eating this delicious...

316
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:39,697
I think one of my mushrooms
just crawled away.

317
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,317
Well, you know what? That mushroom's not
the only thing that's leaving.

318
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,238
Car keys, please.

319
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,445
Look at this money!

320
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,855
This one has a moose,

321
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,675
this one has a beaver,
and they have Elton John on the back.

322
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:13,930
When I moved to the States,
I swore I wasn't going to change.

323
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:16,055
And yet, here I am,

324
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,167
in the most Canadian place
in the universe...

325
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:21,513
Tim Horton's, around the corner
from the Hockey Hall of Fame,

326
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:23,292
and I don't belong.

327
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,609
It's like I don't have a country.

328
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:28,622
That's it.

329
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:31,740
Attention, Canada!

330
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,784
I am Barney from America.

331
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,370
And I'm here to fix
your backward-ass country.

332
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,872
Number one,

333
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,069
get real money.

334
00:16:40,194 --> 00:16:43,209
Don't know what board game
this came from, but it's a "jhoke."

335
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,260
Number two,

336
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:46,756
and this is the biggie,

337
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,300
quit letting awesome chicks
like Robin Scherbatsky get away,

338
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,801
because, guess what?

339
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,242
You don't want her?
I'm planting my flag in her,

340
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:56,615
if you know what I mean,
which you probably don't,

341
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,516
and getting her
the hell out of here.

342
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,519
You may now return
to being pointless.

343
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,487
This coffee is excellent.

344
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,260
It's called a "tie".

345
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,310
<i>Sparky was my best friend,</i>

346
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,051
<i>but after I married Helen,</i>

347
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:36,381
<i>old spark started to feel
a little left out.</i>

348
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,834
<i>For so long,
it had been just me and him,</i>

349
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,309
<i>but now he suddenly felt
like Helen had taken his place.</i>

350
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:46,193
<i>What Sparky didn't realize was,</i>

351
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:49,047
<i>even though I loved Helen,
I still loved him, too.</i>

352
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:52,381
<i>I had room in my heart
for both of them.</i>

353
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:54,601
<i>But maybe I should have put aside</i>

354
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:57,155
<i>some special ball-tossing time
just for the two of us,</i>

355
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:00,822
<i>to make sure Sparky knew
that he was a good boy.</i>

356
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,039
<i>I wish now I had,</i>

357
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:06,290
<i>'cause old Sparky ran out
in front of a Cadillac,</i>

358
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:09,963
<i>and got splattered like a watermelon
in one of them Gallagher shows.</i>

359
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,166
- I'm sorry, Ted!
- I'm sorry.

360
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,299
- I never should have been mad at you!
- I never should have brought Lily.

361
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:17,804
She pees all the time,
even at the apartment.

362
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,223
Still bros?

363
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,257
Best bros.

364
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,774
You want to crank some Van Halen
just like old times?

365
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:31,821
- Or listen to the Sparky book again?
- Let's listen to it again.

366
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:36,420
Those Canadian doctors banded me up,

367
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,479
reset my jaw,

368
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:41,586
put my shoulder back in its socket,
and they didn't even bill me.

369
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:42,454
Idiots.

370
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:46,374
All right,
I guess they're not idiots.

371
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,042
The coffee was extraordinary.

372
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,589
I guess Canada's not so bad.

373
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,718
They play their cards right,
maybe they can become a state someday.

374
00:18:57,462 --> 00:18:59,562
Barney, I've thought about this.

375
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,910
When you stood up
and told off those people, I thought...

376
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:05,727
"America's cool."

377
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:09,607
And then when those guys pounded
the stuffing out of you, I thought...

378
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,191
"Canada's pretty cool, too."

379
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,194
In fact, after you passed out,

380
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,237
I may have taken a few pokes myself.

381
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,008
So, I've decided, dual citizenship.

382
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,993
I'm going to be American
and Canadian.

383
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:23,912
Wait, you can do that?

384
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:25,259
Yeah, dummy.

385
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:27,412
Instead of being a woman
with no country,

386
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm going to be a woman with two.

387
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:30,758
I see.

388
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:32,378
You understand?

389
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:35,590
I can see out of my left eye again.

390
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,201
I'm so sorry that we left you.

391
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,275
Did you go somewhere?

392
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,977
<i>Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor
had pampered Lily</i>

393
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:03,631
<i>into a nearly comatose
state of relaxation.</i>

394
00:20:03,756 --> 00:20:05,537
<i>She didn't even notice we were gone.</i>

395
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,677
So, I had a great time, too.

396
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,009
That's good.

397
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:24,138
And I'm so sorry
you didn't get any pizza.

398
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:25,694
That's okay.

399
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:29,394
<i>And if she didn't mean it then,
she certainly meant it 19 minutes later.</i>

400
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:30,619
My stomach!

401
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:32,883
Damn you, Gozzola's!

402
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,891
It's like a hot ball of lead!

403
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,469
Baby, cut it out of me.

404
00:20:39,164 --> 00:20:40,113
Cut it out!

405
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:44,843
That was a wild trip!

406
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:46,443
I know. It was kind of crazy.

407
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:48,698
But how great is it
to drink some Tantrum again?

408
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,568
You know who had fun, was Lily.

409
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:52,577
Lily drank
like, four cans of the stuff.

410
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:53,585
Right?

411
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:55,951
Where's Lily?

412
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,253
I have to pee.
