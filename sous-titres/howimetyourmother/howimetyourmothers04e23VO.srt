1
00:00:00,778 --> 00:00:02,921
<i>Kids, Stella Zinman was the girl</i>

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,422
<i>I thought I'd spend
the rest of my life with.</i>

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,992
<i>Until she left me at the altar,
smashing my heart to smithereens.</i>

4
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:11,395
<i>So when I ran into her
seven months later,</i>

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>there was only one way
to deal with her.</i>

6
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,892
- Great to see you!
- You, too.

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:19,435
And Tony!

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,939
What a nice surprise.

9
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,550
"What a nice surprise"?

10
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:26,340
No, a nice surprise would be

11
00:00:26,465 --> 00:00:29,494
if a safe fell from 40 stories
and smushed them both.

12
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,072
You didn't let them have it?

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,617
No, we had a nice friendly chat, then,
they went their way and I went mine.

14
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,885
You blew it.
He blew it, right?

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,082
- Well played, sir.
- Bravo.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,458
- What?
- You see,

17
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:46,103
Ted played it cool, which is exactly
what he should have done.

18
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:48,881
As a matter of fact,
I'd say on a scale ranging from...

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,800
And I kept this sweater of yours...

20
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,196
and sometimes
I just sit in the bathtub

21
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,638
for hours just,
you know, just sniffing it.

22
00:00:58,336 --> 00:00:59,517
... all the way to...

23
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,335
This is my new fiancée.

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,770
She's basically Stella,

25
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,370
except she's French
and, as you can see,

26
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:07,195
she's got enormous cans.

27
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:08,547
<i>Enchantée.</i>

28
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,066
<i>Enchanté.</i>

29
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,661
I'd say you nailed it.

30
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:20,360
I'll do you one better.

31
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:22,415
You, sir, got Stella thinking.

32
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:26,419
"Gosh, Ted seemed so cool today.
Did I choose the wrong guy?"

33
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,213
Give it a week, you'll get her back.

34
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,004
And her front.

35
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:35,094
Did you just feel that?
I think we just had a "what up" quake.

36
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,675
I don't want her back.

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,821
Or her front.
I just want to move on.

38
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:42,900
And this was an important step
towards that.

39
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:44,348
To moving on.

40
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:47,213
<i>And you know, I really meant it.</i>

41
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,662
<i>But still, that night,
my mind began to wander.</i>

42
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,115
I made a terrible mistake.

43
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,701
I know.
I'm a better person than you are.

44
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,202
You totally are.

45
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,246
Let's get back together,
and have way more sex.

46
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,414
Deal!

47
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:14,508
Hello, Ted.

48
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,144
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

49
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:32,306
No, come in. It's not weird at all.

50
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:39,575
I knew it was wrong
to steal somebody's fiancée.

51
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,560
I mean, I grappled with it.
I was up nights.

52
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,353
And not for the good reason.

53
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,290
Well, sometimes for the good reason.

54
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:49,018
I mean, Stella and I hadn't
seen each other in five years,

55
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:52,794
so, as you can imagine, the beginning,
it was just fast and furious.

56
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,925
Lamps breaking, furniture moving.
You see this bald patch?

57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,510
Anyway, we moved on.

58
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,662
Me, Lucy, Stella,
we were gonna move to L.A.

59
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:03,390
I was gonna become a screenwriter.

60
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,098
Then we bumped into you,
and you just looked so...

61
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,729
sad.

62
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,356
Sad? No.

63
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:13,025
I think what you're calling sad
was actually

64
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,634
a jovial nonchalance.

65
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,182
You looked awful, okay?

66
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,230
Like a little dachshund puppy

67
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:20,917
with a bad back that's got
to pull itself around on a cart.

68
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,243
Why are you here?

69
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,205
I know I can
come across pretty tough,

70
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,833
but I can't bear to have hurt someone
the way I hurt you.

71
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:32,505
I think fate put me on that corner
to make this right.

72
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,527
Obviously, I can't fill that giant
crater that Stella left in your heart.

73
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,052
- I've been dating. Like, a lot.
- And then I heard you got fired.

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,720
I transitioned into small business
ownership.

75
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:44,382
t's the backbone of the economy.

76
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,558
No, it's not.

77
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,143
Ted, my family's got a lot of money.

78
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:51,438
And I want to use that money
to make this right with you.

79
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,299
Tony is rich?

80
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,696
Ted, tell me he wrote you a check.

81
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:00,948
Tell me he wrote you

82
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,063
a big, fat check.

83
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:06,412
A check so big it doesn't take
its shirt off when it goes swimming.

84
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:08,292
That is a big, fat check.

85
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,876
A check so big, if you had sex with it,
you wouldn't tell your buddies.

86
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,836
That is a big, fat check.

87
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,695
A check so big that
when you sit next to it on an airplane,

88
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,551
you find yourself wondering whether
the check should have bought 2 seats.

89
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,959
- That...
- Is a big, fat check!

90
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,098
Yeah! He didn't write me a check.

91
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,851
- Ted, I want to offer you a job.
- A job?

92
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,856
Every year, my family gives
a lot of money to Columbia University,

93
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,105
so I got some pull.

94
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:35,691
How would you like to design...

95
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:37,649
<i>My heart leapt into my throat.</i>

96
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,904
<i>A new library?
A new student center?</i>

97
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:43,657
... your very own curriculum
as a professor of architecture.

98
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:46,994
No, thanks.

99
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,906
What do you mean,

100
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:50,864
"No, thanks"?

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,683
You would be a great professor, OK?

102
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,308
You are knowledgeable,

103
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:57,838
you're a good talker,

104
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,984
and when you need to,

105
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,843
you can grow
a very handsome neck beard.

106
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:05,478
I'm not gonna be a professor.

107
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:07,397
Teaching is what you do
when your career

108
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:10,331
has totally bottomed out
and you need to pay the bills.

109
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,403
Small business owner.
Backbone of the economy.

110
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:17,419
I'm not gonna take that job, all right?
I'm gonna be just fine.

111
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:19,724
- New topic.
- Okay, new topic.

112
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,341
I just got a $200
speeding ticket today.

113
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,367
That sucks, dude.
You couldn't talk your way out of it?

114
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,202
You can't.

115
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,867
I've done it.
It was... what was it?

116
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,873
It was 1998.

117
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:34,912
So where's the fire?

118
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:36,337
There's no fire.

119
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,494
Actually, you know, there is a fire
at this barbecue I'm headed to.

120
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:46,011
Nothing special.
Burgers, ribs... brats.

121
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,899
Son, do you have any idea
how dangerous it is to be...

122
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:53,978
- Did you say brats?
- Yeah, brats.

123
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:57,356
My mom marinates them
in Belgian beer for two days. No big.

124
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,733
Funny thing was, I could've sworn
that one of those thick,

125
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:05,295
succulent, hickory-smoked brats
had some writing on it.

126
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,865
Weird. What were you saying?

127
00:06:07,427 --> 00:06:09,342
What did it say? The brat?

128
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,573
It said
"Property of Minnesota State Trooper

129
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,330
"Jorgensen."

130
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:17,563
You a brat man,

131
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,630
Officer Jorgensen?

132
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,174
You going to this address?

133
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:26,927
Follow me and lean on the horn.
We're gonna be running some reds.

134
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:30,709
Well, duh.

135
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:34,281
I would've done that, too,
if I'd have been going to a barbecue.

136
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:35,728
Damn, I was.

137
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,906
See, it's all about
sizing up your opponent.

138
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,297
I could tell that the officer
was a brat man because,

139
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:43,301
well, he was out of breath
just from walking to my car and...

140
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:45,863
he had mustard on his holster.

141
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:51,447
Manipulating an officer of the law
with your sausage.

142
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:52,578
That is very hot.

143
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,248
You think I can't talk my way
out of a ticket?

144
00:06:56,929 --> 00:07:00,586
You think I can't talk my way
out of a ticket?

145
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:04,539
I am Barney Stinson,
master of manipulation.

146
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:07,806
If I can talk a stripper
into paying me for a lap dance,

147
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:09,867
I think I can talk my way
out of a ticket.

148
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:12,347
Challenge accept...
wait for it.

149
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,185
I don't get it.

150
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,038
"Accep-Ted."

151
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:22,900
I get it now.

152
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,765
- What now?
- You want to be an architect?

153
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,339
Great. Guy I went to private school
with wants a new house built.

154
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:35,454
- Job's yours if you want it.
- Tony, look, I don't need your help.

155
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:37,305
Here's what he's offering you.

156
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,712
That is a big, fat check.

157
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,637
Showtime.

158
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:56,252
- License and registration.
- Of course, Officer. Right away.

159
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:05,526
Sir, this is a gift certificate
for a custom-tailored Italian suit.

160
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,689
So, we done here?

161
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,329
375 dollars!

162
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,816
And he kept the gift certificates.

163
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:16,829
I'm gonna call Emilio and tell him
to short-sheet him on the crotch.

164
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,330
You are bad at this, dude.

165
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,854
Whatever, Robin.

166
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,751
Like you've ever talked
your way out of a ticket.

167
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,991
Are you kidding me?
Robin's a pretty girl.

168
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:26,682
Pretty girls don't get tickets.

169
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,341
I bet she's been pulled over tons
of times, never once gotten one.

170
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,471
That is outrageous!

171
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,115
And factual.

172
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:35,556
License and re...

173
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:38,851
Honey.

174
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,520
Don't cry.

175
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,522
It's okay. No ticket for you.

176
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:47,151
Go a little slower next time, okay?

177
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
Thank you.

178
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,004
Excuse me.
I think I left something in New Jersey.

179
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,548
How did your lunch go
with the rich guy?

180
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:07,212
Well, it started off great.

181
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:09,298
I want to design a house

182
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,967
that celebrates the landscape
without overpowering it.

183
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:15,554
You know, when Frank Lloyd Wright
designed Fallingwater in 1935...

184
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,735
Yes, that's all fine.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

185
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,958
What I'm really worried about
is the basement.

186
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,188
- Specifically the laundry room.
- The laundry room?

187
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:27,700
I require a laundry room
of 15 feet by 15 feet,

188
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,305
stain-proof ceramic tile
from floor to ceiling.

189
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,901
I'm a man who likes to do
his own laundry, and sometimes,

190
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:36,700
it gets messy.

191
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,504
- Messy?
- Messy.

192
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:43,081
Steel chains will dangle from
the ceiling  at a height of nine feet.

193
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,641
And that is
where my laundry bags will hang

194
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:49,566
for three days
and three nights before I...

195
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,609
clean them.

196
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,762
Ted, it kind of sounds like
what this guy is asking you to design...

197
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,465
- It's a murder house.
- It is. It's totally a murder house.

198
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:03,561
You know, as a martial artist,
I'm trained to trust my instincts,

199
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,737
and my instincts are saying this...

200
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,979
feels very good.

201
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,894
The steak is so rare.

202
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,196
Right?

203
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,385
One final concern:

204
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,117
soundproofing.

205
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,859
I tend to make a lot of racket
when I launder.

206
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,057
I'll show you what I mean.

207
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,319
I'm gonna go to my laundry room,

208
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,378
and you tell me if you can hear me.

209
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,635
Does something feel off
about this guy?

210
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:39,243
Off the hook!

211
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,306
Bro, you are nailing this.

212
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,479
- You can't design a murder house!
- I'm not gonna design a murder house.

213
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,898
- You can't design a murder house!
- I'm not!

214
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,541
Bring it.

215
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,077
Officer, please,
my wife is about to have a baby!

216
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,160
- Her water just broke!
- Where's your wife?

217
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,916
She took the other car.

218
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,993
This is Italian leather, so...

219
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,753
I... Oh, come...

220
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:12,963
I'm sorry
about that murder house thing.

221
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,674
That was my bad.
That's on me.

222
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:16,800
New plan.

223
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:19,455
You, my friend, are gonna build

224
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,303
the Statue of Liberty

225
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,764
a husband.

226
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,183
Now, I got some suction down
at City Hall.

227
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,347
Stop it!

228
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:28,848
I don't want your help, okay?
You don't have to do this.

229
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,223
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

230
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,398
Because...

231
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:36,703
when you were with Stella,
I know how much I missed her.

232
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,819
I can only imagine you feel
the same way.

233
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:43,962
Let me put your mind at ease.

234
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,038
I don't want Stella back, okay?

235
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,007
She lied to me
and left me at the altar.

236
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:50,542
What kind of person does that?

237
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,697
I'm better off without her.

238
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,296
She's all yours, buddy.

239
00:11:58,621 --> 00:11:59,797
There you go.

240
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:01,385
Load off my mind.

241
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:03,768
<i>And that was it. Tony left,</i>

242
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:06,480
<i>and I began to put this whole
business far behind me.</i>

243
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:07,827
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

244
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:14,107
Tony broke up with me.

245
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:22,366
Tony broke up with you?

246
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,847
He said it was
because of something you said.

247
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,912
You got Tony to dump Stella?

248
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,786
I am very sorry,
but I'm going to have to insist

249
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:31,124
that you bump this.

250
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:34,586
Let's talk out in the hall.

251
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,665
It'll be waiting.

252
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,223
So, why are you here?

253
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,497
Look, Ted, this is about
seven months too late,

254
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:48,981
but here goes.

255
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:52,771
I've been in love with Tony
since high school.

256
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,930
We dated for a long time,
but then...

257
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,806
I got pregnant,
and I guess for two 19-year-olds

258
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:01,423
it was just too much to handle,
so we broke up.

259
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:05,432
And for a long time I just
focused on being a mother.

260
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:07,757
I forgot about Tony.
I forgot about...

261
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,347
the very idea of being in love.

262
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,593
And then you came along
and reminded me.

263
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:17,671
And I loved you for that.

264
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:22,564
I loved you so much, in fact,
that it was just...

265
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,053
shy of enough.

266
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,508
But I never stopped loving Tony.

267
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,721
Take him back, honey.
He's sorry.

268
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,628
No, that's not...
that's not what's happening.

269
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:38,859
Just go back inside, Mrs. Matsen.

270
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,283
- It was good seeing you, Stella.
- Can you talk to Tony?

271
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,270
What?

272
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,709
He'd listen to you.

273
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,046
You changed his mind.
You could change it back.

274
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:55,709
I know it's an awful thing to ask...

275
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,044
Yeah, it's an awful thing to ask.

276
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:00,211
I don't know what else to do, okay?

277
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:01,273
I love him.

278
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,171
You love him.

279
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:05,886
So what, you're-you're appealing
to the romantic in me?

280
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:07,846
Is that your strategy?

281
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:09,973
Because that guy's gone.

282
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,086
You can't pull
those strings anymore.

283
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:14,944
They're not attached
to anything thanks to you.

284
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,342
Go ahead, honey, kiss him!

285
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,566
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!

286
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:24,391
Okay, you can do this.
You can do this!

287
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:27,920
Oh, you can do this.

288
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,244
- License and regis...
- License and registration.

289
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,746
Excuse me?

290
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,103
I can only assume you need a license
to have a face that beautiful.

291
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:37,858
And that body?

292
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:41,345
I'm guessing something that
explosive has to be registered

293
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,274
with the proper authorities.

294
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,091
Get out of the car.

295
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,237
Why, am I under arrest?

296
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:54,601
But you're about to be under me.

297
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,482
No. False.
Did not happen.

298
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,351
That's a line from a porno.
I've seen that porno.

299
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:05,575
Hell, I've made that porno.

300
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:08,035
When will you realize
that the only difference

301
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,102
between my real life and a porno
is my real life has better lighting?

302
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,452
You're lying.

303
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,941
I am not lying!

304
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:16,414
I swear on my mother.

305
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:18,729
I swear on Goliath National Bank.

306
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,543
I swear on my suits.

307
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:21,416
I...

308
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,508
am...

309
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,480
not...

310
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:24,579
lying.

311
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:27,008
<i>He was lying.
Here's what really happened.</i>

312
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:29,218
Go ahead, honey, kiss him.

313
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,429
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!

314
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:37,602
Is there anything I can do
to make this better?

315
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,570
It's me! It's Barney. It's me!
I need your help! I'm in big trouble!

316
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:48,864
Slow down. What happened?

317
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,662
I'm guessing something
that explosive hasto be registered

318
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,573
with the proper authorities.

319
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,354
- Get out of the car.
- Why, am I under arrest?

320
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,786
Yes, you are. I ran your plates.
You've had 15 moving violations

321
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:04,420
in the last three days.
Get out of the car.

322
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,506
But no, my wife's having a baby!

323
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:09,509
- I have a sausage with your name on it!
- Out of the car now!

324
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,304
I need you to come
to Brazzaville, New Jersey

325
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:14,431
and bail me out.

326
00:16:14,782 --> 00:16:16,182
I'm in the middle of something.

327
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,903
Hurry, Ted. You have no idea

328
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:20,520
of the kind of the hardened criminals
they've got me in here with.

329
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,023
Are we gonna get
our spray paint back?

330
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,269
Save me, Ted!

331
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,280
You want to do something for me?
I need a ride to New Jersey.

332
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,133
You'll pay for tolls, right?

333
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,956
I'm kidding.

334
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:40,061
<i>So Stella and I drove
all the way out to New Jersey,</i>

335
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,936
<i>bailed your Uncle Barney out of jail</i>

336
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,438
<i>and drove all the way home.</i>

337
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,446
By the way, how's
that girl you've been seeing?

338
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,436
That super hot French chick
with the big enormous boobs?

339
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,719
Oh, you mean Claudette?

340
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,415
She's... fine.

341
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,833
Man, she's the hottest girl
you have ever been with, Ted.

342
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,057
Ever!

343
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:07,025
I'm so sorry again about everything.

344
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,403
- For what it's worth...
- I'll talk to Tony.

345
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:12,238
Really?

346
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,930
I want you to be happy, Stella.

347
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,030
I'll talk to him.

348
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:17,953
<i>And I did.</i>

349
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:22,119
<i>I don't remember what I said to him,
but I guess I changed his mind</i>

350
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:23,770
<i>because the next day,</i>

351
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:26,628
<i>they flew to California.</i>

352
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,699
<i>Stella set up
a new dermatology practice.</i>

353
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:33,420
<i>And against all odds, Tony found
some success as a screenwriter.</i>

354
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:36,611
<i>His movie, </i>The Wedding Bride,
<i>was a big hit.</i>

355
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,407
<i>But we'll get to that later.</i>

356
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,262
But just tell me this.

357
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:41,601
Why Tony?

358
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,764
I mean, is it the money,
the kung fu pajamas?

359
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,574
Like, what...
what is it?

360
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:49,106
He's the one.

361
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,862
The one.

362
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,856
Yeah, I know it's kinda sappy,
but, yeah.

363
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:02,690
I'm gonna say something
out loud that I've been doing

364
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,453
a pretty good job of not
saying out loud lately.

365
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:09,467
What you and Tony have...

366
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:12,757
What I thought for a second
you and I had...

367
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,553
What I know that Marshall
and Lily have...

368
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,367
I want that.

369
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:22,281
I do.

370
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,208
I keep waiting for it to happen
and waiting for it to happen,

371
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,333
and...

372
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:30,684
I guess I'm just...

373
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,445
I'm tired of waiting.

374
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,268
And that is all I'm going
to say on that subject.

375
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:46,958
I once talked my way
out of a speeding ticket?

376
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:48,168
Really?

377
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:50,712
I was heading upstate
to my parents' house

378
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,608
doing, like, 90 on this country road,
and I got pulled over.

379
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,738
So this cop gets out of his car.

380
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:58,111
He kind of swaggers on over
and he's, like,

381
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:00,680
"Young lady,
I have been waiting for you all day."

382
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:03,989
So I looked up at him and I said,

383
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:06,978
"I'm so sorry, Officer.
I got here as fast as I could."

384
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:09,064
For real?

385
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:12,423
It's an old joke.

386
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,354
I know that you're tired of waiting,

387
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:22,021
and you may have to wait
a little while more,

388
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:24,704
but she's on her way, Ted.

389
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:30,039
And she's getting here
as fast as she can.

390
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,813
She tracked me down two days
later using a phone book.

391
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:20,051
And that's the last time I wrote
my name in my undergarments.

392
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:25,853
You're back!

393
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:29,879
When you told me
that peanut butter and jam joke,

394
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:31,980
I was completely disgusted.

395
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:35,316
But I was in the shower this morning
and it popped into my head

396
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,797
and it actually made me laugh.

397
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:39,383
Peanut butter.

398
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:43,168
So I can see now
how I may have overreacted.

399
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:44,576
Marshall's words, not mine.

400
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,662
It's good to see you again, Lily.

401
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,820
Thanks.

402
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:51,945
- So what have you been up to?
- I'm going to an amnesia ward

403
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,635
with a bunch of photos
of my children and a wedding ring.

404
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,131
I'm gonna find the hottest
patient/my wife, and we are going...

405
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,490
Okay, so that's good
enough for tonight.

406
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:02,218
I gotta ease back into this.
