1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,800
Kids this is the story of the cab ride that changed my life

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,800
I know it sounds crazy

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,600
before all I know my life would be very different if I've taken,say

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,800
that cab,or that cab

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,200
God knows what will happen if I got into that cab

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,500
I took this cab

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,400
and it changed my whole life

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
But first we need to back up a little

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,500
hey any beer in the fridge?

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,900
It's 10 in the morning

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
grab me one

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,300
so something bad just happened

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
stella and I were out having breakfast

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,700
so my sister broke up with her boyfriend

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
I can finally say it

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I hated that guy. 

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,200
everything in his month is I am a vegen,fish feel pain.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,800
I am never constipate.That guy is an idiot

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,900
Actually she is marrying him 

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,100
I just wanna know your honest opinion

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,900
He is actually a real nice guy  I think there is a wisdom to catch

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,830
 Anyway, they picked a date, so, uh,

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,100
you want to come with me,

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,400
so that we can laugh our asses off

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,960
as we watch him walk barefoot down the aisle

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,000
in a hemp tuxedo?

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah, sure. When is it?

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,730
Uh, first weekend in November.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,900
<i>Is that</i>

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,160
the something bad?

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,660
That she invited you to a wedding?

32
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,060
Six months from now.

33
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,500
As in we'll be together six months from now.

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,030
 Do you guys remember

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,500
Barney's whole thing about making plans in a relationship?

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,200
 Fourth row.

37
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,760
Ted, no.

38
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,830
You're violating the date-time continuum.

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,660
You never make plans with a girl further in the future

40
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,500
than the amount of time you've been going out.

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,360
You've been dating this girl for,what,two weeks?

42
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,800
No, you're not taking her to a Springsteen concert in January.

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,000
By that time you won't even remember this Robin girl's name.

44
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,000
Ugh, man, I love Springsteen!

45
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,930
He's like the American Bryan Adams.

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,560
But Barney had a point.

47
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,060
As soon as she started talking about the wedding,

48
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,530
it freaked me out.

49
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,160
Oh,that sounds like so much fun.

50
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,960
So I get to look  forward to it

51
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,000
for six months.

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,330
Which is twice as long as we've been dating.

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,530
Uh-oh.

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,130
I'm sure  your daughter Lucy'll come

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,560
so it'll be like a... a family trip.

56
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,160
Our first trip as our funny little family.

57
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,400
So that... that'll  be super-exciting.

58
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,330
Oh, boy.

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,200
Man, they crank up the heat in these places.

60
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,000
What's going on, Ted?

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,360
 We need to talk.

62
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,700
Oh. Oh. Oh.

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,400
"We need to talk"?

64
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,060
There's only two situations where you say that to someone

65
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,660
and unless you're pregnant,

66
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,330
 it sounds like you  broke up with her.

67
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,230
Yeah, I did.

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
So how did she take it?

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,530
I'm only trying to be honest with you.

70
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,400
You know,Ted. I have to go to work.

71
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,930
Stella, can we just...

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,930
I don't want to leave it like this.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,660
No, Ted, it's okay.

74
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,900
 We're good.

75
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,660
Ow!

76
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,200
Look, I know it sounds rough,

77
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,530
but Stella's a mom.

78
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
I have to be responsible.

79
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,400
If I'm having these feelings now,

80
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,100
what if they don't go away?

81
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,730
What if they just get worse and worse?

82
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,830
and six months from now, I break up with her

83
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,230
over tofu salmon at her sister's wedding?

84
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,700
 I can't do that to her.

85
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,560
And I definitely can't do that to her daughter.

86
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,960
It sucks, but I'm being the good guy here.

87
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,760
This is the right decision.

88
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,330
<i>Which brings me back</i> <i>to the cab ride.</i>

89
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,430
Hello, may I speak with Marshall Eriksen?

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Hey, guys.

91
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,400
Jell-O?

92
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,400


93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:01,030


94
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,260
can't believe this you are totally fine.

95
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,760
No, I'm not fine.

96
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,530
I made the biggest mistake of my life.

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,960
I want Stella back.

98
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,360
I've left her like ten messages,  but her phone's off.

99
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,300
She's at that arcade Kiddie Funland with her daughter.

100
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,360
Please.

101
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,000
Let me go to Kiddie Funland.

102
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,860
You can say that all you want, buddy,

103
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,530
but you're not getting any morphine.

104
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,860
No, I'm serious. I got to get out of here.

105
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,300
You're not going anywhere until we get the tests back.

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,730
You could have internal bleeding.

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,560
Your brain could be all full of blood.

108
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,900
Think that's good for it?

109
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,030
It ain't.

110
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,500
This sucks.

111
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
This sucks.

112
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,630
-This sucks. This sucks. -Are you...

113
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,800
are you kidding me?

114
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,530
You walked away from a car accident without a scratch.

115
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
A miracle took place today.

116
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,600
Oh, here we go.

117
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,500
You don't think this was a miracle?

118
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,900
There's no such thing as miracles.

119
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,330
March 2006, MacLaren's Bar.

120
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,560
That's terrible. Gentle.

121
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,760
That's in! Gentle.

122
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,700
Ow.Here we go.

123
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,760
Hey!

124
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,800
Bravo.

125
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,130
Cheers...

126
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,330
No... way.

127
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,260
That did not just happen.

128
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,260
Am I dead?

129
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,160
Am I dead?

130
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,400
Miracle!

131
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,430
A pencil went up Barney's nose,

132
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,460
 and you call it a miracle.

133
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,530
Well, do you have a better explanation for it?

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,230
A drunk jackass with a box of pencils?

135
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,400
A drunk jackass called "God!"

136
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,430
And a box of pencils called "destiny!"

137
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,800
Speaking of Barney, I should give him a call.

138
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,460
Why? We're not friends anymore.

139
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,030
You'd want to know if this happened to him.

140
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,900
Go for Barney.

141
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,260
Hey, Barney.

142
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,030
Listen, I have something to tell you.

143
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,030
Oh, boy, here we go.

144
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,730
I've been waiting for this one.

145
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,900
 You talked to Robin.

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,300
She told you what's under the hood

147
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,430
and you want to take it for a spin yourself.

148
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,430
Not even if you boiled it in detergent.

149
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,560
It's about Ted.

150
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,600
Ted?

151
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,000
My former best friend Ted

152
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,060
who I asked you never to mention to me again?

153
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,100
 Yeah.

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,830
 He's been in a car accident.

155
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,660
He's at Saint Anthony's hospital.

156
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,760
Everything's...

157
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,760
No, I understand.

158
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,560
You've got that important thing.

159
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,800
Okay.

160
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,430
Oh, of course

161
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,630
I'll tell him you love him.

162
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,560
Okay.

163
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,560
Suit up!

164
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,230
He is always saying stuff like that!

165
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,200
-He hung up, didn't he?  -Yeah.

166
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,200
See, I told you.We're not friends anymore.

167
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,260
My best friend needs me!

168
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,760
What did he say?

169
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,760
Ah, a hundred and thir... What?

170
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,930
You...

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,130
I'm coming, Ted.

172
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,760
So, what made you change your mind about Stella?

173
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,260
Well, I was in the cab,and the car was coming at me,

174
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,760
and you know how they say that your whole life flashes

175
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,800
before your eyes in a near-death experience?

176
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,300
It doesn't.

177
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,830
You don't see everything.

178
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
Just the things you love.

179
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,700
I realized in that moment

180
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,530
that Stella is the most important thing in my life

181
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,960
and-and I have to get her back.

182
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,960
Miracle!

183
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,460
Very sweet.

184
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,130
Very romantic.

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,960
Not a miracle.

186
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,630
July 1999.

187
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,630
Kennedy Airport.

188
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,900
So, did you enjoy...

189
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,330
Amsterdam?

190
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,860
No.

191
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,160
Nothing illegal.

192
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,560
 Paintings.

193
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,400
 All right,  Bob Marley.

194
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,430
Let's have a conversation.

195
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,530
Shift change.

196
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,060
Oh, Amsterdam.

197
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,960
 All right.

198
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,530
 Float on through, brother.

199
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,530
Miracle!

200
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,330
Don't you go into the light!

201
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,500
Don't you do it!

202
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,360
Hey, Mosby,

203
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,430
 you got a visitor.

204
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,600
Hey, guys.

205
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,360
Hey. 

206
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,260
Can you guys,uh,give us a minute?

207
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,260
 Stella, before you  say anything...

208
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,030
 I love you.

209
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,700
  I love you, too.

210
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
 Can we just forget about...

211
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,300
It's forgotten.

212
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Is this your chart?

213
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,560
 Okay.

214
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,300
Everything looks good.

215
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,300
I think you can handle it.

216
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
Handle what?

217
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,230
This morning he dumped her

218
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,130
and now she's dry-humping him on a hospital bed.

219
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
-Miracle!   -Yeah,

220
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,030
you know, I bet  if you call up the Vatican,

221
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,130
they will tell you that most of their certified miracles

222
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,760
involve dry-humping, so.

223
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,060
April 2008.

224
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,400
Lily's kindergarten classroom.

225
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,760
You're gonna go in there

226
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,330
and beg for your old job back?

227
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,530
That's crazy.

228
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,060
You hated it there.

229
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,060
I-I know, the job market is  just really bad right now.

230
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,660
Hey, kids,

231
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,760
who wants Uncle Marshall to get his old job back?

232
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,960
They'll cheer for anything if you say it like that.

233
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,300
Kids, a super tanker

234
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,460
spilled five million  gallons of oil

235
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,930
off the coast of Alaska this morning!

236
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,430
Hello, Marshall.

237
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,700
Mr. Hewitt,

238
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
I came here to apologize.

239
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,900
I'm going to go  grab some more glue.

240
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,660
Will you watch them for a sec?

241
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,860
Of course.

242
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,260
Leaving Nicholson Hewitt,and West was a huge mistake,

243
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,630
and I can see that now.

244
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,860
So...

245
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,430
who wants to see the big guy

246
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,330
put on these tiny hats?

247
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,300
My behavior was disrespectful.

248
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,030
It was unprofessional.

249
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,960
I'm a pilgrim.

250
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,500
I know it looks like  I have a tiny hat,

251
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,500
but in reality, I have an abnormally large head!

252
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I was going through a stressful time.

253
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,400
I wasn't getting enough sleep.

254
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,430
Fourscore and seven years ago,

255
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,200
I had a great, big giant head!

256
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,100
I had just bought an apartment,

257
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,730
and there were some problems.

258
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
I-I don't want to bore you with the details.

259
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,760
I only regret that I have but one giant head

260
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,600
to give for my country.

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,330
Sir, if you could just see your way into giving me

262
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,660
-one more chance,  I promise...   -Marshall.

263
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,900
I'm willing to give this a second chance.

264
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,230
I remember my first years as an attorney.

265
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,000
Why, I don't know how  many hours I spent.

266
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,100
I don't think  I ever left...

267
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,460
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

268
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,260
<i>I have lice.</i>

269
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,460
<i>Those little bastards</i><i>gave me lice.</i>

270
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,800
<i>God, it itches.</i>

271
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,960
<i>Don't scratch it.</i>

272
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,100
<i>You'll look like a fool.</i>

273
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,930
<i>You'll never get your job back.</i>

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,400
<i>Okay, you can scratch,</i><i>but just make it subtle.</i>

275
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,000
<i>Okay, that's not working.</i>

276
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,530
<i>Oh, sweet, sharp corner</i><i>of the desk,</i>

277
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,160
<i>how I long to rub</i> <i>my infested scalp against you.</i>

278
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,500
I was, um... just, uh...

279
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,900
You okay, Eriksen?

280
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,600
Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good.

281
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,800
I am good.

282
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,430
Continue.

283
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,430
<i>Mind over matter.</i>

284
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,360
<i>There are no lice in my hair...</i>

285
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,960
<i>laying eggs,</i>

286
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,830
<i>burrowing into my scalp,</i>

287
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,130
<i>eating their way all the way</i> <i>down to my brain!</i>

288
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
I have lice!

289
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,600
"Lice"?! Lice! Get out!

290
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,100
Get out of my office!

291
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,760
We've got lice!

292
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,260
Everybody out of the building.

293
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,700
If it weren't for the lice,

294
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,130
I would have gotten my job back,

295
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,930
and I would have been working there when,

296
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,530
<i>two weeks later,the Securities</i><i>and Exchange Commission</i>

297
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,830
<i>came a-knocking.</i>

298
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,060
God sent those lice to my head

299
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,260
like he sent  the locusts to Egypt:

300
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,800
to liberate me from corporate bondage.

301
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,260
Miracle.

302
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,360
Hey, guys.

303
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,300
Oh, I'm just so glad

304
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,960
-you and Ted are back together.  -Yeah.

305
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,800
Wait, um, what do you mean "back together"?

306
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,160
Well, you know, since you guys broke up.

307
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,960
What? Oh, no.

308
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,130
It was just a small fight.

309
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,400
That wasn't a breakup.

310
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,530
Was that a breakup? Did he think that was a breakup?

311
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,400
What?

312
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,430
Son of a bitch!

313
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,930
That was a breakup. Wasn't it?

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,130
You broke up with me.

315
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,530
Yeah.

316
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,060
I didn't know that  that was a breakup.

317
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,360
Are you kidding?

318
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,730
I-I said, "I feel awful."

319
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,560
You said, "We're good."

320
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,930
Then you got up and left.

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,860
Yeah, I said, "We're good,"

322
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,400
as in "We're good."

323
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,130
Like when the waiter  comes around and asks

324
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,360
if you want any more muffins,  and you say, "We're good."

325
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,700
Exactly, and I took   that "We're good" to mean

326
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,930
you didn't want any more

327
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
metaphorical relationship muffins.

328
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,230
This is crazy.

329
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,730
Forget about all that.

330
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,030
That was a whole life-changing car accident ago.

331
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,300
I love you.

332
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,660
I don't want to break up.

333
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,130
But you did.

334
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,300
You did want to.

335
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,860
And if you had  those feelings once,

336
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,100
then you're going  to have those feelings again,

337
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,500
and you're going to keep on having them.

338
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,660
And I can't count on that car to hit you every time you do.

339
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,060
What are you saying?

340
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,100
I'm saying...

341
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,500
you wanted your breakup,

342
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,700
you got it.

343
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,860
What?! Stella, wait!

344
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,330
No, you know what, Ted?

345
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,230
We're good.

346
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,630
So you broke up with her and she didn't know it.

347
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,900
Apparently.

348
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,730
And you actually said, "I want to break up"?

349
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,830
No, of course not.

350
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,030
Who says "I want to break up"?

351
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,060
That's a horrible thing to say.

352
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,560
Well, that's true.

353
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,430
Hello?

354
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,360
Hi, Ted Mosby?

355
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,800
We have you listed as the emergency contact  for Barney Stinson.

356
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,430
What is it?

357
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,300
What it was was this.

358
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,260
I made it.  I made it!

359
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,830
Dude, I...

360
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,760
I can't believe you ran all the way up here.

361
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,930
Jeez. Flatter yourself much?

362
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,360
What an ego on this guy.

363
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,560
Um, I was up in this part of town

364
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,130
because I had to attend

365
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,430
a very important international business meeting.

366
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,030
If you're here to come crawling back,  just save it.

367
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm doing awesome without you.

368
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,930
Even better now,'cause I can play

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,760
the sympathy card with the females.

370
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,830
And BTW,

371
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,360
there's one bone downstairs that ain't broken.

372
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,960
Marshall,

373
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,860
you know what I'm talking about.

374
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,500
Up top!

375
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,800
Are you sure?

376
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,300
Yeah, dude. Why do you think I had them set it this way?

377
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,630
Okay.

378
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,830
Worth it.

379
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,260
Barney, you, uh...

380
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,160
You could've died.

381
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,830
Ted, I'm sorry I broke the bro code.

382
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,330
No, I'm-I'm sorry.

383
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,730
Ted, can we be friends again?

384
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,260
Barney, come on, we're... we're more than friends.

385
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,530
We're brothers.

386
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,930
You're my brother, Ted.

387
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're my brother, Barney.

388
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,130
Did you hear that, Marshall?

389
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,660
We're brothers now.

390
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,000
Marshall's my brother, too.

391
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,760
We're all brothers.

392
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,630
Yeah, but I'm your  best brother, right?

393
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,200
And that's how your Uncle Barney

394
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,760
and I buried the hatchet.

395
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,560
It got pretty mushy and embarrassing after that.

396
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,360
<i>Let's skip ahead.</i>

397
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,530
I had to look away because if I watched

398
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,130
what the paramedics were about to do,

399
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,300
I would have passed out.

400
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,030
Then they took out this

401
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,530
electric blade thing  and I kept thinking,

402
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,730
"This isn't happening. This isn't happening."

403
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,030
Oh, my God. What did they cut?

404
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,130
My suit.

405
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,430
My beautiful suit.

406
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,900
But you're alive,and, and Ted's alive.

407
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,530
This is amazing!

408
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,860
Two miracles in one day.

409
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,530
What is the matter with you?

410
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,700
How can you possibly be this cynical?!

411
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,700
-You want to know?  -Yeah.

412
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,300
-You really want to know?  -Yeah!

413
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,860
Fine.

414
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,300
When I was a kid,

415
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,060
I had this dog, Sir Scratchawan.

416
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,930
Anyway, Sir Scratchawan got really old,

417
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,900
so my parents decided to put him down.

418
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,460
It was the toughest day of my young life.

419
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,330
Good-bye, Sir Scratchawan.

420
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,800
I love you.

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
And when they took  him to the vet,

422
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,530
he told them that  earlier that very day,

423
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,300
he had learned about   an experimental procedure

424
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,460
called a canine/testudine cerebro-xenograft.

425
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,730
Ever heard of it?

426
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,100
No.

427
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,630
Well, it saved  Sir Scratchawan's life.

428
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,030
He lived another seven years.

429
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,400
-Miracle.   -Except for one...

430
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,760
kind of big side effect   from the surgery.

431
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,830
Sir Scratchawan!

432
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,460
Welcome home!

433
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,660
He turned into a turtle.

434
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,430
I know. It's weird, right?

435
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,030
Apparently, a very common  complication

436
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,400
from canine/testudine  cerebro-xenografts.

437
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,500
And he didn't seem to remember any of his old tricks.

438
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,630
Go get it, Scratchy.

439
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,600
Go get it!

440
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,760
Go get it! Get it!

441
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,200
Go get it, Scratchy.

442
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,660
Go get it.

443
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,460
How long was it before...?

444
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,460
Longer than I'm proud of, Lily.

445
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,660
Longer than I'm proud of.

446
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,500
And that's when I realized

447
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,960
miracles ain't real.

448
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,060
Excuse me.

449
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,800
Mosby, you're still here?

450
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,630
Your tests came back, like, an hour ago. You're fine.

451
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,530
Are you kidding me?Why didn't you tell me?!

452
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,200
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,330
I guess it was rude of me to keep resuscitating that guy

454
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,100
with a rake sticking out of his chest.

455
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,560
Um, I have to go right now.  Barney, I...

456
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,530
Go.

457
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,560
Run, Ted. Run.

458
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,860
If there's anything I've taught  you over the years, it's...

459
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,800
Barney, he left.

460
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,130
Hey, Ted said that right before the accident,

461
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,560
his life flashed   before his eyes.

462
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,060
You know, all the stuff he loves.

463
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,900
-Did that happen to you? -Oh, yeah.

464
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,430
-I know what he saw: boobs.   -Scotch.

465
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,000
And money.

466
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,600
-Suits. -A suit of money.

467
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,830
A suit of boobs.

468
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,730
A giant boob wearing a suit of money.

469
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,200
And the boob is lactating scotch.

470
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,100
I guess that's pretty much everything you love, right?

471
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,760
Yeah, pretty much.

472
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,030
i>Kids, a lot</i><i>of weird, random things</i>

474

476
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,160
<i>but because</i>  <i>of what happened next.</i>

477
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,460
Can I talk to you?

478
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,460
Okay.

479
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,300
I got you this orange kangaroo.

480
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,960
Uh... thanks.

481
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,830
So I've been thinking  about what changed

482
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,500
from the moment I broke up with you

483
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,130
to the moment I knew  I wanted you back.

484
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,760
And, um, I think I finally  figured out what happened.

485
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,900
Your cab got T-boned by a jackass on a cell phone?

486
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,560
No. I changed.

487
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,630
I'm ready to give you  what you need.

488
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,100
That's why I spent

489
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,260
ten minutes on the damn claw machine

490
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,930
trying to get the big,fake diamond ring.

491
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,260
But all I could get   was this orange kangaroo.

492
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,300
Diamond ring?

493
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,800
Will you marry me?

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
