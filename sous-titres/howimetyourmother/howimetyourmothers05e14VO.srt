1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,210
<i>Kids, we all have different
ways of dealing with nerves.</i>

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,709
It'll just be a few more
minutes, Mr. Stinson.

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,537
<i>Some people chew their nails.</i>

4
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:10,324
<i>Some people tap their feet.</i>

5
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,736
<i>And some people imagine
they're being interviewed</i>

6
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,680
<i>by renowned sportscaster Jim Nantz.</i>

7
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, friends.

8
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:19,632
Every sport has had an icon
who transcends the game.

9
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:22,404
Boxing had Ali,
basketball had Jordan,

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,732
and the sport of sleeping
with random hotties

11
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,652
has my next guest,
Mr. Barney Stinson.

12
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,454
- Barney, welcome.
- Thanks. Great to be back on the show.

13
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,816
Good to have you with us.
And, you know, the stats,

14
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:34,535
they really speak for themselves.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,245
Over 200 women spanning
six continents, 17 nationalities,

16
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:40,860
74 sexual positions

17
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:43,084
and not a single fatty.
It's impressive.

18
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,843
With these accomplishments, though,

19
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:48,269
there's one laurel
that's always eluded you.

20
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:51,050
Which brings us to last week.
What was the story there?

21
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:54,220
Buckle up, Jimbo,
this one's a doozy.

22
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:57,912
It all started when I decided
to set myself a little challenge.

23
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,537
He's calling his shot.

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,802
Whatever girl
I'm pointing to right now,

25
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:06,357
that's who I'm going
home with tonight.

26
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,038
Play ball!

27
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:16,367
How'd the date with Dale go?

28
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,537
You know, sometimes, that guy
with the horn-rimmed glasses

29
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,104
and the Smurfs T-shirt
is just being ironic.

30
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,953
Sometimes, he is a dork
with a lazy eye

31
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:27,420
and a love-hate relationship
with Gargamel.

32
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,884
Robin, just because
a guy talks a lot about

33
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,430
a fictional character on a first date
doesn't mean he's not husband material.

34
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:35,386
Sasquatch isn't fictional.

35
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:36,887
That was quick.

36
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,019
So, night one was pretty routine.

37
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:46,355
Jim, there is nothing routine
about the way I get down.

38
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,311
Respect.

39
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:49,567
Take us to night two.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,319
See that hottie over there
nursing a Black Russian?

41
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:55,489
She's about to chase that
with a white American. Up top!

42
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:58,825
You know...

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,511
if you're not careful,
you're going to lose me.

44
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,875
You guys, what should I say
when Dale calls for a second date?

45
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,906
How do you know he's going to call?

46
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:11,822
You're cute, Marshall.

47
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:15,134
But I think Mama knows
when a dude's digging the show.

48
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:18,053
I mean, he couldn't keep
his good eye off me.

49
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,017
Well, let him down easy.
People are fragile.

50
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:24,246
And sometimes, without
even meaning to, you might

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,182
rip someone's beating heart out
and stomp on it in a room full

52
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:30,584
of 26 people
and a teacher's assistant.

53
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,069
How did school go today, Ted?

54
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,695
Something bad happened.

55
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:36,989
The first class
of the new semester...

56
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,816
Jamie Adamic.

57
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,129
Brian Glow-atz.

58
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:48,935
Well done.

59
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,007
Adding a fake name
to the sign-up sheet.

60
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:54,673
That's real original, guys.
You know, I'd expect

61
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:58,495
inspired minds such as yours
to be a little more mature,

62
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,153
and frankly, more creative.
I mean, seriously.

63
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:03,808
What kind of a fake name is Cook Pu?

64
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:04,683
Here.

65
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,967
Come on, guys.
It's got to at least sound real.

66
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,546
Whatever happened to the classics?
Right, you know?

67
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,795
Seymour Butts.

68
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,531
Hugh Gerection. Those were fake names,
but Cook Pu?

69
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:19,907
Here.

70
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,339
She's back here, bro.

71
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:31,043
All right, come on, let me have it.
Bring on all the Cook Pu jokes.

72
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,511
We're not going to make jokes, Ted.

73
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,923
That girl must be
really down in the dumps.

74
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,780
You really... smeared the Pu name.

75
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:41,384
You guys finished?

76
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,764
Are you asking us if all the Pu
is out of our system?

77
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,288
Back-to-back nights.
Barney is on fire.

78
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,376
That girl's lucky.

79
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,723
Barney was the best sex I ever had.

80
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,568
He's the best friend I've ever had.

81
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,029
- He's everything I want Marshall to be.
- He's everything I wish I could be.

82
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:01,907
I'm just assuming that's what
they say when I'm not around.

83
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,868
I buy it. You're awesome.

84
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:05,452
Now, night three.

85
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:07,079
Paint us a word picture.

86
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:09,331
Jim, I could tell I was on a roll,

87
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,167
so I decided to mix things up
a little bit.

88
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:16,046
I think I'm going to go
small boobs tonight.

89
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,631
You're disgusting.

90
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:19,806
Lily, they're people, too.

91
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:24,187
- Here's your burgers.
- Thank you.

92
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:27,099
What, you're not sharing?
You two always share a burger.

93
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,094
We don't.

94
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,060
We're not like weirdos
who share everything.

95
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,645
- You are.
- Exactly.

96
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,355
We're perfectly normal!

97
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:34,815
What's going on?

98
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:38,143
You know how Lily and I have been
looking for new couple friends

99
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:40,429
ever since we lost Robin and Barney,

100
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:44,043
and Ted and Stella, and Ted and Robin,
and Ted and Victoria?

101
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:45,951
Geez, when are you going
to get your life?

102
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,453
How did we end up here?

103
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,422
We went on a great
double date last night.

104
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:52,859
It... we were cool.
We were casual.

105
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,101
We didn't spaz out.

106
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:56,874
And then, one tiny
little detail came out

107
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,505
and the whole night was ruined.

108
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:02,058
And Joeanna's toothbrush
flips off the side of the sink,

109
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:04,553
hits the ceiling and falls
right into the toilet.

110
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,991
- Come on.
- That's... That's crazy.

111
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:09,391
Last week, the same thing
happened to our toothbrush.

112
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:12,061
Our toothbrush?

113
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,938
Our toothbrush?

114
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:15,773
Our toothbrush?

115
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:18,943
Like, one toothbrush?

116
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:21,487
That you both use?

117
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:23,197
Every day?

118
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:24,782
Is that weird?

119
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,643
Super weird.

120
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:30,829
Marshall, four out of five dentists
just threw up in their mouths.

121
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:35,483
Check it out.
Barney's leaving with another girl.

122
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,630
Three girls in three nights.
That's gross, even for Barney.

123
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,216
Are you kidding?
He's on his way to a perfect...

124
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:43,926
Don't say it!

125
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,179
- You'll jinx it.
- Jinx what?

126
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:49,139
I was on my way toward...

127
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,366
a perfect week.

128
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,172
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

129
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,531
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

130
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,658
The perfect week.

131
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,036
Seven nights, seven girls,
zero rejections.

132
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,096
Incredible.

133
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,975
I mean, it's really
like the sexual equivalent

134
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,084
of baseball's perfect game,
but even rarer.

135
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:19,519
Yeah.
The only player in history

136
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:21,024
to have ever achieved both

137
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:24,008
was Mustache Pete Drexell
back in 1896.

138
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:30,848
Now, this wasn't the first time
you'd come close to a perfect week.

139
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:33,108
You learned the hard way, though...

140
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,602
one mistake, and it's all over.

141
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,540
<i>Sometimes,
a teammate makes an error.</i>

142
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:42,609
<i>Sometimes, one wild pitch...</i>

143
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:46,405
You, me, the canned food aisle
in the bodega next door.

144
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,023
<i>... leads to a walk.</i>

145
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,062
<i>And sometimes, you just lose focus.</i>

146
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,761
<i>And that almost always leads
to a hit.</i>

147
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:59,308
But this week,
you were three for three

148
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,086
with no sign of slowing down.

149
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,754
I could do no wrong.

150
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,716
Wish I could say the same
for my friends.

151
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,677
Cook didn't show up for class today.

152
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:10,187
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,517
Yeah, Ted, we know, like,
a ton of people named Cook.

154
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,069
Here we go.
The dreaded Dale call.

155
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:27,788
It's my mom.

156
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:30,482
She's going through some pretty
major league health stuff.

157
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,302
God, why won't that guy call?

158
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,080
Wait a minute.
You want him to call?

159
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,664
No! Shut up.

160
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,460
Don't you guys have, like, a...
a toothbrush to share or something?

161
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,977
Yeah. When did you guys
even start doing that anyway?

162
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:46,924
Like, years ago. You should know.
We lived with you.

163
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,278
Yeah, but you always
kept your toothbrush in the bedroom.

164
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,595
Also weird, by the way.

165
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,138
We kept it in the bathroom.

166
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:56,536
No, there was only one toothbrush
in the bathroom, and it was mine.

167
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,424
Wait.

168
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,349
Are you saying...

169
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:05,619
... that for eight years,

170
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:08,654
All three of you
shared one toothbrush?

171
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,830
- Oh, my God.
- Kill me.

172
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,957
So, you're through four nights.
You're over the hump.

173
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:20,958
Nice.

174
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,459
I try. I'm no you.

175
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,340
But then came night five,
and with it, trouble.

176
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:31,426
Beer here.

177
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,310
How's Barney doing tonight?

178
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,063
Cool as a cumber.
Just like he's been all week.

179
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,024
- That's hard to believe.
- Why?

180
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,817
Apparently, this big merger
fell through last week

181
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,553
and Barney's being blamed for it.

182
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,613
That's weird.
He hasn't said anything.

183
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:54,361
I work with the guy.
I didn't find out until this afternoon,

184
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:55,993
when I walked by his boss's office.

185
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:58,318
<i>... you cost this company, Stinson?!</i>

186
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,289
I'd never seen Barney
look that scared.

187
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:03,346
I think he's going to get fired.

188
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,217
I can't believe he might get fired.

189
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,689
They're having a meeting on Friday
to determine if he keeps his job.

190
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,703
Poor guy. He must be freaking out.
I'm going to go talk to him.

191
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,687
You can't distract a man
in the middle of a... you-know-what.

192
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:25,804
Come on, this is his career.

193
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:28,770
This is much more important
than some stupid perfect...

194
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,261
You can lick my hand
as long as you want.

195
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,180
I'm not going to let you ruin his...

196
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:37,993
Guys, we need to talk to him.

197
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:39,232
I'll go.

198
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:40,913
He needs a bro.

199
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,955
- Everything all right?
- Absolutely. Sure.

200
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,689
Top of the world.

201
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,106
Who am I kidding?

202
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,158
- I need your help.
- Anything, buddy. What is it?

203
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,681
Which one of these girls
looks the dumbest?

1
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:02,654
All right, kid.

2
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:05,106
Let's check the scouting report.

3
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:08,162
What about the heater?

4
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,900
High and outside?

5
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,146
All right.

6
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:23,872
I'd go with the slider.

7
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,331
Thanks, Skip.

8
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:33,548
So, what did he say?

9
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:37,386
He's going to take a swat
at the Hamburglar over there.

10
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,223
You were supposed to talk to him
about losing his job.

11
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,309
How is forcing him to dwell
on a problem he can do nothing?

12
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,812
How is ignoring it
going to solve anything?

13
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,495
You ignored good dental hygiene

14
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,232
for the better part of a decade...

15
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Cook Pu!

16
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,486
- Dale call yet?
- Why do you got to...

17
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,529
Guys, look!

18
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,242
I'm going to stop you.

19
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,910
There's a thing I have to ask.

20
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:05,747
Have you ever used
performance-enhancing drugs?

21
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,070
No, sir.

22
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:09,459
I respect the game too much.

23
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:13,130
Although,
I can't say I haven't been offered.

24
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:18,427
Dude, it was pretty awesome.

25
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:21,930
You should try it.
I have, I have some more.

26
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,265
No, thanks.

27
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,412
You sure?

28
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,771
All right, suit yourself.

29
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:30,106
What time is it?

30
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,145
It's 8:00.

31
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,616
I need to go to the hospital.

32
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:45,954
I'd never touch the stuff.

33
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,914
You can test me if you want,
Jim Nantz.

34
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,959
Barney, I trust you.
I regret I even asked you the question.

35
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,109
Let's go to night six.

36
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,816
Two girls away from perfection.

37
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,594
What are you doing here?
Get down to the bar!

38
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:02,048
Ted, relax.

39
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,555
I'm already six for six.

40
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:04,764
Really?

41
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,478
I was lunching
at Tavern on the Green,

42
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,645
I started chatting up
this Swedish supermodel.

43
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,759
Next thing you know,
I'm playing a day game

44
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:14,085
in the back
of a horse-drawn carriage.

45
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,090
Giddy-what-up?!

46
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,156
Awesome.

47
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:22,745
What really happened?

48
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,461
I had lunch at a Staten Island Chili's
and banged a drunk hairdresser.

49
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,953
Are you happy, Truthy McGee?

50
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:34,628
We know you might get fired.

51
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,583
Wait, you have to talk about this.

52
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,958
You are just using meaningless sex

53
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,636
to distract yourself
from a really serious issue.

54
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,770
It is not meaningless, okay?

55
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:47,316
Number five and I really connected.

56
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:48,957
She's going back to school.

57
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:52,646
Or has a kid in school...
Something about school!

58
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,897
So, today one of my students told me
Cook is dropping my class.

59
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,029
Pu dropped out?

60
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:04,750
She is flushing her education
down the toilet!

61
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,159
Any word from Dale?

62
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,412
It's only been five days,
he's gonna call!

63
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:10,872
Why do you care anyway?
You said he was a total dork.

64
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,083
Do not talk about Dale that way.

65
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,711
He is twice the man
you will ever be!

66
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,523
God forbid, if you can't find
another job, sell your place.

67
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:22,884
Marshall and I have an extra room.
You can stay there as long as you need.

68
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,886
Make sure
you bring your own toothbrush.

69
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,583
Lily, what are you doing?

70
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,349
Talking to my friend
who's going through a really tough time.

71
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:31,143
He's doing fine.

72
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,917
Trying to sleep
with seven women in seven nights

73
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,582
is not "doing fine,"

74
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:37,399
it's a cry for help.

75
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,108
Barney's life is a cry for help.

76
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:41,908
But you don't mess with a man
when he's in the middle of a perf...

77
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,030
What?
Perfect week?

78
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,582
Perfect week!

79
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:48,705
Grow up!

80
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,209
Unbelievable.

81
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,333
You know,
there's two things you don't do.

82
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:58,587
One: you don't open an e-mail
from Phil Simms in front of your kids.

83
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,090
And two: you don't jinx a man
going for a perfect week.

84
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,468
I don't know what to tell you.
Lily's messing.

85
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,928
I think
she has a thing for the Barnacle.

86
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:11,141
You're a keen observer
of the human condition, Jim Nantz.

87
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,270
- I can't believe you jinxed him.
- He doesn't stand a chance.

88
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,438
Question:

89
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,245
If I ruined everything,

90
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,364
why is Barney totally hitting it off

91
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:22,569
with Third Martini Girl over there?

92
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,023
- He's going to do it!
- See?

93
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,201
There is no such thing as a jinx.

94
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,121
Tell me she didn't say
"There's no such thing as a jinx".

95
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,206
Wish I could.

96
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:37,000
You were about to achieve
something so beautiful!

97
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:41,555
Thanks to her, the only thing
that could ruin a surefire hookup

98
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,423
was about to walk through that door.

99
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:49,913
A member of the 2009

100
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:53,183
World Champion New York Yankees.

101
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,229
Lily, I'm getting my own toothbrush.

102
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,907
I guess that's it.

103
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,504
- Barney's streak ends at six.
- What?

104
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,371
Why? Because of that guy
with the weird hair?

105
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:15,960
That's Nick Swisher.

106
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,318
He's a New York Yankee.

107
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,258
No normal guy in New York City
can compete with a Yankee.

108
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,893
It doesn't even have to be a Yankee.
When I first moved here,

109
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:27,978
 I was on a fourth date with a girl,
until I got rack-jacked

110
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,177
by Phil Rizzuto.

111
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,972
I was there.
Holy cow, that guy had game.

112
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:33,984
I'm not seeing it.

113
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,268
Let me try
to Canada this up for you, eh?

114
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:39,764
How would you react
if one of those Ca-chuck guys

115
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,774
with the skates and the sticks
walked in here?

116
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:47,087
If one of the Vancouver Canucks
walked in here,

117
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,753
my panties would drop so hard,

118
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:50,935
there'd be a hole
in the floor halfway to China.

119
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,746
- That's what it's like with them.
- Well, Barney's screwed.

120
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,495
It's happening! Look.

121
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,666
Want to come over
and look at my snow globe collection?

122
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,042
Snow globe collection?

123
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,669
He's throwing junk out there.

124
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,662
That is Nick Swisher!

125
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:10,165
- Good effort.
- Good game.

126
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:12,637
Not good enough.

127
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,715
This whole week was a waste.

128
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:18,235
And tomorrow,

129
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,220
I'm going to get fired.

130
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,583
I'm really sorry, dude.

131
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,551
But for what it's worth,
this week wasn't a waste.

132
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:29,649
We were all having

133
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:32,523
a really horrible week
and you took our minds off it.

134
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,458
I had my first student drop my class...
It sucked.

135
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,836
I met my soul mate
and he never called me back.

136
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:39,511
I mean yet.
He will.

137
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,458
He will.

138
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:45,545
We scared off a really great couple
just because we share a toothbrush.

139
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:48,048
You share a toothbrush?

140
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,758
Them and Ted.

141
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:51,897
Wait a second.

142
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:54,906
When we were dating, you borrowed
that toothbrush all the time.

143
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,647
<i>And that's when Aunt Lily realized
what's great about sports:</i>

144
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:03,688
<i>They take your mind off your troubles,
if only for a moment.</i>

145
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,744
<i>And deep down,
we all need that perfect week.</i>

146
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:11,863
The second she sits down
next to Swisher, it's all over.

147
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,416
Wait a minute!

148
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,411
<i>Aldrin's got a bead on her!</i>

149
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:24,779
<i>She's running out of room.</i>

150
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:26,044
<i>She dives...</i>

151
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,742
I have no idea where she's going.

152
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,758
Are you okay?

153
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,658
Sorry.
I'm such a klutz!

154
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,890
I think I twisted my ankle.
Can you get me some ice?

155
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:39,978
Of course.

156
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:42,161
She did it!

157
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:44,646
I guess there is no such thing
as a jinx!

158
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:52,070
I'll get you some ice, Lily.

159
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:53,956
Damn it.

160
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,333
Swisher's back in play!

161
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,367
Follow me.

162
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,571
This guy and his wife
share a toothbrush!

163
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:02,900
So?

164
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:05,583
That's weird, right?

165
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,585
I think it's kind of sweet.

166
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:11,875
In a way, aren't we all trying
to find that special someone

167
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,550
to share a toothbrush with?

168
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,959
Excuse me.

169
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,137
Nick Swisher thinks we're sweet.

170
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,552
Martini?

171
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,101
We're having a beer with a Yankee.

172
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:24,644
How cool is that?

173
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,362
It's amazing.
I totally follow baseball.

174
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:29,774
Mookie Wilson, is that a thing?

175
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,033
Baseball, it's amazing.

176
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,362
But I tell you one thing,
it's no hockey.

177
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:36,141
I live...

178
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,110
right upstairs.

179
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,935
What do you say
we go back to my place?

180
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:44,873
To be honest,

181
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,621
I don't normally do that, but...

182
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:49,352
I feel a real connection here,

183
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:50,628
seven... Christy.

184
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:55,896
Please.

185
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:00,333
I did it!

186
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:09,814
Amazing!

187
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,233
Congratulations
on your perfect week!

188
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,118
I couldn't have done it
without my teammates.

189
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:16,488
On to a new topic.

190
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,240
Do you really think
you might get fired today?

191
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:24,329
Jim, I told you
I don't want to talk about that.

192
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:29,348
I'm a figment of your imagination,
so apparently you do.

193
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:30,877
Think about that.

194
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:33,551
What a jerk.

195
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:35,472
You're a jerk.

196
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,552
Mr. Donovan will see you now.

197
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,558
We've reached a decision.

198
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:49,029
We're keeping you on.

199
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:53,024
I know this past week
must have been tough on you.

200
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:55,898
I barely slept.

201
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,196
Here you go.

202
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:01,533
The official hat
of Barney's perfect week.

203
00:20:02,162 --> 00:20:04,520
I was going to do shirts,
but you have to guess sizes.

204
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,329
And feelings get hurt.
It's a mess.

205
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:11,141
In commemoration of Barney's induction
into the Hall of Game,

206
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,445
this tie, worn on the seventh night
of his perfect week,

207
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,840
is hereby retired.

208
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,522
May Barney's heroic feat
be remembered

209
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,053
and spoken of
for generations to come.

210
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:26,067
I'm totally going
to sit my kids down one day

211
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:29,102
and tell them about the time
Barney nailed seven chicks in a row.

212
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:33,019
<i>Am I a bad dad?</i>

213
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,735
Take out order for Cook Pu?

214
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:40,822
We have a number two over here
for Cook Pu.

215
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,283
You guys got Wendy saying it now?

216
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,457
Come on, I get it.

217
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:49,332
Cook Pu is a stupid name,
it gets stupider the more you say it.
