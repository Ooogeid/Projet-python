1
00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:05,124
You will not believe what happened
at laser tag last night.

2
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:06,797
People freaked out because

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,425
a creepy man in a suit
wouldn't leave their kids alone?

4
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,720
Well, yeah, pretty much.

5
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,335
Come on!
You want it?!

6
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:22,843
My shoulder!

7
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:24,803
Come on.

8
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:28,402
Stinson, my office! Now!

9
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:29,487
Crap.

10
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,456
Disorderly game play,

11
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:34,784
three counts of shoving,
and now this!

12
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:37,070
Stinson, you're a liability!

13
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,640
I know, I don't play
by your precious rules, McCracken,

14
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:43,000
but, damn it, I get results!

15
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,073
Look, you're a good
laser tag player.

16
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:48,343
Maybe the best I've ever seen.

17
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:51,149
But one of these days,
you're gonna get someone hurt.

18
00:00:51,274 --> 00:00:52,510
Maybe even yourself.

19
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:55,297
You just forgot
what it's like out there.

20
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,140
You've had your fat ass stuck
behind that desk for too long.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,283
That's it!
You're out of here, Stinson!

22
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:02,078
Hand in your gun and your ID badge!

23
00:01:02,203 --> 00:01:03,403
With pleasure.

24
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,361
Please don't do this.
This game is all I got.

25
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:14,198
And I've almost got enough tickets
for the remote control helicopter.

26
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,492
Please.

27
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,971
I can't believe I'm doing this.

28
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,339
But I'm gonna give
you one last shot.

29
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,210
But so help me,

30
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,932
if you so much as step one toe
out of line,

31
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:31,370
you'll play Duck Hunt
in your mama's basement so fast,

32
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:33,237
it's gonna make your head spin.

33
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,477
Now, get out of here!

34
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,449
You won't regret this.

35
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,228


36
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:50,818
That's it, Stinson.
You're banned for life!

37
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,102
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

38
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,718
I can't believe you got kicked out
of laser tag. What are you gonna do?

39
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,618
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

40
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:20,765
I'll tell you
what Ted and I are gonna do.

41
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:25,325
We're gonna break in after hours
and TP the place.

42
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:29,996
Barney, we are too old
to cover a place in toilet paper

43
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,076
because they won't
let you play laser tag.

44
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:34,278
And for that matter,
too old for laser tag.

45
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:37,465
Ted, laser tag knows
no age restrictions.

46
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:39,533
Kind of like stripping
in the Midwest.

47
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:41,242
Yeah, whatever.

48
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,329
I'm adding laser tag
to the Murtaugh List.

49
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,758
- Jeez, not the Murtaugh List.
- What's the Murtaugh List?

50
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:49,015
<i>The Murtaugh List is something
that came into being</i>

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,699
<i>around the time I turned 30.</i>

52
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:53,130
<i>It all started with
yourUncle Marshall's beer bong.</i>

53
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,331
... two, one, chug!

54
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,950
<i>When we were in our early 20s,</i>

55
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,635
<i>every time we had a party,
that beer bong came out.</i>

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,460
<i>And around the time
we turned 30, same thing.</i>

57
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,643
<i>Of course, in our early 20s,
the next day would go like this.</i>

58
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:10,189
<i>But by the time we were 30,
the next day would go like this.</i>

59
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,106
<i>Then one day, in the throes of the worst
hangover of my life,</i>

60
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:19,490
<i>I realized there was only one person
in the world that I could relate to:</i>

61
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,980
<i>Detective Roger Murtaugh,
played by Danny Glover</i>

62
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,162
<i>in the'80s noir masterpiece</i>
Lethal Weapon<i>,</i>

63
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:28,015
<i>known for his
oft-quoted catchphrase:</i>

64
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,917
- I'm too old for this...
- Stuff.

65
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,496
<i>He said,
I'm too old for this stuff.</i>

66
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,674
It's sad to admit, but as you get older,
there's things you can't do anymore.

67
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,669
That's why I have this list, so
I never make the mistake of thinking

68
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:42,012
that I can still
pull an all-nighter.

69
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,873
I'm too old for that stuff.

70
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,685
Or eat an entire pizza
in one sitting.

71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,310
I'm too old for that stuff.

72
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,983
Or hang posters
on your wall without frames.

73
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,151
"Riggs."

74
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,158
I'm too old for that stuff.</i>

75
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,492
- By the way, how good is <i>Lethal Weapon?</i>
- I don't know. It's kind of a rip-off.

76
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:06,477
Old guy paired up
with a young renegade cop.

77
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:07,852
Sound familiar?

78
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,291
<i>Mackleroy and LaFleur.</i>

79
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:14,295
Don't tell me you guys have never seen
<i>Mackleroy and LaFleur.</i>

80
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:18,048
It's the greatest Canadian
action movie of all time.

81
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,354
Mackleroy is a young,
renegade Mountie

82
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,721
whose horse was just killed
by evil Americans,

83
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,308
while LaFleur, his grouchy,
old, African-Canadian partner,

84
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,269
just bought a cozy ice fishing
shack in northern Alberta...

85
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:36,442
- I got to go.
- Bye, baby. Have fun at practice.

86
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,486
Practice?

87
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,521
Is he doing that one-man
band thing again?

88
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,322
'Cause that was a bummer.

89
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:42,656
<i>Actually,</i>

90
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,542
<i>He had just taken over</i>

91
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,883
<i>as coach for Lily's
kindergarten basketball team.</i>

92
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:51,012
<i>He thought it'd be fun, but Lily saw it
as something more: dad practice.</i>

93
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:51,957
Hi.

94
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,084
Hey! Oh, my gosh!

95
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,045
Orange slices.
That is so sweet.

96
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:58,669
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't resist.

97
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:01,175
I wanted to see
Coach Marshmallow do his thing.

98
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,035
Hey, kids,
who wants to knock off early

99
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,599
and have some of these here
orange slices?

100
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,810
- Yeah!
- Yeah? Well, you can't!

101
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:15,253
Because oranges are for winners,
and you little turds

102
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:17,581
haven't even made a single shot yet!

103
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:20,882
You're embarrassing yourselves,
you're embarrassing Ms. Aldrin,

104
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,948
and worst of all,
you're embarrassing me!

105
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,074
That's it!

106
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,050
Suicides! Baseline! Now!

107
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:29,258
Run.

108
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,645
Ted, there is not
a single thing on here

109
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,356
that you are too old to do.

110
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:39,019
In fact, if you did
everything on the Murtaugh List,

111
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:40,798
I'd call that a pretty fun weekend.

112
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,791
Barney, you are not 18 anymore.

113
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,636
If you did everything
on that list, you would die.

114
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,988
- That wasn't a challenge.
- Challenge accepted.

115
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:52,447
In the next 24 hours,
I'm going to do

116
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:54,144
every single thing on this list.

117
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,745
And after I do,

118
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,983
you will TP
the laser tag place with me.

119
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:02,150
- And if you can't do it?
- I will spend three hours

120
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:05,072
listening to you
talk about architecture.

121
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,790
You have got yourself a deal.
Robin, will you do the honors?

122
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,194
A gentleman's agreement!

123
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,097
All right, chumps, let's do this.

124
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,039
You really want to make this bet
with him? You know how he is.

125
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,975
There is some pretty
tough stuff on that list.

126
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,969
I mean, do you really think
Barney's gonna get his ear pierced?

127
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,388
"Get ear pierced."
Check.

128
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:32,766
All right, I'm off to go
do laundry at Mom's house.

129
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,357
You mind if I crash
on your futon tonight?

130
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,318
- We don't have a futon.
- Put it over there, boys.

131
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,895
- What's going on?
- It's on the Murtaugh List.

132
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,949
"Crash on a friend's futon
instead of getting a hotel room."

133
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,695
I am too old for that stuff.

134
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,662
What's going on with your ear?

135
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,165
Looks like the inside
of a jack-o'-lantern on November 3rd.

136
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:59,557
What, this?
Ah, just a little infecsh.

137
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,935
Nothing a young guy like me
can't shake off.

138
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,590
Plus, "Put off going
to the doctor," on the list.

139
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:06,979
Hold on.

140
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:09,841
Go for Bar...

141
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,563
Keep running!

142
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,312
You know what's funny is, I was supposed
to come here to teach them...

143
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,773
Do not stop running!

144
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:24,401
This whole time, they've been
the ones who are teaching me.

145
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,199
That's not running!
That's falling!

146
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:35,713
<i>The next morning, Barney woke up
on the futon in our living room.</i>

147
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:42,584
Check.

148
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,080
"Drinking shots with strangers."

149
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,299
Check.

150
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,511
You OK, Barney?
It looks like you hurt your back.

151
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,178
Oh, no.
Just rocking a party hunch.

152
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:54,680
I like it.

153
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:57,559
Closer to my booze.
To youth.

154
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:09,217
Can I get a straw?

155
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:11,518
I must say,
there's something admirable

156
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:13,492
about the way he wants
to stay young at heart.

157
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,495
- I mean, who wants to get old?
- This guy.

158
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:21,917
Life is a meal
and old age is the dessert.

159
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,697
I spend so much of my time
worrying about the future.

160
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:26,975
Where's my career going?
Who am I gonna marry?

161
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,128
But when you're old,
you don't worry,

162
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,260
'cause all that stuff's
already happened.

163
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:33,790
You get to wear comfy shoes
and a chair takes you up

164
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,430
and down the stairs, it's perfect.

165
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,724
That's not perfect.
That's pathetic.

166
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,186
You can't just jump to the end.
The journey is the best part.

167
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,104
I used to feel that way, too,

168
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,939
but you'll understand
when you're a little bit older.

169
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:51,208
Marshall, can you try
not to pick on the kids today.

170
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,274
I'm not picking on the kids, Lily.

171
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,867
I'm picking on the culture
of losing around here.

172
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:57,355
I got to get them in shape

173
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,172
if they're gonna win
that game tomorrow.

174
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:00,297
Win?

175
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:02,166
We don't keep score.

176
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:06,170
- What?
- We don't keep score.

177
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:08,135
You don't keep s...

178
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,479
What's the point of playing
if you don't keep score?

179
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:12,805
How do you know...

180
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,679
Lily, what were you doing
with this team before I got here?

181
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,181
I was coaching them.

182
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,634
That's it, my little angels.

183
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,697
You're all luminous
wonderful beings of light.

184
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:27,107
- What's the score?
- It's all tied up at fun to fun!

185
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,487
Because that's the point of playing,
to have fun.

186
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:35,317
The point of playing
is to win the trophy.

187
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,410
And if you don't know who's
winning, who gets the trophy?

188
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,578
Everyone.

189
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,457
It's a participation trophy,
everyone gets one.

190
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,044
It's like you're speaking
Chinese to me right now.

191
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,777
- Hi, this is Barney.
- And Robin.

192
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:53,802
- We can't answer the phone because...
- He's watching sports and I'm...

193
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,441
Probably out shopping.

194
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:58,622
Leave a message,
we'll call you back just as soon...

195
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,740
- As...
- We...

196
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:00,807
Can!

197
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,547
"Leave an annoying two-person message
on your answering machine."

198
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,520
Check.

199
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,441
Probably gonna cost me
some dates, but it's okay.

200
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,872
Your ear's starting to smell.

201
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:13,509
It's good.

202
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,198
I hate to send it back,

203
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,884
but you did describe the turkey
as extremely lean,

204
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:21,120
and, well, you tell me.

205
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,203
All right. That's it.

206
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,874
- We have our own list.
- What?

207
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:28,481
This is a list of things
you're too young to do.

208
00:10:28,606 --> 00:10:32,256
Go out and do each one of these things,
tell me you still want to be an old man.

209
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:36,200
Remove "colonoscopy"
and "Have sex with an old lady",

210
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,803
and this is a cakewalk.

211
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:40,956
New stakes, then.

212
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,542
If I can finish your list
before you finish mine,

213
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,537
you have to come with me
to TP laser tag

214
00:10:45,662 --> 00:10:47,905
and you have to buy
the toilet paper.

215
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,288
And none of that biodegradable crap.
I want it up there forever.

216
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,714
Fine,
but if I finish your list first,

217
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,219
it's a six hour survey

218
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:57,288
of early 20th century
American architecture

219
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:00,096
and you can never do anything
on the Murtaugh List ever again.

220
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:02,828
- It's for your own good.
- You, sir, have got yourself a deal.

221
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,660
A gentleman's agreement!

222
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,411
Marshall, they're in kindergarten.
This isn't how you teach basketball.

223
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,340
Sure it is. It's the way I learned.

224
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,285
Are you kidding me?

225
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,110
What kind of sociopath
taught you this way?

226
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,142
Come on, Dad. I'm tired.

227
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,603
Sleep is for winners.

228
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,770
You can go to bed
when you score a basket.

229
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,771
I'm trying.

230
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,953
Let's give you
two points for trying.

231
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,068
But negative two points
for having a great big head.

232
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,114
My father gave me no quarter

233
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,742
and I asked for no quarter.

234
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,287
I totally got to call that guy.

235
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,073
Keep stretching!

236
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,880
"Put on reading glasses." Check.

237
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,687
"Yell at neighborhood kids."

238
00:11:58,045 --> 00:11:59,221
My pleasure.

239
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,359
- What the hell happened to you?
- I just had a very minor

240
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,602
"blew out my knee
and it hurts like hell" incident.

241
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,812
- How did you blow out your knee?
- We...

242
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:14,691
"Helped someone move out of a 6th floor
walk-up in exchange for pizza and beer."

243
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,190
Or we helped someone
rob a sixth floor walk-up.

244
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:20,322
They were in a big hurry
and left all the pictures behind.

245
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:22,366
Whatevs, it counts.

246
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:26,516
Now, I am off to
"Dye my hair a funny color",

247
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:28,955
and then we are going to,
"Go to a rave".

248
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:31,458
4:00!

249
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,626
Supper time.

250
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,759
So, your dad was tough on you.

251
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:38,508
That stinks,
but you don't have to be like him.

252
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,717
You can learn from his mistakes.

253
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,448
Mistakes?
Lily, scoreboard.

254
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:45,846
The guy nailed it, okay?
He taught me how to be a winner.

255
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:49,226
That's what I'm teaching these kids.
And, for that matter,

256
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,478
that's what I'm gonna teach
our kids someday.

257
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,854
Okay, that's it.

258
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,199
This is not
how we're gonna raise our kids!

259
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,818
And this is not
how you're gonna coach this team!

260
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:01,034
At tomorrow's game,
if you are anything less

261
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,577
than a teddy bear stuffed
with cotton candy and rainbows,

262
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:07,889
I will silent treatment
your ass into the ground!

263
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,645
You'll think the time I found
your Internet search history

264
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,666
was a freakin' picnic!

265
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,042
Are we clear?

266
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:18,380
- There are many different philo...
- Are we clear?

267
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,579
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,220
What's ironic is that now...

269
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,785
Just call Ted.

270
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:35,406
I want to go home.

271
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:37,306
All right.
I'm calling him.

272
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:39,818
But it's 4:30 in the morning.
He's not going to be awake.

273
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:41,296
Up at 4:00...

274
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:42,688
Check.

275
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,991
- Is he answering?
- I haven't dialed yet.

276
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,864
Please hurry, Robin.

277
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:51,139
Perfect.

278
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:53,553
"Take forever to answer the phone."

279
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,503
Come on, Ted.

280
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,214
Someone gave me some aspirin
and I don't think it was aspirin.

281
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,098
Check.

282
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,580
So, I know that I have been
a little tough on you

283
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:15,267
for the past couple days.

284
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:18,004
And I apologize for that.

285
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,583
So today, we're not gonna
worry about winning.

286
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,529
We're gonna go out there and...

287
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:25,935
have fun.

288
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:30,598
<i>Kids, over the years,
your uncle Marshall has told and retold</i>

289
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:33,705
<i>the story of this game
hundreds of times. And in reality,</i>

290
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,648
<i>the kids on that other team
were probably only a grade older.</i>

291
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:38,709
<i>But, in telling
and retelling the story,</i>

292
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,734
<i>they came to look like this.</i>

293
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,633
Way to let them score that easily.

294
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:56,645
Now, you're sitting down.
Awesome.

295
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:04,027
Addison, it's not soccer.

296
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,695
You don't kick the ball!

297
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,780
Unless that's something
that you think is fun,

298
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:12,379
in which case, great job having fun.

299
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,182
- That was a foul, wasn't it, Ref?
- My name's not Ref. It's Kenny.

300
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:22,601
- And watch your tone.
- No tone, Kenny.

301
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:23,713
Great job, Kenny.

302
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:25,495
Thanks a lot, Kenny.

303
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,170
See you later, Kenny.

304
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,806
All right, Barney. As your manager,
I am throwing in the towel.

305
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,265
This bet is over.
Your ear looks like

306
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,846
a free Danish
at a continental breakfast.

307
00:15:38,058 --> 00:15:40,272
No. One thing left.
"Beer bong."

308
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,931
Coming right up.

309
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:45,944
Oh, I...

310
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,063
found these weird Russian beers
in the basement.

311
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51,474
Russian beers?
I'll take a brewski.

312
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,237
Brewski. Get it?

313
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,788
Yeah, it's...

314
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:59,791
It's a little warm.
Hope that's not a problem.

315
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,088
No, don't, don't.

316
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:09,509
All right, Ted.
You win. I hate this.

317
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:11,469
I hate all of it.

318
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,238
My back is killing me.

319
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,348
Everyone at the rave
thought I was a narc.

320
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,982
My ear hurts so bad I can hear it...

321
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:22,274
I can hear my own ear.
Think about that.

322
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,774
My clothes... What is it...
What is it... What am I...

323
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,329
Get this stuff off of me!

324
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:29,988
Ted, I'll pay you double
for your finest suit.

325
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:31,196
Here's...

326
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,750
30 bucks.

327
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,368
And throw in the shoes.

328
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:37,329
You win, Ted.

329
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:40,279
I'll never do anything
on the Murtaugh List again.

330
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,673
I'm too old for this stuff.

331
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:46,200
You know, Barney, last night,
I went to bed at 8:00

332
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:49,449
because it was on the list,
and I couldn't sleep because...

333
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:51,027
well, it was 8:00.

334
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:53,178
So I decided to watch <i>Lethal Weapon</i>.

335
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,078
<i>And then,
when I still couldn't sleep,</i>

336
00:16:58,203 --> 00:16:59,953
<i>I watched </i>Lethal Weapon 2<i>.</i>

337
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,263
<i>And then I watched 3.</i>

338
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:05,899
<i>And then, halfway through</i>
Lethal Weapon 4<i>,</i>

339
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,373
<i>is when it occurred to me...</i>

340
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:11,269
Murtaugh kept saying,
"I'm too old for this stuff",

341
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:12,832
but every time he'd say it,

342
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,124
he'd turn around,
make another movie,

343
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,660
and do more stuff.

344
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,802
I guess what I'm saying is...

345
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:22,540
screw being old.

346
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,118
Let's go TP laser tag.

347
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,547
And then the hospital.

348
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,527
Great job, guys.

349
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:37,415
At least we're not keeping score, right?
No idea what the score is.

350
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,057
Could be 53 to zero.

351
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,963
Could be some other score.
It's 53 to zero.

352
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,270
What are we doing wrong, Coach?

353
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,224
You know what?
You're not doing anything wrong.

354
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:49,357
It's great that you guys are losing,

355
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,238
because in life, it doesn't matter
how much effort you put in,

356
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,907
or how hard you try,

357
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:57,169
people will just give you things.

358
00:17:57,294 --> 00:18:00,608
Like diplomas and jobs
and promotions.

359
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,641
So, it doesn't matter
what you do out there,

360
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,014
as long as...
as long as you have fun.

361
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:08,253
<i>At that point, because they didn't want
to fight in front of the kids,</i>

362
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,274
<i>your uncle Marshall and aunt Lily had
one of their telepathic conversations.</i>

363
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,688
<i>- Don't you give me that look.
- Lily, I can't take it anymore!</i>

364
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:17,387
<i>Your way of coaching is crazy!</i>

365
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,930
<i>Stop yelling at me!</i>

366
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,439
<i>Sorry.</i>

367
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,893
<i>But can I please do it my way?</i>

368
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,959
<i>Fine, but I'm going
to do it my way, too.</i>

369
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,440
<i>I'm getting my guitar.</i>

370
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:33,255
<i>I don't know if it was
Marshall's tough attitude,</i>

371
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,821
<i>Lily's gentle encouragement,</i>

372
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,005
<i>or some magical combination
of the two,</i>

373
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,693
<i>but in the second half of that game,</i>

374
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,119
<i>that ragtag group
of little firecrackers...</i>

375
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:44,010
<i>got beat down even worse.</i>

376
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,461
<i>In fact, according
to your uncle Marshall,</i>

377
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,866
<i>in the second half,
the other team got even taller.</i>

378
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,509
<i>And one of them
turned into a Teen Wolf.</i>

379
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,698
Kenny! There is a Teen Wolf
on the court!

380
00:18:57,823 --> 00:18:59,323
That can't be legal.

381
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,044
I know the Teen Wolf
looks different, kids,

382
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:04,833
but try to make sure
he feels included.

383
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,054
How is that not traveling, Kenny?

384
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,867
You are killing me!
You are absolutely killing me!

385
00:19:29,992 --> 00:19:32,086
Watch it, Coach,
or you'll get a technical.

386
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,481
I am begging you
to give me a technical.

387
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,886
<i>When the final horn mercifully blew,</i>

388
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,202
<i>the score was,
by Marshall's estimate, 118 to nothing.</i>

389
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:45,792
<i>And even though
they didn't win anything,</i>

390
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:49,354
<i>everyone, even the coach,
got a participation trophy.</i>

391
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,481
I understand if you don't want it.

392
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:54,268
I love it.

393
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:59,531
I worked so hard. It feels good
to be appreciated for my effort.

394
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:01,449
I know, baby.

395
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,498
Maybe your way
is not totally stupid.

396
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:09,989
Thanks.

397
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:12,587
Your way is totally stupid.

398
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:25,381
Son...

399
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:29,727
you have been a pain in my ass
ever since you joined this club.

400
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:33,127
But damn it...

401
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:36,592
if this ain't some
of the finest TP work I've ever seen.

402
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,816
You're reinstated...

403
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,614
effective immediately.

404
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,823
Really?

405
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:47,620
Hell, no!

406
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,250
I'm calling the police!

407
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:54,239
Grown-ass man with pink hair throwing
toilet paper. You're kidding me.

408
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,036
- I'm too old for this...
- <i>Stuff.</i>

409
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,711
<i>He said stuff.</i>
