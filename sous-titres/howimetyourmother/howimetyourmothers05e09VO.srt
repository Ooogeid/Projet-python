1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:01,970
<i>In November 2009,</i>

2
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:05,796
<i>Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily
hosted the first Thanksgiving.</i>

3
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:08,746
<i>Marshall had found
the perfect turkey.</i>

4
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:11,950
Baby, it is beautiful.

5
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:14,838
It's 22 pounds.
It's organic.

6
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:18,401
Remember my bald Uncle Heinrek?
It looks exactly like his head.

7
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:21,896
My turkey...

8
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:27,693
<i>So, when we showed up for the big day,
Marshall was pretty bummed out.</i>

9
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,779
Well, we got the turkey.

10
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,275
You didn't.
You got the pathetic replacement turkey.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,670
Damn it, why didn't I listen
to the precorded voice

12
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:37,411
of former mayor Ed Koch
reminding me to take my belongings?

13
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:42,541
- You don't understand.
- We went to the port authority,

14
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,543
and there,
sitting in their fridge...

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,798
Is this your turkey?

16
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:50,464
That's my turkey!

17
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:53,447
Come here,
you handsome little bastard!

18
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:55,763
I'm gonna go put this in the oven.

19
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,265
You are the best friends ever!

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,239
It was totally a team effort.

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,923
I don't know what to say.
It's Thanksgiving,

22
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:08,901
but thanks doesn't seem like enough.

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,895
You would've done
the same thing for us.

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,364
I would, and you know why?
Because I love you.

25
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,590
I'm going to show you just how much.

26
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,007
I bequeath unto you

27
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:22,458
the fourth slap.

28
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,041
What?

29
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:26,961
<i>Kids, you remember
Barney and Marshall's "slap bet".</i>

30
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:30,653
When Barney lost, Marshall won the right
to slap Barney five times

31
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:34,093
as hard as he could.
So far, he'd used three slaps.

32
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,070
With the third being doled out
exactly two years earlier

33
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:40,933
on Thanksgiving day 2007.

34
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,035
A day that history came to know
as "Slapsgiving".

35
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:48,023
- Are you saying...
- What we think you're saying?

36
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,442
Probably not.

37
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,818
Unless you think I'm saying

38
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:54,460
"Slapsgiving two:
revenge of the slap",

39
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:57,283
in which case, yes,
that's exactly what I'm saying!

40
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,205
No way!

41
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,995
- Slaps aren't transferable.
- Lily is the slap bet commissioner.

42
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,041
Slaps are transferable.

43
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:10,650
You realize you'll only have
one left after this.

44
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,715
Are you sure
you want to spend this slap today?

45
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,800
Life is short.
I figured, <i>Slap-e Diem</i>.

46
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:18,303
Rule number one:
the slap must occur before sundown,

47
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,306
so as not to interfere
with Lily's meal.

48
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,350
Two, you have to decide
who gets to do it.

49
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,761
Three...
We're going to tie barney to this chair,

50
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:29,442
which shall henceforth be referred
to as the slapping throne.

51
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,424
Sound fair?

52
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,332
- Totally.
- Absolutely not!

53
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:35,212
<i>It was all set to be
the best Thanksgiving ever.</i>

54
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:36,487
<i>Until...</i>

55
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,663
Are we expecting somebody else?

56
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:42,338
<i>It was someone Lily hadn't seen
or spoken to in three years.</i>

57
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:45,025
Dad.

58
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,899
Synchro : -Titou-

59
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,427
.:: La Fabrique ::.

60
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:01,889
<i>Now, Lily and her dad, Mickey,
had always had a tough relationship.</i>

61
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,706
<i>Mickey's dream was to invent
the next great American board game.</i>

62
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,478
<i>But his ideas were a little off.</i>

63
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,086
Daddy?

64
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,440
You missed my ballet recital.

65
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,211
Yes, but, look!

66
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:16,195
I just put the finishing touches
on my new, hit board game,

67
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,000
"Tijuana Slumlord".

68
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:22,897
You missed my gymnastics meet.

69
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:24,995
But this is the one!

70
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:27,991
"Car Battery:

71
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,074
"how long can you hold on?"

72
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,630
Grab these.

73
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:39,385
I had a nightmare.

74
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:44,799
Here, come play daddy's new game:

75
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:47,226
"There's a clown demon
under the bed!"

76
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:50,887
Her whole life,
Mickey disappointed Lily.

77
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,231
<i>And she put up with it,</i>

78
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:54,781
<i>until one day in 2006</i>

79
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,969
<i>when Lily went to visit
her grandparents.</i>

80
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,446
So, Rita, are you excited
about the big move to Florida?

81
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,670
Actually, slight change of plans.

82
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:04,076
We're staying here
for the time being.

83
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,149
We had a slight financial hiccup.

84
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:10,523
The straw to my juice box broke!

85
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,405
- What a pleasant surprise.
- What happened to your apartment?

86
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,889
I had a little falling out
with my roommate.

87
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:27,253
- What happened?
- He wanted me to pay rent.

88
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,183
Got kind of ugly.

89
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,464
You should be paying rent,
not living in your parents' basement.

90
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,522
It's not my first choice.

91
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:37,776
Having the old farts right upstairs
is crimpin' my style a bit.

92
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:41,322
Clearly, they're not getting
the whole "sock on the doorknob" thing.

93
00:04:41,718 --> 00:04:44,368
- They caught you with a girl?
- In a way.

94
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:47,763
I'm off to work.

95
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,979
- You're retired.
- Now I have an extra mouth to feed,

96
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,875
I had to go back to the steel mill.

97
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,336
Where's my truss?

98
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,591
So, not only did you stop them
from moving to Florida,

99
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,008
but now you forced Grandpa
to go back to work?

100
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,456
Just until I get Aldrin Games
unlimited off the ground

101
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:06,096
with my new sensation:

102
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,264
"Dog Fight Promoter".

103
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:12,978
<i>Lily gave her dad a look that Marshall
had only seen a few times before.</i>

104
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:16,132
A look we all prayed never to be
on the receiving end of:

105
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,567
her "you're dead to me" look.

106
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,366
Which brings us
back to Thanksgiving of 2009.

107
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,787
I brought "Diseases"!

108
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,598
- Why is he here?
- Dunno.

109
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,504
But we should let him in
and find out.

110
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,999
No, I don't want to see him!
Get rid of him!

111
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,809
Just hang tight, okay?
We'll, we'll work this out.

112
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:55,157
Take your time, <i>amigo</i>.
I'm okay as long as I have "diseases"!

113
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,130
The fun's infectious.

114
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,436
- God, I hope Lily's okay.
- Me, too.

115
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:10,911
She doesn't talk about it much,
but this thing causes her a lot of pain.

116
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,330
Just tell me which one of you
is gonna slap me!

117
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,332
- What?
- I'm dying over here!

118
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,711
Ted reaches for a chip, I flinch!
Robin fixes her hair, I flinch!

119
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,739
I'm doing so much flinching.
It's bad for my skin.

120
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:24,133
I'm getting crow's feet.
Crow's feet!

121
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,971
Lily, it's been three years, okay?
That's long enough.

122
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,410
Having him in my life
causes me nothing but stress.

123
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,935
It's just easier for him
to be dead to me.

124
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:40,399
I supported you when our neighbor,
Mr. Ossias, was "dead to you".

125
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,612
- That's our newspaper.
- You'll get it back in 15 minutes.

126
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,624
Make it 20.
I had a steak last night.

127
00:06:57,438 --> 00:07:00,627
And I was fine when your bridesmaid,
Whitney, was "dead to you".

128
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,090
You look so amazing!

129
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,716
That dress is gorgeous!

130
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,217
Thanks, guys.

131
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,880
I'm just not a fan of strapless.

132
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:22,149
I even understood when Mr. Park
was "dead to you."

133
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,901
One coffee, please.

134
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:26,945
But only if you have decaf.
I don't want to be up all night.

135
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,344
Dollar fifty.

136
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,337
- Coffee, regular.
- Dollar fifty.

137
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:40,498
Excuse me.
Are you sure mine was decaf?

138
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,919
You just used the same pot.

139
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:44,634
I lie to him. Okay?

140
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,536
You son of a bitch.

141
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,850
That was not decaf!

142
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:08,184
I supported you
with all of those random people,

143
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,122
but this is your father.

144
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:13,075
Can't we at least
just give him some turkey?

145
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:14,774
Come on.

146
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:17,079
Please, I can't ask the guy
to leave on Thanksgiving.

147
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,097
You don't have to ask.

148
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:21,873
Just tell him that it's really important
that he be here.

149
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:25,441
And before you know it,
he'll be at a game convention in Toledo,

150
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:29,133
giving your braces money to some guy
claiming to be Milton Bradley.

151
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:32,010
He was just out
trying to provide for the family.

152
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:35,514
No, that's what my mom did
by working two jobs.

153
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:41,179
That man broke my heart
every single day for 20 years.

154
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:46,567
Well, then we'll just give him
some dark meat.

155
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,371
No, seriously, Robin,
you should get the slap.

156
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,947
You're a great slapper.

157
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:55,343
In fact, I want to study slapping
under your tutelage.

158
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:57,077
I want to be your slap-prentice.

159
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:01,873
Don't sell yourself short there.
You're a slapping rock star.

160
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:03,959
Your name should be Eric Slapton.

161
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:06,991
This is torture.
Just put me in the chair...

162
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,506
- Slapping throne.
- And get it over with!

163
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,758
- He's all yours.
- It's you, I insist.

164
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,126
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Wait, what?

165
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:15,721
I'll slap him.

166
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:18,348
What, so that's just, like,
the end of the discussion?

167
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:21,073
You said I could slap him.

168
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,729
I was just being nice.

169
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:26,815
If anyone's gonna slap him,
it's gonna be me.

170
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,567
No, it's not.

171
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:33,122
This is interesting.

172
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:37,060
Lily, he's family, okay?

173
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,828
And I'm sorry,
but you just don't cut off family.

174
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:41,954
That's easy for you to say

175
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,792
when you come from the most
ridiculously close family in the world.

176
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,628
We are not ridiculously close.

177
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,559
Really?

178
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:51,298
What about the Eriksen family dinner
every single sunday?

179
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,056
Everything looks delicious,
Mother Eriksen.

180
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,802
Thank you, Papa Oear.

181
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:59,223
Would you say grace?

182
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:01,961
<i>Well, I would be happy to, mother.</i>

183
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,519
<i>Everyone, please join hands.</i>

184
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,193
<i>Dear Lord...</i>

185
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:13,445
I'm sorry, but that's weird.

186
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:15,657
A family should be that close.

187
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,784
I want our future family to be close.
And that includes your dad.

188
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:20,869
I can't believe
you're taking his side.

189
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,656
Let me be clear on this.

190
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:25,853
That man will never cross

191
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,460
the threshold into this home, ever!

192
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:31,505
It's just gonna be,
like, five more minutes.

193
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:33,470
Hopefully soon, <i>amigo</i>.

194
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:36,051
I'm fighting a losing battle
with hemorrhoids here.

195
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,011
That's one of the diseases?

196
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,205
Ted, there is an hour
before the sun sets,

197
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,465
at which point,
neither one gets to slap Barney.

198
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,836
So just let me have it.

199
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:52,610
I had the idea to call
the port authority lost and found.

200
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,411
That's a good point.
Rebuttal?

201
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,360
- I'm the one who slipped the guy a 20!
- Philosophical conundrum.

202
00:10:57,485 --> 00:11:00,075
Idea versus execution.
Please discuss at length.

203
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,661
I carried that huge turkey
all the way up here.

204
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,087
I paid for cab fare.

205
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:05,914
You slept
with one of my best friends!

206
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:07,355
What?

207
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:09,793
- You said you were okay with that.
- I'm not!

208
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,753
Why didn't you say
something at the time?

209
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,755
Because I'm still in love with you!

210
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,123
Do you really want
to slap Barney so bad

211
00:11:19,248 --> 00:11:21,138
you would lie
about being in love with me?

212
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,723
I really want to slap him!

213
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:26,540
Your dad has made
some mistakes in the past,

214
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:28,278
but he's a different person now.

215
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:31,189
He's out of your grandparents' house.
He's got a job.

216
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,899
He's paying off his IRS debts.

217
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,503
How do you know all that?

218
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:37,654
Body language.

219
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,742
We met for a drink last week.

220
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:44,453
I miss her a ton.

221
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:46,330
Little princess.

222
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:49,173
She ever talk about me?

223
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,729
Like, all the time.

224
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,339
She tells
this one really sweet story about...

225
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,257
- So never?
- Not a word.

226
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,529
But...
It doesn't have to be that way.

227
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,262
We can fix this, right?

228
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,433
You know, I always thought
it'd get fixed at the wedding.

229
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,329
I even wrote a toast.

230
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:12,647
But then, no invite.

231
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,715
Hell, I haven't even seen
a wedding photo.

232
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,462
<i>And then, right before my eyes,</i>

233
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:22,166
<i>your father broke down crying.</i>

234
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:26,249
That's it!

235
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:28,038
You're coming to Thanksgiving!

236
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:30,916
You invited him?

237
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,086
The guy was, like, blubbering.
What was I going to do?

238
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,626
Then, some jerk at the next table
called him a sissy

239
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:38,507
which I thought
was totally uncalled-for.

240
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,885
I can't believe you.
What gives you the right to do that?

241
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:43,341
You and I are married.

242
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,138
And that means he's my family, too.

243
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,619
Ted, you better roll quickly.

244
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,496
Your gall bladder's about to burst.

245
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:12,874
Mickey, it's been half an hour.
I think we should go look for Lily.

246
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,044
She just needs some time to cool down.
Let's finish the game.

247
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:18,255
Play another round.
Best of seven!

248
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,885
Damn it, Robin!
I've known Barney the longest.

249
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,092
I get to slap him.

250
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,154
That slap is mine, Mosby.

251
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,153
I've never slapped Barney...

252
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:27,580
above the waist.

253
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,225
I've wanted to slap Barney
since the moment I met him!

254
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,215
You don't think
that I want to slap Barney?

255
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,520
Wait a minute!

256
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,316
This slap was supposed to be
a wonderful thing, a gift,

257
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,524
and...

258
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,651
it's turned us against each other.

259
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:42,264
My God, you're right.

260
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:46,228
This once pure fruit has turned
into a poison slapple.

261
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,494
You know what?
Seriously, you take it.

262
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:50,662
Are you sure?

263
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:52,289
Slapsolutely.

264
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,876
I really think
that we should go look for Lily.

265
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,302
Gall bladder about to pop.

266
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,720
It's decided. Barney, come on.
Get in the throne.

267
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:04,314
Are you...

268
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:05,582
Come on.

269
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,313
Well, I guess that is the...

270
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,307
best decision, Robin.
I mean...

271
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,850
Men are stronger than women.

272
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:16,062
Don't listen to him.
It's been decided.

273
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,273
And that's what
you've always wanted, isn't it?

274
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,276
A strong man to take care of you?

275
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:24,224
I mean, sure.
Growing up, you were a scrapper.

276
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,272
Playing hockey with the boys,

277
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,617
skinning your knees on the ice.

278
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,740
But what you couldn't tell
your teammates...

279
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:32,849
What you couldn't
even tell yourself...

280
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,990
was that all you really wanted...

281
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,090
was that pretty white dress...

282
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,854
in that pretty white chapel.

283
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:43,960
And at the end of that center aisle,

284
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,623
strewn with pretty white flowers,

285
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:51,389
a man to do
all your slapping for you.

286
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:52,807
Let me at him!

287
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:59,529
- What just happened?
- Sorry, Ted.

288
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:01,058
Gallbladder burst.

289
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:02,984
You move back three spaces.

290
00:15:03,757 --> 00:15:04,815
You come in here,

291
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:08,027
and you watch your daughter leave,
and you don't even care.

292
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,593
And now
you've destroyed Thanksgiving dinner!

293
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:12,536
Lily worked all day on this!

294
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:14,541
Relax. It's not real bile.

295
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,993
It's just lead-based paint
from China.

296
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:18,903
And horse bile.

297
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,585
<i>And at that moment,</i>

298
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,124
<i>Marshall gave Mickey a look</i>

299
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,361
<i>none of us had ever seen him
give anyone.</i>

300
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,677
- What's this? What's he doing?
- Did you swallow some of that paint?

301
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,720
This is my "you're dead to me" look.

302
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,599
Lily's is so much better...

303
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,028
Get out of my house!

304
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,694
Mr. Park's? This is the last place
I expected to find you.

305
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,237
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,704
But just hear me out.

307
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:52,810
I used to think
that family was a right.

308
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:55,660
But it's not. It's a privilege,
and it has to be earned.

309
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:57,914
I kicked your dad out.

310
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,616
And I promise, baby,
I will never make you see him again.

311
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,045
What?

312
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,547
Baby, what happened?

313
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:08,770
Marshall,
I came in here because it was cold

314
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:10,940
and this was the only place
that was open.

315
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:13,815
I wasn't even gonna look Mr. Park
in the eye.

316
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:15,906
And then I found out...

317
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,268
Mr. Park died.

318
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,222
He really is dead to me!

319
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,735
And if I feel this bad
about never making up with Mr. Park,

320
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,989
a guy who meant
literally nothing to me...

321
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,851
We got to go get my dad.

322
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:42,392
<i>So that's how on Thanksgiving 2009,</i>

323
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:44,767
<i>your aunt Lily performed a miracle.</i>

324
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:47,753
<i>She brought a man
back from the dead.</i>

325
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:49,656
Everyone.

326
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,100
Before we get started, Barney,

327
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:55,138
we're going to need you
on the slapping throne.

328
00:16:57,112 --> 00:17:00,153
Slap bet commissioner, surely tying me
to a chair is a breach...

329
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,312
Less yappin', more slappin'.

330
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,770
Ted, Robin.
It's two minutes until sundown.

331
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:07,479
Have you decided which one of you

332
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,320
is going to get
to slap Barney right in his face?

333
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,536
It's gonna be Ted.

334
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:14,988
What? Why me?

335
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:18,128
Last year,
you got left at the altar.

336
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,601
You lost your job.

337
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,499
But you've come
such a long way since then.

338
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:25,226
I'm so proud of you, Ted.

339
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,761
You deserve
to slap someone in his face,

340
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,336
as hard as you can.

341
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,008
Thanks.

342
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,551
This is the worst.

343
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,851
Mama!

344
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,022
You went through
your breakup, and...

345
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:49,557
While I know you and Barney
left it on good terms, isn't there...

346
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:51,916
some part of you, deep down,

347
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,781
that wants to slap him
right in his face?

348
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:56,408
There is.

349
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,575
I know there is.

350
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,369
This is basically hell on earth.

351
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,059
All right.

352
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
It hurts!

353
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,423
I can't do it.

354
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,349
I can't take this from you, Ted.

355
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:15,474
No or I, you.

356
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:16,722
Thank God.

357
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,751
So, I'd like to make a gesture.

358
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
No way!

359
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,310
I'm glad you and Lily
are trying to work things out.

360
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,689
So, to welcome you
to our little family...

361
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:30,629
I'd like to offer you this slap.

362
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,068
Really?

363
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:36,030
Well, I feel a little weird.

364
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,831
I just met barney,

365
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:40,109
and I don't have anything
against the guy, but...

366
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:44,143
how often do you get a chance
to slap someone right in his face?

367
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,588
Soft!

368
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:54,257
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

369
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:55,467
Thank God.

370
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:57,023
Lily...

371
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,804
I haven't been much
of a father to you.

372
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,421
You are kidding me.

373
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,600
So for all the ballet recitals
I missed,

374
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:07,812
for all the art shows
that I should've been at...

375
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:11,775
for the wedding gift
I never got a chance to give to you...

376
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,160
Princess...

377
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,360
I give this slap...

378
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:17,947
to you.

379
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,413
She is the slap bet commissioner.
She's supposed to remain impartial!

380
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,582
Slap bet commissioner says
it's okay.

381
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:30,327
This is not good.

382
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,505
Please.

383
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,673
Let me...

384
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,164
Just close your eyes.
It'll be over soon.

385
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,845
Running through a meadow.

386
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:42,514
I can't do it.

387
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:44,366
Why can't I do it?

388
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:46,404
Because...

389
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:49,337
this slap has done
exactly what I hoped.

390
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,481
It's brought us all closer together.

391
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,787
And it's caused us to recognize

392
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,404
both the frailty and the greatness

393
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,122
in ourselves

394
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,156
and each other.

395
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:01,764
Give me a break.

396
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:03,772
And that is why...

397
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:09,499
There will be no slap today.

398
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:15,293
This is the best Thanksgiving...

399
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:18,192
That's four!

400
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,140
So, turkey?

401
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:27,005
<i>From Aldrin games unlimited, it's...
Slap Bet!</i>

402
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:30,562
<i>The slap-happy game
that's a real hit.</i>

403
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,746
<i>You just got slapped,</i>

404
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:37,193
<i>across the face, my friend...</i>

405
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:38,820
<i>For kids of all ages.</i>

406
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,245
<i>You just got slapped,</i>

407
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,657
<i>that really just happened...</i>

408
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,869
<i>Everybody saw it,</i>

409
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,220
<i>everybody laughed and clapped,</i>

410
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:51,416
- <i>'cause it was awesome...</i>
- I win!

411
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,377
<i>The way that you just got slapped.</i>

412
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,213
<i>Slap yourself silly with Slap Bet,
the happy hitting game from Aldrin.</i>
