1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:03,294
<i>Kids, your uncle Barney had been
called a lot of names over the years.</i>

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:04,387
Jerk!

3
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:06,374
Bastard!

4
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:09,109
Barack Obama Jr.?!

5
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:11,841
And yes...

6
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:13,137
we can.

7
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,014
<i>But there's one name none of us
ever expected to hear him called.</i>

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,288
Boyfriend.
Barney Stinson is my boyfriend.

9
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:23,021
I've said it, like, a hundred times
it still sounds weird to say.

10
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,045
Anything sounds weird
if you say it a hundred times.

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,970
Bowl.

12
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,976
But other than that,
things are good?

13
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,159
I don't know.

14
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,239
I think Barney's been single
for too long.

15
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:40,264
Like, the other night,
I wake up at 4:00 a.m...

16
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:43,586
Barney, are you awake?

17
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:52,815
This is not a one-night stand.
We're dating. Come back to bed.

18
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,560
That's happened three times. And
it's not just that, it's other things.

19
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,398
What's wrong?

20
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:09,402
It was just one thing after another
at work today, and then...

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,633
I found out my aunt's
in the hospital.

22
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:14,958
I'm just, I'm feeling
so overwhelmed and it's just...

23
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,077
What you need to do
is talk through this stuff.

24
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,620
Thanks.

25
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,807
And then, once you're
off the phone with Lily,

26
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:24,882
I'll be down in the bar
ready to have sex. Okay?

27
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:31,155
Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est
person in the world, but...

28
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:34,385
- a little more effort would be nice.
- I understand.

29
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,149
I guess, in a lot of ways,
Barney doesn't stack up.

30
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:39,897
I mean, you've had some pretty
incredible boyfriends.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,064
No, that's not it.
I don't know.

32
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:50,103
Maybe he just
doesn't have it in him.

33
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:52,403
Maybe is whole thing's
a big mistake.

34
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,032
- She really said that?
- And she meant it.

35
00:01:57,495 --> 00:02:00,668
Trust me. I dated Robin for a year...
if you don't want to lose her,

36
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:02,390
you gotta try a little harder.

37
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:05,738
Be more attentive to where
she is emotionally. Just...

38
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:07,863
- be present.
- Yes, totally.

39
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:10,628
Only thing, and this is just me...

40
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:13,699
I like my testicles attached
to my body, rather than rolling around

41
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:16,552
next to some eyeliner
in Robin's purse. Stinson out!

42
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:19,894
<i>But then a funny thing happened.</i>

43
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:22,266
<i>Over the next couple weeks,
Barney was thoughtful,</i>

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,759
<i>considerate...</i>

45
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:25,155
<i>sweet.</i>

46
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:27,810
<i>In short, the perfect boyfriend.</i>

47
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:29,940
<i>Which, to Robin,
meant only one thing.</i>

48
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,734
- He's cheating on me.
- What?!

49
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,042
Why else would he buy me flowers?
He's gettin' some on the side.

50
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:38,115
Barney's not the type of guy
who would... go on.

51
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,353
Plus, he keeps saying
he's working late.

52
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:42,786
But when I call his office,
they say he left hours ago.

53
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,307
- That doesn't prove anything.
- Yes. Proof.

54
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,917
Good word.
I'm glad you brought that up.

55
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,586
Barney's briefcase.
He forgot it here this morning.

56
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:54,023
- And what do you plan on doing with it?
- We, we...

57
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,210
you and I... are going to open it up
and look for evidence.

58
00:02:57,335 --> 00:03:00,022
Ted probably has a sledgehammer
around here somewhere.

59
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,181
Stop! Stop! Eye contact.

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,849
Listen to me.
Robin Scherbatsky is many things:

61
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:09,613
friend, confidant, occasional
guest star in some confusing dreams

62
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:12,193
that remind me a woman's
sexuality is a moving target.

63
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,819
But she is no crazy,
jealous stalker-bitch.

64
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:16,570
Let go.

65
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:21,159
I've been down in the basement storage
area going through all the stuff that

66
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,745
Lily and I left behind when
we moved out. I'm sorry Robin.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,957
We should've cleared it out
for you much sooner.

68
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:28,937
- There's a basement storage area?
- You're not upset. Good.

69
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:30,812
Baby, guess what I found.

70
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,621
- That's great, honey.
- What the hell is that?

71
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,030
Marshall got it in college.
He used it as a nightstand for years.

72
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,518
Until we found out that Lily
was allergic to barrel resin

73
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,369
- Barrel resin?
- Just go with it.

74
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:52,279
- You need a hand throwing it out?
- No, I'm not...

75
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:56,104
I'm not just going to throw her out,
okay? Mabel's like family.

76
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:59,398
So... what are you going
to do with Mabel?

77
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,949
I want to give her away... to a lucky
new owner. Do you know anyone?

78
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,787
Let me think.
Do I know any rodeo clowns?

79
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:10,791
That's weird, I do. But even Lenny
wouldn't go near that mess.

80
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,116
He's not going to have the chance,

81
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,755
because I am putting old Mabel
in the Bermuda Triangle.

82
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:19,894
<i>"The Bermuda Triangle"
was the name we'd given</i>

83
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,071
<i>years earlier to the curb right
in front of our building.</i>

84
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,765
<i>Whenever we wanted to give something
away, we'd put it right there.</i>

85
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:32,983
<i>It was uncanny.</i>

86
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:35,941
This is so exciting.

87
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,766
Right now there's some out there
who has no idea that tonight

88
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,820
they're going home with just...

89
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,907
just the best barrel.

90
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:46,242
Let's just hope they're not allergic
to barrel sin like Lily here.

91
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,077
Be cool, baby. Damn!

92
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,923
- See you, sweetie. Good luck.
- Bye, babe.

93
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:56,008
- Now, can we please get out of here?
- I'll grab my coat.

94
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,564
A college notebook?!

95
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:06,542
My God, he's cheating on me
with some college girl.

96
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,957
I knew there was a skank but
I thought she'd at least be dumb.

97
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:15,021
"Birthday: July 23. Favorite hockey
team: the Vancouver Canucks.

98
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:17,746
Age: 29, but tells people
that she's 26."

99
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:20,489
My God, these are notes about me.

100
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:22,613
Or some 29-year-old version of me.

101
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,935
I hope I'm not too late!

102
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,155
I want to see the look of joy
on the new owner's face!

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,400
She's still there!

104
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:38,789
Okay Mabel, let's find
you a new home.

105
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:40,589
Here comes a guy!

106
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:44,015
He has walked,
walked right on by it.

107
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:47,775
He's probably rushing home to
get a handcart or something.

108
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,091
Hey, better hurry up, pal.

109
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,103
What are you guys doing with
Barney's secret Robin notebook?

110
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,053
Let me rephrase that.

111
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:01,927
Did you...
two ladies lose some weight?

112
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,971
What do you know
about this, Marshall?

113
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:07,658
Why would Barney have a notebook
full of information about me?

114
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:10,619
<i>The truth was...</i>

115
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,872
<i>Barney was taking a
night school class taught...</i>

116
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,595
<i>by me.</i>

117
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,570
Welcome

118
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:18,046

124
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:37,271
Why is Ted teaching
a class about me?

125
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:39,690
It all started a few weeks ago.

126
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,988
... rather than rolling around next
to some eyeliner in Robin's purse.

127
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,331
Stinson out!

128
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,680
Stinson back in.

129
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,754
Say...

130
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,550
hypothetically, I did
want to change who I am

131
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,906
to become a better boyfriend to Robin,
which I do not!

132
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,297
What kind of changes
are we talking about?

133
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,175
Why, I mean, there's just so much
you need to know about her.

134
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:08,364
Okay, for starters,

135
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,305
don't ever cry in front her.

136
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,478
And whatever you do,

137
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,543
don't cry in front
of her four times.

138
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,191
- What should you talking about?
- Fantasy football.

139
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:27,055
They realized they couldn't talk about
this stuff at the bar, and

140
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,013
since you live with Ted,
they had to find someplace safe.

141
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:32,117
So... Ted's classroom.

142
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:34,745
"How To Date Robin Scherbatsky."

143
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:36,228
Lesson one.

144
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,412
Now, even though she puts up
a tough exterior,

145
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:40,501
what Robin really wants,
deep down...

146
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,669
I'm bored.

147
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:45,464
- You said you wanted my help.
- Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?

148
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:48,550
- We did that all ready.
- No, like, really big boobs.

149
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,620
No. Look, I need this, too.
I've only been a professor a few weeks.

150
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:54,681
Being up here...
it's good practice for me.

151
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,861
Can we have class outside?

152
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:59,280
What Robin really wants deep down...

153
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,633
What? I'm tweeting about you.

154
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,224
You should be flattered.

155
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:08,499
How do you spell...
"H's" or no?

156
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,741
You were just... like, the worst
student in the world, weren't you?

157
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,828
They said I had A-D...

158
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:17,538
something.
Can we have class outside?

159
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,088
Barney, I'm only gonna
say this once,

160
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:21,363
so listen up.

161
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,028
I love you

162
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:25,888
and I love Robin.
And I want to make this work.

163
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:28,409
So if you give me
a few weeks of attention,

164
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:31,030
I could give you
a lifetime of happiness.

165
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:32,580
Can you do that for me?

166
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:36,380
Do you think I should get Sports
Illustrated for 70% off the cover price?

167
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:38,305
Can we have class outside?

168
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:41,044
I got to find a way
to reach this kid.

169
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,392
"Class number two."

170
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:47,693
"Top ten Robin Scherbatsky facial
expressions and their meaning."

171
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,155
Now, notice the vacant eyes,

172
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,179
the pale, queasy expression,
suggesting nausea.

173
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:56,311
- What do these mean?
- You guys just had sex?

174
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,830
Wasn't me.

175
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,876
Dude! I worked really hard
on these slides, okay? Can we just...

176
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:08,505
This look is hunger. If you ever see
Robin looking like this,

177
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,579
get some food in her quick,
or one of two things will happen.

178
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:12,511
One:

179
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,469
weird, out-of-context laughter

180
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:16,826
or two:

181
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,460
spontaneously falling
to sleep in strange places.

182
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,685
But...

183
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:25,494
the most important facial
expression of all?

184
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,384
That's a building.

185
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:33,489
That's for my class.
The Flatiron Building.

186
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:37,346
Fun story about it. It was designed
by Chicago's Daniel Burnham

187
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:39,494
in the Beaux-arts style.
This architectural...

188
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:45,000
The most important facial expression
of all.

189
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,283
Flared nostril ridges.

190
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:56,803
Wide, unblinking eyes.

191
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,310
If you ever,

192
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:01,285
ever see this face, Barney,

193
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,254
run.

194
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,055
And don't... take a picture of it.

195
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,630
She will punch you.

196
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,131
And you will cry...

197
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,870
for the third time...

198
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:15,212
that night.

199
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,027
Which brings us
to an important point:

200
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,248
defusing the bomb.

201
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:26,451
"Defusing the bomb"?

202
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,335
What does that even mean?

203
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,213
"Three topics to distract Robin
from being mad at you."

204
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,361
"Distract me"?
That is so condescending.

205
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:35,508
These guys are really
starting to piss me off!

206
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,277
"Immediately switch the conversation
to one of the following,

207
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:42,349
unless you want Robin to start
throwing her shoes."

208
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,479
"Vancouver Canucks
2004 division title."

209
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,717
What?! That's not distracting.

210
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:53,778
That's just talking about the story
of a scrappy little underdog team

211
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,055
that prevailed despite
very shaky goal ending

212
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,116
and, frankly, the declining
skills of Trevor Linden.

213
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,329
"Proper gun cleaning
and maintenance."

214
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,374
You have to clean your gun.

215
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,271
My uncle had a filthy old shotgun,

216
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:11,542
blew both his thumbs off
trying to shoot a beaver.

217
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,119
You want to distract someone,

218
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:16,394
make them watch my uncle
try to eat corn on the cob.

219
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:20,553
"Emperor penguins."

220
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,530
Did you know that
before intercourse,

221
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:26,852
the male and female emperor
penguins bow to each other?

222
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,630
Mr. Penguin.

223
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,397
Mrs. Penguin.

224
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,588
Oh, God, silly penguins,
acting all fancy.

225
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:37,482
What were we talking about?

226
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:39,784
Looks like we got a taker.

227
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:43,096
Oh, come on, dude.
You know you want to

228
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,963
a guy like you, beard, no mustache.

229
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,100
You're exactly the kind of guy
who could use a sweet barrel. Do it.

230
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:54,055
That's not a fire hydrant!

231
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:55,804
For shame, Sir.

232
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:56,965
For shame!

233
00:11:57,353 --> 00:12:00,927
I bet you couldn't even grow
a mustache if you wanted to.

234
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,763
- Neither can you, sweetie.
- He doesn't know that, baby! God!

235
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,114
Ted's only teaching Barney
horrible things about me.

236
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:12,606
I don't know. Check this out.
This is actually kind of sweet.

237
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:17,388
Now, we all know Robin's not
what you'd call "touchy-feely."

238
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:20,423
She doesn't say, "I love you",
like a normal person.

239
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:22,292
Instead, she'll laugh,

240
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:25,681
shake her head, give you
a little smile and say:

241
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,206
"You're an idiot."

242
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:28,955
"You're an idiot"?

243
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,709
If she tells you you're an idiot,
you're a lucky man.

244
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,350
And if she does say "I love you",

245
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:38,090
she's already broken up
with you in her mind.

246
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,971
I think's nice
that Ted knows you that well.

247
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:43,222
Too bad it's next
to a page entitled...

248
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,931
"Robin Scherbatsky's
surprising erogenous zones."

249
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,462
Right knee...

250
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:50,655
ticklish.

251
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,903
Left knee...

252
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:55,561
Does lefty like that?

253
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,492
Lefty like that.

254
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,257
I can't believe I'm taking
sexual advice from Ted Mosby.

255
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:08,541
That's like taking
fashion advice from...

256
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,288
well, Ted Mosby.

257
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:13,254
Here's a good one.

258
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:15,877
"Top five things never
to do around Robin."

259
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:21,549
"Never, ever play the
"Guess Who" game with her".

260
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,717
What do you mean?

261
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,038
Guess who?

262
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:29,399
It's me!

263
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:33,246
Number four: "Unless you want
to see it 80 times a day,

264
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:37,023
for the next month, never
show Robin a YouTube clip

265
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,891
of an animal playing
a musical instrument."

266
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:45,121
Do you have a problem
with this class?

267
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:47,909
It's boring as hell and
I'm not learning anything.

268
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,422
Maybe the problem is your attitude.
You're not listening to a word I say.

269
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,627
Can you hear this, Professor?

270
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,802
Or should I turn it up for you?

271
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:59,843
<i>It may not have been
a thumbs-up, kids.</i>

272
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,641
You think you're not
learning anything?

273
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:07,947
- Pop quiz.
- What...

274
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,888
When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind
of chocolate should you get her?

275
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:13,455
- Trick question. Get her butterscotch.
- Correct! Why?

276
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,897
Butterscotch is to Canadian women
what chocolate is to American women.

277
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,029
What is Robin's dream job?

278
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:21,962
To become the most successful
female TV journalist of all time.

279
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:24,608
And if she achieves that,
will she truly be happy?

280
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:27,045
Robin's deep-seated need
for attention can traced back

281
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,344
to her father's emotional distance, and
no amount of success will ever make up

282
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,163
for what she truly needs, which is
six simple words from her Dad,

283
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,248
"Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?"

284
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,563
But I guess you're right.

285
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:43,215
You haven't learned anything.

286
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,614
Sorry to have wasted your time.

287
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:51,811
"O Captain! My Captain!"

288
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,064
How good was Dead Poet's Society?

289
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,483
I know, right? The end? Tears.

290
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:05,321
Can I just say that
my deepest need in life

291
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,822
is not to have my father to say,
"I am proud of you, eh?"

292
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,616
Than why are you crying right now?

293
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,934
- I'm not crying.
- Oh, sweetie.

294
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:15,428
- Can I get you some butterscotch?
- Stop it.

295
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:23,755
Wait a second. It says here that
the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.

296
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,632
- So?
- That's right now.

297
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:30,313
Now, as you can see,
well over 50% of the blankets

298
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:32,472
have been dragged onto her side.

299
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,302
Make no mistake.

300
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:35,906
Robin Scherbatsky

301
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:37,346
is a classic,

302
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:38,818
textbook...

303
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:40,993
cover hog.

304
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,775
- Any questions?
- I have one.

305
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:46,304
Yes, Robin?

306
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:55,620
Flared nostril ridges.

307
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:57,330
Wide, unblinking eyes.

308
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,103
I got this.

309
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,086
Emperor penguins... crazy?

310
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,119
What the hell do you
two think you're doing?

311
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:09,594
Did you sells out?

312
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,069
I was vulnerable.

313
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:14,431
I said good-bye to
a very dear friend today.

314
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,433
Dude, it's a barrel!

315
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,312
- You're giving Mabel away?
- I have so many questions.

316
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:23,106
Why would you do this?
What were you thinking?

317
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:25,306
Who the hell is that guy?

318
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,862
That's Shin-Ya. He's sort of
been auditing the class.

319
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,454
"Auditing"?

320
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,694
I tried to explain to him
it wasn't a real class,

321
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,703
but I don't think he speaks
much English.

322
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,526
On the bright side, he came
in handy standing in for you

323
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:41,056
- during the role-playing exercises.
- Wait. You did role-playing exercises

324
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,270
where I was played by Shin-Ya?

325
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,133
You know, I can't believe you, Ted.

326
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,853
You actually think you're
some kind of an expert on me?

327
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,846
He is an expert.
He's a great teacher!

328
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,110
Kiss ass.

329
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:58,933
You know, half the stuff in this
notebook is patently wrong.

330
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,685
Really? Name one wrong thing.

331
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,885
"Robin Scherbatsky's surprising
erogenous zones"?

332
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,274
Let me clear something up
for you, Ted.

333
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,399
Does lefty like that?

334
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,870
The right one's ticklish, I guess.

335
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:22,248
But the left one, yeah,
I'm glad you're back there.

336
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,429
Because that is just some

337
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,284
sweet, sweet lovin'.

338
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:28,792
Noted.

339
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,879
- That was a lie?
- We had just started dating.

340
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:33,354
I was being nice.

341
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,093
And you.

342
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:38,211
You know, I got it into my head
this week that you were cheating on me.

343
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:40,934
I even broke open your briefcase
to look for evidence.

344
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,104
That is a huge
violation of my privacy!

345
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:48,650
Go on.

346
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,007
You know, in a way, I was right.

347
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:53,711
You cheated. You can't get
some crib sheet on dating me.

348
00:17:53,836 --> 00:17:55,118
That's not how it works.

349
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:59,247
If we didn't figure out how to be with
each other in a real, honest way,

350
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,241
I don't see the
point of even trying.

351
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,549
What do you want?

352
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:18,767
Look.

353
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,291
All that stuff I told Barney...

354
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,666
It was personal between you and me.

355
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:25,730
I'm really sorry.

356
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:29,594
I guess I'm impressed
by how much you remembered.

357
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,588
It's funny.

358
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,948
When you date someone,
it's like you're

359
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:36,542
taking one long course
in who that person is

360
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:40,076
and then, when you break up,
all that stuff becomes useless.

361
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,344
It's the emotional equivalent
of an English degree.

362
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:45,790
I guess I just liked the idea of

363
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:49,094
putting all my Robin Scherbatsky
knowledge to good use, you know?

364
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,033
Since you know me pretty well...

365
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,508
am I fooling myself
with this whole Barney thing?

366
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:56,968
I don't know.

367
00:18:58,462 --> 00:18:59,995
I will say this, though.

368
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,920
I've seen Barney work
very hard to get women.

369
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:06,432
I've seen him work very
hard to get rid of women.

370
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,265
I've never seen him work
this hard to keep one around.

371
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,209
I was going to give him an A.

372
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:16,070
Well, B+...
Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.

373
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:25,009
Before you say anything, I am done
with this stupid Robin 101, okay?

374
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:27,384
Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.

375
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:36,257
But there's... there's something that
I did want to say to you.

376
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:39,969
Robin, I have been
with a lot of women...

377
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:42,822
blondes, brunettes,

378
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:44,054
redheads,

379
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:46,072
big boobs,

380
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:47,383
small boobs,

381
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:48,603
medium boobs,

382
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:52,398
some boobs that were big,
but kind of in a bad way.

383
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:56,736
The point is... boobs that pointed
in opposite direc... The point is...

384
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:02,272
I'm really scared that
you're going to dump me

385
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:04,947
and that's why I did this
and I'm sorry.

386
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,284
You're an idiot.

387
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,799
You know...

388
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:22,904
That notebook... does contain
a lot of personal info,

389
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,279
and I think it has my home address.

390
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:27,004
And your work address.

391
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:34,659
Guys! If you don't want the barrel,
can you sit somewhere else? Cause...

392
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:37,184
You're scaring away
potential takers.

393
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:46,077
Designed by Chicago's Daniel Burnham
in the Beaux-arts style,

394
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,601
this architectural gem
was the first of its kind...

395
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:51,667
- Professor Mosby?
- Yes, Susan?

396
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,492
That's a woman drinking beer
on the toilet.

397
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,354
Right. That...

398
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,065
was Daniel Burnham's wife.
She was a troubled,

399
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,052
troubled woman. We are moving on.
