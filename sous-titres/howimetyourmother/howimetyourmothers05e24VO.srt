1
00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:03,012
<i>Kids, up to this point in the story,</i>

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,868
<i>We had found doppelgangers.</i>

3
00:00:04,993 --> 00:00:06,483
Eerie but awesome look-alikes

4
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:08,424
<i>for four members
of our little group.</i>

5
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,852
<i>There was Lesbian Robin...</i>

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,710
<i>Mustache Marshall...</i>

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,858
<i>Stripper Lily...</i>

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,636
<i>and Mexican Wrestler Me.</i>

9
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,588
<i>Yes, mine was the coolest.</i>

10
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:24,281
<i>And so we were all eager</i>

11
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:26,525
<i>to find The Fifth Doppelganger:
Barney's.</i>

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,403
<i>Turned out, it was more important
to some of us than others.</i>

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,533
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby

14
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,824
until we've seen
all five doppelgangers, right?

15
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,826
Of course.
Stands to reason.

16
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,395
So, when we finally see
Barney's doppelganger,

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,270
that's the universe
telling us it's go time.

18
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:43,500
And that's when we'll start trying.
Deal?

19
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:45,135
Deal.

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,530
<i>And then one day,
a few weeks later...</i>

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,091
Baby, were we serious
about the fifth doppelganger?

22
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:52,968
Having a baby is a big thing
to leave up to the universe.

23
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,682
I know it's crazy.

24
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:57,390
It's just so much easier
to let the universe decide.

25
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,083
Why do you ask?

26
00:01:01,204 --> 00:01:02,204
Universed!

27
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:05,341
Wait, hold on.

28
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,291
That could easily be Barney
pulling some scam to meet chicks.

29
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,111
I'm one step ahead of you.

30
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,328
Go for Barney.

31
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,629
It's Marshall.

32
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:15,491
So you are at work?
You're not, I don't know...

33
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:17,326
driving a cab, wearing a wig.

34
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:19,470
Yes, I'm at work.

35
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:23,163
That's the sound of my stapler.
That's the sound of my three-hole punch.

36
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:24,886
And this is the sound of me filing

37
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:27,167
my corporate guidelineson
sexual harassment.

38
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,579
What is up?

39
00:01:29,704 --> 00:01:31,257
Got to go, Big Chief.

40
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,612
Barney's at work.

41
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:39,925
That was the fifth doppelganger.

42
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,439
Put a baby in my belly.

43
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,935
Synchro: Titou & JoJo

44
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:03,247
I can't wait to tell the gang.

45
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,637
This is one of those moments
you dream about.

46
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:06,974
"Guys...

47
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,109
"Lily and I...

48
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:11,284
"are having unprotected sex."

49
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:12,715
I just got the chills.

50
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,257
We're not gonna say anything.

51
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,217
What? Why?

52
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,693
If we tell them,

53
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,647
we're basically inviting them

54
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,390
into the most private,
intimate moment of our lives.

55
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,688
You guys banging?

56
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,206
Keep goin,; I'm not even here.

57
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:31,567
For the record,

58
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,443
having a baby: huge mistake.

59
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:34,987
Now, show me what you got.

60
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,238
Uncle Teddy's here!

61
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,533
Quick question: How you gonna handle
the whole Santa thing?

62
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,051
I'm thinking, be honest.

63
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,386
Hell. I'll dress up.

64
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,164
<i>This just in...</i>

65
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,991
<i>is what Marshall Eriksen
is about to say to his wife</i>

66
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:50,060
<i>as he attempts to impregnate her.</i>

67
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,064
<i>Chopper 12 is live on the scene
with "Baby Watch: 2010".</i>

68
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,682
Fine. I won't tell anybody
about the baby thing.

69
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:08,578
We saw the fifth doppelganger!

70
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,065
- Amazing!
- That is awesome!

71
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:12,515
Freaky.

72
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,716
- A brunette Barney.
- I know.

73
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:17,811
Say what you will about the guy,
but Barney seems right as a blond.

74
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:19,949
Not every dude
can pull that off the blond look.

75
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,192
I don't know about that.

76
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,226
What?

77
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:27,481
That summer, I was lifeguarding
at the Chagrin Falls Country Club,

78
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:30,133
I was lathering a little lemon juice
into the old mop,

79
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:32,086
playing
with some natural highlights.

80
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:33,629
Let's say there were

81
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,258
a few senior citizens
who pretended to drown on my watch.

82
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,594
Sadly, one who did.
Anyway,

83
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,450
I'd look good blond.

84
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,025
<i>Okay, people, we're in a delicate</i>

85
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,977
<i>but very, very promising
situation here.</i>

86
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,386
<i>If we play
the next 30 seconds right,</i>

87
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,055
<i>Ted will dye his hair blond.</i>

88
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:54,951
<i>Guys, this is mean.</i>
<i>We can't... Just pictured it.</i>

89
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:56,068
<i>How do we do?</i>

90
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,728
<i>What are we all thinking about?
Nachos?</i>

91
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,364
<i>Ted Mosby responds to one thing
above all else.</i>

92
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,967
<i>I don't know,
I'm still kind of full from lunch.</i>

93
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,036
<I>A bunch of people emphatically
telling him not to do something.</i></I>

94
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:08,205
<i>Follow my lead.</i>

95
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,833
<i>Screw it, I could eat.</i>

96
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,585
Yes, we'd all like

97
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,979
some nachos.

98
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:19,616
I love you, buddy,
but there's absolutely no way

99
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,468
that you could pull off blond.

100
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,536
It just wouldn't look right.

101
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,181
Seriously, Ted, don't go blond.

102
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,183
I'm going blond!

103
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,460
That is not the outcome
we were hoping for!

104
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,415
<i>Now, kids, Robin and Don</i>

105
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,400
<i>were becoming such a great team,
both off</i>

106
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,331
<i>and on the air, that local Channel 12
started asking them</i>

107
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:42,031
<i>to guest-host
some of their other top-notch programs.</i>

108
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:53,042
So, that's why Monty and I
vow never to do drugs.

109
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,118
Because drugs are bad.

110
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:57,020
Right, Monty?

111
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:58,464
Well, sure,

112
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,382
man-made chemical stuff.

113
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,385
But things that grow in nature...

114
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:06,722
they're okay to try,
like, once or twice.

115
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:10,059
Not looking
for gray areas here, Monty.

116
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,603
I don't think it's right
to lie to the kids, Moo-Moo.

117
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,840
So... what are you saying?

118
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:19,526
I've experimented with drugs.

119
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,612
<i>Fun fact:</i>

120
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,580
<i>highest-rated</i>
<i>Monty and Moo-Moo episode ever.</i>

121
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:28,202
What was that for?

122
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,329
Before I met you,
I'd given up on everything.

123
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,181
Relationships, career,

124
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,930
pants.

125
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,386
But you made me want to try again.

126
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,923
I love you for that.

127
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:45,594
I see.

128
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:54,853
Sorry.

129
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:57,847
You don't know me,
but I just wanted to say thank you.

130
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,609
You're actually
a very important person in my life.

131
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:01,885
Important?

132
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,486
More like legendary.

133
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:05,355
Marshall, it's me!

134
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:09,016
<i>Oddly enough,
this would rank as only</i>

135
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,100
<i>the second biggest surprise
of the day.</i>

136
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,122
This is just very sudden.

137
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,395
Sure, I can get you
an answer by tomorrow.

138
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:27,182
Something big has just happened,
and you're the most sensible guy I know.

139
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,637
I need to talk to you.

140
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:30,973
It can wait.

141
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,142
Go ahead. I'm listening.

142
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,895
The executive producer from WNKW

143
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,682
happened to see our show
the other morning and loved me.

144
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:42,818
They offered me the lead anchor job,
starting next week.

145
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:44,894
That's great!

146
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,163
It is great.
But here's the catch.

147
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,158
WNKW is in...

148
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,326
Helen, kill the dryer!

149
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,664
Is in Chicago.

150
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:03,385
But you were the fifth doppelganger.
How can you be you?

151
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,779
I called you, Barney,
We had a whole conversation!

152
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,704
Yes, I know what happened.

153
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,244
See, people at work

154
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:13,182
have this very strange expectation
that I, well, work.

155
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:15,969
I know, I know.

156
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:19,119
<i>So to make my colleagues think
I'm busting my hump</i>

157
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:21,635
<i>when I'm really out humping
busty chicks,</i>

158
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,731
<i>I decided to record
a special message.</i>

159
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,268
What is up?!

160
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:26,649
Got to go, Big Chief.

161
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,705
How can it be a recording?

162
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,207
You called me Big Chief,
my special workplace nickname.

163
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:34,015
Oh, buddy.

164
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,632
Come on, Big Chief.

165
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:41,664
Don't.

166
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,078
Just don't.

167
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,715
Why does this have to happen now?

168
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,635
I mean, just when things
are going so great with Don.

169
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,014
It's the never-ending battle of my life:
Career versus romance.

170
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,479
"Never-ending battle"?

171
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:59,186
Career has been
trouncing romance for years.

172
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:01,805
It's like the Globetrotters
versus the Generals.

173
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,157
Career's sinking hook shots
from half court,

174
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:05,745
Romance is some slow white guys

175
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,570
who couldn't make it
in the Italian league.

176
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:10,684
I'm lost.

177
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,825
What should I do?

178
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:16,078
You seriously need
to talk to Don about this.

179
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:18,916
I'm just too confused
to put this on Don.

180
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,126
I need to leave him out of it
until I figure out what I want.

181
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,335
That makes sense.

182
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,041
I'm sorry I can't give you
better advice.

183
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,389
The truth is, it's impossible for me

184
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:30,470
to be objective
about you moving away.

185
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:37,349
- Did you get a manicure?
- No, I didn't get a...

186
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,117
- He sure did.
- Flo!

187
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:43,447
Why are you brunette
and driving a cab?

188
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:45,958
It's my dream to have sex

189
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,318
with at least one woman
from every country on the planet?

190
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,194
Sure.

191
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,450
You're doing surprisingly well
in the Baltics.

192
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,755
So, I figure, what's the quickest way
to get around the world in 180 lays?

193
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,167
Lease a cab and wait outside
the U.N. building for foreign chicks.

194
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:05,043
<i>It was the perfect plan.</i>

195
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:08,797
<i>There was only one small detail
I didn't take into account.</i>

196
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,627
- Chicks don't want to bang cab drivers.
- Chicks don't want to bang cab drivers!

197
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,595
And I put a lot of work
into this one.

198
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:16,793
I can't believe this.

199
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,892
Now I got to tell Lily
the fifth doppelganger is a fake.

200
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,435
So? What does she care?

201
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:25,068
Lily decided that once
we spotted your doppelganger,

202
00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:27,024
we'd start trying to have kids.

203
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,483
Kids?! No!

204
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,500
The rule is: no kids
until you're at least 45!

205
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,622
Do you ever read my blog?!

206
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,113
It's gotten a lot better.

207
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,816
I'm ready to be a dad, you know?

208
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:43,093
But Lily needs some sign
from the universe.

209
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:46,418
And now it could be years.

210
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:48,795
I'm sorry, buddy.

211
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,594
That'll be $37.50.

212
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:56,303
<i>So that night, Marshall went home
to break the bad news to Lily.</i>

213
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,001
The universe has spoken.

214
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:01,808
Let's make a baby.

215
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,621
Hang on. I heard you were doing this,
so I worked on some stuff.

216
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,917
I'm planning a "White Wedding." Tell me,
Billy Idol, is it a nice day for that?

217
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,527
Some other Billy Idol ones.

218
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:32,506
If anyone's looking for
the real Slim Shady, he's right here.

219
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:34,633
That one's only okay.

220
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,760
Robin,
why aren't you getting in on this?

221
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,304
First of all,
I'm getting tons of compliments.

222
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:42,097
Second of all, tell him.

223
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:44,768
- He's not getting tons of compliments.
- No, the other thing.

224
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:49,189
I might move to Chicago next week.

225
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:57,591
Not for nothing or nothing, but

226
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:01,076
we'd still be doing this even if we
hadn't seen Doppelganger Barney, right?

227
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,739
But we did see him,
which means the universe,

228
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,861
in all its infinite wisdom,

229
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,212
is telling you to stick me
and stick me real good.

230
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:10,962
I can't.

231
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,588
I can't in good conscience
stick you.

232
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,051
- I know what's bothering you.
- Really?

233
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:21,316
The cabbages didn't look enough
like Barney.

234
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,153
Well, that's just not true.

235
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,228
No! Time-out!

236
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,888
This is a group decision!

237
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:32,107
You can't just move to Chicago
unless we all say it's okay.

238
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,109
I think this has to be Robin's...

239
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,820
Stay out of this, Brigitte Nielsen
or Dolph Lundgren from <i>Rocky IV</i>!

240
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,526
We need Marshall and Lily.

241
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,825
That cabbie was like
a foot shorter than Barney!

242
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,535
He was the exact same size!

243
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,670
And you know what?
I think he was Asian

244
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:47,553
Yeah, that guy was like a tiny,

245
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:50,876
graying Asian man
with a soul patch and a potbelly.

246
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,919
Have you completely forgotten
what he's looks?

247
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,379
You guys banging?

248
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:56,298
Why are you in our bedroom?

249
00:11:58,163 --> 00:11:59,551
Why are you in our bedroom?

250
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,721
Why is Ellen DeGeneres
in our bedroom?

251
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:05,640
This is working!

252
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,049
Wait a minute.

253
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:10,881
Candles...

254
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,447
Flowers...

255
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,903
I guess Marshall "forgot"
to tell you.

256
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,743
The Fifth Doppelganger...

257
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,363
was me.

258
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,158
What? Wait,

259
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,217
and you knew about this?
You lied to me?

260
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,368
By omission,
and it's only because this whole

261
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:28,038
"leave it to the universe" thing
of yours is insane, Lily.

262
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,457
Lily, we need to be
in control of our own...

263
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,494
Guys! We're forgetting
what's really important here.

264
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,629
Ted's blond.

265
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,299
Guys, I am pulling this off.

266
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,535
Now, Robin has something
important to tell you.

267
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,054
- He's not pulling it off.
- No, the other thing.

268
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,218
- He got a manicure.
- The other thing.

269
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:51,186
I got a job offer in Chicago.

270
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,847
That's why we all came down here,

271
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:57,109
to try and talk Robin out
of making a huge...

272
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,611
Actually,
I've already made a decision.

273
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,178
Guys, I gotta take it.

274
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,181
I can't believe we're losing Robin.

275
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:16,431
<i>Guys, this might be
the depression talking,</i>

276
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:19,131
<i>but is Ted's hair starting
to look kind of good?</i>

277
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,633
<i>Thank God,
I thought I was the only one!</i>

278
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,771
<i>He looks like a freakin' movie star!</i>

279
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:25,693
And by the way,

280
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,890
this was a huge mistake.
I'm changing my hair back.

281
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:30,892
- Smart.
- Told ya.

282
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,349
Not at all awesome.

283
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,567
I just got off the phone
with Chicago.

284
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,286
Yes, I have made a decision.

285
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:51,001
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't take the job.

286
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:52,789
Thanks.

287
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:54,291
I'm staying.

288
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,417
Damn straight!

289
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:03,800
Tell me something.

290
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,305
When you saw actual Barney
driving that cab,

291
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,169
and you thought he was a petite,

292
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,848
potbellied Asian man?

293
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,344
I know. Weird, right?

294
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,684
It's not weird.

295
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:14,969
It means you're not ready.

296
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:17,439
I'm sorry
that I tried to rush things.

297
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,984
Our baby can wait
for the real Doppelganger Barney.

298
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,286
Hey, Moo-Moo.

299
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,274
Monty made you thin-crust pizza
just the way you like it!

300
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,089
You okay?

301
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,589
You're not gonna believe this.

302
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,726
I got offered the lead anchor job
at WNKW in Chicago.

303
00:14:55,892 --> 00:14:56,892
What'd you say?

304
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:00,087
I said yes.

305
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,294
I've been waiting years
for a shot like this.

306
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,452
Barney?

307
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:14,788
I am simple street performer

308
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:15,976
from Estonia.

309
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,910
Who is this Barney?

310
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:21,526
He's just this guy we know who has,
like, a really lame blog.

311
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:23,665
I hear it's getting better.

312
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:26,267
I mean, wha-what is "blog"?

313
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,843
It's just something that was cool,
like, eight years ago.

314
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,259
Still cool.
Still sounds pretty cool, man

315
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,306
- What's your name?
- Kristof.

316
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,766
Kristof what?

317
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,171
Kristof...

318
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,347
Doppelganger.

319
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,772
- Really?
- Yep.

320
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,608
You're gonna go with the last name
"Doppelganger"?

321
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,193
That's my name, man.

322
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:46,738
Bro...

323
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,161
- Robin, wait. Please try to understand.
- I gotta get out of here.

324
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:52,033
Wait. Put yourself in my shoes.

325
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,282
Can you imagine what it's like
to have the phone ring,

326
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,454
and it's your dream job
on the other end?

327
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:00,098
I can.

328
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:03,656
Good luck in Chicago, Don.

329
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,719
Barney, why are you doing this?

330
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,941
Wait a minute.

331
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:17,309
Could it be that Barney Stinson
actually wants us to have kids?

332
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:20,980
Who is this Barney?!
Take American chill pill!

333
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,663
Well, let me tell you about him.

334
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:28,613
He talks a big game
about how no one should ever have kids

335
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,739
before they're at least 45.

336
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:34,751
I would be interested in reading some
of these opinions in blog form.

337
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,399
But I think I know what happened.

338
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,200
Yesterday,
Barney thought he had to say good-bye

339
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:41,887
to someone he truly loves.

340
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:43,821
And it got him thinking...

341
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:47,760
Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing
if a baby joined our little group.

342
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:50,749
Babies...

343
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:52,624
can be cute.

344
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,284
And someday,

345
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:58,808
he's gonna make
the best uncle in the world.

346
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:00,769
Because this Barney...

347
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:02,615
He's family to us.

348
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:14,923
Excuse me.

349
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,285
I heard you're from Estonia.

350
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:18,990
So am I.

351
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:21,164
Excuse me one moment.

352
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:26,378
Estonia would close out the Baltics!

353
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:28,296
And I am

354
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,548
street performer like you.

355
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,030
Say yes to this.

356
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:57,242
Can I move back in?

357
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:03,339
Yes.

358
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,712
But, Ted, am I just
the biggest idiot in the world?

359
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:12,312
Think about all of us five years ago

360
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:13,758
when we first met you.

361
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:16,678
Marshall and Lily
were just boyfriend and girlfriend.

362
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,015
Now they're married
and thinking about kids.

363
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,351
And Barney? Barney
was never gonna commit to anyone ever.

364
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,073
And last year,

365
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:26,608
he fell in love.

366
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:28,452
And me?

367
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:32,402
I was chasing some girl
I was convinced was "The One."

368
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,302
Now she's one of my closest friends.

369
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
And you?

370
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:38,665
Five years ago,

371
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,940
you never would have chosen love over
your career, but today

372
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:43,371
you did.

373
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,749
- Looks like I'm getting dumber.
- No,

374
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,209
just more courageous.

375
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,631
We've all been searching
for The Five Doppelgangers, right?

376
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:56,569
But eventually, over time,

377
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,979
we all become our own doppelgangers.
You know, these...

378
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,758
these completely different people
who just happen to look like us.

379
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:08,534
"Five Years Ago Robin"?
That girl,

380
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:10,148
she was pretty great.

381
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,725
But Doppelganger Robin?

382
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:16,654
She's amazing.

383
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,869
- We've had a lot to drink...
- I don't care.

384
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,340
What?

385
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:42,352
I forgot I'm blond.

386
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:43,723
I have blond hair.

387
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,863
<i>And that's the story
of how dying my hair blond</i>

388
00:19:46,988 --> 00:19:50,168
<i>kept us from doing something
we both would have regretted that night.</i>

389
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,250
<i>Kids, the universe is funny.</i>

390
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,568
FOUR MONTHS LATER...

391
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,493
Oh, my God!

392
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,454
Yes! You're here!

393
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:08,134
This is fantastic!

394
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,125
Baby, simmer. Your husband's right
there. At least attempt to hide it.

395
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,784
Guys, follow me!

396
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,382
Guys, look!

397
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,300
The Fifth Doppelganger!

398
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,542
- That dude looks noth...
- <i>Guys...</i>

399
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:28,518
<i>Go with it.</i>

400
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:29,644
<i>Kids,</i>

401
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,968
<i>you can ask the universe for signs
all you want...</i>

402
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,159
It's uncanny.

403
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,191
Right?

404
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,151
- Just like Barney.
- Amazing.

405
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,868
It's like looking in the mirror.

406
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:41,761
<i>But ultimately,
we only see what we want to see</i>

407
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:43,659
<i>when we're ready to see it.</i>

408
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:46,317
So,

409
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:49,513
- does this mean...?
- Marshall Eriksen...

410
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:51,791
put a baby in my belly.
