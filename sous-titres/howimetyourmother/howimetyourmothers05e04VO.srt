1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,919
<i>It was the Fall of 2009
and I was a professor now.</i>

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,985
<i>So I decided to change
my look a little bit.</i>

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,860
<i>And people were noticing.</i>

4
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:09,925
Tweed.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,136
Textile of the eunuch.

6
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,848
I've always wondered why those
tweed jackets have elbow patches.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,599
Because the people who wear them
are constantly going,

8
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:20,853
"Geez. Why can I get laid?"

9
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:24,857
You are wrong.
The ladies dig the professor look.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,565
There is something to that.

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,862
I remember thinking my tenth grade
math teacher was very sexy.

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,740
I wonder if Harold's still in jail.

13
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:34,492
What?

14
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:36,064
Tax evasion.

15
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,537
Among other things.

16
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:43,136
So guys, Marshall and I wanted
to invite you to our place

17
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,960
for a little couples' night.

18
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:47,295
Sure. Why not?

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,572
<i>For years, Marshall and Lily
had been the only married couple</i>

20
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:52,259
<i>in a group full of single people.</i>

21
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,131
<i>It got lonely.</i>

22
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:57,431
<i>So they were always searching
for another couple to double-date.</i>

23
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,233
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

24
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:00,858
- Welcome.
- Gouda?

25
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:02,905
<i>They sucked at it.</i>

26
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:07,358
This is great. We're having fun.
You're having fun, right?

27
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:10,212
So, should we just go ahead

28
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,570
and lock the four of us in
for new year's?

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,532
It's april.

30
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:16,437
Right. Sorry.

31
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:19,408
We're getting ahead of ourselves.
Let's talk Thanksgiving.

32
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,833
Our parents really want to meet you!

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,380
Well, we should probably be going.

34
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,591
Wait. But, wait, if you leave now,
Colonel Mustard just gets away with it.

35
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,806
It's getting pretty late.
We're going to go.

36
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:36,095
There's still pie.

37
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:41,559
Tonight was fantastic.
We should do it again.

38
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:43,824
I'm sorry, Marshall

39
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:46,749
but Falguni and I
are just not that into you.

40
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:48,045
And you.

41
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,610
<i>But just when Lily and Marshall
were about to give up,</i>

42
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,928
<i>two of their best friends
in the world got together.</i>

43
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:57,253
<i>And hope returned to their hearts.</i>

44
00:01:58,428 --> 00:01:59,660
<i>So when Lily said...</i>

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,164
Marshall and I wanted to invite you to
our place for a little couples' night.

46
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:06,508
Sure, why not?

47
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:09,920
<i>Barney and Robin had no idea
what they were about to walk into.</i>

48
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,188
Okay. Game time.
Let's review the flow of the room.

49
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:15,504
Barney and Robin enter here,

50
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,853
stop here for margaritas.
That's a great conversation starter.

51
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:20,806
We can tell them about
our trip to Cabo.

52
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,956
Great, cause I got that story
about Sammy Hagar

53
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:24,810
and the Belgian waffle
locked and loaded.

54
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,646
Then we'll move on to the
hot apps station. And,

55
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,982
depending on how things are going,

56
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:32,192
some lively pre-dinner charades.

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,860
Right, but...
we'll play that one by...

58
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:37,614
Sounds like?

59
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:40,504
Okay, you can be Robin's partner.

60
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:44,413
Baby, we can do this.

61
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,809
- Welcome.
- Gouda?

62
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:54,097
<i>Meanwhile, my half-baked theory
that ladies dig the professor look</i>

63
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:55,971
<i>was actually proving to be true.</i>

64
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:57,598
So is it hard to grade papers?

65
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:59,884
You've just got to make it fun.
For example...

66
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:02,908
every time I spot a grammatical error,
I do a shot.

67
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:06,393
I'm trashed right now
and I blame our public school system.

68
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,105
<i>Sometimes things just seem
to magically fall into place.</i>

69
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:12,691
So, you said
you live right upstairs?

70
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,818
<i>Whether it's in the dating world...</i>

71
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,986
Take care.

72
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:18,611
<i>... or the double-dating world.</i>

73
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:21,533
- Nailed it!
- Best night ever!

74
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:25,352
Worst night ever.

80
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:45,845
How was the big couples'
night with Marshall and Lily?

81
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,643
- Brutal.
- Really? How?

82
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,954
It was like we were
on a date with a sad,

83
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,168
chubby girl our mom made us call.

84
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:53,649
And they were so nervous,

85
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,221
that they weren't even
making sense half of the time.

86
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:58,737
Come on in.
Would you like a margarita?

87
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,323
In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar
eating a Belgian waffle!

88
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:06,953
And they kept shoving platters
of food in our faces.

89
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,248
Let me guess, did Marshall get, like,
super intense about the cheese?

90
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:13,160
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Poor Marshall.

91
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,774
Lily's this gourmet cook,
and all she lets Marshall do is

92
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:18,005
pick out one sad block of cheese.

93
00:04:18,544 --> 00:04:20,175
That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.

94
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,511
You guys are going to want
to get in on this gouda.

95
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,971
That's seared scallops
with a mango chutney.

96
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,364
Seriously, don't sleep on the gouda.

97
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:30,143
And that's lobster ravioli
in a black truffle oil.

98
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:32,615
Tick-tock goes the gouda clock.

99
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,537
We didn't realize
there was gonna be dinner.

100
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:38,819
We sucked down
a couple tacos outside the subway.

101
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:40,824
PS, not sitting great.

102
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,910
And if anything didn't go according
to plan, they would freak out.

103
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,830
What do you mean,
the egg timer is broken?

104
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,098
What are we going to use
for charades, sweetie?

105
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:54,501
I'm working on it, darling.
Okay? Just stall them.

106
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:56,867
Now, Robin...

107
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,905
You work in television.
We're experiencing some

108
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,384
technical difficulties.
You get that?

109
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,173
We're still laughing.
Right? Laugh, Marshall.

110
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,228
Come on, they just got excited.

111
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,834
They've been looking for couple
best friends forever.

112
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,307
Plus, I'm sure
they weren't that bad.

113
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,568
Show him.

114
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,629
This is a web site Marshall
already made about last night.

115
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:28,500
It's called:
itwasthebestnightever.com.

116
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,085
<i>It was the best night ever</i>

117
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:39,008
<i>Laughter raining down
like April showers</i>

118
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,144
<i>We talked for hours...</i>

119
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:48,305
- <i>Best night ever</i>
- That's not good.

120
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,132
<i>Then we played charades</i>

121
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:54,533
<i>Lily made some creme brulee...</i>

122
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:57,777
<i>And now that we're
best couple friends</i>

123
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:00,458
<i>There's only one thing</i>

124
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,664
<i>Left to say...</i>

125
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,539
<i>Are you free?...</i>

126
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,542
<i>Are you free next Saturday?</i>

127
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,862
- That's the 17th.
- <i>Are you free?</i>

128
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:14,555
Friday or Sunday would also work.

129
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,530
Or basically any other day.

130
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,660
Needless to say, we've both
changed our e-mail addresses.

131
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:23,298
I don't understand.
If last night went so horribly,

132
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,723
why do Lily and Marshall
think it was such a hit?

133
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:29,703
We knew we were gonna have fun tonight
but we had no idea how much.

134
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,419
Tough luck, every Saturday night
I've ever had,

135
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,571
cause this one just
blew you out of the water.

136
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,853
- Let's do it again, soon.
- Yeah, we'll call you.

137
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,815
They're your friends! Why would you
just blatantly lie to them like that?

138
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,359
That's what you say
at the end of a crappy date.

139
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,090
Great time last night.

140
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:48,749
Let's do it again, soon.
I'll call you.

141
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:51,732
Right?

142
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:55,528
- Who was that?
- I don't want to brag, but

143
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:58,458
it seems chicks are really digging
the whole professor thing.

144
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:01,005
Last night,
she picked me up at the bar.

145
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,180
And then...

146
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,590
She actually wound up falling asleep
on the couch. But, hey,

147
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:07,874
that happens.

148
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:11,493
- No, it doesn't.
- Sure, it does.

149
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:14,974
You know, she was just exhausted
from being turned on.

150
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,843
But you heard her.
She wants to do it again, soon.

151
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:21,882
Ted, let me ask you a question.

152
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,025
Where does this girl live, exactly?

153
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,793
Westchester. Why?

154
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:31,866
- You're the Sexless Innkeeper.
- Oh, my God! You're right!

155
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,918
He's totally the Sexless Innkeeper!

156
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,287
What the hell is
"the Sexless Innkeeper"?

157
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,298
Many a man...
nay, many a soul...

158
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:42,192
has their own tale of
the Sexless Innkeeper.

159
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:44,967
Why, I had run-in
with one just last year.

160
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:47,192
I even composed a poem about it.

161
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,252
- Would you care to hear it?
- Not really.

162
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:53,127
"It was the night before new year's
and the weather grew mean.

163
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:56,770
It was 3:00 in the morning
and I was stranded in queens."

164
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,260
<i>"The tavern grew empty,</i>

165
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,135
<i>the gas lights grew dim."</i>

166
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:05,683
<i>"The horse-drawn carriages
were all but snowed in..."</i>

167
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:07,391
Wait. If this was last year,

168
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:09,685
why are you acting like
it was Oliver Twist?

169
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,372
It's a poem.

170
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,892
<i>"Last call was approaching</i>

171
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,050
<i>and my fortunes looked bleak."</i>

172
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,244
<i>"Then I turned to my left</i>

173
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:20,969
<i>and stifled a shriek."</i>

174
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:24,056
<i>"She had a peach fuzz beard</i>

175
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:26,317
<i>and weighed 16 stone."</i>

176
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:28,746
<i>"She gobbled up hot wings</i>

177
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:30,990
<i>and swallowed the bones."</i>

178
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:32,908
<i>"I muffled a scream</i>

179
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,842
<i>and threw up in my mouth."</i>

180
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,537
<i>I asked,</i> "Where do you live?"

181
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:40,349
<i>And she said,</i> "One block south."

182
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:43,093
<i>"I swallowed my pride</i>

183
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,804
<i>and six shots of whiskey."</i>

184
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:50,719
<i>"And prayed to the gods</i>

185
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:52,783
<i>that she wasn't too frisky."</i>

186
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:57,416
<i>"Back in her cave,
she prepared us a snack."</i>

187
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:01,936
<i>"Neath her mighty hooves,
the floorboards did crack."</i>

188
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:04,781
<i>"But when she returned,</i>

189
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,003
<i>she found a sound sleeper."</i>

190
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,589
<i>"And thus she became</i>

191
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:12,136
<i>the Sexless Innkeeper."</i>

192
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,427
And so are you

193
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:17,888
Wait, you're saying that girl
just used me for a place to crash?

194
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,555
Ted, you mentioned that
you live right upstairs.

195
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,388
She saw the tweed jacket
which basically says

196
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:27,348
you're not interested in, nor probably
even capable of, having sex.

197
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:29,873
And she thought,
"Hey, free lodging."

198
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,241
No way.

199
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:33,487
I'm not the Sexless Innkeeper.

200
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:37,370
That girl had no intention
of ever hooking up with you.

201
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,591
Which is funny, because usually

202
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:42,413
it's the Innkeeper
who offers turndown service.

203
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:46,792
Hey, guys. Good news.

204
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,962
First of all, you can ignore all the
e-mails and texts we've sent you.

205
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,500
We have. Go on.

206
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,652
Because we went ahead and booked

207
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:55,885
that couples weekend
for all of us in Vermont!

208
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,308
Wait, you guys were
serious about that?

209
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:02,183
We never joke about B&B's, especially
at the height of syrup season.

210
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,594
Saturday we've got apple-picking,
antiquing, then

211
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,334
a hanted hay ride.

212
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:11,274
And then on Sunday, we're up
at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike.

213
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,481
Now, you better pack your long Johns,
cause it is cold up there.

214
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,814
I'm sorry that we have been
dodging your calls

215
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:21,113
but we respect you guys
too much as friends

216
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:24,109
to give you some song and dance.
You deserve the truth.

217
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:31,845
The US Navy has found
intelligent alien life

218
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,820
at the bottom of the ocean.

219
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:35,899
For reasons I can't explain,

220
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:38,886
Robin and I have been tapped
to lead the expedition.

221
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,003
That kind of sounds like
the stuff you say to girls

222
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:45,392
when you're too much
of a coward to dump them.

223
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,891
You know, that's exactly
what it sounds like.

224
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:50,105
But if that's true, that's awesome.

225
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:52,898
What's going on?

226
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,363
Look, all the couple-y stuff,
it's just not us.

227
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,615
Barney and I are barely equipped
to date each other, let alone you guys.

228
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,535
Plus, the alien thing.

229
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:05,762
- Come on, Marshall. Let's go.
- Let's go.

230
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:08,037
- No... Lily...
- You know what?

231
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:11,227
I hope those underwater aliens
are cold-blooded.

232
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,880
Cause then you guys will
get along just fine.

233
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,179
I think they bought it.

234
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:26,358
I can't believe they
broke up with us.

235
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:27,833
We're so lovable.

236
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:31,243
No, we're not.
We're ugly and gross.

237
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,192
- I thought we did everything right.
- I know!

238
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,983
I know. We had the gouda.

239
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:40,489
We had my waffle story. I even sent
them a awesome photo montage.

240
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:43,261
Nothing.

241
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:45,422
Oh, dear God.

242
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:49,061
Marshall, we've been
over and over this.

243
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,786
You have to stop
sending those to people.

244
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:53,311
<i>It was true.</i>

245
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:55,611
<i>Marshall had become addicted
to creating songs</i>

246
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,590
<i>and photo montage is documenting
various mundane events.</i>

247
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,933
<i>So for months,
all of Marshall's friends and</i>

248
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:03,470
<i>professional colleagues
were getting e-mails like this...</i>

249
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,326
<i>Ordered Chinese food today</i>

250
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,914
<i>Some moo shu pork sauce got away</i>

251
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:12,687
<i>Flipped the cushion</i>

252
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:15,458
<i>Now everything's okay.</i>

253
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:21,880
<i>Cat-sitting for Lily's mom</i>

254
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,189
<i>Cat-sitting for Lily's mom</i>

255
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:27,393
<i>It's gonna be fun</i>

256
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:30,608
<i>It's gonna bring us all
closer together.</i>

257
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,558
<i>Cat funeral...</i>

258
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:38,979
<i>Cat funeral...</i>

259
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,526
<i>It was an accident</i>

260
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,911
<i>And not entirely my fault</i>

261
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,752
<i>Cat funeral...</i>

262
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,015
<i>We'll miss you, Whiskers.</i>

263
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,157
I can't believe you sent them
one of those.

264
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,200
They think we're insane now.

265
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:10,996
If I recall, they didn't dump us until
you brought up that Vermont trip.

266
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:14,226
It was way too early.
First, a boat ride around the city,

267
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:17,628
then a trip to Vermont. It's a rookie
mistake, and you're better than that.

268
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,340
What about you forgetting to check
the egg timer for charades?

269
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:24,713
I gave you one thing to do,
Marshall. One thing.

270
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:26,455
One thing?

271
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:28,065
One thing?

272
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,295
Really?

273
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,943
I guess that gouda

274
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,813
just walked itself
right through the door...

275
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,767
sliced itself up,

276
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:43,742
and arranged itself
in a perfect semi-circle

277
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,450
around not three,

278
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,616
not four...

279
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:49,476
but five

280
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:53,206
different kinds of sturdy,
cheese-bearing crackers?

281
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,417
You're a sturdy,
cheese-bearing cracker!

282
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:02,144
Lily and Marshall haven't been
to the bar all week.

283
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,863
They're taking this really hard.

284
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:06,083
I could listen to this
guilt trip all day,

285
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,261
but don't you have to
get back up to the inn?

286
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,184
Who's working the front desk?

287
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,433
Seriously, they're your friends.
You got to go apologize.

288
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:15,431
To your point, Ted,

289
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:18,563
as an Innkeeper,
do you do that cheapy thing

290
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:21,581
where you only change
the linens upon request?

291
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:25,111
How much water
is that actually saving?

292
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,370
Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring
a problem doesn't make it go away.

293
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:30,162
Usually, it just makes it bigger.

294
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,757
- You're right.
- Thank you.

295
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:34,120
All that sexlessness
has made you wise.

296
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,770
For God's sake!

297
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:37,249
Mint on the pillow!

298
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,501
And don't charge for wi-fi.
It seems greedy!

299
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:45,594
<i>But eventually,
even Barney and Robin had to admit</i>

300
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,842
<i>they owed Lily and Marshall
an apology.</i>

301
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:51,304
We wanted to say we're sorry.

302
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:53,640
I wish you had called.

303
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:57,477
I swear, he was right there
just eating a Belgian waffle!

304
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:02,857
He can't have enjoyed it as much
as I'm enjoying this gouda!

305
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,862
Listen...
Now's not a good time.

306
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:08,405
We'll call you.

307
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:10,156
Wait, we just want...

308
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:20,792
Long time no see.
Have a seat.

309
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:24,044
We can't.
We're here with Py and Shea.

310
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,409
It's just... we haven't seen
you guys all week.

311
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,834
Maybe all six of us could hang out.

312
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,898
It might be weird.
We're kind of on a double date.

313
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:36,182
Wouldn't want you to feel
like a fifth and sixth wheel.

314
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,435
Who the hell are these people?

315
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:40,903
They just moved here from Hawaii.

316
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:43,478
Py is a total foodie
and Shea, well...

317
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:45,221
She's...

318
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,510
Shea... Shea is just...

319
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:55,186
Anyhoo, we can't stay long.
We're just gonna grab a quick beer

320
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,621
and then take these kooks
for a boat ride around the city.

321
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:00,915
It sounds like this is
getting pretty serious.

322
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:03,401
We don't want to jinx it, but...

323
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,462
we kind of think
they might be the two.

324
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,301
- Who needs 'em?
- Not us.

325
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:24,876
<i>Livin alone</i>

326
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:29,876
<i>We think of all the friends
we've known</i>

327
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:35,674
<i>But when we dial the telephone</i>

328
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,033
<i>Nobody's home</i>

329
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:44,937
Two for dinner.

330
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:46,294
Just the two of you?

331
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:52,829
<i>All by ourselves</i>

332
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,647
<i>Don't want to be</i>

333
00:16:57,424 --> 00:17:00,948
<i>All by ourselves</i>

334
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,811
<i>Anymore</i>

335
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:08,172
<i>All by ourselves...</i>

336
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:10,710
Why don't we call that

337
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:13,457
weird couple down the hall
from you? You know, with the ferrets?

338
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,852
Maybe they want to come over
and play taboo.

339
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:17,380
After midnight? No way.

340
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,869
We can't Tabooty-call them,
it's pathetic.

341
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:26,605
Are you wearing sweat pants?

342
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,956
Maybe. But they're Armani.

343
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,194
Okay, guys, I've got
some bad news for you.

344
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,304
So I'm just going
to come out and say it.

345
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,729
You're a couple.

346
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:40,581
And no matter how hard you try to
fight it, couples need other couples.

347
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:42,819
That's why you miss
Marshall and Lily.

348
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,944
And can't you just admit that?

349
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:52,193
- That was amazing, Lily!
- I know!

350
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:55,446
When I got that left-hand-yellow,
I was like, "What?!"

351
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:59,185
- You guys are the best.
- Right back at you!

352
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:48,124
For charades.

353
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,879
How do we know you two
won't hurt us again?

354
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:55,590
You don't.

355
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,708
You know what? We have two...

356
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,754
very nice people
up in that apartment

357
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:04,140
who are perfect for us.

358
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:06,183
Then what are you doing,

359
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,769
standing out in the rain with us?

360
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:10,784
Damn it.

361
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:14,336
Why is there something
so attractive about a bad boy...

362
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:15,401
and girl?

363
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,911
I think we can change them.

364
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:21,857
Come here, you two.

365
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,622
We'll never sleep
on the gouda again.

366
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,982
<i>All by ourselves...</i>

367
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,876
I got a little poem for you.
You want to hear it?

368
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,552
- Not really.
- "It was the night before this one,

369
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:43,881
I had hours to kill.

370
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:47,576
<i>I sat in the tavern,
grading parchments with quill."</i>

371
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,809
With quill?

372
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,978
Barney. It's a poem.

373
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:55,024
<i>A busty, young lassie
flashed me a grin.</i>

374
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,988
<i>Her garb said "classy",
but her eyes whispered "sin".</i>

375
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:02,072
<i>She said, "You're a teacher?"</i>

376
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,741
<i>I said, "Yes, indeed".</i>

377
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,670
<i>"I must have you", she moaned.
"I'm turned on by tweed".</i>

378
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:12,410
<i>With haste we did scamper
to my chamber anon.</i>

379
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,326
<i>We fell to the couch,
and, bro, it was on.</i>

380
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:20,785
<i>I unlaced her bodice.
Our passions grew deeper.</i>

381
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:22,961
<i>And thus ends the tale</i>

382
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:26,190
<i>of the Sexless Innkeeper."</i>

383
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,360
No way.

384
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:31,060
You made that up.

385
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,939
Are you coming back to bed,
professor?

386
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:41,396
God, I love being single.

387
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:46,657
You ready for brunch
with Lily and Marshall?

388
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:48,444
What have I done?
