1
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:09,577
<i>Kids, on my first day
as a college professor,</i>

2
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:12,428
<i>there were two things
I didn't know that I wish I did.</i>

3
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:16,807
<i>The first thing was that your mother
was in that classroom.</i>

4
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>The second thing?</i>

5
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,191
<i>To explain that, we have to go back
to the beginning of the summer,</i>

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,486
<i>when, after a year of wrestling
with their feelings for each other,</i>

7
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,672
<i>Barney and Robin finally, well...</i>

8
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,202
- Use your indoor "whoo".
- Sorry!

9
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:40,257
It's just they kissed!
They're finally a couple.

10
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:44,016
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is our first double date!

11
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:47,029
First of millions!
What if our kids get married!

12
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:48,254
I love this!

13
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:51,592
Lily, listen.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,977
- Barney's awesome.
- Robin's more than just awe-"some".

15
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:57,830
She's awe-"quite a bit".

16
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:59,905
She's awe-"a whole darn lot".

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,936
Wait, what are you saying?

18
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:04,463
We're just not feeling it right now.

19
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,482
But we'll totally still be friends.

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,111
Is it something I did?

21
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,186
God, no.
Lily, it's not you.

22
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:15,231
- It's... It's us.
- Yeah. It's us.

23
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:16,867
You understand, right?

24
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,848
Sure, of course.

25
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:21,747
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

26
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:26,679
We were gonna take
cooking lessons together

27
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:29,463
and we were gonna go
on camping trips together

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,945
and then we were gonna sit around
telling funny stories

29
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,850
about our cooking lessons
and our camping trips.

30
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:37,573
I know, I know.

31
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:44,701
So, has the boat sailed
on sex tonight or...

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,109
<i>After that, the summer
went by way too fast.</i>

33
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,821
<i>Until the Friday before my first day
as a college professor.</i>

34
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:56,365
What's this?

35
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,884
It's just a little something
that we got for you

36
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,798
that used to belong
to my favorite professor of all time.

37
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:07,543
A fedora.

38
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:15,107
I'm Indiana Jones!
I'm Indiana Jones!

39
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:18,482
That, my friend,
is the Dominator 8000,

40
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:21,015
the best bullwhip on the market,
according to my whip guy.

41
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,759
Yeah, I have a whip guy.

42
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,941
- You know what we should do?
- Finish our drinks,

43
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,106
go out in the alley, and whip stuff.

44
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,734
God, you just get me.

45
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:34,862
I should get going.
I got a date.

46
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,740
- Are you still seeing that guy?
- Even better, seeing him naked.

47
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,419
I should go, too. I hooked up
with this Chinese girl last night,

48
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:45,635
and I don't know, it's weird.
I already feel like seconds.

49
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,335
Okay, Ted, you got first whip!

50
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:51,738
All right.

51
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:53,278
Hey, dummy.

52
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,952
What did tell you
about smoking in here?

53
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:58,959
Make him whip the habit!
I'so excited about this whip!

54
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,408
I got whip fever!
Just whip him, Ted!

55
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,682
Don't even aim!
Just whip him!

56
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,147
- I am so sorry.
- No, it's just the whip's not a toy.

57
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:08,212
There's such a thing
as common sense.

58
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:11,973
- You can whip me if you want.
- I will, some other time.

59
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,636
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

60
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:35,970
So, how long has this been going on?

61
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:37,591
All summer.

62
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:40,177
I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!

63
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,888
You guys are boyfriend
and girlfriend.

64
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,428
- Girlfriend?
- No. Lily...

65
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:49,436
- Slow your roll there, Lilypad.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,064
You've been together all summer.
I don't get it.

67
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:55,108
Okay, it's like this.
After we kissed,

68
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,819
we sat down to have the talk.

69
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:00,762
- We should figure out what this is.
- Yes, we should.

70
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:02,283
Or.

71
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,021
Or...

72
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:08,673
Okay, now, we have
to figure this out.

73
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,210
Yes, we do.

74
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:12,126
Or. Or...

75
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,968
We kept trying to have the talk
and then we realized we hate the talk.

76
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,636
Yeah, the talk sucks.

77
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,831
You have to, like, talk.

78
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:28,171
And be all, "I don't know.
It's not that I don't like you.

79
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,800
"It's that I haven't had
a girlfriend in a really long time.

80
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:33,606
"I hope it doesn't make you mad."
Who needs it?

81
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,024
You needs it.

82
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,592
Guys, you can't just keep hooking up

83
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:40,321
and not at least try and figure out
what you mean to each other.

84
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:43,435
Yeah, we knew you would say that.
That's why we kept it a secret.

85
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,296
Well, that and the fact
that elaborate lies really turn us on.

86
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:53,111
You need to define the relationship.
You need to have the talk.

87
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:54,465
Or...

88
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,859
Or...

89
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,175
I know what you're all thinking.

90
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,740
"Who's this cool peer of mine
up in front the class?"

91
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:08,649
Well, I know the board
says "Professor Mosby," but to you

92
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:10,978
I'm Ted

93
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,221
Question. Awesome.

94
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:17,274
- Hit it.
- Yeah, here's my question.

95
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,235
"Ted", who the hell
do you think you are?

96
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,404
Yeah, "Ted".

97
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,658
We're supposed to learn from you?
You failed as an architect.

98
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,637
- Well...
- And if you're a professor,

99
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,117
- where's your hat and your whip?
- At home...

100
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:31,872
And where are your pants?

101
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:39,331
Oh, God.
It was awful.

102
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:40,719
I was teaching...

103
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:43,581
Ted, now's not a good time.
Where do you keep your condoms?

104
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:47,721
I'm freaking out,
I don't think I can do that.

105
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:49,948
Okay, look, mistake n°1

106
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:51,809
was taking that girl's question.

107
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,937
You don't take questions
on the first day. It shows weakness.

108
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:58,149
Mistake n°2
was you should've hit that.

109
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,034
Your pants were already off,

110
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,149
you had a classroom full
of people to cheer you on,

111
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,494
and you don't knock her up
'cause it's a dream.

112
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,031
Class dismissed.

113
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,257
Mistake n°3:
dude, where was the hat?

114
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,744
Because if you're not gonna wear it,
I'm taking it back.

115
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,378
I think what Barney's saying
is that definitions are important.

116
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,333
You're their teacher,
not their friend.

117
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,459
Exactly.

118
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,087
If people don't know their place,
nobody's happy.

119
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,225
Amen.

120
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,258
- You have to make things clear.
- Ron tell dat.

121
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:26,468
Define the relationship.

122
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,763
Lily, private convo time.

123
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:35,561
Can't you just let us be happy?

124
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,965
You're not happy.

125
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,440
You just think you're happy
because you feel happy.

126
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:42,359
- And that's not happy?
- Of course not.

127
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,445
You and Robin need to have the talk.

128
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,363
Why? Give me one good reason.

129
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,051
- I'll give you 20...
- You can't even think of one.

130
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,367
Headlights. Deer.

131
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:52,786
Lily, for the last time,

132
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,211
things with me and Robin
are as good as they can possibly be.

133
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:57,416
Brad's here.

134
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:01,670
I've got 2 tickets to the Rangers
vs Canucksame tomorrow night.

135
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:04,173
I know you're a hockey fan,
so I was thinking...

136
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,557
What do I have to do?
Put a gun to your head?

137
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:13,922
- Buy you a six pack?
- Come on, Brad, that's...

138
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:16,268
There's really six of them.

139
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,731
- I can't.
- Why not? You have a boyfriend?

140
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:25,681
- No, no boyfriend.
- Great! It's a date.

141
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:32,076
I just thought of a reason.

142
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:38,290
<i>The next night, Robin and Brad
went to a hockey game.</i>

143
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:41,502
You're probably wondering
why I've been quiet all night.

144
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,525
Damn it, Hordichuk!

145
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,094
You miss another gimme like that,
I'm gonna come down there

146
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,968
and put a slapper right up
your beerhole! Come on!

147
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:51,637
Not really.

148
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,724
The truth is, I feel kind of weird
being out with you.

149
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:58,644
Oh, man.
Is this the talk?

150
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,783
- What?
- No, this is good.

151
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,525
Let's get it all out of the way.
I'm looking for something serious.

152
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,097
- No, Brad, no, it's...
- But before we go any further,

153
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:10,203
you should know something
about my stuff below the belt.

154
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:12,241
I was born a little different.

155
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:13,523
God, no!

156
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:18,163
- This is about me and Barney.
- You and Barn...

157
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,064
- So you, you guys are...
- Well, we don't know what we are.

158
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,934
I mean, my heart says
"leap into it".

159
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,171
My brain says "it's a bad idea".

160
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,173
Sounds like
you need to have the talk.

161
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,008
We're not gonna have the talk!

162
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,917
Would you just have the talk, okay?
It's a five-minute conversation,

163
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,928
and then you get
to have sex afterwards.

164
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:37,808
It's great! Back me up, Ted.

165
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,811
- I don't think the talk is necessary.
- What?

166
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,146
Thank you, Ted.

167
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,481
Because Robin
is already his girlfriend.

168
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,649
What?!

169
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,360
MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...

170
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:51,280
How do you keep a girl
from becoming your girlfriend.

171
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,449
Simple: the rules for girls
are the same as the rules for gremlins.

172
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:57,578
- "Gremlins"?
- Gremlins. Rule n°1:

173
00:08:57,814 --> 00:08:59,333
never get them wet.

174
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,920
In other words, don't let her
take a shower at your place.

175
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:04,381
N°2: keep them away from sunlight,

176
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:07,110
i.e. don't ever see them
during the day.

177
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:10,090
And rule n°3:
never feed them after midnight.

178
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,649
Meaning she doesn't sleep over

179
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:14,636
and you don't have breakfast
with her, ever.

180
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:16,972
What about brunch?
Is brunch cool?

181
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:21,048
No, Ted.
Brunch is not cool.

182
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,310
OK, new topic.
How do I pick a tie?

183
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:27,733
Simple: remember
in the movie <i>Predator...</i>

184
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,099
I've done all three of those things
with Robin.

185
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:33,488
Is she my girlfriend?

186
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:38,589
Just once, I wish you guys
would call me on Tuxedo Night.

187
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,867
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
time to pucker up</i>

188
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:45,608
<i>for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!</i>

189
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,555
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

190
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:52,090
OK, how about this? If you kiss me
and you feel bad about it,

191
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,999
you're meant to be with Barney.

192
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:56,012
Why not?
Lay it on me.

193
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:03,852
Hey, Brad.

194
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,036
We can't fight like this!
We both got some good shots in.

195
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:10,491
Let's call a truce!

196
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:12,300
It's okay, dude.

197
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:14,363
I shouldn't kiss
other guy's girlfriend.

198
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,198
- Girlfriend? Come on.
- That's putting it a bit strongly.

199
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,447
A bit strongly.
She's not my girlfriend.

200
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:23,695
A girlfriend's a bit much,
Brad, okay?

201
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,166
Okay, seriously.

202
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,834
We're at the point
of physical violence.

203
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:31,282
Now, will you please have the talk?

204
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,761
Because of that?

205
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:34,635
Come on. That's my thing.

206
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,510
I'm always punching guys.

207
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:39,221
Girls... I'll punch a baby.
I don't care.

208
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:43,558
<i>Finally, my first class had arrived.</i>

209
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:44,990
<i>For real this time.</i>

210
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:47,136
<i>I knew I had to make
a strong impression.</i>

211
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:49,094
<i>I had thought of everything.</i>

212
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:50,219
<i>Except...</i>

213
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,424
<i>Wait. Does professor
have one "F" or two?</i>

214
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:54,199
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

215
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:55,324
<i>Professor.</i>

216
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:56,905
<i>Pro-fess-or.</i>

217
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,783
<i>They're all staring at me.
Professor.</i>

218
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:02,415
<i>I don't know.
Just do something!</i>

219
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,009
<i>Two "F's."</i>

220
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:06,684
<i>That looks right.</i>

221
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,041
<i>I think that's right.</i>

222
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,851
Sorry, I went
a little too far last night.

223
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,984
We've been over this.
Unless I say "flügelhorn",

224
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,545
you haven't gone too far.

225
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,399
No, I meant punching Brad.

226
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,572
Right. Look,
don't even worry about it.

227
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:37,821
God.
The doorknob's broken off.

228
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,782
We're locked in here.
Did you do this?

229
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,827
Flügelhorn.
Did you do this?

230
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,249
Are you out there?

231
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,108
Ted's not here, Robin.

232
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,045
Let us out of here.

233
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:54,508
I'd be glad to.

234
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:57,341
Just as soon as you
and Barney have the talk.

235
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,971
Lily! Come on.
Let us out!

236
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,598
No. Sit down,

237
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,325
define the relationship,

238
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,886
write down that definition
on a piece of paper,

239
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,644
slip it under the door,

240
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,773
and if I like what I read,
you can go.

241
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,942
- We are not having the talk!
- Then you'll die in there.

242
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,202
You're gonna lock us in here?
Guess what?

243
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,977
Maybe we'll spend
the whole day having sex!

244
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,666
Well, guess what?

245
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:25,827
I brought Marshall with me,
so maybe we'll do the same.

246
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:27,431
Hey, guys.

247
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:32,459
<i>I still hadn't decided
what kind of professor I wanted to be.</i>

248
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:35,241
<i>Authoritative or cool guy.</i>

249
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,169
<i>I thought I would decide
in the moment.</i>

250
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:39,446
<i>And I did. About 20 times.</i>

251
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:40,812
Good morning.

252
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,870
'sup, dudes?

253
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,133
Silence!

254
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,065
This is architecture 101.

255
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,900
I am professor Mosby.

256
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:52,833
But you can call me Ted.

257
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:55,392
Professor Mosby.

258
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,002
T-Dawg.

259
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,420
Do not call me T-Dawg.

260
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:06,313
Never take questions
on the first day.

261
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:07,633
It shows weakness.

262
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:11,470
Also, don't look right here.

263
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,076
Okay, good luck. Byesies.

264
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:17,877
<i>This was it,</i>

265
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:19,213
<i>my crossroads moment.</i>

266
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:22,128
<i>What kind of professor
was I gonna be?</i>

267
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:23,553
<i>I had to decide.</i>

268
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,562
Please save all your questions
until the end of the lecture.

269
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:27,844
Thank you!

270
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,370
<i>Professor Mosby had arrived.</i>

271
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:33,815
<i>Of course,
if I had taken that girl's question...</i>

272
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
<i>Who, by the way, was not your mom...</i>

273
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,627
<i>Your mom was sitting...</i>

274
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,611
<i>Wait, let me finish
this story real quick.</i>

275
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,361
<i>Here's what that girl
would have said.</i>

276
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:43,989
I'm sorry to bother you,
professor Mosby,

277
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,415
but this isn't architecture 101.

278
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,571
This is economics 305.

279
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,412
You're in the wrong classroom.

280
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,155
<i>Yes, I was in the wrong classroom.</i>

281
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,441
<i>And thus began the most humiliating
seven minutes of my life.</i>

282
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,440
Here's your think-about-it
for the day.

283
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:00,815
Every single person in this room...

284
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:02,936
is already an architect.

285
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,384
Architect?

286
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,062
"We're just hanging out."

287
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,589
Just hanging out?

288
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,063
Not good enough.

289
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,398
Not good enough!

290
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:22,836
Can anyone here tell me

291
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:26,031
what this class is really all about?

292
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:27,469
Economics?

293
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,657
Don't laugh.
He's not...

294
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:33,482
He's not entirely wrong.

295
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:36,048
An architect must be economical

296
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:37,669
in his use of space,

297
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:39,283
so...

298
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:40,828
well done.

299
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:42,545
Looks like someone's

300
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:46,038
building towards an A, huh?

301
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,705
"We're seeing
where things are going."

302
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:54,017
I'll tell you
where things aren't going...

303
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:57,270
Out of that bedroom.
Not good enough.

304
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,605
Not good enough!

305
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,206
You...

306
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,418
Why do you want to be an architect?

307
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:06,780
I don't want to be an architect.

308
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:09,574
Yes. Yes, exactly.

309
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:11,815
It's not something you want to be.

310
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,620
It's something you need to be.

311
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,563
You don't have a choice, right?

312
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:17,650
None of you has a choice.

313
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:19,282
No questions!

314
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,850
"We're Barnman and Robin."

315
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,358
Come on, you got to admit,
that's kind of funny.

316
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,804
Not good enough.

317
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,272
Not good enough!

318
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:35,058
So if any of you

319
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,454
have even the slightest inclination

320
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:40,514
to do anything with your life
other than become an architect,

321
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,093
you're wasting my time and yours.

322
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,841
There's the door.

323
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:46,152
You can go.

324
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,413
I'm serious.
Get out. Now!

325
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,538
Wait!
Don't all leave!

326
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:58,331
Architecture's fun!

327
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,875
- I brought a hacky sack!
- Sorry I'm late, everyone.

328
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:02,813
My name is professor Calzonetti.

329
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,672
This is economics 305.
You may return to your seats.

330
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:07,943
Sorry.

331
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,302
This is architecture 101.

332
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:13,013
Who invited their dad, right?

333
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:15,575
Young man, for the last 28 years,

334
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,967
economics 305
has been taught right here,

335
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:20,184
in building 14, room 7.

336
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,236
Buddy, I'm sure
200 architecture students

337
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:26,492
and their professor
all got the room wrong.

338
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,737
T-Dawg,
you're in the wrong room, bro.

339
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:35,446
College kids, I'm on my way.

340
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:37,162
Sorry. Coming through.

341
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:43,693
Excuse me.

342
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:50,925
20 minutes late on your first day?

343
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:54,054
- That's rough.
- But here's the funny thing.

344
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,013
<i>I didn't have time</i>

345
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,558
<i>to think about what teacher
I was going to be. I just...</i>

346
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,603
<i>got up there
and talked about architecture.</i>

347
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:04,689
- And it was kind of great.
- That's awesome, Ted.

348
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,307
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

349
00:17:06,432 --> 00:17:07,687
Nice job, Ted.

350
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:09,312
Ted, door five!

351
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:12,280
- Were you there?
- I got you, buddy.

352
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:14,778
They still haven't had the talk.

353
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:17,234
I think I know
how to speed things up.

354
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,167
Not cool!

355
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:28,831
Pancakes, fresh bacon.

356
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:30,986
It is so yummy.

357
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:34,635
Dude, I'm starving. Let's...

358
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,596
Let's just have the stupid talk.

359
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,972
- Come on.
- Fine.

360
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,268
How do these things even work?
What do we say?

361
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,979
"Where do you see
this relationship going?"

362
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,778
Oh, my God, that sounds so cheesy.

363
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,186
I know, right?

364
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:54,311
Totally.

365
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:58,365
But where do you see
this relationship going?

366
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,287
I don't know.

367
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:04,001
It's not like I don't like you.

368
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,769
I just haven't had
a girlfriend for a long time.

369
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,098
- I hope that doesn't make you mad.
- Mad?

370
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,757
I feel the same way.
I suck at relationships.

371
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,649
I mean, except with Ted.

372
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,299
Man, he really got it right.

373
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,520
I know it's a cliché, but...

374
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,946
he really ruined me for other men.

375
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:24,372
<i>Of course, I wasn't in the room
for this conversation,</i>

376
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:27,017
<i>but I have to imagine Robin
said something like that.</i>

377
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,316
Maybe we should go back
to being just friends.

378
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:31,651
Maybe.

379
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:34,051
But...

380
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:37,490
- I don't want to stop having sex.
- Good. Me, neither.

381
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,406
- Friends isn't gonna work.
- Nope.

382
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:43,874
We're not good at being friends,
at being in a relationship.

383
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,249
What are we good at?

384
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,167
I know something.

385
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,547
If we'll do it again,
I'll need some Gatorade, or...

386
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:51,777
No, not that.

387
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:53,687
Lying, think about it.

388
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:55,751
We spent the whole summer lying.

389
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,988
Why not just keep lying?

390
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,874
Really?

391
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,937
Really. We sat down.

392
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:10,362
We had the talk.

393
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,173
- Barney's my boyfriend now.
- And Robin's my girlfriend.

394
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:15,933
I know it sounds nuts,
but it feels good to say.

395
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:18,339
We're both afraid
of commitment, but...

396
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:20,915
the fact is,
we also can't live without each other.

397
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,025
And if the alternative
is not being together,

398
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,038
then it's worth taking
this risk 'cause...

399
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:27,892
she's awesome.

400
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:29,751
And he's awesome.

401
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,097
- He looks nice in a suit.
- She can handle her scotch.

402
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:35,882
He's my boyfriend.

403
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:37,884
And she's my girlfriend.

404
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:47,856
Good enough!

405
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:52,376
She bought it.

406
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:53,813
Hook, line, and sinker.

407
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:55,001
We are good.

408
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:55,985
Totally.

409
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,987
You want to get some breakfast?

410
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:00,812
Brunch actually
does sound kind of good.

411
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,735
Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.

412
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,286
Flügelhorn.

413
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,915
Yeah, that felt wrong.

414
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:20,811
You realize they were lying, right?

415
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:21,936
No, Ted.

416
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,681
They don't realize
they weren't lying.

417
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,519
Hello. Good evening.

418
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:38,096
Hello. Don't get up.

419
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,712
Didn't we meet on a yacht?

420
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:44,816
What?

421
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,830
Did I not tell you guys
that it was Tuxedo night?

422
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,080
Doesn't feel very good, does it?
