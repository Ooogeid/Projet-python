1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:03,388
<i>Kids, back in 2009,
your Aunt Robin was the host</i>

2
00:00:03,513 --> 00:00:05,588
<i>of a morning show
for local New York cable.</i>

3
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:07,840
<i>And it was on early.
How early?</i>

4
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:10,760
Mike? Wake up.

5
00:00:12,977 --> 00:00:14,722
<i>But then, everything changed.</i>

6
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,412
- See my show?
- I meant to watch it.

7
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:21,312
I just got so busy with the whole
"being sound asleep" thing.

8
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,739
It took all night,
eight hours down the drain.

9
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:25,566
It's fine.
But get this:

10
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:27,485
After the broadcast...

11
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:30,029
Hi. Are you Robin?

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,814
I'm Don, your new co-host.

13
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,283
<i>Don was Don Frank,</i>

14
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:38,036
<i>seasoned veteran of no fewer
than 39 local morning news teams</i>

15
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:39,630
<i>from all over the country.</i>

16
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:41,832
<i>The guy was an industry legend.</i>

17
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,963
You are so going to hit that.

18
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,300
No, I just think we're going
to be great together on the air.

19
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,011
And on the sofa and on the bed
and on the coffee table.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,492
All right, I'm gonna
go up on the roof

21
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,432
and stand there for 5 minutes.

22
00:00:58,557 --> 00:00:59,322
Have fun.

23
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:01,268
<i>And that's exactly what she did.</i>

24
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,217
<i>She just stood there.</i>

25
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,485
<i>All right, I'm gonna level with you.</i>

26
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,776
<i>That's not what she did.
Here's what she did.</i>

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,154
All right, all right...
I'm going to go have a cigarette.

28
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,120
What?!

29
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,659
<i>I promised her I'd never tell you this,
but once upon a time, your Aunt Robin</i>

30
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,127
<i>did enjoy the occasional cigarette,</i>

31
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,831
<i>and occasionally
that occasional cigarette...</i>

32
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:24,317
<i>was more than just occasional.</i>

33
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,755
I left something
like this in my apartment.

34
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,864
Robin, come on, take it to the roof.
We said no smoking in the apartment

35
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:36,137
after you torched
the throw rug doing push-ups.

36
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,205
All right, all right.
Geez.

37
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:41,177
Yeah, Robin, I mean, God,

38
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,936
not only is that a
filthy habit, but also,

39
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,679
- can I bum one?
- Sure.

40
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:46,688
What?!

41
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,593
Synchro: ShalimarFox

42
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,035
.:: La Fabrique ::.

43
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,130
<i>Kids, your Uncle Marshall definitely
doesn't want you to know this,</i>

44
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:04,749
<i>but he also smoked off and on.</i>

45
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:08,627
<i>It all started when he was 13,
on a camping trip in Minnesota.</i>

46
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:11,380
Come on, Marshall, let's celebrate.
It's summer vacation.

47
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,277
But just one.

48
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:17,636
This is my first
and last cigarette ever.

49
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:21,903
<i>And that was the first of many,
many "last cigarettes ever."</i>

50
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:22,934
That's it.

51
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,048
I am done, I am out.

52
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:26,729
Last...
cigarette...

53
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,056
... ev-arrh!

54
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,003
<i>So, by that point,
I'd heard it all before.</i>

55
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:32,693
Last cigarette ever.

56
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,237
What are you doing?
You haven't smoked in six months.

57
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:38,365
Is this about the McRib?
It's gone, dude, let it go.

58
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,327
I'm worried about work, okay?

59
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,826
They just hired a new head
of the legal department,

60
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,821
and he's going
to be letting people go.

61
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:46,444
So that's why you're worried?

62
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:49,794
The new head of the legal
department is Arthur Hobbes.

63
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:51,670
As in "Artillery Arthur"?

64
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:53,506
As in your former boss?

65
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:56,049
<i>Arthur Hobbes was the meanest boss</i>

66
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:58,574
<i>Marshall or anyone else
had ever had.</i>

67
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,617
<i>The last time Marshall
worked for him, it ended like this.</i>

68
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,108
I quit!

69
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:05,976
So does he hold it against you?

70
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:07,478
Worse.

71
00:03:07,894 --> 00:03:09,146
I'm sorry, who are you?

72
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,899
I'm Marshall Eriksen.

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,403
We had a fairly intense
screaming match.

74
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,433
Wherein I suggested
that you take your head

75
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:23,202
and store it within yourself

76
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:26,060
in a fashion that,
while, while space-saving,

77
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,415
might limit its exposure
to, to sunshine.

78
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:31,519
Well, that describes
95% of my employees

79
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,463
and everyone in my family...
except for my dog.

80
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,288
He's such a good boy.

81
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:41,089
I'll see you later...

82
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,639
Randall Wilkerson.

83
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,767
Gary Dinkersfield, right.

84
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,721
- Great, he doesn't remember you.
- Not great.

85
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:53,476
Arthur Hobbes hating him,
that's no big deal. He hates everyone.

86
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,818
It's the people he doesn't know
that he cuts loose.

87
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,792
He just fired What's-His-Face.

88
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:02,783
He fired What's-His-Face, Ted,
and What's-His-Face was invaluable.

89
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,661
I understand you getting upset, but
it's not worth killing yourself over.

90
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:09,039
Yeah, wait till you get
laid off, then kill yourself.

91
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:10,619
Like What's-His-Face.

92
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:13,725
Although I guess now
it's more like Where's-His-Face.

93
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:16,971
Look, it was just two cigarettes.

94
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:18,746
Okay, I can handle two.

95
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:21,473
As long as I don't have three
within 24 hours,

96
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,326
then I'm not going
to get hooked again.

97
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,754
What's Lily going to say
when she finds out you smoked?

98
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,681
She's not going to find out.

99
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:29,016
I have a system.

100
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,895
<i>Yes, Marshall's system.</i>

101
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,118
- Hello.
- You smoked.

102
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,286
Damn it!

103
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,101
<i>The next morning,
your Aunt Robin was thrilled</i>

104
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:52,726
<i>to be finally going on the air
with a real pro.</i>

105
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:55,597
In three, two, one...

106
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:58,701
- Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
- And I...

107
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:00,042
am Don Frank.

108
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,509
Two teens were arrested late
last night for stealing a police cart.

109
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,987
No, I'm sorry,
not a police cart, a policecar.

110
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:07,609
Screw it.

111
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:08,777
Brain fart.

112
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:10,601
Don't you hate those?

113
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:13,685
Look at that, the teleprompter's
still running.

114
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:17,227
Something about a woman
giving birth on an uptown bus.

115
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:19,192
Well, no point
in jumping in halfway.

116
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,317
I'll just wait till it's done.

117
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:25,967
And she cut the cord
with a Metropass.

118
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:27,632
We'll be right back.

119
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:28,953
And we're clear.

120
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,372
What the hell was that?
Don, you said "brain fart."

121
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,918
Robin, you seem like a nice kid,
but this is my 39th local news show.

122
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:37,628
I've learned 3 things:

123
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,089
avoid the all-you-can-eat
sushi buffet in Bismarck,

124
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,967
do not go to the bathroom
with your lapel mic still on,

125
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,345
and three, at this hour,
your entire viewing audience is

126
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,139
one half-drunk slob sitting
in his underwear, so...

127
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:51,720
Back in five, four...

128
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:55,053
Well, let's do a great show
for that half-drunk slob.

129
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:57,368
Well, that half-drunk slob
appreciates it.

130
00:05:58,027 --> 00:06:00,661
<i>The next day, Marshall found
himself craving a cigarette.</i>

131
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:04,058
<i>It was driving him crazy, so he
decided to get some fresh air.</i>

132
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,410
You're not up here to jump?

133
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:14,318
I fired a lot of people today.
I don't need another jumper in my file.

134
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,667
Cigarette?

135
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,005
No, no, thank you.

136
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,423
That's too bad.

137
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:24,717
You know what I miss, Jeffrey?

138
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,261
Getting to know
somebody over a smoke.

139
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:30,039
People are so interchangeable now,

140
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,851
but you share a butt with
somebody, you got a real bond.

141
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,314
You know what?
I will, I will take one.

142
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:44,069
I'm Marshall, by the way, it's Marshall,
Marshall Eriksen.

143
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:46,822
Tell me something, Marshall Eriksen.

144
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,866
How would you like to see

145
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,244
a picture of the cutest dog
in the world?

146
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:54,853
There he is. He's a good boy.

147
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,491
You smoked.

148
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,632
Yes, I smoked,
and it was my third of the day.

149
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,336
You know what that means?
I'm a smoker now. It's all over.

150
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,529
I even bought a pack on the way home
and a lighter and a Vikings lamp

151
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:14,433
which has nothing to do with anything,
I saw it in the window and I liked it.

152
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,036
Damn it, Marshall.

153
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,771
We already have four
Viking lamps and smoking kills.

154
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:23,525
It was a way to bond with my boss, OK?
You should have seen me up there.

155
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,628
That is a cute dog.
Are those your kids?

156
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:27,863
Yeah, whatever.

157
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:30,518
Look what I got at the mall.

158
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,503
There he is.
There he is.

159
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,506
Go ahead, you can pet him now.

160
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,168
Yeah, yeah, come on, he likes it.

161
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:44,702
Scratch him under the chin.

162
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,592
I don't care what your reasons are.

163
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,594
You know how I feel about smoking.

164
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:52,599
Now, give me the cigarettes.

165
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:57,810
And the lighter.

166
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,558
That's the stuff.

167
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:11,783
What?!

168
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,742
<i>Add your Aunt Lily to the list.</i>

169
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,217
<i>Whenever Uncle Marshall fell
off the wagon,</i>

170
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:18,665
<i>your Aunt Lily got dragged
right down with him.</i>

171
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,444
What you doing?

172
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:22,961
If you must know, I am reaching out

173
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,295
to City Hall to try to get
the mayor on our show.

174
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,606
Oh, my goodness, you are adorable,

175
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,914
but the mayor's not coming
on a show nobody watches.

176
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,262
My colonoscopy had
more viewers than this show.

177
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,556
At least that had
some twists and turns.

178
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,183
I don't know
why you're acting like this.

179
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,096
Maybe you're just bitter because
you never had a shot at a network job,

180
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,397
but I think I still do,
so I really need to focus.

181
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,218
I've been on a network.

182
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,402
You were on a network?

183
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:51,443
It was the best Labor Day
weekend of my life.

184
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,787
When you do the news,
you're in these ergonomic chairs.

185
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,618
It feels like you're sitting
on a cloud.

186
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,663
Which was nice 'cause it was
right after my colonoscopy.

187
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:03,162
- And the dressing rooms?
- There's dressing rooms?

188
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,752
You bet your sweet headset
there's dressing rooms, Mike.

189
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:08,930
No changing in the KFC
bathroom across the street.

190
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:09,923
No, sir.

191
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,294
It was heaven.

192
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,827
But the second you get used to it,
they go find someone

193
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:19,500
who isn't "going through a bitter
divorce" and doesn't "reek of gin,"

194
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,603
and before you know it,
you're stuck in a dead-end gig,

195
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,417
surrounded by people going nowhere,
doing the news in your tighty whities.

196
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,777
Okay, the underwear thing
was your choice,

197
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:33,472
and I don't like
that it's catching on.

198
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:35,329
Looking good, fellas.

199
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:36,742
Feels good, right?

200
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,578
God, I want to kill him.
Of course people watch the show.

201
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,268
You guys watch the show,
that's, like, two right there.

202
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,586
Oh, my God.
You guys still haven't seen my show.

203
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,422
- What? We never miss it.
- We've seen it!

204
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:52,591
Really? What color is the set?

205
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:56,871
It's... black.

206
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,973
- Right. Yeah.
- With, like, silver around the edges.

207
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,975
Not your TV set, my show set.

208
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,813
If even my best friends don't watch,
who's going to watch?

209
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:08,334
Lots of people.

210
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,609
You got bedridden insomniacs.

211
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:13,654
Bums camping
outside a department store.

212
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:16,481
People waiting in the ER,

213
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:19,660
where the TV is in a cage,
so you can't change the channel.

214
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,287
Do you have any stalkers?

215
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:25,165
Even Leonard won't watch my show.

216
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:29,586
Can't believe they are smoking.
It's freezing out.

217
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:32,005
Remember when you used to be able
to smoke in bars?

218
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,884
I think that hot girl over there
is smiling at me.

219
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:39,554
That's a chair.
But yeah, hit that.

220
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:43,773
Marco!

221
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,142
Polo!

222
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:49,207
Well, it's dividing our group
into smokers and non-smokers.

223
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,354
- And that's not healthy.
- You're right.

224
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:54,454
Let's smoke.

225
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:55,897
What?!

226
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:57,447
<i>I'm not proud of it.</i>

227
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,200
Look at you two.
Smokers.

228
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:01,785
Just like the rest of us.

229
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,499
I am not a smoker.

230
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,359
I only smoke in certain situations.

231
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:14,673
Postcoital, when I'm with Germans...
Sometimes those two overlap...

232
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:18,102
Coital, birthdays,

233
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:19,410
to annoy my mom,

234
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:20,886
precoital,

235
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,658
on a sailboat,

236
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:25,381
the day the Mets are mathematically
eliminated every year,

237
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,897
and, of course...
wait for it, 'cause Lord knows I have...

238
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,314
pregnancy scares.

239
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,357
Why are you smoking?

240
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:34,708
I'm always precoital, Ted.

241
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,878
You know,
maybe smoking's not so bad.

242
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:40,449
At least it gets us
out in the fresh air.

243
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:42,899
And all the coughing
really works my abs.

244
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:44,761
I... am...

245
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,329
ripped!

246
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,550
But, as glamorous as it was,

247
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,708
within a week,
we all hit our breaking point.

248
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:54,921
You okay, sweetie?

249
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:58,133
Actually, my throat's a bit sore.

250
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,954
So, I'm whapping him across the nose
with the newspaper, right? Yeah.

251
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,031
My wife says,

252
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,283
"You can't treat your son
like that."

253
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:24,993
I don't know.

254
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,247
Michael, call 911.

255
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:32,670
Right away.

256
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:34,669
Marshall, by the way.

257
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:44,221
I hope Arthur's okay.

258
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,847
Dibs on his office if he's not.

259
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:47,682
We have to quit smoking.

260
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,700
Honey, you said a mouthful.

261
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,436
I wish I never started.

262
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,746
I mean, I think back to myself
at 13 years old.

263
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:57,317
If I could only go
back to that moment...

264
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:06,243
I hate that little bastard.

265
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:07,709
Me, too.

266
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,546
Okay, that's it.

267
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:11,123
Let's quit.

268
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:12,707
Let's do it.

269
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,782
I am proud of you.

270
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:19,235
I have heard how difficult it is
for smokers like yourself to quit, so,

271
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:23,541
so, on behalf of nonsmokers,
I salute you, and I am here to help.

272
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,972
So, hand in your cigarettes.
I will get rid of them one at a time.

273
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,723
You're quitting, dollface.

274
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:33,502
I don't normally call you dollface,
but it kind of works in this voice.

275
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:34,771
Dollface.

276
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:38,066
I was just wondering,

277
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:41,732
is anyone else interviewing the Mayor
tomorrow on TV,

278
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:43,196
or is it just me?

279
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:48,869
Don can suck it while I suck this.
Light me, Marshall.

280
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:52,664
Actually, we've decided
that we're all quitting smoking.

281
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,207
That's fantastic.

282
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,418
I'm sick of you
bumming my cigarettes.

283
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,212
No, come on, Robin.
We can't do it unless we do it together.

284
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:02,792
You can sleep with Marshall.

285
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:05,969
Sorry, baby,
you got to take one for the team.

286
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,305
I don't want to sleep with Marshall.

287
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,055
I've seen the looks.

288
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:13,957
I can't quit right now.
Not before the interview of my life.

289
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,438
- It's too stressful.
- It's too stressful!

290
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,231
- Just one more.
- A cigarette!

291
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:22,845
Think about this for a second.
Bloomberg is the antismoking mayor.

292
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:25,197
You wanna show up to that interview
smelling like smoke?

293
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:28,617
It'd be like interviewing a vegetarian
smelling like a McRib.

294
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,952
Really? I'm not going through enough
right now?

295
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,554
You're quitting.
We're all quitting.

296
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:38,418
Fine. I'll quit.

297
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,570
Great.

298
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:43,173
We've to get through the first 24 hours.
After that, it's a cakewalk.

299
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:47,260
You have to bite your nails so loud?

300
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:48,831
I'm not biting my nails.

301
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,498
I'm trying to suck the leftover nicotine
out of my fingertips.

302
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:55,018
- Can you pass the onion rings?
- You got dinosaur arms? They're there.

303
00:14:55,932 --> 00:14:59,189
What cigarettes are doing right now?
Think about us?

304
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:03,443
If you don't stop tapping your foot,
it's coming off.

305
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,519
Ted, I'm so sorry.

306
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,907
Maybe I should move it
a little bit closer to your ass!

307
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,600
<i>None of us knew
what we were fighting about.</i>

308
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:15,480
<i>We just knew we wanted to smoke.</i>

309
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:17,647
<i>More than anything in the world.</i>

310
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:26,341
It wasn't going very well
for Robin, either.

311
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:27,631
Sorry I'm late.

312
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:29,803
One used the microwave,
and the elevator stopped.

313
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:33,489
What are you doing?

314
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:35,666
Don, seriously, not tonight.

315
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,795
I'm on edge cause I quit smoking
for my interview, so just...

316
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:43,608
You precious little
porcelain unicorn, you.

317
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,023
- Why would you do that?
- Why?!

318
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,948
Because I care, Don.

319
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:53,396
I care about the show,
I care about my career.

320
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:55,453
Unlike you, you unprofessional jerk!

321
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:58,225
You're sloppy, you're rude.

322
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,583
I wish you worked half as hard
as the elastic on those underpants.

323
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:05,797
This is getting personal.

324
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:09,622
It would be personal if I would say
that the reason you bounce

325
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,178
from market to market
is because you're a loser...

326
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:15,171
a lazy, obnoxious, loser.

327
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,186
The Mayor canceled.

328
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,520
You think I'm a loser?

329
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,271
You're right. I'm a loser.

330
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:34,909
But at least I've accepted it.

331
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:39,039
A raccoon has been cheering up patients
at a local senior center.

332
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,834
I used to be just like that.

333
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,146
Always wanting more
and never getting it.

334
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:44,794
It's a dead end, Robin.

335
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,119
You're never gonna be
a network anchor.

336
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,544
Just like you're never gonna
quit smoking.

337
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:52,356
What are you doing?

338
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,684
I'm enjoying a cigarette.

339
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:56,922
That'll get you there.

340
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,590
That's good.

341
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:02,270
- You want a drag?
- Can we be professionals?

342
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,836
- Please?
- Professionals?

343
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:07,567
You know who's working the camera?
A chair.

344
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:11,029
We're on a show
where even the cameraman doesn't watch.

345
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,572
That's why the Mayor canceled.

346
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,170
And that's why Mike
is on a fried chicken run.

347
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:18,203
And that's why you and I can enjoy
a cigarette right here on the air.

348
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,834
Why?

349
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,669
Because of our millions and millions
of impressionable viewers?

350
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:30,708
If any viewers have a problem with this,
please give us a call.

351
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,683
The number's on the screen.

352
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:39,522
Come on, Robin...

353
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:40,558
Live a little.

354
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:55,669
That must be Mike.
He always forgets extra crispy.

355
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,617
Don't smoke!

356
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,788
We're all watching
and we're all very impressionable.

357
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,333
And I swear to God, if you smoke,
we're all going to smoke.

358
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,833
You guys are watching?

359
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,808
We sure are, sweetheart,
and you look fabulous.

360
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,128
You don't have to smoke.

361
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:18,982
Resist it, honey.

362
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:21,933
Thanks for the call, guys.

363
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,522
- She did it!
- Good for her.

364
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,292
We're not gonna smoke.

365
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,820
I've a pack stashed up on the roof.

366
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:42,653
I'm awake.
And I'm smoking!

367
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:46,083
You know how dangerous it is
to wake a sleep smoker?

368
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,416
It's fine.

369
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,420
I bought a pack on my way home.

370
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:52,922
Great show.

371
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:55,592
Yeah, but that Don guy, what a tool.

372
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,219
He actually apologized to me.

373
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:01,937
No, I mean when he stood up.
Those briefs were pretty revealing.

374
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:05,435
- You should date that guy.
- Not in this lifetime.

375
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:08,730
<i>They were dating within two months.
But more on that later.</i>

376
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:11,357
Look, the sun's coming up.

377
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,071
You know what right now
is a perfect time for?

378
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,368
A last cigarette ever.

379
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,940
A real last cigarette ever.

380
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,290
Damn it, let's do it.

381
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,836
All right.

382
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:35,581
Last cigarette ever
on the count of three.

383
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:42,081
<i>We all quit for a while after that.</i>

384
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,337
<i>But it wasn't
anyone's last cigarette.</i>

385
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:46,928
<i>But we did eventually
all quit smoking for real.</i>

386
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:50,223
<i>Robin's last cigarette
was in June 2013.</i>

387
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:54,243
<i>Barney's last cigarette
was in March 2017.</i>

388
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,897
<i>Lily's last cigarette was the day
she started trying to get pregnant.</i>

389
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:02,884
<i>And Marshall's last cigarette
was the day his son was born.</i>

390
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,620
<i>And my last cigarette?</i>

391
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:07,372
<i>Two weeks into dating your mother.</i>

392
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:10,030
<i>And I never looked back.</i>

393
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:22,929
I'm sorry I hit you.

394
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:26,182
I wanted to make it up to you,
by giving you this.

395
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:29,644
She's hot!

396
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,816
- Some day, you're going to marry her.
- No way.

397
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:37,026
We're pretty lucky.

398
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:38,784
Totally.

399
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,083
I'll be in my tent.

400
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,033
Don't do that.

401
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:54,002
Have fun for me.
