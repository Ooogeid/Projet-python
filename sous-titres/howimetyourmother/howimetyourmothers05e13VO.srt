1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:02,721
<i>Kids, when you're on your 30s
and living in New York,</i>

2
00:00:02,846 --> 00:00:04,795
<i>there's a few places
you never want to be:</i>

3
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:06,797
<i>Times Square on New Year's Eve,</i>

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,091
<i>Rockefeller Center
around Christmas time...</i>

5
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:10,901
<i>But most of all...</i>

6
00:00:11,026 --> 00:00:14,535
A college bar? Man. We're probably
going to run into my students.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,849
They're going to corner me
and want a free lecture.

8
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:19,727
I don't even have
my slide projector. Damn it.

9
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,654
Ted, I've been Skee-Ball
champ here since law school.

10
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,596
I have to pop in at least
once a month to maintain my record.

11
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:27,943
Looks like you've been gone a while.

12
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,780
Some guy named Big Fudge
has been cleaning up.

13
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:31,796
He has.

14
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,617
- And you're Big Fudge.
- The biggest.

15
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:38,775
So by the way,
I have to tell you something.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,338
I... invited Jenkins.

17
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:42,875
Jenkins? No way!

18
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:45,836
<i>We'd all started hearing
about Jenkins a few weeks earlier.</i>

19
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:49,465
You guys will not believe
what Jenkins did this time.

20
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,375
- Who's Jenkins?
- He's this hilarious new lawyer

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,050
at Marshall's office.

22
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:55,221
Hilarious.

23
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,642
Okay, so there's this jar of Maraschino
cherries in the fridge at work.

24
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,644
So, Jenkins says,

25
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:04,974
"200 bucks, I'll eat the whole jar."

26
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,983
So, we give Jenkins 200 bucks...

27
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:12,577
... and Jenkins ate the whole jar!

28
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:20,766
<i>And after that,
the stories kept coming.</i>

29
00:01:20,891 --> 00:01:23,582
So, the CFO comes in
to sign some acquisition papers.

30
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:25,251
So, Jenkins goes,

31
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:27,485
"Excuse me, Mr. Wilcox.

32
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,880
I think we forgot
one of the documents."

33
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:40,724
So, we all go out for
beers after work.

34
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,066
Jenkins gets up on the bar
and starts gyrating

35
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,435
like some sort of deranged stripper.

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,858
Next thing you know,
off comes the shirt!

37
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,326
It was so gross.

38
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:55,264
Right?

39
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:58,408
Well, it'll be great to finally
meet the famous Jenkins

40
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,202
after all those stories.

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,438
And there's about to be
one more story.

42
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,081
I'm going to bang Jenkins.

43
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:05,874
- What?
- You heard me.

44
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:08,669
You want to have sex with Jenkins?

45
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:11,450
With Jenkins, on Jenkins,
near Jenkins.

46
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:14,633
You name it.
I want to wear Jenkins like a sock.

47
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:17,392
But you're...

48
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:18,975
Haven't you... I'm...

49
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:20,730
- Really?
- Hi, guys.

50
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:22,622
Ted, this is Jenkins.

51
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,589
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

52
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,865
.:: La Fabrique ::.

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,409
This is going to sound crazy,

54
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,078
But, um... I thought Jenkins was a guy.
What gave you that idea?

55
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,869
What? That's crazy!

56
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,293
I don't know. Maybe the whole "Jenkins
peed out the window of a cab" story.

57
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,449
Yeah. Much more impressive now,
isn't it?

58
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:53,046
OK, I'll come clean!

59
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,674
It all started a few weeks ago.

60
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:59,379
By the way, Four Eyes, new lawyer.
This is Jenkins.

61
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,388
Watch out for this guy.
He steals stuff.

62
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:02,973
I don't steal stuff.

63
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:06,113
And I don't wear glasses.

64
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,438
- I'm Marshall.
- Hi.

65
00:03:10,118 --> 00:03:13,400
So, are you really a Vikings fan
or was he lying about that, too?

66
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:14,713
Why?

67
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:16,553
Is this a trap?
Are you a Packers fan?

68
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:18,949
My wife knows I'm here.
She doesn't have money,

69
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,825
but what she does have
is a very special set of skills.

70
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,764
I'm a Vikings fan, too!
I bleed purple and gold.

71
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:27,080
- I'm from Pelican Rapids.
- Pelican Rapids?

72
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,707
No way.

73
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,706
My grandpa lives in Pelican Rapids.

74
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:33,795
Well, I mean, he's dead now,
but he haunts a barn off Route 108.

75
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,381
Hold it. Dude,

76
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,269
if you tell me you have a thing
for a woman that is not your wife,

77
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,219
I'll drag you outside
and kick your ass.

78
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,316
Okay, first of all...

79
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:46,099
Come on, buddy.
You can't handle the Fudge.

80
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:48,131
Second of all, no.

81
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:50,680
I think of her like a...
a big brother.

82
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,439
Who, I guess, has boobs.

83
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,858
But so does my oldest brother,
Marvin Jr., anyway,

84
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:58,320
that night,
I told Lily about Jenkins.

85
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,697
I can't wait to meet him.

86
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,711
I should have corrected her.

87
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:04,534
It would have been so easy.

88
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,656
But I didn't, so,

89
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,109
after that, whenever I talked
about Jenkins,

90
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:11,208
I always avoided pronouns.

91
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:15,042
So, the head of marketing comes in
to choose people for the Midwest audit.

92
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:16,293
So, he goes,

93
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,565
"Him, him, her, him, him...

94
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:22,219
Jenkins, him, her."

95
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,429
I don't understand
why you wouldn't just tell her.

96
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,903
Do you really think
she'd be all that jealous?

97
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:28,892
Think about those stories
I told you.

98
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,416
I could see how that'd be a problem.

99
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,870
Exactly.
That's why Lily can't find out.

100
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,539
Lily can't find out what?

101
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,874
That Marshall's going
to buy her a horse.

102
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:54,267
You are?

103
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:57,186
That is so awesome!
I love those things.

104
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,551
Guys, why... why is that kid
over there staring at me?

105
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,052
I think I know what this is.

106
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:08,555
I think it has finally happened.

107
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:11,142
I'm getting recognized from my show.

108
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:14,396
Robin, that is so cute.

109
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:18,066
But that's Scotty. He's one
of my students, and he's looking at me.

110
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,837
How weird is it that
I'm more famous than you?

111
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:23,572
Not at all, 'cause you're not.
I'm on TV.

112
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:27,242
Yeah, and I've 30 students in my class.
That's what, 30 times your viewership?

113
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:31,365
Now, this will give him a little thrill,
buying a drink for the old prof.

114
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,093
All right, Scotter,
one question about

115
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,210
neoclassical architecture,
and that is it.

116
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,279
- You're Robin Scherbatsky, right?
- What?

117
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:40,639
Yes, I am.

118
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:44,432
I didn't mean to stare.
It's just,

119
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:46,594
I watch your show all the time.

120
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,239
Really?

121
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:49,180
Really?

122
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,348
Totally.

123
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:55,014
- What are you doing out with Ted?
- It's Professor Mosby.

124
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,783
We're friends.

125
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:57,908
Holy crap!

126
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:01,109
Robin Scherbatsky is friends
with my econ professor.

127
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,064
It's architecture!
OK, you know what?

128
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,310
You're crowding us.
Hit the bricks.

129
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,618
- Wait a minute. You're Big Fudge.
- Go!

130
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,705
Baby, I'm on my way up.

131
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:15,540
What? Why?

132
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,880
There was a measles outbreak
at school, and they called a half day.

133
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,103
Thought I'd come by here,
have lunch,

134
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:22,714
maybe give you the measles.

135
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:28,136
I have a problem.
That was my wife.

136
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,639
When I first mentioned you,
she mistakenly thought you were a guy...

137
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,960
Now you're worried that
when she finds out I'm a woman,

138
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,936
- she's going to totally flip out.
- Yes. Exactly.

139
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:40,724
Geez. Oh, gosh. I was in an improv group
in Pelican Rapids.

140
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:42,317
Follow my lead.

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,324
I'm Lily, Marshall's wife.

142
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,605
Hi, Lily.
I am from the French embassy.

143
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,359
I am here because of a small
but significant

144
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:56,998
- cheese incident that occurred...
- She's Jenkins!

145
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:03,588
You're Jenkins?

146
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:08,126
Yeah, well, that, Camembert cris
isn't going to resolve itself,

147
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,274
so I'll catch you guys
on the flip-flop.

148
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,181
<i>Marshall cringed.
This was the moment he had feared.</i>

149
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:16,011
The famous Jenkins!
How about that?

150
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:19,062
Funny, I was picturing a guy.
Anywho, lunch?

151
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:23,358
Wait. Wait.
So... so, you're not jealous at all?

152
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:25,659
Sweetie.

153
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:28,196
I never have to worry
about you with another woman.

154
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:31,157
Right, because we're so
hopelessly in love, right?

155
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,560
Yeah, sure.

156
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,152
Anywho, lunch?

157
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,996
She wasn't jealous.

158
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:38,873
Of course, she wasn't.

159
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,917
That's the whole dynamic
of your relationship.

160
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:44,063
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's like this, my man.

161
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:47,346
Every good relationship
has a reacher and a settler.

162
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:50,739
Exactly. One person reaches
for someone out of their league;

163
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:53,388
the other one settles for
someone below theirs.

164
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:56,190
I did not settle for Lily.

165
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:57,934
Okay, yes, she's a little short,

166
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,771
and, true, my mom says she doesn't have
the hips to birth an Eriksen child,

167
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:02,865
But, um...

168
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:05,817
You guys think I'm the reacher.

169
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,456
That's why Lily's not jealous.

170
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:10,367
The settler is never jealous
of the reacher because,

171
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:12,198
where is the reacher going to go?

172
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:14,532
The settler, Lily, is the best thing

173
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:16,767
that the reacher, Marshall,
is ever going to get.

174
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:19,378
No... okay.
Yes, I am lucky to have Lily,

175
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:21,493
but Lily is just as lucky...

176
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,126
to have me.

177
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,664
Okay. Neither one of us
is the reacher.

178
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,567
Dude, you are so the reacher.
You're getting her a horse!

179
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:32,683
What?

180
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:33,936
Take the hit.

181
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,441
Take the hit.

182
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,142
Thus ending modern architecture's

183
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:42,773
very brief experiment
with the V-frame house.

184
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,808
Excuse me a second.

185
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:50,669
- What are you doing here?
- I noticed you forgot

186
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:53,195
something this morning,
so I thought I'd bring it by.

187
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,248
- Your pen.
- This is your pen.

188
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:57,660
And you chewed on the end of it.
Recently.

189
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,538
Not a problem, Ted.
Your class was on my way to work.

190
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,379
- No, it's not.
- At "Come On, Get Up New York!",

191
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:07,431
- where I'm an anchor, so...
- I watch your show all the time.

192
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:09,321
What?!

193
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,674
You watch the show?

194
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,306
Well, paint me flattered.
Any other fans out there?

195
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,722
We got...

196
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,222
- All right. Thanks for coming by.
- Tune in tonight.

197
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,058
I am doing a great piece
on snail poison.

198
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,146
Also, who's got the worst pizza
in New York?

199
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,357
I'll give you the answer after traffic
on the ones, threes, fives and nines.

200
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:31,783
Really?

201
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:33,356
You guys watch her show?

202
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,324
It's like watching a well-lit aquarium,
but not as interesting.

203
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:38,576
And now that I think about it,
not as well lit.

204
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:40,899
The truth is, we...

205
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:42,538
watch it for the drinking game.

206
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:43,748
The who now?

207
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:46,226
Her morning show comes on so early,

208
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,028
we're usually still at the bar,

209
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:49,988
so whenever she does an interview,

210
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:52,715
you have to drink every
time she says, "But, um..."

211
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,176
"But, um..."?

212
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,344
"But, um..."

213
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,429
Apparently, she says it a lot.

214
00:09:58,955 --> 00:09:59,815
It's funny.

215
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,869
I had a drinking game
based on Robin,

216
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:05,311
but it was actually on Robin. I'd pour
peach schnapps in her belly button...

217
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,934
- We agreed we wouldn't do this.
- Sorry. You're right.

218
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:09,540
She didn't like it anyway.

219
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:10,858
Said it woke her up.

220
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,904
Does she say "But, um..." that much?

221
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,310
<i>That night, we found out just
how much she said it.</i>

222
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,999
That's great.

223
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:23,370
This wasn't your first Spelling bee,
was it?

224
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:24,580
Third.

225
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:26,514
Good for you.

226
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:48,729
Interesting article in the paper.

227
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:52,233
Says that in every relationship,
there's a reacher and a settler.

228
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,631
Really?
Let me see it.

229
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:57,613
I's not in this newspaper.
It's in one I read a while back.

230
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:00,397
This newspaper reminded me
of the other newspaper.

231
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:01,620
Anywho...

232
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:04,370
What do you think about that?

233
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,122
Well,
I guess sometimes that's the case.

234
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,999
But not in ours.

235
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,960
What?
Of course not.

236
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,310
Right.

237
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:17,477
Say, gun to your head...

238
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,944
You had to say
one of us was the reacher.

239
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,559
Well, I'd say it's neither.

240
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,307
That's what makes us great.

241
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,305
Now, there's a gun to my head

242
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,386
and our future children,
and our future cat or monkey,

243
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:35,234
depending on who wins the game
we've been playing for three years.

244
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,487
No reacher, no settler.

245
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,061
How about this?

246
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:44,936
<i>This went on for a while.</i>

247
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,421
<i>Until finally...</i>

248
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,849
Our two kids, our eight grandkids,

249
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:53,270
our 11 great-grandkids,

250
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:56,687
are all on a plane piloted by Oprah.

251
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,992
And it's about to crash
into an art museum

252
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:02,637
With all of your favorite paintings,
and the only way...

253
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:06,419
the only way to save everything
is just to answer the question:

254
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:09,237
Are you the reacher or the settler?

255
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:12,062
And Oprah's tried everything?

256
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,295
Everything!

257
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,130
You have to decide now.

258
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:19,836
Well, I guess, if I had to say,

259
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,157
then maybe I'd say I'm the settler.

260
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,025
How could you say that?!

261
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:27,286
She thinks that she's the settler.

262
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:32,499
I mean, that's it. I gotta prove to her
that I am not the reacher.

263
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:34,251
I gotta make her jealous.

264
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:37,546
That's easy. Here's the plan.
Step one, sleep with Jenkins.

265
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:39,882
Step two,
I sleep with Jenkins first.

266
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:42,170
Step three, we do step two first.

267
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,645
I'm gonna go
get started on step two.

268
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,347
I got something.

269
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:51,226
Remember the other night, the game?
When you were putting in the 50 hole?

270
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,146
Whatever.
Just another night for big fudge.

271
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,170
You thought she was into me?

272
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:20,858
Full-on lady wood.

273
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:24,416
Of course.

274
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:26,720
A plan taketh shape.

275
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:29,823
If lady Lily's jealousy

276
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:32,709
young Marshall cannot budge,

277
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:36,981
then perchance,
fair gentles, big fudge...

278
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:38,868
Can...

279
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:41,334
make her jealous.
Let me try that again.

280
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,486
If lady Lily's...

281
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:43,653
I got it.

282
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,786
I have got a great idea.

283
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,814
Is it clean your hair
out of the shower drain?

284
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:54,956
It's like
you're trying to carpet the tub.

285
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:58,712
If you wanted to print out
one of your lectures or something,

286
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,487
I could read it on air.

287
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,065
Coming from a more...

288
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,902
entertaining source.

289
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:06,687
Your students might actually
pay attention and learn something.

290
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:08,691
You're entertaining?

291
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,787
Last night,
there was three minutes of dead air

292
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,808
while you sewed a button
back on your sweater.

293
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:16,132
Look, just because your class
likes me more than you...

294
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:18,647
- You're a drinking game!
- What?

295
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:21,079
That's why they watch.
They made a drinking game out of you.

296
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:23,928
Every time you say "But, um...",
They do a shot.

297
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,750
I don't say "But, um...".
I've never said, "But, um..."

298
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,876
I guess
it's not a very good drinking game.

299
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,040
Which would mean last night,
when I played it,

300
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,383
I didn't get super wasted
and throw up all over myself.

301
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,381
Wait, I did both of those things.

302
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,498
So, face.

303
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:52,556
Lily and I are gonna go back
to that college bar again.

304
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:55,203
And we were wondering
if maybe you wanted to come.

305
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,514
You could just watch me
play skee-ball,

306
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,600
or do exactly
what you did the other night.

307
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:01,648
Something like that.
It's really up to you.

308
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,416
I mean, I know that...

95
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,334
Baby, what are you doing home?

96
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:23,715
"Baby".

97
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,626
That's a name I don't deserve.

98
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,842
- What?
- Jenkins kissed me.

99
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:31,257
She kissed me.

100
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:35,312
The other day, she saw me
play skee-ball, and I don't know,

101
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:37,350
she caught
some of the big fudge fever.

102
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,797
But you have to know,
I stopped it right away.

103
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,853
And just,
you're the only one for me, baby.

104
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,048
I see what this is.

105
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:50,947
This is
about the whole reacher/settler thing.

106
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:52,991
Come again for big fudge?

107
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:56,494
You want to make me jealous,
you're making up a story about Jenkins.

108
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:58,455
I'm not making this up!

109
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:02,422
This happened.
That woman kissed me with tongue.

110
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:04,169
Her tongue was in my mouth.

111
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:05,712
Sure it was.

112
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:09,466
It was thick and rough
like a starfish arm.

113
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,922
I'm so jealous.

114
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:14,736
I'm just gonna go over there
and punch her right in the nose.

115
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,098
Give her a knuckle sandwich.

116
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:18,475
Come on, baby.

117
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,372
You want some soup?

118
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:22,897
It happened!

119
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:25,742
Do you have any...

120
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:27,732
split pea left?

121
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,844
These are just
a few of the many contributions

122
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,573
he made to architecture, and yet,

123
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:35,825
he is only remembered for one thing.

124
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:39,126
That my friends,
is the sad legacy...

125
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:42,555
of Gregorio Franchetti Gazebo.

126
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:45,627
Any questions?

127
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,213
- Do you want to drink with us tonight?
- What?

128
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,922
We're gonna play
the Robin Scherbatsky drinking game.

129
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:53,182
We were wondering
if you wanted to join us.

130
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,379
What can I say, except

131
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:58,284
"But, ums up."?

132
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,025
Can I still come?

133
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,172
I'll pay.

134
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:09,570
So, your third book
was your breakout novel,

135
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:13,655
Damn!

136
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:14,739
Sorry.

137
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,198
But... just "But",
no "Um,", just "But."

138
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:22,580
Your first novel was written
more quickly.

139
00:17:23,003 --> 00:17:24,083
That's correct.

140
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:28,795
How great is this?!

141
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:33,399
<i>And it was right then
that Robin got an idea</i>

142
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,426
<i>that would end
the drinking game forever.</i>

143
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:39,547
I wanted to ask you about
the novel you're writing right now.

144
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:43,434
<i>... it's an idea you've had for a...</i>

145
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:45,436
long time...

146
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,191
Don't drink, it's a trap!

147
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:53,164
I think I'm gonna go.
You can keep your ten bucks.

148
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:56,030
Thanks.

149
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,680
<i>If there's any college kids
watching,</i>

150
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,020
We have to drink, professor.

151
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:04,486
It's the rules.

152
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:06,629
She said "But, um".

153
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:11,176
God help us all.

154
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:14,882
Here you are.

155
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:18,052
I'm so sorry I kissed you yesterday.

156
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,478
That's okay.

157
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:21,889
And I'm sorry
I had sex with you in the mailroom.

158
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,015
That wasn't me.

159
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:26,797
Good grief, that's two awkward
conversations I have to have today.

160
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:28,610
I don't normally do that.

161
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,147
I was really drunk.

162
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,024
You were drunk at 8:00?

163
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:33,734
I don't know how that happened.

164
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:36,205
<i>I thought snail pellets were safe.</i>

165
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,242
I gotta get to work.

166
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:47,957
That game is catching on.

167
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,792
Damn it, how could I do this?

168
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,002
It's okay.

169
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,503
You know what, it's not okay.

170
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:54,937
You're the nicest guy
in this stupid office

171
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:57,008
and I don't want
to screw up our friendship.

172
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,011
This is so embarrassing.
Don't tell anyone.

173
00:19:01,732 --> 00:19:03,673
Who am I gonna tell?
Lily?

174
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:04,974
I told Lily.

175
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:07,298
For Pete's sake,
I gotta go talk to her.

176
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:09,043
I gotta apologize.

177
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:12,731
I'm gonna tell her that it happened,

178
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:14,922
that it meant nothing
and that I'm sorry.

179
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,159
- Do that.
- I will.

180
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:25,481
And if you don't have time
for all that,

181
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:27,913
tell her it happened,
and that you're sorry.

182
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,225
And if you're in a real rush,
don't say "Sorry".

183
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,722
Tell her that it happened.

184
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:34,474
That's the important part,
that it actually happened.

185
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,506
So emphasize that
as much as you can.

186
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:40,641
And so, Lily,
I guess what I'm saying is,

187
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:41,723
it happened.

188
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,388
I feel terrible about it,
and I'm really sorry.

189
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,266
It happened.

190
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:49,849
What are you going to do?

191
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:50,974
It happened.

192
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,224
Terrible!

193
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:54,053
But like I said...

194
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:56,662
- It happened.
- And I feel awful about it.

195
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:58,791
And I'd hate myself if what I did,

196
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,072
hurt you in any way
or affected your relationship.

197
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:03,938
Please forgive me.

198
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:06,097
Kiss my husband?

199
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:10,064
My husband? Nobody kisses
my future baby daddy but me!

200
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,840
Marshall, you're blocking the shot!

201
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,130
<i>And, kids, your uncle marshall
never tried to make Lily jealous again.</i>

202
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,537
That's good.

203
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,808
We're just going to have a nice,
low-key class today.

204
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,240
Not a lot of talking.

205
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:35,597
No loud noises.

206
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:39,401
'sup guys?

207
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:43,297
Please, just go away.

208
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,782
I just wanted to drop by and say...

209
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,333
<i>Thanks for watching</i>
