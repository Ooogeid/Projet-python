1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,662
<i>Kids, in many of my stories,</i>

2
00:00:02,787 --> 00:00:06,117
<i>I'm a starry-eyed romantic
on a noble search for true love.</i>

3
00:00:06,404 --> 00:00:08,623
<i>In this one, I'm just a jerk. </i>

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,520
Well, guys, tonight is the night.

5
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:16,385
I'm inviting Tiffany up to my place
to see my antique camera collection.

6
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:18,445
- It's Ted's bait.
- "Bait"?

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,748
A true gentleman invents a pretense

8
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:23,134
to lure an honorable lady
into his apartment.

9
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:25,558
Some item of interest
or beauty you can both

10
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:28,653
pretend to admire for five minutes
before she hops on your disco stick.

11
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,184
Like she's coming up to "borrow a book"
or "check out an album on vinyl. "

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,232
Or to see your new rap poster.

13
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:37,536
"Rap poster"?
Who would that work on?

14
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:41,499
It was the first week of college.
I was really into Wu-Tang Clan.

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,113
Yeah, bait is tricky.

16
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:46,934
It has to be something interesting
enough to get the girl upstairs,

17
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,173
but not so interesting
that it overpowers the night.

18
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:51,676
<i>I found that a slot machine
was too fun. </i>

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,098
<i>And a trampoline... </i>

20
00:00:58,143 --> 00:00:59,954
<i>turned out to be too dangerous.</i>

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,873
<i>But then I found the perfect bait:</i>

22
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,621
<i>a teacup pig. </i>

23
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:09,986
"A teacup pig"?
Who's that working on?

24
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:13,072
- You have a teacup pig?! I
- Didn't know you had a teacup pig!

25
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:17,163
- Can I borrow your teacup pig?
- Yes, you can.

26
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,390
You have a teacup pig?! My gosh!
I can't believe you have a teacup pig!

27
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:23,611
You're just so cute!
Yes, you are the cutest piggy ever!

28
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:25,334
What?

29
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,629
Were you always this pretty?
Or are you going to give me that whole,

30
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,173
"In high school I was
really shy and awkward" line?

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,281
I <i>was</i> shy and awkward.

32
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:36,303
I was, like, a hundred pounds heavier
and I had these crazy buck teeth.

33
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,388
- Seriously?
- No, I've always been hot.

34
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:41,496
What are you going to do?

35
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,873
Do you know who else
would love this teacup pig?

36
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:49,608
My boyfriend.

37
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,086
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

38
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,457
..: www.sous-titres.eu :..

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,709
- You have a boyfriend?
- I know.

40
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:08,878
So annoying, right?
I mean, he's

41
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,671
not <i>really</i> my boyfriend.

42
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:14,258
- Good.
- I mean, technically, he kind of is.

43
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:16,093
Is he or isn't he?

44
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:19,116
Some of both,
but definitely not either.

45
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:21,856
Are you getting any of this?

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,852
Look, I really like you.

47
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:27,216
I just need you to be patient.

48
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:30,342
I don't want to lose you,
Big Brown Eyes.

49
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:36,847
Somebody doesn't want to lose
Big Brown Eyes.

50
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:40,782
She's got you on the hook.

51
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,828
What? What?
I'm not on the hook.

52
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:45,081
You are totally on the hook.

53
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,960
She's stringing you along.
She's not committing to you,

54
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,030
but she's keeping you
around just in case,

55
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:52,716
like an old can of chili
in the pantry.

56
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:56,268
Who's buying canned chili
and not eating it immediately?

57
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,593
 Amen, sister.

58
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,041
Don't feel bad. We've all been there.
I've been on both sides of it.

59
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,892
I've been a hookey and a hooker.
Move past it, guys.

60
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:08,145
I've been a little bit loose,
but money never changed hands.

61
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,629
I've been on the hook.

62
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,166
Lisa Walker.

63
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:16,286
Picture it:
1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.

64
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,771
So I was, like, thinking, Lisa...

65
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:24,732
do you maybe want to,
like, go out with me?

66
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,414
That sounds great.

67
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,835
But I'm sort of seeing this guy.
He's got a LeBaron convertible

68
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,338
and an "in" at the roller rink,
so I'd hate to burn that bridge.

69
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:37,592
I understand.

70
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:40,261
But how about this?

71
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,347
You can be my secret boyfriend
who does all my homework for me.

72
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:47,622
A'ight.

73
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,938
You want to see my rap poster?

74
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,923
Poster whore.

75
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:54,608
Anyway...

76
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,677
Lisa Walker strung me
along for months until one night,

77
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:02,032
I went to go tell her
how much I loved her.

78
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:04,285
In song.

79
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,300
<i>She wasn't home yet, so I waited.</i>

80
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,857
<i>And waited. </i>

81
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,201
<i>I woke up four hours later,</i>
<i>covered in snow. </i>

82
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,805
<i>And that's when I saw it. </i>

83
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:22,696
<i>Lisa's footsteps. </i>

84
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:26,126
<i>She had walked right over me
and into the house. </i>

85
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:30,769
It was the best thing that could've
happened. It got me off her hook.

86
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,783
Okay, that is definitely not
what's going on with me and Tiffany.

87
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:34,857
Listen to this.

88
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:37,963
I'm really into you.

89
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,468
I just can't be with you right now.

90
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:48,787
Ted, "right no" is the classic
on-the-hook catchphrase.

91
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,642
"Right now" paints a picture of
some sort of magical future time

92
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:55,586
when everything will work out, but
the truth is, that will never happen.

93
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:58,470
It's like this.
"I can't be with you. "

94
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:01,006
"Right now. "

95
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,507
I think my high school boyfriend,
is still sort of on the hook for me.

96
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:10,560
Sort of?
He totally is.

97
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,395
The poor guy showed up at our
wedding hoping to win you back.

98
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,704
It's sometimes weird
when I see him at work.

99
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:17,879
Wait. What?

100
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:22,049
Scooter works in the school cafeteria.
We've talked about this.

101
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:23,948
Lily. Nice dress.

102
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:25,376
Tater-tots?

103
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,014
We most certainly have
not talked about this!

104
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,956
Yes, we have.
I've mentioned it tons of times.

105
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,681
"Lunch Lady Scooter. "

106
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:38,687
I thought that you were referring

107
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:41,170
to some sort of long overdue
device that carries around

108
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:43,465
those poor,
underappreciated lunch ladies!

109
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:46,303
This explains a lot.

110
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,136
Lunch Lady Scooter
was there again today.

111
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,813
Did you jump on that thing?
Give it a ride?

112
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,286
Really? If it were me,
I'd be riding that scooter

113
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:59,066
all day long until I broke
that thang in half.

114
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,653
So those poor women still
have to walk everywhere?

115
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,380
Wait. Scooter is working
at your school?!

116
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:08,058
Are you jealous?

117
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,821
No, I just feel bad for Scooter.

118
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:13,621
'Cause the reason he took that job
is he thinks he has a shot with you.

119
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,701
You have to make it clear
that he doesn't,

120
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,861
so that he can move on
and a real lunch lady

121
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,814
can get her job back. Damn!

122
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:20,989
I've tried.

123
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,979
I saw you had seventh period free.
So do I.

124
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,137
You want to run away together?

125
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:30,656
Let me be clear, Scooter.

126
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,436
There is no way you and I
can ever be together.

127
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,430
Right now.

128
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,614
I'll see you tomorrow, Lily.
It's Tijuana Tuesday.

129
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:50,589
"Right now"?

130
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,162
You right-now'd Scooter?

131
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:55,956
You need to let him
off the hook once and for all.

132
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,638
You're right. Day after tomorrow,
that's exactly what I'm going to do.

133
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:00,965
Why not tomorrow?

134
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,977
Baby, I can't ruin Tijuana Tuesday.

135
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:07,176
Really?

136
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:10,019
You're really going to sit here
all night watching the door

137
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:12,806
because Tiffany said
she'll "try to stop by"?

138
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,315
Barney, I'm not going
to just give up on her.

139
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
<i>I should have given up on her.</i>

140
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,683
This girl is special.

141
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:21,402
<i>She was the devil. </i>

142
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,749
Things are going
to work out with her.

143
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:26,674
<i>No, they're not, dumbass. </i>

144
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,866
Ted, let me be clear:
this girl is a poison

145
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,535
and you need to cut her
out of your life forever.

146
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,997
There she is.

147
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,794
She brought some of her coworkers.

148
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,174
Hang on to this girl.

149
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,843
Hang on to her and never let go! 

150
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,477
These are some of the
hottest girls I've ever seen.

151
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,901
And they all work with Tiffany?

152
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:04,064
There could only be
one explanation for this.

153
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:07,757
Is Tiffany a ph...

154
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,155
pharmaceutical sales rep?

155
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,484
- Yeah, how did you know that?
- And you never thought to mention that?

156
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:16,370
What? It's just a job.

157
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:20,499
Just a j... just a jo...

158
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,732
Ted, throughout time

159
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:26,295
there has always been one
cutting-edge profession

160
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,161
to which hot girls,
like Tiffany, have flocked.

161
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:31,969
- Shall I walk you through the history?
- I'm gonna explicitly say no.

162
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,900
It all started
2.5 million years ago.

163
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,256
<i>Man was a hunter. </i>

164
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:40,002
<i>So, the hottest</i>
<i>profession of the day?</i>

165
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,270
<i>Gatherer. </i>

166
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,522
Homo erectus indeed.

167
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:48,878
<i>As man mastered technology,</i>

168
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:50,979
<i>the hottest profession
of the day evolved. </i>

169
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:54,366
I'm pretty sure it's a hernia.
Can you check again?

170
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,553
<i>And then, man took to the skies. </i>

171
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:04,042
<i>And so, hot women put on high heels
and became stewardesses</i>

172
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,255
I am in the upright
and locked position.

173
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:14,961
And then man said, "Life is hard.

174
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,389
I should start taking
lots of prescription drugs. "

175
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,356
And so, hot girls
rolled into doctors' offices,

176
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:22,776
looking sexy enough to render
the very erection pills

177
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,396
they peddled ironically redundant.

178
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,775
So now, pharma girls are today's
hottest profession.

179
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,571
Big Brown Eyes.
How you doing?

180
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,214
I'm good.

181
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:38,160
By the way, you, you ditch
that loser boyfriend yet?

182
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,328
No, sir.

183
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,530
Touched my nose.

184
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,220
Dude, ditch Tiffany
and join the Barnacle

185
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:50,180
in a pharma girl free-for-all.

186
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:52,784
Side effects may include
loss of clothing, rug burn,

187
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,298
shortness of breath and sore
abdominals the next morning.

188
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:57,012
What in the world is up?!

189
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:05,354
I know that you've been having trouble
letting Scooter off the hook.

190
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,512
I decided what you need is practice.

191
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:10,442
Now, you say
the problem is his cute, sad eyes?

192
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:12,453
Well...

193
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,105
All right, shut it, woman.

194
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,538
Now,
I want you to look at this teacup pig

195
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:28,126
and tell him that there's no way
that you could ever be with him.

196
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:32,435
Teacup Pig,

197
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:37,219
there is no way
I can ever be with you.

198
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,645
Right now.

199
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,510
Come on!
Grow a pair!

200
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:49,985
I'm sorry, but...

201
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,558
he's just so freakin' cute.

202
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:54,947
I just want to cuddle him
all day long.

203
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,030
- Yes, I do.
- You know, that's funny.

204
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,949
I remember when you used to say
things like that about me.

205
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,118
I still do.

206
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,550
Not as much, Lily.

207
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:05,923
Not as much.

208
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:10,210
<i>Ain't no party
like a pharma girl party.</i>

209
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,185
<i>'Cause a pharma girl party
don't stop!</i>

210
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,011
Dude, I have already hooked up
with three of them.

211
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:16,072
Fantasmo.

212
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:19,428
Plus, my cholesterol is down.
My restless legs syndrome is cured.

213
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,346
I've never felt more alive.

214
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,809
Guys, great news.
Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend.

215
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:29,260
- Proof that I am not on the hook.
- You're still on the hook.

216
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,815
Listen to how we spent last night.

217
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:34,026
<i>First, we cuddled.</i>

218
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:37,272
<i>Then,</i>

219
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,553
<i>we shared chocolate cake.</i>

220
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:44,027
<i>Then, well, I don't usually
join in on locker room talk,</i>

221
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:48,040
<i>but I gave her
a pretty sensual foot rub.</i>

222
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:53,117
And let me guess,
it didn't go any further than that.

223
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:55,505
No, but...

224
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,134
And tell me, did you by any chance
make that chocolate cake?

225
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,304
- It was a mix.
- Dude.

226
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,788
There's no shame in admitting it,
Ted.

227
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:08,917
We've all been on people's hooks
and we've all kept someone on the hook.

228
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,242
I most certainly have not.

229
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,575
- What?
- Are you joking?

230
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,822
What about that girl
from the university library?

231
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:17,945
Henrietta?

232
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,260
Henrietta and I are just friends.

233
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,340
She is so on your hook.

234
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:24,196
Absolutely not.

235
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:25,621
<i>She totally was.</i>

236
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:26,662
<i>I mean...</i>

237
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:28,927
<i>we cuddled.</i>

238
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,294
<i>We shared chocolate cake.</i>

239
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,635
<i>She gave me foot rubs... long ones.</i>

240
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,260
<i>I'm not proud, kids.</i>

241
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,913
You like having Henrietta around

242
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:45,260
for the reason
that Tiffany likes having you around,

243
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,074
it's a nice little ego boost.

244
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,384
No wonder you're such an expert
about keeping people on the hook.

245
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,885
What about that poor camera guy
you work with?

246
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,511
- Mike and I are just friends.
- Come on.

247
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,357
That's the stuff.

248
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:04,109
Robin, have you ever thought about
taking us to the next level?

249
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:06,702
If you're talking about
doing my laundry, I'm on board.

250
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,150
You got yourself a deal.

251
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:13,012
What?!
I am not keeping Mike on the hook.

252
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:14,935
You are Captain Hook.

253
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,386
Dude, I'm a girl.

254
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:18,949
Our girl parts are like a spiderweb.

255
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,882
Sometimes you'll catch
stuff you don't want.

256
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:23,760
That doesn't make it okay.

257
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:27,321
And Henrietta is in, in no way
wasting her time with you, right?

258
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:29,338
Henrietta knows
that we're just friends.

259
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:32,409
In fact, I'm gonna call her up
and hang out with her tonight,

260
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,146
as friends.

261
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,635
I love you. What?
Do you want a foot massage?

262
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,610
'Cause I've been practicing
on myself.

263
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,986
I'm good.

264
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:45,837
I didn't know if you were hungry,
so I threw together some...

265
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:47,462
it's not a big deal.

266
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:48,777
<i>Kids, looking back,</i>

267
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:52,330
<i>I don't know how I didn't see
that Henrietta was in love with me.</i>

268
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,838
<i>I'm going out of town this weekend
for my friend's wedding.</i>

269
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,413
<i>Want to be my date?</i>

270
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:05,177
I would love to.
What are you doing right now?

271
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:06,658
God, no.

272
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,347
Awesome.
I'll see you in, like, ten minutes?

273
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:10,682
Great.

274
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,796
Sorry, Henrietta, something came up.

275
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,353
Take a rain check, pal?

276
00:14:15,743 --> 00:14:16,855
It's no problem.

277
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:19,427
You're strong.

278
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,820
<i>What a jerk.</i>

279
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:23,996
Henrietta, I...

280
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,031
Wait. Where did Ted go?

281
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:27,699
I thought we'll meet him.

282
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,471
Something came up, okay, Mom?

283
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,587
I told you there was no Ted.

284
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:33,822
I heard that.

285
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:39,956
<i>So there I was,</i>

286
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:43,222
<i>at one of the surest signs of taking
a relationship to the next level,</i>

287
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:45,217
<i>an out-of-town wedding.</i>

288
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,831
<i>It was finally happening.</i>

289
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:47,969
Champagne?

290
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,889
Ted, my gosh, I forgot to call you.

291
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,433
Whatever it's you wanted to talk about,
we can do it now.

292
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:58,273
This is Jack.
He's the best man at the wedding.

293
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,199
We just got back together.

294
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,652
Now that I think about it,
a phone call would have been nice.

295
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:05,274
You're Ted?

296
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,282
I hear you make
a mean chocolate cake.

297
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,712
Isn't he great?

298
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:15,867
And he's in a band.

299
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,045
Thanks.

300
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,239
Come on.
You have to get Scooter off the hook.

301
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,420
Now, try again.

302
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:24,647
Teacup Pig...

303
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:28,385
I don't want to be with you.

304
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:38,657
- Right now.
- Man up!

305
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,459
Teacup Pig...

306
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,527
I don't want to be with you.

307
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:51,908
Ever.

308
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:53,285
Finish him!

309
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,337
We will never be together

310
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:57,928
in any sort of sexual way
ever again.

311
00:15:58,053 --> 00:15:58,957
Nice.

312
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,961
- A weird thing to say to a pig.
- It felt really wrong.

313
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:07,132
Anyway, I just don't think
you and I are going to work.

314
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:09,968
Right now.

315
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:12,027
<i>And that's when it hit me.</i>

316
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:13,556
<i>I was on the hook.</i>

317
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,973
<i>I also realized...</i>

318
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:17,463
I missed this so much, baby.

319
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:19,273
<i>... Tiffany was on this guy's hook.</i>

320
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:20,645
<i>It was a vicious cycle.</i>

321
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:22,243
<i>Henrietta was on my hook.</i>

322
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:25,817
<i>And years later, I found out
this bastard was on Henrietta's hook.</i>

323
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,614
You know what?

324
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:33,033
We're not going to work ever.

325
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,366
I'm done.

326
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:42,773
And it's better for the circulation
if you knead the arches with thumbs.

327
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:44,002
Now, I'm done.

328
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:49,836
Marshall, I can do this by myself.

329
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:51,134
Then prove it.

330
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:56,096
Grab me a pudding.

331
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,586
Listen up, Scooter.

332
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,855
There is no way
you and I will ever be together.

333
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:12,522
Right now!

334
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:15,522
I'm sorry, but he's adorable.

335
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:16,534
Listen.

336
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,787
- I don't want to be with you.
- Right now.

337
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:21,289
Hang in there, Scoots!
I'm not going to live forever.

338
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,446
Last night I was
with this pharma girl who was so hot,

339
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:27,871
you should call a doctor
if you don't have an erection

340
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,214
for more than four hours.

341
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,832
Am I right, people?

342
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,803
There's no people...
just the girl you most recently dated.

343
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,891
I want you to meet
the newest pharma girl.

344
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,249
Gladys Reynolds.
Nice to make your acquaintance.

345
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:46,314
I represent statins
and other cholesterol-lowering drugs.

346
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,036
Come on.
Let's go get our drink on.

347
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:53,405
It's over.

348
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:54,651
What's over?

349
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:58,904
Pharma girls are
no longer exclusively hot chicks.

350
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,587
It's the end of an era.

351
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,372
You're being a little dramatic.

352
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
Am I?

353
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,895
It starts out with a Gladys.

354
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,337
Next thing, a few not-so-fabulous
gay guys enter the ranks.

355
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:12,157
And before you know it,
pharma girls look

356
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:15,847
like the crew on a Southwest flight
from Albuquerque to Little Rock.

357
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,011
It's over!

358
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:22,587
<i>So that night,
I went straight to Henrietta's...</i>

359
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,812
<i>all set to let her off the hook.</i>

360
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:36,489
This is Jack.
He's the best man at the wedding.

361
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:42,211
I'm done.

362
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,336
The answer is yes!

363
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:55,508
It gets worse.

364
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:56,977
It's perfect!

365
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:58,647
Mom, Dad!

366
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,023
Ted proposed!

367
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,807
I knew this day would come!

368
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:04,587
Son!

369
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:05,810
There's been a...

370
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,022
What did you do?

371
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,641
I seriously considered

372
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,152
just marrying her
out of sheer awkwardness.

373
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,548
But I did what I had to do.

374
00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:19,674
I did what anyone
keeping someone on the hook should do.

375
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,576
I broke her heart.

376
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,830
Henrietta, I'm sorry if this is blunt,
but I think I owe you this.

377
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,545
I don't want to be with you.

378
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,610
Right now?

379
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:34,211
Ever.

380
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,760
But we're still getting married,
right?

381
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,351
It was... brutal.

382
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:43,632
I'm sorry, buddy.

383
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,925
Honesty is tough, but in the end,

384
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,186
it is the far kinder alternative.

385
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,574
Hey, sweetie.

386
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:54,869
Hey, Mike.

387
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,195
I have to tell you something.

388
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,198
Did you finish my delicates?

389
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,325
- Got one more load.
- It can wait.

390
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,046
How's it going?

391
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,423
Still in mourning
over the end of the pharma girl era?

392
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,654
I realized
that their reign had to end

393
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,670
for some new hot girl profession.

394
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,020
Maybe it'll be...

395
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,423
intergalactic communications officer
on a rocket ship

396
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:31,941
to some distant solar system
we can't possibly imagine.

397
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,065
Maybe it'll be... meter maids.

398
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:35,483
We just don't know.

399
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,556
But one thing is sure.

400
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:41,355
The future glows

401
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,817
like a giant sun

402
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:48,075
shooting amber rays of light
into our hearts and minds.

403
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:52,458
What changed your mind?

404
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,295
The realization
that hope springs eternal, Robin.

405
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,675
That
and this little bottle of purple pills

406
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,492
I found in my couch cushion.

407
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,440
I don't know what they are,
but they are amazing.
