1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,965
<i>When I first moved to New York,
it was dingy, disgusting,</i>

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,892
<i>dirty, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky</i>

3
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:09,096
<i>and altogether terrifying,</i>

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,117
<i>but then, sadly.</i>

5
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,351
<i>The whole city started to go uphill.</i>

6
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:16,608
<i>The streets got a little cleaner,</i>

7
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:19,130
<i>the rents got a little higher,
and one by one,</i>

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,108
<i>the crappy old places we loved
began to disappear.</i>

9
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:25,124
<i>The Elbow Room,
an old punk rock club,</i>

10
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:26,772
<i>became a drugstore.</i>

11
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:29,753
<i>McHale's,
a working-class watering hole,</i>

12
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:31,284
<i>became a fast-food place.</i>

13
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,687
<i>And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge,</i>

14
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,211
<i>became a bank.</i>

15
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:37,791
<i>And not just any bank.</i>

16
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,959
Goliath National Bank.

17
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:42,128
The world leader
in credit and banking.

18
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:44,881
God, I love Goliath National Bank!

19
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:48,301
Okay, first of all, you look like
the last pick in the draft.

20
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,096
And, second, why are you so excited
about some bank?

21
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:54,182
Our company just bought them
out in a ruthless takeover.

22
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:57,272
Took two months.
Cost 2,000 jobs.

23
00:00:58,304 --> 00:00:59,737
It was brutal.

24
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:01,481
Who wants a T-shirt?

25
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:05,318
Hey, Marshall, they're hiring
in the legal department.

26
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,828
I could get you a job.

27
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:10,045
Barney, Marshall didn't quit his
last soul-sucking corporate job

28
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:11,491
just to go work at a bank.

29
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,993
He's gonna be
an environmental lawyer.

30
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:16,001
<i>That was the plan, anyway.</i>

31
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:18,956
<i>Over the next few weeks, Marshall
went on a lot of interviews.</i>

32
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:20,208
You are confident,

33
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,004
you are energetic,

34
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,528
you are focused!

35
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:25,257
<i>A lot of interviews.</i>

36
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:27,428
You are flexible on salary,

37
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,342
you're willing to compromise,

38
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,049
you're not gonna cry this time.

39
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:34,036
<i>Too many interviews.</i>

40
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:35,365
You are sad,

41
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:37,434
you are beaten down,

42
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,395
you will get through this,
come home,

43
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:43,754
get in your big underpants
and take a nap.

44
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,365
<i>Which brings us to September 29,</i>

45
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:49,561
<i>the night of the burger.</i>

46
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:51,729
So, what do you guys
want to do for dinner?

47
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,241
Oh, we just got a new cook.

48
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:55,243
You have to try the burger,
it's amazing.

49
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:57,871
- Great, we'll take five of those.
- Five burgers.

50
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:01,328
- Really? You want to eat here?
- Yeah, I'm freaking starving.

51
00:02:01,448 --> 00:02:04,544
- I just finished a seven-day cleanse.
- I thought you started that yesterday.

52
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:05,879
I finished early, OK?

53
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:08,303
- Five of those.
- Five burgers.

54
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:09,507
Wait.

55
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,580
- What about sushi?
- We had sushi last night.

56
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,303
- Italian.
- I had Italian for lunch.

57
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:15,424
- I can come back.
- No. We always do this.

58
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:17,390
We spend an hour arguing about
where to eat,

59
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,892
and we end up here anyway.

60
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,720
I haven't eaten for two days.

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,475
Can we please, for the love of God,
just order something now?

62
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,970
Chinese?

63
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:30,403
- I don't like Chinese.
- Indian?

64
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,447
I just said I don't like Chinese.

65
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:33,737
Indian isn't Chinese.

66
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,895
Weird meats, funny music,
side of rice.

67
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:37,619
Why are we splitting hairs?

68
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:38,912
Mexican?

69
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,504
I just said I don't like Chinese.

70
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:42,734
God.

71
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:45,410
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

72
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,583
Robin, yours will be right out.

73
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,184
Of course, mine comes last.

74
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,772
Go ahead, start without me.

75
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:08,274
Sweet! You shouldn't have.
That's so kind of you.

76
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,113
My God.

77
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,347
This burger is so good.

78
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,500
It's like Christmas in my mouth,

79
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,962
meat Christmas.

80
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:22,804
It's like an angel from heaven

81
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:25,143
landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's.

82
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:28,461
Where the chef killed it and ran
it through the meat grinder.

83
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,882
I love this burger so much,

84
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,959
I want to sew my ass shut.

85
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:35,885
It's okay.

86
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,540
Are you kidding me?

87
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,763
Guys, guys, guys.

88
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:41,808
When you've had the best burger
in NY, every other burger

89
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,560
tastes like my grandpa's feet.

90
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:46,844
But you guys eat up,
enjoy my grandpa's feet.

91
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:49,274
And you've had the
best burger in New York.

92
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,331
It was eight years ago,
my first week in New York,

93
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:58,074
and for a kid from Minnesota,
the big city was a scary place.

94
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,456
Oh, thank God it's just you.

95
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,500
You are being ridiculous.

96
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,003
- {\Tell me}You left the apartment today?
- Why would I have to leave?

97
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:13,131
I can have anything I want delivered,
and New York City cable is awesome.

98
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,107
Have you seen this public access show
with the old Jewish lady in a bikini?

99
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:17,414
It's disgusting.

100
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,813
Marshall, you have to
get over this paranoia.

101
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,452
- You are not gonna get mugged.
- What if I do, Ted

102
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:25,443
I don't have a switchblade.
I don't know how to break-dance

103
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:27,520
and win the begrudging respect
of a street gang.

104
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,564
That's it, you're taking a walk.
Come on, go.

105
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:31,661
No. Look, the old lady
in a bikini is back on.

106
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,589
I'm just gonna lie back
and get comfortable.

107
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,601
- Go outside, go, go.
- Okay.

108
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,598
Leave the bat.

109
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:42,945
Fine.

110
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:46,555
So I went for a walk
in the big, scary city.

111
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:50,156
And I discovered something amazing:
it wasn't scary at all.

112
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:51,129
All right.

113
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:53,463
What's the word?

114
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,215
Your search is over!

115
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:59,376
<i>And then, right when I started
to get a little hungry,</i>

116
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:01,050
<i>I turned a corner...</i>

117
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:04,955
And there it was.

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,847
The tiniest little
burger joint you ever saw,

119
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,730
tucked between a taxidermist
and a triple-X bookstore.

120
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:13,316
Name two places
where things get stuffed.

121
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:17,227
So, I went inside.

122
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:20,378
And I ordered the burger.

123
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:22,542
Thank you.

124
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:06,411
Ted, you got to wake up.
Wake...

125
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,040
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,699
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

127
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:12,826
I'm all right.

128
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,741
Ted, I've just had the most
amazing burger of my life!

129
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:20,216
It's this awesome little place,
Regis Philbin eats there,

130
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:22,927
so it's sort of like
a celebrity hot spot. But the burger,

131
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,906
- The burger.
- Dude.

132
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,931
I want one of those
burgers right now!

133
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,071
- Do you think they're still open?
- I don't know.

134
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,477
Does stuff in New York
stay open past... 9:30?

135
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:34,230
So we went out
to get another burger.

136
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,130
But after hours of searching...

137
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,105
Damn it!

138
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:38,401
Where is this place?

139
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,915
- You couldn't find it?
- We didn't know our way around.

140
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,230
Just getting back to the apartment
took us three hours

141
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,542
- and one very helpful drag queen.
- Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?

142
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:51,216
- Where do you think it was?
- Probably tucked between her legs.

143
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:54,458
You know what's not a drag?

144
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:56,747
Getting a home equity loan
at Goliath National Bank.

145
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:57,837
I'm just saying.

146
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:00,423
Anyways, we never found the place.

147
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,985
Now, eight years
have passed, still...

148
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,856
No burger.

149
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,244
I couldn't help but overhear.

150
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:11,007
Okay, here we go.

151
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:13,436
- I know the place you're talking about.
- No, you don't.

152
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:15,942
It's a place
called the Corner Bistro.

153
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,487
Greatburger.

154
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:20,679
Oh, the Corner Bistro!

155
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,446
It's amazing, I spent
a quarter of my life

156
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:26,449
searching for the best burger
in New York City, but silly me,

157
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,406
it never occurred to me to check

158
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,544
the highest-rated burger
in the Zagat guide.

159
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:32,478
Wow, thanks a lot, guy.

160
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:34,207
Let me return the favor.

161
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:35,958
Great cup of coffee:

162
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:37,861
Starbucks.

163
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,299
So I take it you've
tried the Corner Bistro.

164
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,070
I've tried every
so-called best burger

165
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,282
in New York City
trying to find that burger.

166
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:53,684
Or at least forget about her.

167
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:12,263
We're going.

168
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,464
But none of those places
even came close.

169
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:18,512
There was that one time we thought
we had a break in the case, remember?

170
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:19,951
Get this.

171
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:22,955
- You know who works out at my gym?
- Regis Philbin.

172
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:24,861
The autographed picture.

173
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,759
Of course I remember the place.

174
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,110
It was the best burger I ever had.

175
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,696
I still have dreams
about this burger.

176
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:33,850
Beautiful, haunting dreams!

177
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,977
I wake up at night screaming,

178
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:38,604
"Get out of my head, burger!
Get out!"

179
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,106
That's the one, Mr. Philbin.

180
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:42,900
- Do you rember where it is?
- No! I never wrote it down.

181
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,737
But not a day goes by
that I don't regret it.

182
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,990
Why? Why? Do you know where it is?

183
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,435
- No.
- And if you tell me

184
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:53,035
it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna
smack you right in the face!

185
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:55,259
- We don't know where it is.
- Listen, Blondie!

186
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,971
Don't mess with me!

187
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,000
Daddy needs his meat.

188
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,681
I don't know where it is,
Regis, I swear!

189
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:04,262
What about you, Lurch?

190
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:06,829
And what about you, satchel-mouth?

191
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,051
This is my cell.

192
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:12,430
You find that burger,
you call me day or night.

193
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,265
OK, Regis, we will, we will.

194
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:16,517
What are you waiting for?
Get out and find the burger!

195
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,702
- All right.
- Let's go, all of you!

196
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,480
That's where my story ends.

197
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,786
Now I'm doomed to walk the earth

198
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:25,975
forever searching
for that green door

199
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:28,988
and that red neon sign
that says "Burger."

200
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,574
Green door, red neon sign
that says "Burger?"

201
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:33,051
I know that place.

202
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:36,398
I've walked by it a million times.
It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.

203
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:38,998
I knew it was on a numbered street!

204
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,806
- Finally.
- No! Robin!

205
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,827
If any of us is gonna
eat a burger tonight,

206
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,853
it's gonna be
the best burger in New York.

207
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,757
We're going downtown!

208
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,090
No...

209
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:56,140
I cannot believe we're finally
gonna have this burger

210
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:58,547
Honey, I'm so excited for you.

211
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:01,604
After all these interviews,
after all these disappointments,

212
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:04,440
you deserve a triumphant
mouth full of meat.

213
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:06,562
You know what else is a mouthful?

214
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:09,820
All that double-talk other banks
give you. At Goliath,

215
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,573
customer satisfaction
is our most important investment.

216
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,410
I hate to break this to you,
but working for a bank's kind of lame.

217
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,243
How lame
is free automatic bill pay?

218
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:23,319
How lame is 3.3% APY
online savings?

219
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:27,237
That's right. Hate to make you
look stupid in front of your friends,

220
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:29,026
but you left me no choice.

221
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:33,149
- We should probably call Regis.
- Reg...

222
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:36,722
That guy scares me.
I think I'll leave him a text.

223
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:39,392
Now, Kathy,
your last flip was heads.

224
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:42,227
The one before that was tails.
You polled the audience,

225
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:45,572
they came out split, 50/50.
No help at all there.

226
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,027
So, for $258,000...

227
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:54,532
I have to ask you, Kathy,
what's it gonna be: heads...

228
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:56,743
or...

229
00:10:58,489 --> 00:10:59,499
Excuse me.

230
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,706
Oh, boy. I've got to go.

231
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:03,330
I've got to go!

232
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,813
Green door,
red neon sign. Guys,

233
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,839
this is the place.
I've actually,

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,300
- I prepared a few words.
- I will eat your hand.

235
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:15,694
Let's just go inside then.
Shall we?

236
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:19,096
- Thank you.
- Yours will be right out.

237
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,519
Please, go ahead, start.

238
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,315
- Just shut up and eat.
- All right.

239
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,152
Oh, my God.

240
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,659
I'm never brushing my teeth again

241
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,115
unless it's with a toothbrush
made from this burger.

242
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,737
I think I just had
my first burg-asm.

243
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:41,991
I want...

244
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:44,802
to take this burger out to dinner,

245
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:46,711
then maybe a movie,

246
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,007
then take it back to my place,

247
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:50,931
put on a little
Terence Trent D'arby,

248
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,715
and then I would just...

249
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:54,804
fool around a little bit.

250
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,094
Nothing serious,
just take it slow, you know?

251
00:11:58,211 --> 00:11:59,875
- This isn't it.
- What?

252
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:01,349
It's not it.

253
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,767
Marshall, you might not
want to hear this, but...

254
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,131
is it at all possible this is the same
burger you had eight years ago,

255
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:09,706
only it could never live up
to your ridiculously high expectations?

256
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:12,627
- I mean, it is just a burger.
- Just a burger?

257
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:19,415
It's so much more
than just a burger.

258
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,088
I mean,

259
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,069
that first bite...

260
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,263
Oh, what heaven
that first bite is.

261
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:29,043
The bun, like a sesame-freckled

262
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,001
breast of an angel, resting gently

263
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:34,316
on the ketchup
and mustard below. Flavors

264
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:36,801
mingling in a seductive <i>pas de deux</i>.

265
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,594
And then...

266
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:41,448
a pickle

267
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:42,959
the most...

268
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,393
playful... little pickle,

269
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:49,179
and then a slice of tomato,
a leaf of lettuce, and a...

270
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,167
a patty... of ground beef, so...

271
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,568
exquisite...

272
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:56,695
swirling in your mouth,

273
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:59,448
breaking apart
and combining again in a fugue

274
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:01,684
of sweets and savories so...

275
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,079
delightful.

276
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,621
This is no mere sandwich
of grilled meat

277
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:10,344
and toasted bread.
This is God...

278
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,439
speaking to us through food.

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,801
And you got our wedding vows
off the Internet.

280
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:23,597
Okay, look, so, so this,
this isn't the place.

281
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:27,040
All right, it's no big deal.
It's another place with a green door

282
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,292
and a red neon sign
that says "Burger. "

283
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:31,826
I'll just... I'll call
every restaurant in Manhattan

284
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:34,127
and ask 'em
what color their door is.

285
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:37,249
No big deal, right?
Let's do this.

286
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:45,494
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say this isn't just about a burger.

287
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:47,733
Marshall's not doing
so well, guys.

288
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:49,623
He really needs to get a job.

289
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:52,793
- Tell them about the underpants.
- What about the underpants?

290
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:56,380
It started a couple
of weeks ago.

291
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,533
Heads!
It's going to be heads.

292
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:01,552
It's almost usually heads.

293
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:04,250
- Hey, baby.
- Hey!

294
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,319
Did you put on pants today?

295
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:08,685
Nope.

296
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,981
It was funny at first,
but then it became a daily thing.

297
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:17,276
I thought, "Okay, well, at least
he's not leaving the house like that. "

298
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:21,155
Then, one day, he opened
the door to get the paper.

299
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:25,398
Day after that,
went downstairs to get the mail.

300
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,659
Everyone's got
an underpants radius.

301
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,873
For most of us, it's the distance
from the bedroom to the bathroom,

302
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,856
but as your self-esteem
gets smaller,

303
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,377
your underpants radius gets bigger.

304
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:40,508
How big is
Marshall's underpants radius?

305
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:43,121
We're going.

306
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:51,477
Come on, Lily,
he'll find a job eventually.

307
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:54,005
You know, Lil,
when times are tough,

308
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,812
I like to remember the uplifting words
of my favorite song.

309
00:14:56,932 --> 00:15:00,444
"We'll be on your side
when you need a friend

310
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:04,588
"Through thick and thin
You can always depend

311
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:09,965
"On the world leaders
In credit and banking

312
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:14,005
"Goliath National Bank."

313
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,495
Member FDIC.

314
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,837
We've got to find
Marshall that burger.

315
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:22,007
- I think we're all eating that burger.
- I'm not eating that burger.

316
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,196
No, if Marshall says
this isn't the burger,

317
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:25,427
this isn't it.

318
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:27,217
- Finally.
- Excuse me.

319
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:29,473
Did you guys change
cooks or something?

320
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:33,519
Because my husband was here 5 years ago,
he's sure he had a different burger.

321
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,839
Yeah, we get this a lot.
This place is modeled

322
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,732
after this other place uptown with
the same green door and "Burger" sign.

323
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:42,194
- What? Uptown? Where?
- 106th and Manhattan Avenue.

324
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:48,484
Damn it.

325
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:52,259
106. A numbered street. Of course.

326
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,167
Barney, where the hell are you?

327
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,461
I'm sorry, this is...?

328
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:01,326
Regis. I'm at the place.

329
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:06,445
Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot
to call you. That's not the place.

330
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,543
The real place is on 106th
and Manhattan Avenue.

331
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:11,680
- We're headed there right now.
- What? Uptown?

332
00:16:15,794 --> 00:16:18,022
Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20.

333
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:19,695
If you get there first,

334
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:21,734
- medium rare.
- Onions?

335
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:24,236
- Onions?
- Okay, no onions.

336
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:25,569
Stop the cab!

337
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:31,164
Wait.

338
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:32,644
This is it.

339
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:34,619
Your search is over.

340
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:37,304
We got girls taking
off their clothes.

341
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:38,531
This is it.

342
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,197
One of 9,000 convenient locations.

343
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,579
It was ri...
it was right here. It was...

344
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,730
it was right on this very spot.

345
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,184
I don't understand.
Where is the burger place?

346
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:05,276
It's not a burger place anymore,
it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.

347
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:07,237
That's fine. Let's just eat here.

348
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:09,698
We can't eat here. It's an ATM.

349
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,581
But... food.

350
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,198
What the...
This is your fault,

351
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:16,872
you and your stupid bank.

352
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:19,426
- You did this.
- It's not my... Stop, okay.

353
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:20,720
Stop that, Lily.

354
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:23,962
I will never use
a Goliath ATM ever again.

355
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:26,375
Goliath National Bank sucks.

356
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:29,134
It's the worst bank
on the face of the earth.

357
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:32,398
Attention, New Yorkers,
this bank sucks!

358
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,931
- They suck!
- Geez.

359
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:36,817
- They suck, suck!
- Will you just tell her already?

360
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:38,296
Tell me what?

361
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:41,271
Tell me what?

362
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:42,981
I got a job.

363
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:44,650
What? Where?

364
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,277
Goliath National Bank.

365
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:50,516
That's why Barney's been going on
and on about how, how great Goliath is.

366
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,826
He wanted you to be excited for me
since we will to working together.

367
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:57,871
Well, technically not together.
You won't have access to my floor.

368
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,209
But you want to be
an environmental lawyer.

369
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:05,921
Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem
Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but

370
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:07,615
in the meantime,

371
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:10,642
I need a job, and this is,
this is a really good one.

372
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,512
It's great pay and
there's good benefits,

373
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:15,947
and to be honest,

374
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,978
it gives me a reason to put
on pants in the morning.

375
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:21,834
You know, I have my whole life
to save the planet, but right now

376
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:24,398
I'm kind of really excited
to wear pants again.

377
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:26,316
You've got great pants.

378
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:29,596
- I love you.
- I love you.

379
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,615
- They're unopened.
- Give it.

380
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:35,409
- They're barbecue.
- Give it!

381
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:37,828
I'm sorry you didn't get
your burger.

382
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:41,182
It's stupid. I think about that
first week in New York.

383
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:43,375
You know?
I was 22 years old.

384
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:45,977
I had my whole future ahead of me.

385
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,911
I guess I just kind of thought that if
I could have that burger one more time

386
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:52,880
and feel that way
for one more night,

387
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,051
that I might be able to
check that off the list,

388
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:56,298
and grow up,

389
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,965
go work for the stupid bank,
and just... be happy.

390
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:04,146
You know, that burger place isn't gone.
It just moved to a new location.

391
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,770
And I can tell you where that is
for a hundred bucks.

392
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,943
A hundred bucks?
That's crazy.

393
00:19:12,011 --> 00:19:14,448
- Let's pay the man.
- I paid for the cab.

394
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,909
- I have any cash.
- I haven't worked since March.

395
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:20,441
If only there were an easy,
convenient way

396
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,485
to get some cash right now.

397
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:33,023
Member FDIC.

398
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:37,660
<i>So we paid the guy,
and 20 minutes later...</i>

399
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,790
Thank you.

400
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:42,059
All right, Marshall, remember.
It might not taste as good.

401
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:45,062
This place has changed,
you've changed, New York has changed.

402
00:19:45,222 --> 00:19:47,827
Just... don't get
your hopes up too high, okay?

403
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,110
- This is it.
- Yes!

404
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:02,516
It's exactly the same.

405
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:04,581
It's the best burger in New York.

406
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:06,389
Go ahead, eat up, eat up.

407
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:10,170
<i>And so, after finally tasting again
the burger he'd craved</i>

408
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,839
<i>for so many years,</i>

409
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:14,967
<i>Marshall got up the next morning,
put on some pants,</i>

410
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,382
<i>and went to work,</i>

411
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,515
<i>and he never looked back.</i>

412
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:25,064
I want to get tiny fitted sheets
for this burger, and just...

413
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:27,093
crawl into this bun,

414
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:29,362
get all cozy, and die there.

415
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:31,187
Oh, my God.

416
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:33,737
I just want you inside of me.

417
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:36,512
This feels so good.

418
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,783
I'm worried I'm gonna get
this burger pregnant.

419
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,227
If he does get
that burger pregnant,

420
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,002
I have dibs
on the delicious burger babies.

421
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:49,080
- This isn't it.
- What?

422
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:50,874
Come on.

423
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:53,714
- That's outrageous.
- That is unbelievable.

424
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:56,000
Wait.

425
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,212
This is it!

426
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,472
- You were just freakin' teasing us.
- No, really.
