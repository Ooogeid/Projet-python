1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,882
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, how's it going?

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:05,808
I'm gonna finish this.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,937
We had dinner
with Stella's sister and her fiancé?

4
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:12,324
- They're getting married before us.
- How you've dreamt

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,684
about your perfect wedding day
when you were a little girl?

6
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,435
- Yeah.
- Totally.

7
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:18,396
My sister is stealing
my dream wedding.

8
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:22,275
Down to every last detail
on Shelter Island, at sunset...

9
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:26,237
... just down the beach
from our family's old summer house.

10
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,573
It's my dream wedding.

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,722
I'm gonna finish this.

12
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:36,623
- The lamb here is supposed to be great.
- I'm a vegan.

13
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:39,000
I wish I could tune out
that moral voice

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,419
inside me
that says eating animals is murder,

15
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:45,131
but I guess I'm just not
as strong as you are.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,008
That's 'cause you need protein.

17
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:49,952
I'll have the lamb.

18
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:53,680
Okay, new goal:

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,393
I want our wedding
to kick her wedding's ass.

20
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,846
I want our wedding
to take her wedding's head

21
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:01,523
and shove it in the toilet
and flush it, like,20 times.

22
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:05,026
Ted, in high school,
you were her wedding, weren't you?

23
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:09,887
You know,she's always trying
to one-up me. I mean, I love her, but,

24
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:12,784
there's a part of me that kinda wishes
this whole thing would just fall apart.

25
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:15,036
I hate him. I hate him!

26
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:17,455
I hate him.
God, this steak is so good!

27
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:19,290
Four days to go and he just runs off

28
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,319
with the vitamin consultant
from Whole Foods?

29
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,500
I gave up makeup for him.
I gave up showering for him.

30
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,297
I gave up shaving my armpits for him.

31
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,946
Hard to imagine
where it all went wrong.

32
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:31,961
Now it's so close to the wedding...
There's like bacon or something

33
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:34,288
in this dipping sauce. I love it.
I can't get any refunds.

34
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:36,307
I'm gonna be out
thousands of dollars.

35
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,059
<i>Kids, when you're in a relationship,</i>

36
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,770
<i>you develop a kind
of telepathy with your partner.</i>

37
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:42,495
<i>What do you think?</i>

38
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:43,982
<i>We could help her out.</i>

39
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,491
<i>No, Stella,</i>

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,672
<i>we should help her out.</i>

41
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,294
<i>Let's pay for dinner.</i>

42
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,415
Nora. Don't worry.

43
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:55,789
We got this.

44
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:58,054
That's right.
We'll take over your wedding,

45
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:00,003
pay you back
for everything you spent.

46
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:01,916
Ted and I will get married
this Sunday.

47
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:07,449
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

48
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:24,481
We're getting married this Sunday?

49
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,566
Are we sure we're ready for this?

50
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:29,660
Ted, I wasted years
trying to get Lucy's dad

51
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,905
to decide he was "ready" for this,

52
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:35,234
but he never got ready for this.
That's why we never got married.

53
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:37,668
Come on, let's just be spontaneous.

54
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:40,872
I used to dream that Tony
would be spontaneous like this.

55
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,832
Okay, I'm in.

56
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,418
And I'm also... spontaneous.

57
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,549
I wish I hadn't done that.

58
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:56,080
<i>Kids, morals usually
come at the end of stories,</i>

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,792
<i>but this one is so important,
I'm gonna tell you now:</i>

60
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,643
<i>Don't ever, ever
invite an ex to your wedding.</i>

61
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:05,230
<i>If someone had given me that advice,
well, it'd've changed everything.</i>

62
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,732
Come on, you've got to come,
it's my wedding.

63
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:09,727
I can't. I'm in Tokyo.

64
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:13,098
It's my first week on the job.
I can't just take off.

65
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:16,582
Plus, I'm finally
doing serious news.

66
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,953
<i>Robin was doing serious news.</i>

67
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:22,789
<i>It was the number one
English news network in Japan.</i>

68
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,240
<i>Of course, the news was
a little different over there.</i>

69
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:31,499
The Federal Reserve Board voted
to leave interest...

70
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:33,925
rates unchanged.

71
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,704
It's my wedding.
You have to be there.

72
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,180
Okay. I'll be there.
I gotta go.

73
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,855
Good evening.

74
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,063
And I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

75
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:50,600
Peace talks were stalled once again
in the Middle East.

76
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,082
Despite a promising start
in the latest negotiations,

77
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,049
talks foundered on security issues.

78
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:58,639
She's in.

79
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,768
All right,
your bachelor party, tonight.

80
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,375
I have got three of the most
physically and morally

81
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,893
flexible exotic dancers
you've ever seen...

82
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,001
- There's no time.
- I'll let you know how it goes.

83
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:11,599
We should really rent
the cars for tomorrow?

84
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,186
- What?
- No, "Don't get married, Ted"?

85
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:21,861
No, "You're making
a big mistake, Ted"?

86
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,308
Barney Stinson...

87
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:27,312
are you no longer committed
to the war on marriage?

88
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,184
No, I just know
a hopeless cause when I see it.

89
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,949
It's the same reason
I don't recycle.

90
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,130
Plus, Ted getting married

91
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,137
is in my best interest.

92
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,610
You see...

93
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,821
Lately I've been working on a problem
of the utmost importance.

94
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:45,394
I confess I was stumped.

95
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,712
Until one night I decided
to tackle it once and for all.

96
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,610
Then, at last,

97
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:06,476
I cracked the code.

98
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:15,568
- So you're back on Robin.
- Hopefully.

99
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:19,864
I mean, this weekend is the best chance
ever to hook up with her again.

100
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,992
You'll never pull it off.
There's too many distractions.

101
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:25,388
The first drunk bridesmaid you see,

102
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:28,623
you'll have your head under her dress
like an old-time photographer.

103
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:30,875
Lily, don't cheapen this.

104
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:34,874
I don't want to sound all
mushy-gushy and romantic,

105
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:38,257
but this weekend,
Robin is the only woman I'm banging.

106
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,594
<i>And so, the day before our wedding,</i>

107
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:44,681
<i>Stella and I made the trip up
to Shelter Island.</i>

108
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,225
<i>With everyone else not far behind.</i>

109
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,644
- Zitch dog.
- Z... Zog...

110
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:55,248
This isn't exactly
where I pictured Ted getting married.

111
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,277
"The Namaste Yoga
and Meditation Collective."

112
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:00,947
I don't know about you, but Nama-stay
here any longer than I have to.

113
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,702
Sweetie,
go check in with that dirty hippie

114
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:07,900
over there
and we'll get some drinks.

115
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:12,917
What scotches you got?

116
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:16,421
Here at the center,
we have a very strict no-alcohol policy.

117
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:20,745
Great, and all the meals
are included, right?

118
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:23,428
And they're all 100% vegan.

119
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:27,499
I need alcohol.

120
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:30,268
I'm not gonna get Robin
with this stuff.

121
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,760
Look at this.

122
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,431
Berry Blaster Brain Revitalizer.

123
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,353
My God, some of these drinks
could actually make a girl smarter.

124
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:40,402
What sort of hell
has Ted brought us to?

125
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:43,197
- There's no meat.
- There's no alcohol.

126
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,413
It gets worse:
I'm 90% sure that guy

127
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,483
you were talking with used to be
lead singer of the Spin Doctors.

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,540
Hey, guys,

129
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,293
Stella and I have a little problem.

130
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:57,295
The programs look great.

131
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,965
I mean, it's not our names on the front,
but otherwise, really nice.

132
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,347
I talked to Robin.

133
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:06,137
She's running a little bit late,
but she'll be here just under the wire.

134
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,182
- You invited Robin?
- Yeah, of course.

135
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:12,977
You never told me that.
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

136
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,031
Can I help?

137
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,689
You feel glad.

138
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,898
- You like Robin.
- Yeah, but

139
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:21,539
she's your ex-girlfriend.

140
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,083
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.

141
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:24,227
It's weird.

142
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:27,325
You don't get what it's like for a bride
to see her groom's ex at their wedding.

143
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:34,040
Your new husband used to nail me,
like, three times a day.

144
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:38,628
Having exes around,

145
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:41,047
I don't know, it brings up...

146
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:42,965
unresolved things.

147
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:46,719
How do you know that spark won't come
back with your ex sitting out there?

148
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,182
Come on, we're just friends. Plus,
Robin and I already had our backslide

149
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,748
last Thanksgiving,
not even that long ago.

150
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:55,228
Did you place a large bet
against yourself in this argument?

151
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,503
She already got her ticket.

152
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:01,786
It's important to me.
I would never invite Lucy's dad.

153
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:04,529
I wouldn't care if you did.
Tony's great. Let's invite him, too.

154
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:07,857
Tony is the last person
I want at our wedding, okay?

155
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,537
And Robin is a close second.

156
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,493
Robin's probably
about to get on the plane.

157
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,876
Plus, she left
a really important job for this.

158
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:21,434
Spurred by environmental concerns

159
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:23,887
and high gasoline prices,

160
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:28,636
sales of hybrid vehicles have risen
11% over the previous year.

161
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,429
What should I do?

162
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:33,391
I don't know.
I kinda get the no exes thing.

163
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,559
Why ask a failed romance to come
and watch your successful one?

164
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,392
It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners
to a World Series game.

165
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:41,080
It's weird for everyone.

166
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,734
What? Robin has to come.

167
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,736
Right, she's, like, my best friend.

168
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:48,614
Female friend.
My best female friend.

169
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,117
I don't care, why fake it.

170
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:55,204
- Dude, Robin has to be here.
- She shouldn't come.

171
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,915
- What are you talk...
- Justice Aldrin, tie-breaking vote.

172
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:04,630
Wouldn't feel right without Robin.
But you don't mess with the bride.

173
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:09,698
- I'm gonna tell her not to come.
- It's the right decision, Ted.

174
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,763
This is gonna be, like, the worst
phone conversation of all time.

175
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,641
Co-best man, I'm on it.

176
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:23,566
- Hello?
- Where are you?

177
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,544
Just heading to the airport.

178
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:28,446
We'll see you soon.
Have a great flight.

179
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:33,478
Bad news.
I couldn't reach her.

180
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:35,286
Robin's already on her way.

181
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,419
Robin's on her way.
You know what, I'm glad.

182
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:46,011
Exes should be allowed
to come to weddings.

183
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:48,238
I'll just tell Stella
she's got to deal with it.

184
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:51,844
You need to be more delicate with Stella
about this whole Robin thing.

185
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:54,902
- What do you mean by delicate?
- Brides are under a lot of stress

186
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:56,073
before a wedding.

187
00:09:56,193 --> 00:09:58,809
I mean, of course,
I held it together pretty well.

188
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,312
You don't remember?

189
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:08,291
The florist just told me
the roses are more light medium-pink

190
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:09,854
than medium-pink.

191
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:13,157
Light medium-pink!
Everything's ruined.

192
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,874
Our wedding site uses
a gravity furnace

193
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,807
instead of forced-air heating.

194
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:23,909
That's the one thing I cared about.
Why are we even getting married?

195
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,055
After a while, it's all noise.

196
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:40,517
Poor Stella's had to jam months
of crazy into just three days.

197
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:43,591
- So what do I do?
- You wait for the next crisis,

198
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,475
you solve it, you're a hero.

199
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:48,817
Then you bring up the Robin thing,
but this time she'll say yes.

200
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:51,404
But what if there's no next crisis?

201
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:55,241
She's a bride.
There will be a next crisis.

202
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:00,538
- There's an next crisis.
- Awesome! What is it?

203
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,292
My daughter, my own daughter
isn't coming to our wedding.

204
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:05,454
What?

205
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,475
Tony's supposed to drive her up
tomorrow, but now he's being all petty

206
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:10,634
about me getting married,
and he won't do it.

207
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,634
It's been five years.
Why can't we just move on already?

208
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:16,678
So first thing tomorrow,
I drive down, talk to him,

209
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:20,557
get him to let me drive Lucy up,
then, boom, crisis solved.

210
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:22,852
Stella's happy.
Robin comes to the wedding.

211
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,023
- You Barney?
- Yes.

212
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:29,358
I hear you're a real man whore,
so listen up.

213
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:33,326
Tomorrow night, I want to do things
so dirty and so depraved

214
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:35,913
that I forget that this was supposed
to be my wedding.

215
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,909
I'm kind of here with someone.

216
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,296
Bring her.

217
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:42,999
You're never gonna make it.

218
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,280
<i>So, the morning of my wedding day
I made the trip back</i>

219
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:48,544
<i>to Tony's house</i>

220
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:49,771
<i>to get Lucy.</i>

221
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,719
Doing a little karate?

222
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:00,889
Sorry, sorry, man.

223
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,559
You set off my internal defense alarm.
You got to watch these things.

224
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,562
- Stay alert, stay alive.
- Right.

225
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,107
So what brings you here?
I thought you'd be off

226
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,359
in some honeymoon suite
with my woman right now.

227
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:13,068
Not yet. Soon.

228
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:15,373
That's right, tonight's the night.

229
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:16,696
Oh, man,

230
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:19,575
you are going to be sticking it
to the mother of my child.

231
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:22,107
Actually, I've already stuck it
to her plenty of times.

232
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:24,131
Why do I always have
to correct people?

233
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,531
You and Stella.

234
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,226
You lucky dog. I could just...

235
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,215
I'm so happy for you, guys.

236
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,666
Listen, here's the thing...

237
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:40,857
- You can't take her.
- Tony, stop.

238
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:43,954
This is a big day for Lucy, too.

239
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:46,023
You're going to have
to put aside your own issues

240
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:48,938
and think about what's best for her,
here. Whether you like it or not,

241
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:51,323
she really should be at
her mother's wedding.

242
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:52,775
I'm taking Lucy with me.

243
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:58,781
You're right, man.

244
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:00,256
You're right.

245
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:03,129
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...

246
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:05,096
seeing you guys...

247
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,290
has made me realize
everything I had.

248
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,508
Let's stop hugging.

249
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:14,389
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,737
Lucy means the world to me.

251
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:21,378
I feel like I'm losing her to this new
family, a family I'm not even a part of.

252
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:24,515
- Come on, sure you are.
- I wasn't even invited to the wedding.

253
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:25,975
You are now.

254
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:31,831
Road trip.

255
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:33,983
Right?

256
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:39,825
"Road Trip 2. Back in the Car".

257
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,286
Today's the day. You hydrating?

258
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:49,414
Dear female, thank you
for your interest in Barney Stinson...

259
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:52,001
Your back is going to look like
a Jackson Pollock.

260
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:55,525
I regret to inform you
that at this time...

261
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:58,674
I was a vegan for two years.
I need meat.

262
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:02,011
There are currently
no positions available.

263
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:05,526
I'm a yoga instructor.
Every position is available.

264
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,310
Your room, 20 minutes.
No foreplay.

265
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,101
- I'm not going to make it, am I?
- Not a chance.

266
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,115
- Remember, let me talk to Stella first.
- Mommy!

267
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,074
Ted invited Daddy!

268
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,679
Hi, sweetie. I missed you.

269
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:30,873
Give me just a sec, okay?

270
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,837
You invited Tony?
To our wedding?

271
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:40,697
We talked about this.
No exes at our wedding.

272
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:43,223
- Why would you do this?
- Oh, boy.

273
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,278
What did Ted do this time?

274
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:54,445
What is Robin doing here?
I thought I made myself clear.

275
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:56,023
No exes at our wedding.

276
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,202
To be fair...

277
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,070
- your ex is here.
- You invited him!

278
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,447
- Come on, it's not weird.
- It is weird.

279
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:06,116
It's like things are not finished
between you two.

280
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:08,145
And Tony...

281
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:10,661
I can't deal with Tony now.
Can you please go out there

282
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:13,395
and tell him to leave?
You can make me the bad guy.

283
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:16,418
I'll go talk to Robin,
so she knows it's nothing personal.

284
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,130
<i>And, kids, if I had just let
Stella talk to Robin,</i>

285
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,176
<i>this whole story might have
ended differently.</i>

286
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:25,719
I understand.

287
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:27,942
I get it.

288
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:32,017
<i>For the first time,
Ted and Stella Mosby.</i>

289
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,507
<i>And that's how I met your mother.</i>

290
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,601
Is your dad finally done yakking?

291
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,938
Now, come on, who wants ice cream?

292
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:43,232
<i>But I didn't.</i>

293
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:46,247
Can you talk to Tony?
Robin flew all the way here from Tokyo.

294
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:47,670
I should talk to her.

295
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:49,868
Sure.

296
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:58,990
- Sorry about running off like that.
- It's okay.

297
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,241
You would not believe the trip I had.
I was on a plane for almost a full day.

298
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:06,343
It's worth it to see you get married.
How could I not be here...?

299
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,428
- You can't come to the wedding.
- Thank God!

300
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:09,471
What?

301
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:11,973
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.

302
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:15,394
It is weird. Do you know how it feels
to be somebody's ex at their wedding?

303
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,813
Suck it, bitch! I win!

304
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,653
We broke up over a year ago.

305
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:27,088
Yeah, but that's not that long ago.

306
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:29,138
Watching your marry another woman

307
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:31,744
isn't exactly something
I was looking forward to.

308
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,656
I don't know, I just thought
if I ever changed my mind about

309
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,476
marriage and kids, it was...

310
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,002
it was nice to know
that you were there.

311
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:42,337
So, I was your safety school.
How flattering.

312
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:45,434
- That's not it. It's just that...
- Why are you bringing any of this up?

313
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:48,010
- There's nothing between us anymore.
- Maybe there is.

314
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:52,091
I mean, of course there is.
That kind of stuff

315
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,600
doesn't disappear without a trace.

316
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:57,728
I'm not just another guest here.

317
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,991
Right. We used to date, but...

318
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:02,790
we both moved on.
And, look, we got what we wanted.

319
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,505
I'm getting married,
you got your dream job in Tokyo.

320
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,921
- And they all lived happily ever...
- I quit my job.

321
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:10,366
- You what?
- I'm moving back to New York.

322
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,962
I thought I wanted that job, but...

323
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,038
I want to come back to my real life.

324
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,416
And I think you should
go back to yours.

325
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,235
What's that supposed to mean?

326
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:26,340
Don't get married.

327
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,695
Look, you're rushing into this.

328
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,138
It's like you're trying to skip ahead
to the end of the book.

329
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:35,203
You're the most romantic guy I know.

330
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:37,445
You stole a blue French horn for me.

331
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,019
You tried to make it rain.

332
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,211
- I did make it rain.
- It was a coincidence.

333
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:45,856
But after all that, this is how your
great romantic quest comes to an end?

334
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,647
You're just disappearing
into someone else's wedding,

335
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,074
someone else's house, someone
else's life without a second thought.

336
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:56,093
That's not the amazing ending
that you deserve.

337
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:58,532
That's not Ted Mosby.

338
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:04,628
I love Stella.

339
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:07,089
She's the one.

340
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,904
If you really feel that way...

341
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:13,889
I guess it's a good thing you're not
coming to the wedding after all.

342
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,982
- Big fight?
- Yeah.

343
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:27,417
Here...

344
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,261
It's on the house.

345
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,320
Just keep 'em coming.

346
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,764
God, do not keep them coming.

347
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:46,670
I am having a horrible day.

348
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,424
I snuck some scotch in from the duty
free store. You want to join me?

349
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:53,224
Let's go to your room.
Far away from this room.

350
00:18:53,344 --> 00:18:56,585
- And we can knock it back.
- They didn't get me a room.

351
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,807
I was actually hoping
I could stay with you.

352
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,904
No problem.

353
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:04,054
I just have to straighten up
a little bit.

354
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:06,402
I've got some clothes
on the floor, and...

355
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,026
And a naked girl tied
to your headboard.

356
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:11,278
Towels all over the bathroom.
It's a mess.

357
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:14,656
So, anyway...
Give me ten minutes

358
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,241
- to get the place in order...
- See ya, Barney.

359
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,256
Okay, let's do this.

360
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:33,605
Who the hell is that?

361
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:37,040
It's the girl from the front desk.

362
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:48,897
<i>Kids, sometimes you think
you're living out one story,</i>

363
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:52,620
<i>but the truth turns out
to be something else entirely.</i>

364
00:19:58,504 --> 00:19:59,933
<i>At the time I thought the story</i>

365
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:02,430
<i>was about whether Robin should be
at the wedding.</i>

366
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,382
<i>If only I'd understood
what the real story was.</i>

367
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:25,060
Having exes around...
I don't know, it brings up

368
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:27,312
unresolved things.

369
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:34,403
How do you know that spark won't come
back with your ex sitting out there?

370
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,705
Like things are not finished
between you two.

371
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:45,937
I wasted years trying to get
Lucy's dad to decide

372
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:47,583
if he was ready for this.

373
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,162
Seeing you guys...

374
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:52,582
It's made me realize
everything I had.

375
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:56,091
I used to dream that Tony would be
spontaneous like this.

376
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,288
<i>Seriously, kids,</i>

377
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,397
<i>never invite an ex</i>

378
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:07,017
<i>to your wedding.</i>
