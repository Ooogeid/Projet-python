1
00:00:01,237 --> 00:00:05,179
<i>Kids, the day you get married's supposed
to be the happiest day of your life,</i>

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,942
<i>the perfect ending
to a perfect love story.</i>

3
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:10,532
<i>My wedding...
at least my first wedding...</i>

4
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:12,026
<i>didn't go so well.</i>

5
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:28,006
It's funny looking back on it now.

6
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:30,934
I was so sure Stella was the one.

7
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:33,974
And when she left me,
I was so devastated.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,490
But you guys got me through it.

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,634
And now the painful part's over.

10
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,754
I've come out the other side
a little bit stronger.

11
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:45,221
You know, I hardly
even think about her anymore.

12
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:47,634
That's what time does, I guess.

13
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,889
Ted, the wedding was yesterday.

14
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:55,517
It's been 24 hours.

15
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:56,745
I know.

16
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,561
And this is me, moving on.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,398
A great new chapter
of my life began today,

18
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,166
and we're gonna celebrate.
Right now, we need two things.

19
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:07,028
We need Kool, and we need the Gang.

20
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:09,304
It's jukebox time!

21
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:17,706
I look at that young man popping
and locking his way over to the jukebox,

22
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:21,075
and I think to myself, you know...

23
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,529
maybe Stella made the right call.

24
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:26,812
- Pain.
- How is he dancing right now?

25
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:30,495
He should... he should be smashing up
Stella's car with a sledgehammer.

26
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:32,504
Hypothetical.

27
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:34,389
Ted isn't pretending to be happy.

28
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,330
Ted really is happy. He never wanted
to get married in the first place.

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,754
Ted just pulled off the greatest train
dodge since <i>Stand by Me.</i>

30
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:45,567
Well, not the first kid,
but the other kids.

31
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:49,070
No, he is in bad shape.

32
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:51,190
What's up?

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,908
Really bad shape.

34
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:56,350
And we need to be there for him.

35
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,650
<i>But as much as my friends wanted
to be there for me,</i>

36
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,433
<i>I was, by all appearances, fine.</i>

37
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:04,753
- Hey, buddy.
- Want to hang out?

38
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:07,255
Guys, I'm fine.

39
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:12,224
- Hey, pal, you want to have a catch?
- I'm fine.

40
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:17,682
Hey, kiddo.

41
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:19,675
Barney, I'm fine.

42
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,227
This is not necessary,

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,189
and it's actually kind of weird.
No offense, ladies.

44
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:26,857
I did not realize you'd be home.

45
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,486
Ladies, to the stairwell.

46
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,583
Synchro: Arrow et mpm

47
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:47,274
<i>Finally, after two weeks,
the inevitable emotions boiled over.</i>

48
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:50,379
- You guys want to get some dinner?
- Oh, shut up.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,417
I'm sorry, sweetie.

50
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:55,804
It's just, Ted, you've been through
something traumatic,

51
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:59,590
and we're trying to be there for you
as friends, but you're not letting us,

52
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:02,302
and it's pissing us off,
you selfish bitch.

53
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,663
Sorry.

54
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:07,182
We're worried that you're not dealing
with this whole Stella thing.

55
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:10,693
Do you remember when Lily left me?
You remember how I held in my feelings?

56
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:15,342
I... miss... her so much.

57
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:19,506
Yeah, dude, you were a rock.

58
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,684
I should have been even worse, okay?

59
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:23,985
I should have gotten mad.
I should have taken your advice

60
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,875
and set all of Lily's stuff on fire.

61
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,252
Oh, nice... thanks, Ted.

62
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,463
But I didn't,
and I think that that's why

63
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,090
it took me so long to get better.
So, now, Ted...

64
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,842
I want you to explode.

65
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:35,836
Release the berserker.

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,798
Ready?

67
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:40,515
Now!

68
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,630
I'm good.

69
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,768
Guys, get off his back.
He's happy.

70
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:47,934
Listen, if Ted were
married right now,

71
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,177
he'd be married,
he'd be living in New Jersey,

72
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,653
and he'd be married.

73
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,181
He's fine.
Now, let's eat.

74
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:59,200
- How about Flat Michael's?
- No, that's 44th and Lex. Can't do it.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,193
- Why not?
- It's too close to Stella's gym.

76
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:03,348
Might run into her.
Anywhere else, though.

77
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,290
Okay, how about Hurley's?

78
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:09,168
Right between Stella's office
and her dry cleaners. No, sir.

79
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:11,671
Well, what about Meatloaf Charlie's?

80
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,798
Two blocks from Stella's
mother's hairdressers.

81
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:17,927
Well, geez, Ted, is there anywhere
in Manhattan we can go to dinner?

82
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,504
Of course.

83
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:21,222
Check this out.

84
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,076
- What you got there, Ted?
- A reference map I made for myself.

85
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:28,730
A New York guide to places you
might run into Stella Zinman.

86
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:31,221
Red areas are places to avoid.

87
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:32,604
White areas are safe.

88
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:33,735
Blue is water.

89
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,175
- That is just ridiculous.
- Well, water <i>is</i> blue.

90
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:39,104
You can't live that way.

91
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:41,882
She leaves you at the altar,
and you're the one avoiding her?

92
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:43,434
Yes, I'm avoiding her.

93
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:45,371
What's the big deal?
That's how we do it.

94
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,138
Who's we, gutless weenies?

95
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:50,710
No, "we" is people
from the great state of Ohio.

96
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,590
When life gives us pain, we Buckeyes
take that pain and we push it down.

97
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,928
And if the pain starts to come up again,
we push more pain down on top of it.

98
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:02,347
Why confront something
when you can avoid it, right?

99
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:04,731
All I have to do
is never see Stella again,

100
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:06,476
and I'll live a long, happy life.

101
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,209
- Who wants to get something to eat?
- Somebody just told me

102
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,148
about a tapas place
that's in the white zone.

103
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,163
Great. Let's go there.

104
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,927
- You ready to order?
- Not quite yet.

105
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,989
Can we get some of those
almonds for the table?

106
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:21,160
Certainly.

107
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,174
Nice call, Lily.

108
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,453
This place looks great.
Who told you about it?

109
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,824
You know, I don't remember.

110
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:31,397
What?

111
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:32,995
I just remember.

112
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:44,415
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

113
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:47,850
Okay, just be cool.
We're just gonna have to deal with this.

114
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,281
Everyone...

115
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,383
follow my lead.

116
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,525
- Oh, you're kidding.
- Is he serious?

117
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:57,937
I am not getting under this table.

118
00:05:58,255 --> 00:05:59,946
I'd maybe get under that table.

119
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:02,719
She's turning around.

120
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,872
Think, hink, think.

121
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,964
Everyone, just stay here.
I'm gonna go take a look.

122
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:14,653
Marshall, go take a look.

123
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:24,178
- And will you need utensils?
- No, I'm just going straight home.

124
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,683
She's placing an order to go.

125
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:31,319
Did she seem happy? Did
she say anything about me?

126
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,730
I don't even care.
Where are those almonds?

127
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,636
Gosh, where would Ted's nuts be?

128
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:37,984
Why don't you check
the vise in Stella's garage.

129
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:40,080
Go yell at her.

130
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,031
Ted, you may be from Ohio,
but you live in New York now.

131
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,415
We don't push down
our feelings in New York.

132
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:48,327
We take our feelings and we shove them
in somebody else's face!

133
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:51,956
Spare me, Lily. You'd be doing the same
thing if you were in this situation.

134
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:53,203
That's outrageous.

135
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:57,128
There is not a person on Earth
I would hide under a table from.

136
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,382
Oh, really, not a single person?

137
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,713
Not even...

138
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,028
Gasser?

139
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:04,677
How dare you
mention that name to me.

140
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:05,997
Who's Gasser?

141
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:09,515
He's the last person I'd want
to see walk through that door.

142
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:13,061
Michael Sasser. He's a guy I went
to high school with.

143
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:16,104
<i>Michael sat next to me
in freshman biology.</i>

144
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:19,015
<i>He had been a bit of a loser
all through middle school,</i>

145
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,893
<i>but the summer before ninth grade,</i>

146
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,637
<i>he grew 12 inches
and joined the baseball team.</i>

147
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:27,017
<i>He was right on the precipice
of becoming one of the cool kids.</i>

148
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:28,656
<i>Until one day...</i>

149
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,331
Lily, we've all been there.

150
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,500
When you've ripped one,
it's not pretty.

151
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,012
- What did you do?
- Are you kidding?

152
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:39,997
This was ninth grade.

153
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,881
I only had one choice.

154
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:44,717
Oh, my God, Sasser.

155
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:46,219
Fart much?

156
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,930
No, it wasn't me.
It was her.

157
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:50,871
As if, Sasser.

158
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,612
More like Gasser.

159
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:53,893
Gasser!

160
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:59,857
I'm on the baseball team.
I'm cool.

161
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,736
The nickname Gasser stuck.

162
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:07,240
He got teased so much,
eventually he had to change schools.

163
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:11,397
- Kids are awesome.
- I've always felt awful about that.

164
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:14,067
But if Gasser... Michael...

165
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,800
walked in right now,

166
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:19,085
as hard as it would be,
I would go up to Gasser... Michael...

167
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:21,254
and I would resolve
things between us.

168
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,268
Right, clear the air, as it were.

169
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:25,159
Oh, man.

170
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,697
Those don't come around often.

171
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,720
Y'all are welcome.

172
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,640
Are you guys okay?

173
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,268
We're just gonna be eating
down here if that's okay.

174
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:38,479
- Here's your almonds.
- Thanks. You have any specials today?

175
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:40,623
Ted, this is ludicrous.

176
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:43,846
I am a person who...
well, let's just face it.

177
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,163
There are a lot of people
I don't want to see...

178
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:48,489
people of the
"chicks I banged" persuasion...

179
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,710
but if any of them
were to walk in here,

180
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,244
I would stand up, and I would look them
right in the eye.

181
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,872
Some of them
for the very first time.

182
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:58,833
Really, you wouldn't
hide from anyone?

183
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,210
Not even, say...

184
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:02,670
Becca Delucci?

185
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:04,797
You son of a bitch.

186
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,800
- Who's Becca Delucci?
- Do you mind?

187
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,099
So, who is Becca Delucci?

188
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,344
Becca is just this girl
who lives upstate.

189
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:17,268
I used to visit her now and again.

190
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:19,562
Where exactly upstate, Barney?

191
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:22,940
Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.

192
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:27,445
<i>And yes, the visits
were of a conjugal nature.</i>

193
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,364
No way, really?

194
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:31,544
Really.

195
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:34,933
And what I had with Becca
was a perfect relationship.

196
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:38,247
She was only allowed, by law,
to call me once a week.

197
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:41,542
If she ever got clingy,
the armed guards stopped her.

198
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,053
And I never had to pay for dinner.

199
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:46,088
Well, that's not true.
I pay taxes.

200
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,705
Then again, I guess we all paid
for dinner. Thanks a lot, guys.

201
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:50,635
Anyway, the last time I visited,

202
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:52,762
I kind of screwed things up.

203
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,847
I know it's hard, baby,

204
00:09:55,257 --> 00:09:57,371
but I'm in a prison, too.

205
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:59,560
A prison of my own heart.

206
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:03,135
Is that room ready yet or what?
Can we...?

207
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,526
You're the only thing
that's keeping me going here.

208
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:10,738
That's what I'm here for, baby.
I'm your rock.

209
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:13,532
I'm... Oh, my God.
Hello, strange.

210
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:21,052
Barney Stinson, attorney at law.

211
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:23,945
- Let's talk about getting you off.
- Hell, no!

212
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:38,621
Now I get letters from Becca
and she's all,

213
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:41,099
"I'm coming to get you
the day I get out of here.

214
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:43,561
I'm gonna hang your eyes
from my rearview mirror."

215
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,440
Women, huh?

216
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:48,397
See?

217
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,777
You're scared of Becca.
Lily's scared of Gasser.

218
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,763
We're staying under the table.

219
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:57,687
We don't have to.
Stella's gone.

220
00:10:57,863 --> 00:10:59,077
Oh, my gosh.

221
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:03,416
There, all done,

222
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:06,168
and that's how we do it Ohio style.

223
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,963
Problem showed up.
We avoided it. It went away.

224
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:12,072
- Now we can enjoy our meal in peace...
- She's back.

225
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,056
We all think that you need...

226
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:20,975
Wait, where's Barney?

227
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:30,007
- We {\all}think {\that}you need to go talk to her.
- I don't.

228
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,469
- What?
- If the lastperson

229
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,946
I wanted to see walked through the door,
I wouldn't say a {\damn}word.

230
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,406
- Really?
- And who's that?

231
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:36,699
My father.

232
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:40,119
You guys,
that other table is off the hook.

233
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,527
- What are we talking about?
- Robin's dad.

234
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:45,458
I haven't spoken to him in three years
and I don't intend to start now.

235
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:46,542
Why?

236
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,920
<i>It goes back to the day I was born.</i>

237
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,043
You give me my son now. Push.

238
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,972
He wanted a son and the fact that I was
a girl didn't change his plan.

239
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,237
What do you mean?

240
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:06,479
My full legal name is
Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr.

241
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:09,482
And it only gets worse from there.

242
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:12,894
<i>When I was eight,
he took me hunting for the first time.</i>

243
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:15,029
I don't want to shoot a deer.

244
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,113
Nonsense, R.J.

245
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,741
Shooting deer is
the noblest of pursuits.

246
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:20,701
But they're cute.

247
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,164
You said the same thing
about our rabbits.

248
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,384
Remember how delicious they were?

249
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:28,042
Over the years,
as my body developed...

250
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:29,335
Hold on a sec.

251
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,187
Sorry, go on.

252
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:36,384
It became harder and harder
for him to pretend I was a boy.

253
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,928
<i>The lowest moment came
when I turned 14.</i>

254
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,951
<i>My peewee hockey team had just
won the Squamish Invitational</i>

255
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,231
<i>and everyone came back
to my house to celebrate.</i>

256
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:47,645
You lads availed yourself splendidly
out there on the ice.

257
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:48,938
Splendidly.

258
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,390
You go on outside. I'll come back
with an assortment of soft drinks

259
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:55,069
and American pretzels.

260
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:00,866
I can't believe you missed
that last empty-netter, you hoser.

261
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:03,369
- You're the hoser.
- No, you're the hoser.

262
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:12,609
What are you doing?

263
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,798
You're teammates, hockey players.

264
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,199
Teammates don't kiss!

265
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,254
Hockey players don't kiss!

266
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:25,572
Oh, my God.

267
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:28,104
I have no son.

268
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,716
You poor thing.

269
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:36,497
To have to grow up in Canada

270
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:38,446
with America right there.

271
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:41,354
That sucks about your dad, Robin,

272
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,826
but congratulations on that game.

273
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,933
And Kyle and I weren't even
doing anything serious.

274
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,415
- We only went to the blue line.
- The blue line?

275
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:53,625
You know how when you're a kid,
you put everything into hockey terms?

276
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:55,956
The blue line is kissing;
the red line is getting naked;

277
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:58,131
and I think "in the crease"
speaks for itself.

278
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:02,678
Anyway, after that, my relationship
with my dad pretty much went north.

279
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:05,419
I moved in with my mom,
grew my hair out,

280
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:08,100
became a Canadian pop star.
You know, normal teen stuff.

281
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,271
Don't you think it would feel better
to talk to him about all this?

282
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:15,231
That's the point.
It wouldn't solve anything.

283
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:16,942
It's in the past. It's done.

284
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:21,565
I mean, what would I even say to him?
"I wish you hadn't raised me as a boy"?

285
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:23,983
"I wish you hadn't taught me
how to hunt

286
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,414
"and fish and smoke cigars
and drink Scotch

287
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,374
"because that's not what girls do.

288
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:32,163
"And you know the reason I throw like
a girl, Dad, is because I am a girl."

289
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,793
You held onto that
for a long time, huh?

290
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:41,966
It really messed you up.

291
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,018
- I'm sorry.
- That's hot.

292
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,593
<i>And then I realized...</i>

293
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,065
<i>all of my friends were haunted,</i>

294
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,377
<i>but there was a difference
between my ghost and theirs.</i>

295
00:14:58,226 --> 00:14:59,818
<i>It wasn't too late for me.</i>

296
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,404
I'm gonna go talk to her.

297
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:09,705
She's gone.

298
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:12,198
- I'm going after her.
- Go, go.

299
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:15,942
There she goes!

300
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:26,213
I see her. She's two cabs ahead
on the right. Just stay with her, okay?

301
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,597
Finally. Finally, you're doing this.
You're going to confront her.

302
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:31,600
I am going to confront her.

303
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,257
- This is so exciting.
- Totally.

304
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:35,635
- What are you going to say?
- I'm gonna say,

305
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:38,899
"I'm sorry things didn't work out."

306
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:44,838
We're gonna talk about this like adults.
She can tell me her side and...

307
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:48,575
I'm going to listen. Probably should
have done a little more of that before.

308
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:51,912
Driver, can you run us into the nearest
lamppost? Everyone, buckle up. Not you.

309
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:55,228
You got to get mad right now.

310
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,189
Come on. Dig deep.

311
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:59,375
Dude, come on. This isn't
about me waving my arms,

312
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:02,464
stamping my feet and getting really mad.
This is about Stella and I

313
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,966
finally communicating.
I mean, clearly, that was...

314
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:08,281
Stella hated Star Wars.
She lied to you.

315
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,015
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

316
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:13,475
That's her business.

317
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:16,395
Come on, Ted.
She left you at the altar.

318
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:18,108
I don't understand!

319
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,691
- In the name of all that is sacred...
- Wait, wait!

320
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:24,016
Where is she going? Her cab just missed
the turn for the Lincoln Tunnel.

321
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:25,683
Why would anybody buy takeout food

322
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:28,031
and bring it all the way back
to New Jersey anyway?

323
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,534
- Maybe she's going to her office.
- No.

324
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,532
The waiter asked her,
"Will you need utensils?"

325
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:35,623
Then she said,
"I'm just going straight home."

326
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:38,635
But if she's going home,
why are we still heading...?

327
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:40,328
Oh, my God.

328
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,095
Tony lives downtown.

329
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:44,575
"Home"

330
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,342
is Tony's apartment.

331
00:16:46,502 --> 00:16:49,094
She was going to make me
move to New Jersey

332
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:52,264
and then she moves
into the city with Tony?

333
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:54,391
Son of a bitch!

334
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:56,769
Finally. Finally, buddy.

335
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:00,094
- I am so angry right now!
- I know, and I love it!

336
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,238
That is awesome!
Sir, we'd be happy to cover

337
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,029
the cost of that window crank.

338
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:08,869
I love angry Ted!

339
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:10,156
So do I!

340
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:14,786
- Get it out, baby. Let it out.
- She's stopping.

341
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:17,580
- It is on. It is on!
- Yes, Ted.

342
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:20,852
- Go get her, buddy!
- Go get rid of your demons!

343
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:23,199
- My leg is asleep!
- Okay, wait.

344
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,381
- Wait...
- What are you doing?

345
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,543
Hold on.

346
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:29,544
Look, Ted, it's great

347
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:32,142
- it's great that you're angry {\right}now.
- It sure is.

348
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,979
And that you're finally dealing
with this, but...

349
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,002
you only get one shot here.
Let's just take a beat,

350
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,061
and think about what
you're going to say.

351
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:43,816
I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

352
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:55,995
You picked the wrong guy.

353
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:01,166
You picked the wrong guy.

354
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,290
You made a really,

355
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:05,828
really,

356
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,798
really bad choice.

357
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,635
What were you thinking?
That guy?

358
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,820
Are you kidding me?

359
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:17,140
Have you learned nothing
in the last eight years?

360
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,949
You're just gonna regret this.
You know that, right?

361
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:21,724
You are going to regret this,

362
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:24,857
and now there is nothing you can do
about it because it's too late.

363
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,433
All you can do now is go up there
and start your crappy,

364
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:31,136
disappointing life

365
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,949
that will never be nearly as happy
as the one you could have had with me.

366
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:38,577
Good-bye.

367
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:40,481
- Ted, wait.
- Look,

368
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,583
I am not here to win you back.

369
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:46,595
I am here because I need to know
that you know

370
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:49,465
you made the biggest mistake
of your life.

371
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,092
I know.

372
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,447
Good.

373
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,893
That's what I'm gonna say.

374
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,394
Dag!

375
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:05,522
- Cold-blooded.
- That's good. Go say that.

376
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:09,594
Thanks.

377
00:19:10,354 --> 00:19:13,096
<i>So I got out of the cab,
ready to say all of that stuff,</i>

378
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:14,459
<i>ready to explode</i>

379
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:15,699
<i>but then...</i>

380
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:16,865
Mommy!

381
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:23,460
<i>It all just went away.</i>

382
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,638
<i>And that was it.</i>

383
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:31,673
<i>In that moment,
I wasn't angry anymore.</i>

384
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:35,177
<i>I could see Stella was meant
to be with Tony.</i>

385
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:39,436
<i>Kids, you may think your only choices
are to swallow your anger</i>

386
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:41,382
<i>or throw it in someone's face.</i>

387
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,236
<i>There's a third option:</i>

388
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,870
<i>you can just let it go,</i>

389
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:48,762
<i>and only when you do that is it
really gone, and you can move forward.</i>

390
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:53,162
<i>And that, kids, was the perfect
ending to a perfect love story.</i>

391
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:55,122
<i>It just wasn't mine.</i>

392
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,484
<i>Mine was still out there
waiting for me.</i>
