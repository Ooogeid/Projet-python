1
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,504
- I heard this great joke at work.
- Dude, come on.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,591
She's not gonna like it.
It's boy-funny. It's not girl-funny.

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,009
That is sexist!

4
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:12,366
Funny is funny, Ted.

5
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:14,388
Lily's cool.
She'll appreciate this.

6
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:17,841
- You're on your own, man.
- Just tell me the joke.

7
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:19,211
Okay. Ready?

8
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:21,866
Lily, what's the difference

9
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:24,106
between peanut butter and jam?

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,117
- See? It's funny.
- It's boy-funny.

11
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:29,528
- She's not gonna like it.
- Why don't you let me decide?

12
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,032
What's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?

13
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,411
<i>And then Barney said the punch line.</i>

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,515
<i>To this day,
it's still the dirtiest joke</i>

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>I've ever heard in my life.
And no, I'm not gonna say it.</i>

16
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:46,379
Yeah, I can't hang out
with you anymore.

17
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,714
Oh, come on.

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,249
That's a funny joke. That...

19
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:53,719
Told you.

20
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:55,388
She'll be back.

21
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:58,536
<i>And we didn't see Lily
for four weeks.</i>

22
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,247
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

23
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,698
<i>Kids, after getting laid off,</i>

24
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:16,742
<i>I was finally pursuing
my lifelong dream:</i>

25
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,161
<i>starting my own architecture firm.</i>

26
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,921
<i>All I needed was some clients.</i>

27
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:23,769
I think it's so great that
you're striking out on your own, Ted.

28
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:25,334
- I admire that.
- Thanks.

29
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:28,200
And thanks for being so cool
with me using the apartment.

30
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:30,625
Yeah, of course.
Anything you need.

31
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:34,510
Small thing, do you mind not watching
television during business hours?

32
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,860
- This isn't working!
- I'm sorry. It's just, I....

33
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:39,265
I can't concentrate
while <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> is...

34
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,600
A penny saved
is a Penny Marshall! Yes!

35
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:45,811
Ted, I know you're nervous,
but you've got to stop procrastinating.

36
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:49,929
You've spent the last two days choosing
the official pen of Mosbius Designs.

37
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:52,491
I've made some progress!

38
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:54,366
I've eliminated felt-tip.

39
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:58,200
Who am I kidding?
Felt's back in the ballgame.

40
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:02,288
Hey. You hear there's gonna be
more layoffs?

41
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:04,529
I know. I'm freaking out.

42
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:06,936
- Are you worried?
- Are you kidding?

43
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:10,523
The things I know about this company.
I won't ever be fired.

44
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,193
There's a pretty good chance one day

45
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,355
I'll wash up on shore
with no fingerprints or teeth,

46
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,676
but I won't be fired.

47
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:17,636
I wish I had your confidence.

48
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:21,849
Look, you just need a way to make
yourself absolutely essential.

49
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,351
Well, I work harder
than anyone in my division.

50
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,534
Yeah. Keeping your job has
nothing to do with hard work.

51
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,648
- You need a thing.
- What do you mean, a thing?

52
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,336
You know, something

53
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,778
that makes you fun
and well-liked, like Marcus Denisco.

54
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,631
<i>Marcus Denisco worked
in account services</i>

55
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,241
<i>and was perhaps the most expendable
employee at the company.</i>

56
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:42,578
I brought some donuts.
They're probably stupid.

57
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,455
<i>But eventually,
he came to be known as...</i>

58
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,373
Food Guy!

59
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,074
Who wants some pulled pork?
Of course you do! Come on!

60
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:51,837
I love Food Guy.

61
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,090
They could never lay him off.
You know what I love about Food Guy?

62
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,676
- He always has food.
- He always has food.

63
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,407
See? That's what you need.

64
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,972
You need that thing
that makes you a guy.

65
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,688
I have that thing
that makes me a guy.

66
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:06,972
Maybe even a guy and a half.

67
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:11,190
Not that thing.
You know, a thing. Like Toy Guy.

68
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,983
Guys, bad news.

69
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,390
As your HR rep,

70
00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:17,696
I got to review the new overtime
scheduling policy with you.

71
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,373
The good news is we're gonna do it
while wearing Wolverine claws!

72
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:26,455
Section 5A:

73
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,541
Overtime will no longer be paid

74
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,292
at time and a half.
This is awesome!

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
Claw five!

76
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,547
I love Toy Guy.

77
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,315
See? You need a thing.

78
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,008
Like YouTube Clip Guy.

79
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:46,684
You're right.

80
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:48,342
I do need a thing.

81
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:50,260
But choose wisely.

82
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:52,398
You don't want
to be Creepy Back Rub Guy.

83
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:56,360
Don't fill up. Food Guy's
got panna cotta in his office.

84
00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:59,113
Hey, buddy.

85
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:02,165
Hey, Douglas.

86
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:06,579
You're so tight.

87
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:10,288
I was relaxed about two seconds ago.

88
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:13,586
You're next.

89
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,424
Hi. Welcome to Mosbius Designs.

90
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:23,429
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm PJ, Mr. Mosby's assistant.

91
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,998
- What the hell is going on?
- I'm sorry. We do <i>not</i> interrupt

92
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:28,893
Mr. Mosby during
his brainstorming hour.

93
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,080
<i>It's okay, PJ. That's Robin.</i>

94
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,455
<i>She lives here.</i>

95
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,107
<i>I'm sorry for the disturbance, sir.</i>

96
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,989
Do you need anything else?

97
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:40,446
- I wouldn't say no to a cup of coffee.
- You're right there!

98
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:44,658
So now, Ted has an assistant
to help him not do anything.

99
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,209
PJ's been a huge help to me,

100
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,657
setting up the office,
designing the Web site.

101
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,374
And in return, I'm mentoring
a bright young mind.

102
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,376
Yes, the mentoring.

103
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,754
I want you to go outside
today and simply...

104
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:59,590
put your hands on buildings.

105
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:01,717
All right? Feel

106
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,596
the concrete pulse.

107
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:08,112
Listen... Listen to the stories
the stones are telling you.

108
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:11,769
And pick up my dry cleaning.

109
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,207
I will.

110
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:16,624
- Thank you so much, Mr. Mosby.
- All right.

111
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,738
This table just told me
you're a douche.

112
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,360
This whole mentoring thing
is just another way to procrastinate

113
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:30,480
- from actually calling clients.
- I'm not procrastinating.

114
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:33,278
I just... I want everything
to be perfect, okay?

115
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:34,833
I only get one shot at this.

116
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,901
Fine, but PJ is not helping.

117
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,908
If Ted says that PJ
is important to the company,

118
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:43,342
then PJ is not going anywhere.

119
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,177
See? He's very valuable.

120
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,055
PJ's a guy?

121
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:50,641
PJ's not some hot chick
you're banging?

122
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,393
No, I'm mentoring him.

123
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,390
Mentoring.

124
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:59,900
I mentored a young fellow once.
Even made him my wingman.

125
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,503
Then, one day, he hired an assistant

126
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,043
to work ten feet
from his bedroom who...

127
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:08,696
get this... isn't a hot chick,

128
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,123
proving he never listened
to a word I said.

129
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:13,163
And do you know
that young man's name?

130
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,284
Maybe. I don't remember.

131
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,051
Because he is dead to me!

132
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,507
PJ's gonna be getting
a very confusing card in the mail,

133
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:32,356
along with a garment
that he should by no means wear

134
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:34,935
for three days
and then mail back to me.

135
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,817
I thought of a "thing"
to make me more essential here.

136
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,904
I'm Eco Guy, 'cause everybody loves
a guy who recycles, right?

137
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,906
Fired. What else you got?

138
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:50,576
I thought of a few others:
Wacky Tie Guy.

139
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,037
- Fired.
- Daily Fun Fact Guy?

140
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:54,955
Did you know that you're fired?

141
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,374
I Know a Good Stretch for That Guy?

142
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,251
Downward-facing fired.

143
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:00,753
Monty Python Guy?

144
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,741
We are the knights who say...

145
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,016
You're fired.

146
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:06,628
Wait! Wait!
I did used to run

147
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,886
a fantasy baseball league
back in law school.

148
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:11,597
That's not bad.
You might be on to something.

149
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,670
Awesome. Awesome!
I'll be Fantasy Guy!

150
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,779
We'll have to make you Sports Guy.
We already have a Fantasy Guy.

151
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,054
- What's up, bros?
- Hey, Frank.

152
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:25,652
Hello?

153
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:29,382
Where are you?
You're never late.

154
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:33,736
You're on top
of the Empire State Building?

155
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,895
Listen to the old gal.
She's got some stories to tell.

156
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,183
Take all the time you need.

157
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:45,831
Wait a second.
"Ted Mosby Home".

158
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:50,677
Oh my God, the call is coming
from inside the house.

159
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:03,357
That's not
the Empire State Building.

160
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:11,156
Robin, you cannot sleep
with my assistant.

161
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,284
I'm trying to run a business here.
How did this even happen?

162
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:17,903
Well, at lunch, when you go
on your wisdom walks,

163
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:20,499
it gives me and PJ
some time alone together.

164
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:23,773
Inspiration... do your thing.

165
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,254
It always does, sir.

166
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:26,922
It always does.

167
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,637
Hey, PJ, I actually have
an architectural question for you.

168
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,264
How does Ted's ass taste?

169
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:39,096
I wouldn't know, but I assume
it tastes like genius.

170
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,316
Why is the bathroom locked?

171
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,902
Visitors need to sign in
for the bathroom key.

172
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,282
Listen, Peej, and I want you to think
this over real good

173
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,076
before you answer.
Are you telling me that I can't

174
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,370
go to the bathroom in my apartment?

175
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,851
I am telling you that you need
to ask permission

176
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,502
to use the bathroom in my office.

177
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,754
Why is that so hot?

178
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:12,141
There are billions
of guys in the world.

179
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,886
Why do you have to sleep with him?

180
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,680
Ted, when I get off work,
it's 5:30 in the morning.

181
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:18,807
Do you have any idea
what kind of guys I'm meeting?

182
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,523
I deliver newspapers. It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

183
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,192
Don't worry. I'll wash them
before I handle your business.

184
00:09:29,814 --> 00:09:33,410
I live with my mom.
At night, we watch TV in her bed.

185
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:35,407
We call it "Cuddle Club".

186
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:40,527
So, you, get up really early to trade
on the European stock exchanges?

187
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:42,122
What's that like?

188
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,041
Look, is this going
to happen or not?

189
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:48,219
Okay, first of all,
I've hung out with Fantasy Guy.

190
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,464
You could do a lot worse.
Secondly,

191
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,074
this has to stop.

192
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:54,384
Distracting PJ is going
to kill our productivity.

193
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,888
What productivity? You haven't
even called a single client.

194
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,096
Once I get the Web site up,

195
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:02,689
the brochures printed,
and figure out what trusts games

196
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:06,522
we're going to play at the corporate
retreat, I am making those calls.

197
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,981
Corporate retreat?

198
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,484
Mr. Mosby and I are going camping
on the roof.

199
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:16,156
Hey, Sports Guy. I hear people
are raving about your league.

200
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,346
It's a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

201
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:20,504
Between entry fees
and transaction fees

202
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,609
and penalty fees, I'm actually...

203
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,413
I'm holding on to a lot of money.

204
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:26,250
Great work, Sports Guy.

205
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,842
That's for last week.

206
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:32,891
<i>60,</i>

207
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,312
<i>80, a hundred.</i>

208
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:38,762
<i>This is $18,000 cash.</i>

209
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,149
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

210
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,016
<i>I'll just take it home
and put it somewhere safe.</i>

211
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,588
<i>Okay, just walking down the street</i>

212
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,563
<i>with some money in my pocket.</i>

213
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,964
<i>Don't touch the money.</i>

214
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,056
<i>That's so obvious.
Just be cool.</i>

215
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,198
<i>The baby's on to me.
Babies can smell money.</i>

216
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,448
Everyone knows that!

217
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,242
I'm carrying a lot of money!

218
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,889
Seriously, dude,

219
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:05,706
I'm not sure how much longer
I can keep doing this.

220
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:08,376
Marshall, last week you were trash

221
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,128
that no one wanted to look at.
Now, you're Sports Guy.

222
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:13,380
- I was trash?
- Last week!

223
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,592
There's Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.

224
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,768
How's the home office coming, buddy?

225
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:23,723
It was going great till Robin started
banging my assistant.

226
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,521
It's our apartment, okay? You leave
a big chocolate cake on the counter,

227
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:31,314
Mama's gonna cut her off a slice.

228
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:33,271
I told you.

229
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:36,082
Hire a cute assistant
that you can sleep with,

230
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:38,709
but instead you hire a cute assistant
that Robin can sleep with.

231
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:42,209
And of course he's gonna sleep with her.
She's the greatest woman on the planet!

232
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,274
I'm getting off topic!
You're an idiot!

233
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,330
That's my message!
You're an idiot!

234
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,992
One person storming off isn't enough!
Marshall, storm off with me!

235
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,596
Dude, why are this upset

236
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,015
about Ted not having sex
with the people he hires?

237
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,534
Because it hurts!

238
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,067
- It hurts you how?
- It hurts because I love...

239
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:12,439
Ted.

240
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:15,318
Having sex with women.

241
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,943
I'm a very dedicated wingman!

242
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,913
Look, Lily's the only person
that I can talk to about this stuff.

243
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:21,429
Just get her to talk to me.

244
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:23,358
I'll try, but there's no guarantees.

245
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:26,328
She's still really outraged
about that joke.

246
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,408
That joke.

247
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:31,583
Torn our little group apart,

248
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,959
pitted people I love
against each other.

249
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:35,659
Seriously, I wish...

250
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:38,715
I wish that joke had never come
into our lives.

251
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,995
- It's kinda of funny though, right?
- It's so funny, man.

252
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,798
Hey, good news, PJ.

253
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:50,310
The brochures you designed just came in.
Really interesting choice for the cover.

254
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,025
I like how instead of one
of my designs,

255
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,502
you chose this.

256
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,183
You know what?

257
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,442
I must've sent in the wrong photo.

258
00:12:58,728 --> 00:12:59,569
You think?

259
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:03,198
Look, PJ,
the Web site's still not done.

260
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,728
You didn't even show up
to the corporate retreat...

261
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,161
by the way, I saw a shooting star...

262
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,662
... and you're late every day.
I'm sorry, PJ. I gotta get focused.

263
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:15,335
- You're fired.
- You can't fire...

264
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,462
PJ, you're fired.

265
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,380
Fine!

266
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,299
Hey, baby.

267
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,521
I just got fired.

268
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:28,818
Yeah, I'll wait for you
at your place.

269
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:33,677
<i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

270
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,609
I love having all this free time
to spend with you.

271
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:41,984
I'm going to kiss you here...

272
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:43,701
And here.

273
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,487
And here and here.

274
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,159
And...

275
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,621
- One more.
- Please stop.

276
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:53,241
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll miss you.

277
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,934
I'll miss you, too.

278
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,716
- You're already sick of him.
- He's driving me crazy.

279
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:05,760
When PJ had a job, he was sexy.

280
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:07,803
He was guardian of the bathroom key.

281
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,088
A hot guy telling you
when you can and can't pee?

282
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,218
That's the dream.

283
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,278
"That's the dream"?

284
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:17,495
The dream?

285
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:19,991
Like what Martin Luther King
was talking about?

286
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,926
I have to end it, don't I?

287
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,987
I'm terrible at breakups.

288
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,449
I still have to go a little bit, but
I couldn't be away from you 1 s longer.

289
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:28,929
Listen...

290
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,329
Dude, I don't know.

291
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,348
- What?
- Yeah, it's just...

292
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:36,838
It's not really...

293
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,154
ix-nay, you know?

294
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:41,630
Ix-nay on what?

295
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:44,128
Not feeling it.

296
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:45,735
Not feeling what?

297
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,260
But friends and stuff.

298
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:49,509
My God, this is
the worst breakup ever.

299
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,198
You're breaking up with me?

300
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:55,206
If that's what you want,
I totally understand.

301
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,195
You still haven't activated that
shortstop the Mariners just brought up.

302
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,846
Got to have it.

303
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,374
See, Sports Guy!
People love you.

304
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,324
I can't be Sports Guy anymore, okay?
It's killing me!

305
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:12,202
I keep getting
these constant texts and e-mails

306
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,340
and phone calls
in the middle of the night.

307
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:16,915
Sometimes I even think
that I'm being followed.

308
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:20,098
Hey, buddy.

309
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,801
I need you to push that trade through,
so I can set my new lineup.

310
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:27,342
You really carry it
in your shoulders, don't you?

311
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,969
Seriously, it's over.

312
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,388
Do you want me to stop?

313
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,857
<i>With Robin and PJ broken up,</i>

314
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:39,813
<i>I was free to make
some staffing changes in the office.</i>

315
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,483
Welcome to Mosbius Designs.

316
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:45,944
You got to be kidding me?

317
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:47,904
<i>And now that PJ was back at work...</i>

318
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:51,449
You got to be kidding me?

319
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:56,246
So, apparently Robin and PJ
are an item again.

320
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,153
You got to be kidding me!

321
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,274
Are you all right?

322
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,726
Since Lily's not talking to me,

323
00:16:05,851 --> 00:16:08,842
there's something I have to tell you.
And this isn't easy to say, all right?

324
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,591
I'm... wait for it...

325
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:15,229
in... wait for it...

326
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:17,934
love... wait for it...

327
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:21,104
with... wait for it...

328
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:27,444
a... wait for it...

329
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,910
- certain... wait for it...
- I know that you're in love with Robin.

330
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,975
- What?
- Lily told me.

331
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,477
She told you?

332
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:36,811
Great.

333
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,041
I bet you guys have been laughing at me
behind my back the whole time.

334
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:44,501
Actually, in a weird way,

335
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:47,130
we both think you're kind
of perfect for each other.

336
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:48,798
You do?

337
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,212
Matter of fact,
we even try to sit on the same side

338
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,303
of the booth so you two
will have to sit together.

339
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:55,013
Really? That's so sweet.

340
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,001
But let's be clear.

341
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,686
I don't love her. Okay?
I just...

342
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:05,194
miss her when she's not around.
I think about her all the time,

343
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,771
and I imagine us one day running towards
each other in slow motion,

344
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,712
and I'm wearing a brown suede vest.

345
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:12,248
Are you ever gonna tell her
how you feel?

346
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:15,659
Maybe. Never. I don't know. Look...

347
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:19,879
I just need to get
that PJ idiot away from her.

348
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:22,928
If Lily were here, she'd know exactly
how to get rid of him.

349
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,211
- Maybe I can help.
- Marshall, you're no Lily.

350
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,990
Lily is a diabolical puppet master,
subtly manipulating

351
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,808
every situation to get
exactly what she wants.

352
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,427
She's pure evil, Marshall.

353
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:37,958
You got a good one there.
Hang on to her.

354
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,561
<i>Meanwhile, my bizarre tug of war
with Robin over PJ continued.</i>

355
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,552
I was about to go on my wisdom walk.

356
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:47,983
Want to join me?

357
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:52,461
I took the bathroom key
without asking.

358
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,364
What are you gonna do about it?

359
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:56,199
Look...

360
00:17:56,655 --> 00:18:00,245
you guys are both great.
But the truth is I'm taking another job.

361
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,832
These are for you.
Robin, I hope this letter

362
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,375
offers some closure.

363
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,684
I'm really going to miss you.

364
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,129
You can't trade Manny Ramirez
for two middle relievers!

365
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:15,565
If you veto that trade,
I am out of the league!

366
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,554
I'll figure it out.

367
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:23,105
Hire the kid to be a "paralegal".

368
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:26,688
He gets to do all the work,
and you still get to be Sports Guy.

369
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,232
Pure evil, Eriksen.
Pure evil.

370
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
You okay?

371
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,393
What if I don't think of the books?

372
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,042
Excuse me?

373
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,892
There's this famous architecture story
about an architect

374
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:51,936
who designed this library.

375
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,617
It was perfect.

376
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:56,749
But every year,
the whole thing would sink

377
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:58,470
a couple inches into the ground.

378
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,877
Eventually, the building
was condemned.

379
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,602
He forgot to account
for the weight of the books.

380
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,804
This company... it's just me.

381
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:13,817
What if I don't think of the books?

382
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,406
First of all, nobody goes to libraries
anymore, so who cares about that guy?

383
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,077
Secondly, you need to get
on the phone and start calling clients.

384
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,459
The longer I put off
starting my own firm,

385
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,273
the longer it can remain a dream

386
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:29,846
and not something I screwed up at.

387
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,212
It's like I'm giving up
before I even started.

388
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:36,044
You want to talk about giving up?

389
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,107
I used to describe my ideal guy as
"funny, smart,

390
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,898
"passionate, challenging".

391
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:44,343
And now, apparently,
I will settle for...

392
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:45,775
"in my apartment".

393
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,729
Didn't you think you'd have it
all more figured out by now?

394
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,273
Are you kidding? By 30,
I was gonna be annoyingly successful,

395
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:55,819
married to the perfect woman,
maybe a kid on the way.

396
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:59,562
Instead, I'm just some guy
sitting in his apartment,

397
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:02,087
having a staring contest
with his phone.

398
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,536
And losing.

399
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:08,832
You can take that thing.

400
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,632
Hi, this is Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.

401
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:32,021
I'm calling to inquire about any design
needs you may have now or in the future.

402
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,315
- That sounds great.
- Really? I sound confident?

403
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,649
- Now call an actual client.
- Great.

404
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,335
Hey, Food Guy!

405
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,000
Hey, Toy Guy!

406
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,064
Who's that guy?

407
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,879
He doesn't work here.
I think we should leave the building.

408
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,131
- Really?
- This has happened before.
