1
00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:04,924
<i>Kids, in the winter of 2009,
Robin and I had just become roommates.</i>

2
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:07,360
<i>And to be honest,
it wasn't going very smoothly.</i>

3
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:08,590
Oh, that looks good.

4
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:10,551
- I'm gonna get some.
- There's no more milk.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,720
- No, I just saw some in the fridge.
- Empty.

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,264
- So throw it out.
- The trash can's full.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,016
So take the trash out.

8
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:18,742
I'm eating cereal.

9
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:22,967
You know, when I asked you
to be my roommate, I figured,

10
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:25,336
"She's a girl, she'll be neat."

11
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:28,444
But no, you're Ogre
from <i>Revenge of the Nerds.</i>

12
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,574
You know what, Ted?
Instead of coming up with

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,198
hot off the press
topical references like that,

14
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:36,077
maybe you should spend
a little time,

15
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,772
I don't know...
washing a dish ever.

16
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:41,234
Darn, I can't.

17
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:44,459
I'm too busy leaving a plate
of cookies for the magical elf

18
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:46,407
who changes the toilet paper roll.

19
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:49,382
Wait, there's no elf.
It's always me!

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,509
I always change it.
You never do!

21
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,560
- That is ridiculous!
- No, I went in there yesterday...

22
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:57,398
Stop! Stop!
God, what is going on?

23
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,933
When we were dating each other,
we were practically

24
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:02,547
living together and we didn't
drive each other this crazy.

25
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:03,688
I know.

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,939
What happened?

27
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:06,746
You know what it is?

28
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:08,442
We were having sex.

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,049
Men and women need sex
to live together.

30
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:13,155
It solves all disputes.

31
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,825
Oh, like Barney's theory
about world peace?

32
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,468
So I explained to her.

33
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:20,967
I said, Madeline, every single
international conflict

34
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:23,787
essentially boils down
to sexual tension.

35
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:27,294
- Every international conflict?
- Every single one, dude.

36
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,631
So the crisis in the Middle East
could be solved by...

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,883
Gaza Strippers. Next.

38
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:34,301
Apartheid?

39
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,804
Apart thighs.
What else you got?

40
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:38,305
Cold War?

41
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,518
"Mrs. Gorbachev,
take down those pants."

42
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:46,321
Well,

43
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:48,590
guess we should just
start having sex, then.

44
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:50,259
Yeah, right.

45
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:54,381
I know.

46
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,743
It's like riding a bike, buddy?

47
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:58,962
Riding a bike upside down, maybe.

48
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,300
Okay, listen. If this
is gonna happen on occasion,

49
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:04,245
we can't tell anyone about this.

50
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:05,708
- Deal.
- Deal.

51
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,753
Deal.

52
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,784
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

53
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,187
What the hell are you guys doing?

54
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,189
Are you guys, like, back together?

55
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,025
No. We're just having sex
so we don't fight anymore.

56
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:35,279
That's a great idea.
No, really. Two thumbs up, guys.

57
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,198
Hey, I just looked into the future

58
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,492
and that works out
really great for everyone.

59
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:41,535
What are you even doing here?

60
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,475
I was on my way to work and I
just had to drop by here to...

61
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,917
read this magazine.

62
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:49,975
In...

63
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:51,786
that room over there.

64
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,422
Oh, I get it.

65
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,792
- No problem, buddy.
- Yes, a problem, buddy.

66
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:59,720
You came all the way over
here to read a magazine?

67
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:02,085
I'm willing to bet
that there is a place

68
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,480
to read a magazine at work.

69
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:07,186
You know, a room with
a little man on the door?

70
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,554
Okay, Robin. Come on.

71
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,201
Nobody likes to read
a magazine at work.

72
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,277
I mean, you walk out
of your office holding a magazine

73
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,075
<i>and that magazine is saying
one thing and one thing only.</i>

74
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:22,409
Hey everyone, look
at what Marshall's about to do!

75
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,296
Marshall's about to read
a big ol'magazine

76
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,204
in the bathroom
that you all share with him.

77
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,492
Well, have you thought about maybe

78
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:35,130
not reading a magazine
when you read a magazine?

79
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,069
You gotta read a magazine.

80
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,093
I mean,
that's why there's magazines.

81
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,136
Otherwise, it's time
you're not getting back.

82
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,177
Exactly.

83
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,147
And the worst part is this:

84
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:47,510
That stretch of hallway
from my door to that restroom

85
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:49,598
is... is a gauntlet of

86
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:51,730
judging eyes.

87
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:53,315
<i>You got my boss.</i>

88
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:56,626
<i>We all know exactly
what you're about to do.</i>

89
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,267
<i>Her boss.</i>

90
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:00,642
<i>Hey, Eriksen,</i>

91
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,741
<i>why don't you just
move your desk in there?</i>

92
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:05,619
<i>I-Can't-Believe-He-Has-A-Wife
Donald.</i>

93
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,759
<i>Oh, sweetie, so obvious.</i>

94
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:13,120
Anyways, I just would rather
do that here.

95
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,239
No, I'm sorry.
This is our apartment now.

96
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:19,631
Marshall, you have to read
a magazine someplace else.

97
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,636
- Give me your key.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

98
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,057
I seem to recall a deal being struck
between three parties

99
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:30,568
wherein none would discuss
a certain event

100
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:32,923
that transpired.
An event of the...

101
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,985
... persuasion.
That key, madam, buys my silence.

102
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:41,116
Good day to you both.

103
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,782
You two hooked up?

104
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,453
Thanks a lot, Lilly.

105
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,237
So...

106
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,507
You two...

107
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:52,874
slept together.
That is awf...

108
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:54,752
some.

109
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:56,404
Awfsome.

110
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:58,932
Nice work, Ted.
Tap that.

111
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,752
It sounds like
a bigger deal than it is.

112
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:04,205
Yeah, we talked it over
and we both realized

113
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,805
we've had a rough couple of months.
We deserve a little fun.

114
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,781
No.

115
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:10,100
This could wind up
ruining your friendship.

116
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:13,109
When two exes try
to "just be casual,"

117
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:15,463
someone always winds up
getting hurt.

118
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:17,127
<i>Turned out, Lily was right.</i>

119
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:18,635
<i>But more on that later.</i>

120
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,011
Guys, we've got this covered, okay?

121
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,739
No one's gonna get hurt.
We set up ground rules.

122
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:25,532
Okay, rule number one:

123
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,402
This is strictly
a physical relationship.

124
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,994
There are no feelings involved.

125
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,372
Please, that's like
telling the Fonz to be cool.

126
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:34,875
And since it's just physical,
we don't have to worry about romance.

127
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,344
Hell, no. We can do it
while we watch TV!

128
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,213
Totally!
And we can multi-task.

129
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,299
You know, use the sex to spice up
otherwise dull activities.

130
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,551
- Like folding laundry.
- Paying bills.

131
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,987
Cooking dinner.

132
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:48,764
- That doesn't seem hygienic.
- Yeah, not that one.

133
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,894
And now that we're hooking up,
we're not fighting anymore.

134
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,561
Problem solved.
Actually, the credit belongs to Barney.

135
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,189
This whole idea came out
of your thing about world peace.

136
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,702
Yeah. Thanks, Barney.
You were right.

137
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,304
Peace was achieved.

138
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:02,626
Repeatedly.

139
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,365
So I'm... I'm responsible for...

140
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,855
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.

141
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,458
Next round's on me!

142
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,505
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why do you ask?

143
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,550
Well, for one thing,
you're openly weeping.

144
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,835
With joy.

145
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,961
So happy for those two.

146
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:32,099
Barney, admit it.

147
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:35,477
You still have feelings for Robin
and this is killing you.

148
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:37,771
I am totally fine.

149
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,378
Now, excuse me for just a minute.

150
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:54,756
I'm totally fine.

151
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,916
You have to learn how
to express these feelings.

152
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,252
Maybe you should talk
to a psychiatrist.

153
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:01,696
Please.

154
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:04,260
If I'm gonna pay
so woman $200 an hour

155
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:07,311
to make me feel better,
we aren't going to be talking.

156
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,596
And we're both going
to be on that couch.

157
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,017
The woman in this scenario
is a prostitute.

158
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:20,314
A dirty, skanky, surgically
enhanced, Eastern European...

159
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,386
I got it.

160
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:24,937
There's something kind of liberating
about not taking it all too seriously.

161
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:26,776
Last night, we actually did it

162
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:28,906
while I was returning
a bunch of phone calls.

163
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,366
I knew you didn't
get a rowing machine!

164
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:36,739
Awesome,
we're still talking about this!

165
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:40,650
Look, guys, this is a private thing
between me and Ted.

166
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:41,794
Private Thing.

167
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,797
We wouldn't even be
talking about this

168
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,841
if Marshall could
read a magazine at work.

169
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,544
He's always been this way.

170
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,334
Remember law school?

171
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:52,596
Sure do.

172
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:56,791
Baby?

173
00:07:57,992 --> 00:07:59,186
Baby, what is it?

174
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:01,802
The credit card bill came today.

175
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,078
You checked into a hotel

176
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:07,402
two blocks from school on a Tuesday.

177
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,243
- It's not what you think.
- Who is she, Marshall?

178
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:11,636
What's her name?

179
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:13,881
Burrito.

180
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,050
Carnitas Burrito.

181
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:19,347
So, you checked into a hotel room

182
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:21,917
just so you could
read a magazine there?

183
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:25,143
Robin, do you want me to see if
the waitress has any giant sugar cubes

184
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,862
for that high horse of yours?

185
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,903
Nobody likes to read a magazine at work
and if they say that they do,

186
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:32,553
- then they're not human.
- Dude,

187
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,055
I read a magazine at work every day.

188
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,785
I can't tell you how many
meetings I've been late to

189
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,992
because I was busy
"reading a magazine."

190
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:42,354
But I don't feel bad about it.
That's my time.

191
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:45,917
Sure, "reading a magazine"
ain't pretty,

192
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:48,308
but, you know,
it's something I gotta do.

193
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:50,070
So why be ashamed about it?

194
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,075
Wait, "reading a magazine"
means masturbating, right?

195
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:01,123
I can't believe it.
You drank all my milk again!

196
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,061
- We can have sex.
- Okay.

197
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,713
It's the perfect set up.

198
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,785
Anytime we start getting
into an argument,

199
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,437
we just have sex instead.

200
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:14,547
One minute we're just laying into
each other, and then the next minute,

201
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,344
Well, same thing.

202
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,307
Awesome.

203
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,062
So, this morning, she's yelling
at me through the door,

204
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:26,225
"You're taking too long
in the shower!"

205
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,484
Next thing I know, she hops in.

206
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,915
Now baby don't mind I took my time.

207
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:34,948
So awesome.

208
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,330
Sorry I'm late.
I was just jammin'on Scherbatsky.

209
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:44,420
She used up all my stamps,
so long story short,

210
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:46,439
the postman rang twice.

211
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,420
You must bump this!

212
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:50,805
That's...

213
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:51,969
just...

214
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:53,538
so...

215
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:56,591
Excuse me for a second.

216
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:10,358
So, you're saying plasmas
are better for low light,

217
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,409
but LCDs are better for games?

218
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:16,156
Right, but the CRTs
have the truest blacks.

219
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:19,826
So, if I want a really crisp
contrast ratio...

220
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,133
The CRT's deep-pixel
cell structure produces

221
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:24,623
a resolution you just
can't match with an LCD.

222
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,292
I'll take the CRT.

223
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,048
Barney, this is nuts.

224
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,091
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

225
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:36,539
No, you're not.

226
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:39,096
You need to learn
to let this stuff out.

227
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,633
Like we do in my kindergarten class

228
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,767
"Feelings Hour"
every Tuesday morning.

229
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:46,745
Look, maybe your kindergartners
are upset that their friends

230
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,027
are sleeping with each other,
but not me.

231
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:51,691
I have never been better.

232
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,810
<i>Meanwhile,
Marshall was still struggling at work.</i>

233
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,532
Coming through.
Big breakfast this morning.

234
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,451
You know what that means.

235
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:04,437
<i>But then came the best news
he'd heard in a long time.</i>

236
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:05,661
And did you hear?

237
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:07,858
They laid off everybody
on the eighth floor.

238
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:10,378
I know.
It's a ghost town down there.

239
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,194
- Morning.
- Morning.

240
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,741
- That was fun last night.
- Word, that was a good one.

241
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,827
Mental note: don't throw out
the pizza box more often.

242
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,033
All right, see you later.

243
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,564
So last night, Robin left
a pizza box out on the floor,

244
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,389
- so we had sex three times.
- Sure.

245
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,019
And then, this morning
before I left for work...

246
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,929
- we kissed.
- That's weird.

247
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,021
That is weird.

248
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,009
Right?

249
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,769
That kiss violated the spirit
of our whole arrangement.

250
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:17,318
I mean, she probably thinks
I'm getting feelings for her.

251
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:20,155
- Are you?
- Yes, I'm in love with her.

252
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:24,263
Is what you...
That's you, dude.

253
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,454
No. It didn't mean anything.

254
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,472
It was just some leftover reflex
from when we were a couple.

255
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:32,453
But I think I probably blew it.

256
00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:33,794
Definitely.

257
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,021
It is so over.

258
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:40,217
Hold the phone.
Maybe Robin didn't think it was weird.

259
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,635
It was weird.

260
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,011
Weird, weird, weird, weird, weird.

261
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:47,015
W- I-E-R-D.
Weird.

262
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,143
- That's not how you spell "weird".
- Come on, Lily. Nobody likes a Ted.

263
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,392
I tried to warn you.

264
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:55,484
When exes relapse,
someone always gets hurt.

265
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:58,363
But no one listened.
Story of my life.

266
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:01,299
My cuteness interferes
with people hearing my message.

267
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:02,864
What should I do?

268
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,862
There's only one thing to do.

269
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:07,560
You have to stop
sleeping together, please.

270
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,706
I think we have to stop
sleeping together.

271
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,431
With me and Ted,
it's like cigarettes.

272
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,920
You have one when you're
drunk and you think it's fine.

273
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,588
But before you know it,
you're buying a carton a week.

274
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,507
I think I have to end it.

275
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:22,701
I have to end it.

276
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:23,906
So...

277
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:27,472
- We're ending it, huh?
- I think so, yeah.

278
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,599
It's probably for the best.

279
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,102
It was fun,
but I don't want things to get weird.

280
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,770
- Me neither.
- Roomies?

281
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:35,288
Roomies.

282
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,908
But we tell no one.
Deal?

283
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:43,842
- Deal.
- Deal.

284
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,740
- Dude!
- Come on!

285
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,846
What is the matter with you?

286
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,787
That one.

287
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,584
So, that didn't last long.

288
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,701
By the way, what were you doing
back in our apartment?

289
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:01,755
I thought you had
the perfect situation.

290
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:03,633
I did.

291
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,429
<i>Everything was going great.
I was feeling more comfortable,</i>

292
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,891
<i>more confident.</i>

293
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,179
<i>I felt I could take on the world.</i>

294
00:14:12,504 --> 00:14:15,437
<i>One morning, I took my magazine
down to the eighth floor.</i>

295
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,893
We gotta gut this whole place.
I need these walls taken out

296
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:27,240
- here... and here.
- You got it.

297
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,288
Celebrities pick up
their dry cleaning?

298
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:35,288
I pick up my dry cleaning.

299
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,751
Don't come in!

300
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:39,711
So that didn't last long.

301
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:44,822
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?

302
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,053
Since all these roomie squabbles

303
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,134
are still causing friction between you
and Robin, I thought I'd help out.

304
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,307
BTW, I went
by the post office today.

305
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,624
I picked you up some stamps.
Here's ten thousand. That oughta do ya.

306
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,856
Thanks, I guess.

307
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:01,386
You want a beer?

308
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,756
I picked those up on the way over.
It was nothing.

309
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,950
Did you buy us a dishwasher?

310
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,830
That dishwasher's always been there.
How long have you lived here?

311
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,112
So, you're doing all this
to keep me and Robin from fighting, huh?

312
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:26,229
Exactly.

313
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,482
I worry about you two.

314
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:33,014
It bothers you that Robin and I
are hooking up, doesn't it?

315
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,892
Not at all.
That's crazy.

316
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:39,962
What?

317
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,109
Are you in love with Robin?

318
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:54,452
You're in love with Robin.
That's why you don't want us hooking up.

319
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,771
What? That is crazy talk.

320
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,634
Can't a bro clean
another bro's apartment

321
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,475
like bros do?

322
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:05,005
Name me one bro in the history of bros
who has ever done that.

323
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,554
I'll name two:

324
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,584
Misters Clean and Belvedere.

325
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:17,029
Look, this thing with me and Robin,
it's totally casual.

326
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:20,604
I'm not gonna freak out if you tell me
you have feelings for her. So, do you?

327
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:24,357
No. I don't. I don't, no.
I don't. I don't. No.

328
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:27,058
Robin is all yours, dude.
Have fun with her.

329
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,818
Now, if you'll excuse me,

330
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:32,198
I'm gonna go sleep with other girls.

331
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:34,384
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

332
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:36,997
- Positive?
- Absolutely.

333
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:41,521
And then I stormed out.

334
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:43,469
Why did I do that?

335
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:47,377
I mean, maybe it goes back
to my father issues, but...

336
00:16:47,502 --> 00:16:50,127
I basically gave
my best friend license

337
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,700
to have sex
with the girl of my dreams.

338
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,106
I totally sabotaged myself.

339
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,375
And now I'm smoking.
Now I'm smoking.

340
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:02,729
Get out.

341
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,813
But it's feelings hour

342
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:07,067
and I'm holding
Feely the Share Bear.

343
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:10,514
Whoever's holding Feely the Share Bear
gets to sit in the share chair.

344
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:13,823
Barney, this is not
your private therapist's office.

345
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:17,225
These kids have issues
to talk about, too, you know.

346
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,203
Ben's parents are getting divorced.

347
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:20,705
They are?

348
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:23,561
Who wants to do some coloring?

349
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,874
Great, did Lily send you?
I don't have the bear, okay?

350
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,256
I'm not giving it back!

351
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:36,052
Why are you smiling?

352
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:38,521
I just...

353
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,061
read a magazine.

354
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:41,726
Here at work.

355
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:43,269
What?

356
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,966
It's the funniest thing.

357
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:47,399
I was online,
looking up rates for hotels

358
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,654
<i>when I realized something.</i>

359
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:50,937
This is stupid.

360
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,350
I decided it was time
to let go of my hang-ups

361
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:56,686
and do the thing I gotta do

362
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:59,493
and once I made that decision,
everything changed.

363
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,959
<i>There's a young man
who's comfortable with who he is.</i>

364
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,675
<i>I know what you're about to do
and I respect you for it.</i>

365
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,388
<i>Go the distance.</i>

366
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,970
You made a brave step today.

367
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,950
Remember what Shakespeare wrote:

368
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:33,368
"Virtue is bold,

369
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:35,900
"and goodness never fearful."

370
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,471
You're right,
Super Hot Lady Who My Wife Keeps

371
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:42,080
Telling Me Why You're Famous
But I Keep Forgetting.

372
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,329
Let's do this.

373
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,641
Lead the way.

374
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:51,504
Congratulations.

375
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,135
Thanks.
I was gonna have to do it eventually.

376
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,193
You know, sometimes you just gotta...
You gotta man up and...

377
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,678
and just go for it.

378
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:02,515
Marshall, I have to go.

379
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,312
By the way, I have a bathroom here
if you ever want to use it.

380
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:12,891
Son of a...

381
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,166
Ted, I have to tell you the truth.
I'm in love with...

382
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,531
tacos.

383
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,710
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking out the triz-ash.

384
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:25,582
If you're looking for Ted,
he left.

385
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:27,207
And...

386
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:31,795
our little arrangement is...
over, by the way.

387
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,761
Really?
That's aws... ful.

388
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:37,725
Awsful?
Yeah, it's just awsful.

389
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,307
- What happened?
- He just insisted.

390
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,432
He said he couldn't do it anymore
because "someone's gonna get hurt".

391
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:47,473
I think we all know
who he meant by that.

392
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,259
Do we?

393
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:51,815
Isn't it obvious?

394
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,400
- Is it?
- Yeah.

395
00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:56,486
It's Ted.

396
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,967
You know what a romantic he is.
He can't separate the physical

397
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:01,908
from the emotional.
He's all like...

398
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,701
- I love you.
- Exactly.

399
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,663
He's not like you, you know?

400
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,639
Besides, we're friends. I don't want
to screw that up by getting involved.

401
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,170
Dating friends never works out.

402
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,299
So... you want to get a taco?

403
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:20,819
A taco?

404
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,679
You love them, remember?

405
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:24,692
Right.

406
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,985
Come on, I'm hungry.

407
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,946
<i>So Robin and I went back
to just being roommates</i>

408
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,115
<i>and things went back to normal.</i>

409
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,819
<i>Your Aunt Lily was right.</i>

410
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,244
<i>When two exes decide
to just be casual,</i>

411
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,020
<i>someone always gets hurt.</i>

412
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:52,174
<i>It just wasn't one of us.</i>
