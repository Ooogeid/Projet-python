00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:05,733
<i>Kids, the secret to dating
is very simple:</i>

2
00:00:05,858 --> 00:00:08,245
<i>be confident, be comfortable
in your skin,</i>

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,173
<i>be assured of who you are.</i>

4
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:12,094
<i>Barney was really good
at that last one,</i>

5
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:15,973
<i>even though a lot of the time
who he was was someone else.</i>

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,103
Hi. Do you see that guy
over there in the scuba suit?

7
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,423
You thinking of going
and talking to him?

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,945
Good. He's seriously the biggest jerk
on the face of the earth.

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,281
- How do you know him?
- He's one of my best friends.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,216
- So what's with the scuba suit?
- Well, it's a long story.

11
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,292
He just went through a breakup...

12
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:42,482
<i>There's two basic philosophies of
how to handle yourself after a breakup.</i>

13
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:44,341
<i>Some people throw themselves into...</i>

14
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:46,922
My career. That's my number one
focus right now.

15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,804
From now on, no more dating.

16
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:50,091
Just work.

17
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:51,926
<i>While others{\throw
themselves into}...</i>

18
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,178
Every woman in New York City.

19
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:57,559
That's right, Barney Stinson
is back on the market.

20
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:59,270
Mothers, lock up your daughters.

21
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:01,686
Daughters, lock up your milswancas.

22
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,604
- Milswancas?
- Wait, I can get this.

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,816
Mothers I'd like to sleep with
and never call again.

24
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:08,818
Correct!
Circle gets the square.

25
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:11,570
Don't you think you're kinda
rushing back into this?

26
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,969
Lily, since I started dating
Robin, there's a certain

27
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:17,618
thing haven't used as much
as I would like to.

28
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,954
It's... Kinda big,

29
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:21,664
surprisingly heavy,

30
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,750
kind of leathery, and it's black.

31
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,956
This, my friends...

32
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:31,115
Is the Playbook.

33
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,301
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

34
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,521
.:: La Fabrique ::.

35
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:49,525
The Playbook contains
every scam, con, hustle,

36
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,177
hoodwink, gambit, flimflam,

37
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,530
stratagem and bamboozle
I've ever used...

38
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,873
or ever hope to use...
To pick up chicks

39
00:01:56,998 --> 00:01:58,848
and give them the business.

40
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:01,811
You wrote another book?

41
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,169
We got a... Stephen King over here.

42
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:08,676
It's all in here.

43
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:12,423
Everything from basic moves like
"the don't drink that."

44
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,425


45
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:17,553
Don't drink that.
I saw some guy slip something in there.

46
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:18,971
What? Who?

47
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,031
That guy.

48
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:26,773
Thank you.

49
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:32,443
To more advanced maneuvers
like "the Mrs. Stinsfire."

50
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,487


51
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,337
Now kappas, after our
disciplinary hearing

52
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:39,033
for lewd behavior last semester,

53
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,619
we have been assigned
a new housemom.

54
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:44,079
I'd like you to meet mrs. Stinsfire.

55
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,874
Hello, girls!

56
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,881
I can't picture a way
that wouldn't work.

57
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,468
What's "the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn"?

58
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:58,961
I'm glad you asked.

59
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,973
"the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn" will be

60
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,168
my grand return to the stage.

61
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,975
Or you know, the bed.

62
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:07,144
Actually, my bed
is kind of on a stage.

63
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,371
I put a platform 
and got some lights.

64
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,624
It's a real production.
Barney exits!

65
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,944
How about you?
You getting back out there?

66
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,418
- Where is your Playbook?
- My Playbook?

67
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:20,706
Bro, two-volume set, right here.

68
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:23,786
- It's a great read actually.
- Yeah, I'm reading it right now.

69
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:26,455
I told you,
I'm taking a break from all that.

70
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,979
- Marshall, it's totally gonna happen.
- So gonna happen.

71
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:32,002
- What?
- You're gonna fall in love.

72
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,170
So soon.

73
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:35,799
Not likely.
I'm focusing on my career.

74
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,505
- I'm done with dating.
- Okay, we playing the pyramid?

75
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:41,953
"Things people say right before
they meet the love of their life."

76
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:44,849
Kelly Harris, girl I went
to law school with said...

77
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,310
Law school's so hard,
I just want to focus on my studies.

78
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,021
Six months later?

79
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,146
Married!

80
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,273
That's all w...

81
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,775
Travis Frenchroy, backup
bartender tells me...

82
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,569
I'm so over the whole dating game.

83
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:59,488
I just want to focus
on my <i>Star Trek </i>fan fiction.

84
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:01,108
Six months later...

85
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,133
Married!

86
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:04,174
May I respond?

87
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,486
That's all well and good for...

88
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,707
Matthew Blitz,
accountant at my office says...

89
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,999
I'm gonna die single and alone.

90
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,461
I might as well just focus
on this year's taxes.

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Six months later?

92
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,767
City union and planning to get married
pending the passage of legislation

93
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,917
currently on the floor of the NY
sate senate.

94
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,477
Protest all you want,
but it's gonna happen.

95
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:26,056
- It's a law of nature.
- Lawyered. Of nature.

96
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,580
I'd love to have
no interest in a relationship.

97
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:31,729
There's no way I'd be single right now
if I wanted to be single.

98
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,362
- Okay, now you're ready.
- Ready for what?

99
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,441
Three years ago, this girl Shelly
started teaching at my school.

100
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,407
The moment I saw her, I was like,

101
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:40,905
"this is the girl for Ted."

102
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,157
Why am I just hearing about her now?

103
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,712
You know, I usually
hate being set up

104
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,137
but this Ted just sounds so great.

105
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:51,480
He is. He's so sweet and thoughtful
and intelligent.

106
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,752
Come on! One more chicken finger
and the crown is yours!

107
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,341
I don't see him anywhere.
He must be out doing charity work.

108
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:02,044
So, different bar?

109
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,060
That girl with Lily's pretty cute!

110
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,750
Yeah, she was cute.

111
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,350
Yeah, still is.
And now you're ready.

112
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:14,396
Bro, now you can fit like, three times
as many chicken fingers in your mouth.

113
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,464
- You know it.
- OK, I will set it up,

114
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,091
but promise me you won't
do anything stupid.

115
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:21,737
I promise I won't do
anything stupid.

116
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,822
<i>And I kept that promise.</i>

117
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,651
<i>But only because...</i>

118
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,603
<i>She never showed up.</i>

119
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,124
- I know. I'm sorry, I feel terrible.
- You should feel terrible!

120
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,293
- I do feel terrible! I do!
- You should!

121
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,711
- I do, I do!
- You should! You should!

122
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:40,255
I don't.

123
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,613
Look, I was really
looking forward to meeting Ted,

124
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:44,596
but I got to the bar an hour early

125
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:47,216
and I met this amazing guy.

126
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:48,623
Like, seriously amazing.

127
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,933
And you met him at Maclaren's?

128
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,626
- Yeah, right at the bar.
- What's his name?

129
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,144
I shouldn't say.

130
00:05:57,414 --> 00:06:00,647
What the heck.
It's Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!

131
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,697
You son of a bitch.

132
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,288
So, he hooked up with Shelly?
You must've been pissed.

133
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,623
Damn straight.

134
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:18,752
Barney, I've had Shelly
set aside for Ted for three years.

135
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,959
Dude, Ted was not missing out.

136
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,589
She's brainy and annoying,

137
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,687
kind of boring in the sack.

138
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,886
I guess she would've
been perfect for Ted.

139
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,477
Had I known that
she was there to meet Ted,

140
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,321
of course I wouldn't have done it,
but...

141
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:37,188
Given the circumstances,
I think Ted'll be proud of me.

142
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,774
I pulled off
"the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn."

143
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,235
Okay, what's the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?

144
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,945
My question exactly.

145
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,699
- What's the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?
- Glad you asked.

146
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,743


147
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:53,163
To perform the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn,

148
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,434
here's what you'll need:
basic knowledge of web site design

149
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,208
and a very unique fake name.

150
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,731
So, think of your fake name
right now.

151
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,082
Have you got it? Good.

152
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,541
Now, select your target.

153
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,138
Preferably a girl
with a real nice...

154
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:10,346
Phone.

155
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:17,877
Yeah, it's me.

156
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:20,366
Do I know you?

157
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,110
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

158
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,947
Are you, like, famous or something?

159
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,038
You really don't know
who I am, do you?

160
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,703
What a refreshing change of pace.

161
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:39,993
Nice to meet you...

162
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:44,296
Once again,
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

163
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,016
Spelled like it sounds, two "t"s.

164
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:51,261
Ciao.

165
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:54,681
Then, as soon as you're gone,
she gets out her phone

166
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,230
and does an internet search
for Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

167
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,646
And that's when she discovers...

168
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:02,956
A series of fake web sites,

169
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,816
all devoted to the incredible life

170
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,485
of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

171
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:09,863
There's the fake business article
about him, the reclusive billionaire.

172
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,038
The fake explorers club
newsletter describing

173
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:15,077
his balloon trek to the north pole as
a feat of pure daring and imagination.

174
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,919
The fake medical journal featuring
the heartbreaking story of doctors

175
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,505
telling him penis reduction surgery
isn't an option.

176
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,222
And by the time you get back...

177
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:24,547
Hi, Shelly, I hate to be forward,

178
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,922
but can I buy you a cup of coffee?

179
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:28,459
Please.

180
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,426
What does coffee go
for these days, $50?

181
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:36,560
And it is on.

182
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,727
That's awful.

183
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,057
You realize you broke
her heart, right?

184
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:44,314
She's inconsolable.

185
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,553
Why would she be inconsolable?

186
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:49,945
Lorenzo's balloon won't disappear
over the arctic for another week.

187
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:54,408
She would be upset only if someone
told her it was a bunch of lies.

188
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:58,912
- It was all just a bunch of lies?
- It was all just a bunch of lies.

189
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,165
- The balloon expedition?
- Lies!

190
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,585
The man-made island shaped
like his face off the coast of Dubai?

191
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,921
- Lies!
- Finishing 3 in laser tag competion?

192
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,674
Li... actually, that one's true.
I went to that.

193
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,968
- You went to the Vatican?
- Lies!

194
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,014
Oh, my god!

195
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, I hope
you're happy with yourself.

196
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,477
- What?
- You broke that girl's heart.

197
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:24,021
- Me?
- You!

198
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:26,982
She'll probably never
trust a guy again.

199
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,052
You ruined her for Ted.

200
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:31,986
Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn,

201
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:33,405
Lorenzo's twin brother.

202
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,586
Can you believe that?
He blames me!

203
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,370
And by the way, Ted,
I bet she'd still go out with you.

204
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,832
Let me think. Do I want to go out with
a girl Barney hooked up with?

205
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:45,953
Guys, help me out with
the harmonies.

206
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:48,337
- Hell no...
- Hell no...

207
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,468
You must be a
little bothered by this.

208
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:55,769
It's his life.

209
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,285
If these girls are dumb
enough to fall for this crap,

210
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,925
- they have it coming.
- Agreed.

211
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,726
Have you seen
the one in there labeled "the SNASA"?

212
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:06,772
You're an astronaut?

213
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:12,228
I'm actually
in a top secret government space program

214
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:14,345
called secret NASA

215
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,273
or SNASA.

216
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:18,659
SNASA.

217
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,119
Do you go to the moon?

218
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,536
Well, not the moon you're familiar with,
though I have been to the...

219
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:25,661
smoon.

220
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,169
The smoon.

221
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,287
If you fall for that one,
my heart breaks for you,

222
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,427
but I'm sorry, you're a smoron.

223
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:39,429
So, what happens next?

224
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:40,514
Well...

225
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:42,933
Come on, Barney, you just...

226
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,437
You just got out
of an honest to God relationship.

227
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,549
You're a real boy now.

228
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:51,608
You can't go back
to these cheap tricks.

229
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,972
Cheap tricks?!

230
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,295
Not one of these is a cheap trick.

231
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,197
Except for "the Cheap Trick".

232
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,617
I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick.

233
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,623
And even that one involves
expensive hair extensions.

234
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,542
Now, if you don't mind,

235
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,585
I'm off to prepare
for tonight's main event.

236
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,714
I will be performing
"the he's not coming".

237
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,757
Glad you asked.

238
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,512
<i>To perform "the he's not coming",
here's what you'll need,</i>

239
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,930
<i>the observation deck
of the Empire State Building.</i>

240
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:24,405
<i>Are you up there?</i>

241
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:25,539
<i>Good.</i>

242
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:28,325
<i>For generations, this has been
the spot New Yorkers have chosen</i>

243
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,172
<i>for their romantic reunions
with long-estranged lovers,</i>

244
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:34,179
<i>so all you have to do is walk up
to every girl you see and say...</i>

245
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:35,604
He's not coming.

246
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:38,187
- What are you talking about?
- Never mind.

247
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,948
He's not coming.

248
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,115
He's not coming.

249
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,089
She's not coming?

250
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,239
Sorry.

251
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:51,753
<i>Until sooner or later...</i>

252
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:54,671
He's not coming.

253
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:57,178
He's not?

254
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,614
But we agreed.

255
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,998
We always said we'd meet here.

256
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,440
On this night.

257
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,786
I'm such a fool.

258
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,525
I'm going to go get the paper.

259
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,930
- More like, go get a husband.
- Totally.

260
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,697
You guys need to stop that,
seriously.

261
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,323
The last thing I am looking
for right now is a relationship.

262
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,779
When you pick up newspaper, be sure
to check the wedding announcements.

263
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:26,745
For yours.

264
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,743
Robin, it's like this.

265
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,377
Do you have any idea
how many times I've gone to the freezer

266
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,436
looking for frozen waffles
and not found them?

267
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:34,932
- Thousands?
- Millions.

268
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:38,051
But when I go to the freezer
looking for a popsicle...

269
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:40,470
Or the remote control
because we are having a fight

270
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,780
and she's hidden it there...
You know what I find?

271
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,051
Frozen waffles.
That's how it works.

272
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:48,683
You go out there looking for a paper,
you're coming back with frozen waffles.

273
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,327
And, in this case,
frozen waffles is a guy.

274
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:52,814
Also,

275
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:55,065
could you pick up
some frozen waffles?

276
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,404
In that case, frozen waffles...

277
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:00,737
are frozen waffles.

278
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,249
Guys, code red!
Emergency.

279
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,034
Lockdown.
Nobody's leaving.

280
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,927
- What happened?
- I tried the "he's not coming",

281
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,804
and it worked.
Gangbusters.

282
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:12,607
You should have seen this girl.

283
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,241
I'm leaving.

284
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:20,757
We get up to my place, and I go
into my room to set up the camera...

285
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:22,759
To light the candles...

286
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,352
And when I come out,

287
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,139
she's gone, and so is the playbook!

288
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:31,601
I think we all know
who is responsible for this.

289
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,863
We do.

290
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,439
Al-Qaeda.

291
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:37,818
You idiot.

292
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:39,443
It was me.

293
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,655
You son of a bitch.

294
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:52,093
You stole the playbook?

295
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,291
So,
the girl on the Empire State Building?

296
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,917
A friend of mine, an actress.

297
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,544
An actress.

298
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,879
Of course.

299
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,756
That explains her impeccable diction
and her sluttiness.

300
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,713
Barney, I've got half a mind
to take that playbook

301
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:07,220
and put it up on the internet
for the whole world to see.

302
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,049
- You wouldn't.
- I won't,

303
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:11,679
as long as you agree
to no more scams,

304
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:14,540
no more cons, no more hustles,
no more hoodwinks,

305
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:17,647
no more gambits, no more stratagems
and no more bamboozles.

306
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,359
- I notice you left out flimflams.
- No flimflams!

307
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,427
Damn it.

308
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,301
My God.

309
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,323
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but look at this.

310
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:34,789
I got left at the altar.

311
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:40,698
My god, that's horrible.

312
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,994
I wonder if that would work.

313
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,946
That's not even
the worst one in here.

314
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,177
Have you guys seen
"my penis grants wishes"?

315
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,056
Really?

316
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,013
- A genie comes out of it?
- Only if you rub it hard enough.

317
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,552
- So, then, what happened?
- It says here he breaks into song,

318
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:01,871
and then the furniture comes to life
and dances with him.

319
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:05,237
It's not very well thought out.
It's no "Mrs. Stinsfire".

320
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,863
What happened in real life?

321
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,740
Well, a few hours later...

322
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,921
I heard it was gonna rain.

323
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:21,639
If anyone's interested,
I will be at MacLaren's pub

324
00:15:21,764 --> 00:15:25,298
performing a play out of the Playbook
entitled "The Scuba Diver".

325
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,159
That is all.

326
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:30,997
That's it.

327
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:33,872
I'm putting the Playbook up
on the internet.

328
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,309
Can you put the Playbook
up on the internet?

329
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:39,099
Of course, baby,
but here's the weird thing.

330
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:41,834
I have literally been through this book
cover to cover.

331
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,984
There is no play
called "The Scuba Diver".

332
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,740
So, now you guys want to know
what "The Scuba Diver" is.

333
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:51,999
Well,

334
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:55,307
it was on the last page
of the Playbook,

335
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,789
but I ripped it out just in case.

336
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:01,236
Don't worry.
You're about to see it in action.

337
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,627
See this blond?

338
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,215
Tizzarget acquizzired.

339
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:10,760
- Barney, don't do this.
- Give it a rest, pest.

340
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,373
If anyone should be mad,
should be Robin.

341
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:16,748
- She loves the Playbook.
- I don't love the Playbook.

342
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:18,236
What are you talk...

343
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:21,021
The Playbook, it's gold.
You gotta admit it's spectacular.

344
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:24,004
Look, Barney, we just broke up.

345
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:26,810
I mean, the costumes are cute but...

346
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:28,474
We just broke up.

347
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:33,742
I didn't know you felt that way.

348
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:38,247
I guess I've been so wrapped up
in my own stuff that I...

349
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,722
Crap, she's looking over here.
Quick, everyone, scatter.

350
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:44,922
That's it.

351
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:49,841
You see that guy over there
in the scuba suit?

352
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:52,135
And that brings us to right now.

353
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,520
But... Wait.

354
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,641
So, why is he wearing scuba gear?

355
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:59,161
We don't know.

356
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,811
And it's killing us, Claire.
It's killing us!

357
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,480
Let's go ask him.

358
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,234
So, what's "The Scuba Diver"?

359
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:10,236
And this is Claire, by the way.

360
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:14,240
I'm Lieutenant Frank Lyman.

361
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,661
I train bomb sniffing dolphins
for the balt...

362
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,072
You know what?

363
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,172
I can't do this.

364
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:27,134
I am so sorry.

365
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,174
This breakup's been tougher on me
than I thought.

366
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,136
This Playbook was just a way
to take my mind off of things.

367
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,122
It's okay.
It's been tough on me, too.

368
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,476
I mean, look at me.
I've sworn off relationships.

369
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,598
- She getting married.
- Gotta work on my toast.

370
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:45,271
Gotta make sure my tux fits.

371
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,857
I will bang your heads together
like coconuts.

372
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,245
I'm so glad you're stopping this.

373
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,520
And, frankly,

374
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:54,795
the real Barney is way cooler

375
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,331
than any of the fake Barneys
in this Playbook.

376
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,434
Is that right?

377
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,558
Claire, you've probably heard a lot
about the real Barney tonight.

378
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:04,998
- Want to grab a cup of coffee?
- Claire, before you turn him down,

379
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:06,773
I think you should know

380
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,170
that under this neoprene suit

381
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:12,159
with what appears to be a tube sock
stuffed in the crotch...

382
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:15,985
- Can of Pringles, but go on.
- ... is an amazing guy.

383
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:20,047
He's fun and one of my best friends.

384
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:21,850
And he landed this hottie.

385
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,227
He's a good guy.

386
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,982
- Come on, go out with him.
- It's just a cup of coffee, right?

387
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,867
All right. Let's get some coffee.

388
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:38,195
And by the end of the night...

389
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:40,034
I'm proud of him.

390
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,620
To be that vulnerable
takes a lot of Pringles.

391
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,373
I got a text from Barney.

392
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:48,272
"Look under the table."

393
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:55,008
It's a page from the Playbook.

394
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,527
What does it say?

395
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:58,303
It's "The Scuba Diver".

396
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:03,750
<i>One: tell a meddlesome female friend
about the Playbook.</i>

397
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,471
<i>Two: run a play on one of her coworkers,
making her so angry she steals it.</i>

398
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:08,396
<i>Three:</i>

399
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,357
<i>put on the scuba suit and tell her
you gonna do "The Scuba Diver"</i>

400
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,497
<i>on the hot girl standing by the bar.
Your friend, let's call her Lily...</i>

401
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,113
<i>talks to the girl
and tells her everything about the book.</i>

402
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,158
<i>Here's where it gets tricky.
When they ask what "The Scuba Diver" is,</i>

403
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,061
<i>take off your mask, give them spiel
about your deep-seated insecurities</i>

404
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:25,205
<i>which don't exist,
because you're awesome.</i>

405
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,223
<i>Then, Lily talks you up to the girl
who agrees to go get coffee with you.</i>

406
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:30,374
<i>And it...</i>

407
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:31,979
<i>is...</i>

408
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:33,478
<i>on.</i>

409
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,388
You son of a bitch.

410
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,768
I'll give you a call.

411
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,386
All right. Bye-bye.

412
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:53,499
For those of you keeping score,
"The Ted Mosby" works.

413
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,863
Here we go.
You say you don't want a relationship.

414
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,075
The love of your life
is about to walk through the door

415
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,451
and it's...

416
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
that guy.

417
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:11,753
- I'm not falling in love with that guy.
- Right, because it's going to be...

418
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:12,919
That guy.

419
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:18,424
I don't know. The blue blazer's
just not doing it for me...

420
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,468
You're right, It's that guy!

421
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,432
You should give her a chance.

422
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,102
Make out with her a little,
see if there's something there.

423
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,813
- I'm going to work.
- Yeah, you are.

424
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,314
I'm actually gonna work.

425
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,401
- Go, work it.
- <i>And the ironic part was...</i>

426
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:39,329
Robin?

427
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,949
- Don, your new cohost.
- <i>That was the day she met Don.</i>

428
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,444
Damn it, Marshall.
