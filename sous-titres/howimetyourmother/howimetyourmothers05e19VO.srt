1
00:00:00,843 --> 00:00:02,203
<i>Kids, you may be wondering</i>

2
00:00:02,328 --> 00:00:04,757
<i>how many of these stories</i>
<i>I'm telling you are true. </i>

3
00:00:04,882 --> 00:00:07,277
<i>It's a fair question.
After all, there's a fine line</i>

4
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:10,102
<i>between a good story</i>
<i>and a bald-faced lie. </i>

5
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:14,891
<i>I've never met anyone who could work
that line better than your uncle Barney.</i>

6
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:16,641
<i>Heck, he could jump rope with it. </i>

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,260
- I love to travel myself.
- Really?

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,229
- Where's the best place you've visited?
- Hawaii's nice.

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,775
A buddy of mine lives in Seattle.
That's a good spot.

10
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:29,111
But the best place?
I'd have to say the moon.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,116
Hi, Neil Armstrong.

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,629
You did not convince a girl that you
were the first man to walk on the moon!

13
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:37,787
That happened 7 years
before you were born!

14
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,393
Ted, baby doll, minor hurdle.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,279
Yeah, well, our spaceship
passed through a wormhole

16
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:46,673
or some gamma rays or something.

17
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:49,546
I started aging backwards,
blah, blah, blah.

18
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:52,259
So, you work in a yogurt shop.
That must be wild.

19
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,909
Although, I did actually work
in a yogurt store in high school.

20
00:00:58,034 --> 00:00:59,534
And it was indeed...

21
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:01,602
wild.

22
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,940
Anyhoo, 20 minutes later,
the eagle landed.

23
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:08,401
We knocked space boots.

24
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:10,736
Houston, we have a moaner.

25
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:14,501
Other space-related
double entendres.

26
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,320
Why do you feel the need
to lie all the time?

27
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,995
I'm not lying!
Guys, we made sweet love.

28
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:21,455
I got pictures.

29
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,780
- I hate my job.
- What are you talking about?

30
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,443
- I thought you interviewed the mayor.
- Mayor Mcwoof.

31
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:33,050
He wears a dog costume
and teaches kids not to litter.

32
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:35,052
At least he's supposed to.

33
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,606
I don't want to talk
about mayor Mcwoof.

34
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,618
I want to talk
about these amazing insoles

35
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:42,111
from bon appe-feet!

36
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,478
Just look
how shock-absorbent they are!

37
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,245
Prop table!
Table's a prop!

38
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:49,150
We'll be right back.

39
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:52,653
We'll be right back.

40
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,532
Sorry, Robin.
Got bored.

41
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:58,492
Yeah, I don't blame you.

42
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:03,750
Man, just one decent interview
would be so nice for a change.

43
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,512
Fine. I'll look at my schedule,
see when I'm available.

44
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:09,605
I want a list of questions
ahead of time,

45
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,422
and my personal life is off limits.

46
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,885
You caught seven peanuts in a row.
It's impressive, but not newsworthy.

47
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,346
- You caught seven in a row?
- Seven in a row.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,476
That's not about that.

49
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,226
I'm talking about
how I was selected to build

50
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,739
a scale model
of the Empire State Building

51
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:30,441
for the largest recreation
of the New York skyline in the world.

52
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,995
Is that the thing
you were playing with the other night?

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,708
I wasn't playing. I was working.

54
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:37,500
"It's you."

55
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,574
"It's me."

56
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:40,534
"I saw you in the street.

57
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:42,179
"Are you Annie?"

58
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,755
Are you acting out the last scene
of <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>with dolls?

59
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,631
- How long have you been out here?
- Ten seconds.

60
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,300
Yeah. Just the last scene.

61
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:58,844
Again?

62
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:02,306
That's the pizza.
Baby, do you have any cash?

63
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,489
You know, I actually...

64
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:07,728
I don't think
that I should have to pay.

65
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:11,607
'Cause I'm not a fan of pizza.

66
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:13,818
What?!

67
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,680
We've driven
halfway across the country

68
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,947
for a piece of pizza
literally hundreds of times.

69
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,710
I once caught you
eating pizza in the shower.

70
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,577
Marshall, there's a cartoon of you
on our coupons.

71
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,736
I'm not saying Marshall's a guy
who likes pizza,

72
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:28,862
but last time he went in for a physical,
doctor says, "You got to stop pizza". 

73
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:31,333
Marshall says, "Why?"
Doc says, "So I can examine you".

74
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,337
But seriously,
we kid because we love.

75
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,885
All right, the reason that I don't have
any money on me...

76
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,316
is because...

77
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:41,428
I got mugged.

78
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:42,856
You...? What?

79
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,204
Can somebody please pay Arthur?
All right? I'm starving!

80
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,103
- How's your dad?
- Better.

81
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,271
Good.

82
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,468
Synchro: ShalimarFox, JoJo13

83
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,826
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

84
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,537
- You got mugged?!
- Who mugged you?

85
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,144
Was he wearing a black skull-knit cap
and a five o'clock shadow?

86
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,998
- Did he say, "Stick 'em up?"
- Yes, because I got mugged in 1947

87
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,129
at the corner of Abbott and Costello.
No.

88
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:18,090
I was cutting through central
park on my way home from work...

89
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,426
Watch it.

90
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,144
Don't get any closer.

91
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:23,746
It's cool.

92
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:25,481
It's cool.

93
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,644
It was... completely terrifying.

94
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:33,432
It was... completely terrifying.

95
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,943
- What are you doing?
- Rehearsing.

96
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,986
I'm gonna pretend this happened to me
to try and get some sympathy sex.

97
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,822
Barney, that won't work.
Will it?

98
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,793
- Big time.
- I'll allow it.

99
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,513
I can't believe someone pointed a gun
at my Marshmallow.

100
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:50,945
I'm shaking. I don't think
I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight.

101
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,834
Here, sweetie. I have something
that will help you sleep.

102
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:58,505
Just stick this under your pillow.
You'll sleep like a freakin' baby.

103
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,007
Put that away.

104
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,736
It's not going to hurt anyone.
The safety's...

105
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:03,621
On.

106
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,517
Okay, you know what?
Let's all just relax.

107
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:09,317
We don't need a gun.

108
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,979
I'd just like to forget
this ever happened

109
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,729
and try to move on with my life.

110
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,749
Just like to forget
this ever happened

111
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:18,028
and try to move on with my life.

112
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:20,861
This is great stuff.
I think I'm gonna add tears, though.

113
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,031
Listen, baby,
I know that it's scary, but look at me.

114
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,528
I'm fine, okay?

115
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:28,535
Can we just put this behind us?

116
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,122
That's gold, but I'm going
to switch it to "put me behind you".

117
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,553
Baby, you don't have
to worry about me.

118
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:38,490
Yes, I'm a little scared,
but I'm a New Yorker.

119
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:40,422
I'm not gonna let this change me.

120
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:41,961
I've changed!

121
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,051
I'm a gun person now.

122
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:48,762
- Clip!
- Maybe we should just take a break...

123
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:50,724
I said, "clip".

124
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:55,646
You want to get a gun?
Not a scary one.

125
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,379
Just a cute, little, pink Beretta

126
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:00,052
that matches these adorable
strappy sandals I just bought.

127
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:01,860
And, our new credit card works.

128
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,630
You don't need a gun.

129
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:06,034
Every statistic in the world
points to the fact

130
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:09,037
that it's safer <i>not</i> to have a gun
in the home than to have one,

131
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:11,114
especially in our home.

132
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,205
You know how I'm always
accidentally injuring you.

133
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:15,133
Pretty easy, right?

134
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:30,967
Hurry up, baby.
The party's about to start.

135
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:38,063
My god, Lily! I thought you were going
as a sexy cat!

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,334
I changed my mind.

137
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,588
And now you want to bring a gun
into that equation?

138
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:47,108
I know, you're right,
but every time I close my eyes,

139
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:49,902
I picture that guy
pointing a gun at you.

140
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:52,379
You're my whole world.

141
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:55,164
If something ever happened to you,
I would just...

142
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:57,693
Okay... No, I know.
I know.

143
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,085
OK, I've got to admit something.

144
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,176
That mugging didn't happen
exactly the way that I said it did.

145
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:07,745
So he <i>was</i> wearing
a black, skull-knit cap.

146
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,388
- Told... Ja!
- No, he wasn't wearing that.

147
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,224
He wasn't wearing anything.

148
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:17,189
Wait, so...

149
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:20,893
Watch it.
Don't get any closer.

150
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,458
It's... It's cool.

151
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:25,586
It's cool.

152
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,529
He naked-muggered you?

153
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:30,034
I'm not gonna ask
where he was keeping the gun.

154
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,909
Are we sure it was a gun?

155
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,136
No, guys, I was walking
home from work...

156
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,149
Through Central Park,

157
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:40,417
and I stopped at the zoo.

158
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:45,547
Watch it.
Don't get any closer.

159
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:48,008
It's cool. It's cool.

160
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,519
You're telling us...

161
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:00,556
That you got mugged...

162
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,164
By a monkey.

163
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:04,659
I got mugged by a monkey.

164
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:16,667
You got mugged by a monkey?

165
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,838
Yep, I got mugged by a monkey.

166
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:21,218
I was embarrassed,
so I made up the other story.

167
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:23,605
But the point is, Lily,
you don't need a gun.

168
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:26,171
Forget about the gun.
We're on this now.

169
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:29,925
Monkeys are mugging people now?
It really is a jungle out there.

170
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,308
Oh, my god!
That monkey has our address.

171
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,919
What if he's in a gang?

172
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:36,098
I hope he doesn't do a swing-by.

173
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:40,394
Why didn't you just ask
the zookeeper to get your wallet back?

174
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,537
'Cause I saw what the monkey
was doing with it,

175
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,540
and I didn't really want it
after that.

176
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:46,639
Hey, guys. What's up?

177
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,238
Some new information has come to light
on Marshall's mugging.

178
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,116
- Really? Did they catch the guy?
- Well, he's behind bars.

179
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:56,952
Where did they find him?

180
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,167
I'm guessing naked in a tree,
throwing his own feces.

181
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:03,250
I've seen that guy.
See, that's why I take cabs.

182
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,043
You know how they caught him, right?

183
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,964
- There was a tail on him.
- There was a tail on him!

184
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,401
What is going on?

185
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:15,179
All right, Robin,
here's what happened.

186
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,805
Let me tell it. It's my story.

187
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,768
You see, young Marshall
was at the zoo eating a banana...

188
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,857
I wasn't eating a banana!
If you're gonna tell it, tell it right.

189
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:29,818
You're right.
The banana was on the ground.

190
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,374
There was no banana!

191
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,001
There was no banana.

192
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,128
Marshall, I apologize... Truly.

193
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:50,686
Robin, here's what happened.

194
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,104
God, don't shoot.

195
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,304
- There was no banana!
- Oh, come on.

196
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,724
Barney, I know Marshall
didn't get mugged by a monkey.

197
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,187
He got right.

198
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,554
This is not an uncommon thing, okay?

199
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,640
In Thailand, in China,

200
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:14,769
in Costa Rica, people get mugged
by monkeys all the time.

201
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:17,930
Monkeys are gatherers.
Because of their intersocial dynamics,

202
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,660
having a predisposition towards

203
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,703
stealing gives one
a genetic advantage.

204
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,373
You were mugged by a monkey!

205
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:28,252
Maybe he was just curious.
Were you wearing a yellow hat?

206
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,507
Seriousness, this is a great story.
Can I interview you about it on my show?

207
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,551
What? He gets to be on your show?
What about my model?

208
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,221
No one wants to see a guy
playing with dolls.

209
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:41,702
First of all,
that is not what it is.

210
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,851
And second of all, you just had a guy
on your show playing with dolls.

211
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:48,855
Your dolls are favored at the Rhinebeck
Collector Awards next month.

212
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:50,899
Only if they behave themselves.

213
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,069
Last year, I found one of them
cavorting with a G.I. Joe.

214
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,484
It's not funny.

215
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,075
What were you thinking?
What if you'd gotten pregnant?

216
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:03,620
And you invited him back
for a follow-up interview.

217
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,582
Because the FBI asked us to keep him
occupied while they search his house.

218
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,387
I need this story.
It's got everything:

219
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:13,980
crime, monkeys,

220
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,226
no stupid model
of the Empire State Building

221
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,469
that takes up my entire living room
and makes the place smell like glue.

222
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,515
Do this for me...
as a friend?

223
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,434
It'd be fun to see you on TV.

224
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,070
Can you promise

225
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:32,175
to present it in a way
that doesn't make a joke

226
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,401
out of the fact
that I got mugged by a monkey?

227
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,946
You got mugged by a monkey.

228
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:41,742
Oh, my God.

229
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,702
- I just got mugged.
- What?

230
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,449
Is what I was saying to this girl
at the bar earlier...

231
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,124
It was completely terrifying.

232
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,462
I just want to forget this ever happened
and try to move on with my life.

233
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,297
You poor thing.

234
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:56,402
Neil?

235
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,012
Lady, my name's not Neil.
It's Bar...

236
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,985
Why are you calling him Neil?

237
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,768
Because that's his name.
He's Neil Armstrong.

238
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:08,977
The cyclist?

239
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,730
You were supposed to be
on a shuttle mission?

240
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,523
I thought you just got mugged.

241
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,152
I can do this.

242
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:20,966
You see,
I was on my way to the launch pad

243
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:23,742
when I was mugged.

244
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:24,993
And...

245
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,298
the mugger

246
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:28,993
took my space shuttle keys.

247
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,124
Nailed it. Who's up for a three-way?

248
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:33,255
- I am.
- Me, too.

249
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,267
And it was the best three-way ever.

250
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:41,176
Strange, 'cause you look like you had
two vodka tonics thrown in your face.

251
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,345
And you have lime in your hair.

252
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,041
The story's better with my ending.

253
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,080
Just... okay?

254
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,522
There we are, zero gravity.

255
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,857
The three of us wearing nothing
but space helmets.

256
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,507
You won't believe it.

257
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:01,947
I pitched the monkey mugger story
to my producer and he loves it!

258
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:05,833
Really?

259
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,203
Who's ever heard of a guy
getting mugged by a monkey?

260
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,287
No one except for the good people
of Thailand,

261
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:14,154
China, Costa Rica,
and plenty of other countries

262
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,878
where monkey crime
is an extremely common nuisance.

263
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,132
The best part is, he said that it might
get picked up to go national. Guys.

264
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,117
This monkey mugger story
could make me famous.

265
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,140
Me, too.

266
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:30,230
Guys, this is bad.
I can't, I can't do this.

267
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,396
- It'll be embarrassing... so what?
- It's not that.

268
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,754
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.

269
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:45,490
So, you weren't mugged by a monkey?

270
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,808
No, I wasn't.

271
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:48,846
So what you're saying is...

272
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:52,372
the monkey tricked you
into giving him your wallet?

273
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,041
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- So you mugged the monkey?

274
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,127
There was no monkey!

275
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,087
It was a human being with a gun.

276
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,660
Are you sure it wasn't one monkey

277
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:06,178
standing on another monkey's shoulders,
wearing a men's trench coat?

278
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:08,251
Be about the right height.

279
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,429
I just made that story up

280
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:12,851
so taht Lily wouldn't get a gun.
That never happened.

281
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:16,396
- I don't buy it.
- What?

282
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,019
You heard me.
I think you were mugged by a monkey.

283
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:22,903
You don't want to go on the show
'cause it'll make you look like a joke.

284
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,739
- Won't it?
- The biggest, 'cause it's so funny.

285
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:28,492
Well, it never happened, okay?

286
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,744
I can't lie to you
'cause you're my friends.

287
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,078
I am, but go on.

288
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,831
But I can't lie about it
on national TV.

289
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:39,169
You've known him the longest.
Is he telling the truth?

290
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:42,931
Ted, don't...

291
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:51,216
I can't tell.

292
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:54,579
He smells good.

293
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:58,036
But I just can't tell.

294
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:03,226
I'm still saying it happened.

295
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,019
Maybe. But, Marshall,

296
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:07,339
if you didn't get mugged
by a monkey,

297
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:10,450
you can't let Robin report it.
This could hurt her credibility.

298
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,312
Journalists lie all the time.

299
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:16,453
I'm sorry, but I will believe
that Jack Palance is dead

300
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:17,965
when I see the body.

301
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,628
This may come as a shock to you, Barney,
but people don't like to be lied to.

302
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,116
Wrong! They don't like finding out
they've been lied to.

303
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:29,124
"Because a lie is just a great story
that someone ruined with the truth. "

304
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,655
Case in point,
what that girl Sarah did to me!

305
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,725
I think you mean
what you did to her.

306
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,166
No, I mean what she did to me.

307
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,691
The truth is,

308
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,275
I'm afraid the three-way story
didn't go exactly the way I said it did.

309
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,777
Nailed it.
Who's up for a three-way?

310
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:49,948
Lisa, wait.

311
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:51,825
Yes, Neil?

312
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:54,160
- You're Lisa?
- Sarah, wait.

313
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:56,940
Look...

314
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,916
I'm not Neil Armstrong.

315
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm sorry I lied.

316
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:06,657
I guess I wasn't completely honest
with you, either.

317
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,468
I said that I was 28,
but the truth is that I'm really 31.

318
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,453
31!

319
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,898
I was happy, very happy,

320
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:24,190
thinking that I had nailed
a 28-year-old with some sun damage.

321
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,124
People want the lie.

322
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:29,983
Marshall, they need the lie,
which is why,

323
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:32,760
as far as I'm concerned,
you were mugged by a monkey.

324
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,910
Just as sure
as I had that three-way.

325
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,756
I am the greatest in the world!

326
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,501
- Is that the three-way belt?
- You know it.

327
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,580
Props!

328
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,757
Man, I slept so great last night.

329
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,734
Can you believe
I almost bought a gun?

330
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,262
I'm so glad
you got mugged by a monkey.

331
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,065
You guys got me.

332
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:03,521
I was just nervous.
I got mugged by a monkey.

333
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,981
Yes! I knew it.

334
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,818
Wait a minute. Now I'm thinking
you really weren't mugged by a monkey.

335
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,987
Why would he make
something like that up?

336
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,288
Yeah, come on, Ted.

337
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:14,386
Come here.

338
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,249
Seriously, what is that cologne?

339
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,702
It's intoxicating.

340
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:28,380
<i>So, late the following night,
we all went to the set of Robin's show.</i>

341
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,325
Don't be nervous. What we're gonna do
is we're going to sit you...

342
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,153
What the hell is this?

343
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:36,304
I don't know.
Looks like something covered by a sheet.

344
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,432
Guess if you want to find out,
you're gonna have to do a story on it.

345
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,769
You're gonna be covered by a sheet
if you don't get your stupid model out.

346
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:45,718
Dude, what are you doing?

347
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,483
I don't think Marshall's
going to lie on TV.

348
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,546
When he backs out, I want to be there
for my friend, Robin, with a story.

349
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,862
Or rather, 102 stories,

350
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:58,963
because that's how tall
a certain iconic New York landmark is.

351
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:01,328
Now, I want to buy a gun.

352
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:04,024
- The monkey's here.
- Surprise.

353
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,168
We thought it would help the story
if you could face your attacker.

354
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,105
Because of this incident,
we will be sending Captain Bobo

355
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,691
to a wildlife sanctuary.

356
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,301
- I bet he'll like it there.
- No, ma'am.

357
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,569
You see, we'll be splitting him up
from his mate, Milly.

358
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,807
They've been together
for a long time.

359
00:18:22,437 --> 00:18:23,935
His mate's name is Milly?

360
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,693
<i>And then, the interview began.</i>

361
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:29,816
In your own words,
describe what happened.

362
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,945
I would love to tell you
what happened, Robin.

363
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,072
But...

364
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:40,410
I'm just, I'm so curious as to what
is going on underneath that sheet.

365
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,880
We're not here to talk about that.
We're here to talk about your mugging.

366
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,522
People get mugged in New York City
all the time,

367
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:50,640
but how often do you get to see
whatever's under that sheet?

368
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,423
Mike, can we get a shot of that?
We'll be right back.

369
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:54,841
What are you doing?

370
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:00,346
I wasn't mugged by a monkey. I made up
that so that Lily wouldn't buy a gun.

371
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:02,307
So you weren't mugged by a monkey?

372
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,559
What, baby?
Of course I was mugged by a monkey.

373
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,811
Great, tell it to America.
We're back in five.

374
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,355
Not back in five.
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.

375
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,358
- That's it. I'm getting a gun.
- Not a gun. I was mugged by a monkey.

376
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,779
- Then Bobo here is going away.
- Wasn't! I wasn't mugged by a monkey!

377
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,490
- You think it was mugged by a monkey?
- None whatsoever.

378
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,460
Just tell me: were you
or were you not mugged by Captain Bobo?

379
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:24,746
- Just tell us what really happened.
- Just us tell the truth.

380
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,509
<i>That's when Marshall realized
there was only one thing he could say.</i>

381
00:19:32,634 --> 00:19:33,546
All right!

382
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,111
Here's the truth.

383
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:37,958
I...

384
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:42,138
am going back to bed.

385
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:43,841
And that was it.

386
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,225
<i>We never found out what really
happened to Uncle Marshall's wallet.</i>

387
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>But we do know this:</i>

388
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:50,424
<i>Lily never got a gun,</i>

389
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,153
<i>Robin's credibility
remained unimpeached,</i>

390
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,070
<i>Bobo and Milly lived out their days
together in the Central Park Zoo.</i>

391
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,734
Damn it.

392
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:01,241
All right, Ted, mic up.

393
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,784
Mic'd up and made up.

394
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:05,745
Red leather, yellow leather.

395
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,122
That wasn't very satisfying.

396
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,917
When I tell everyone this story,
I'm saying he was mugged by a monkey.

397
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,753
I'm gonna keep the banana
on a string thing. That was working.

398
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,808
Barney, enough with the lies.

399
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:19,300
You can't tack on a new ending 'cause
you're not satisfied with the wraps up.

400
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,609
Really?

401
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,386
Well, mark my words, Mosby.

402
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,418
Someday you'll be telling this story,
you'll see it my way.

403
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:29,660
Doubtful.

404
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:32,105
<i>And then, kids,
you'll never believe what happened.</i>

405
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,535
The monkey got loose!

406
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:36,276
He's got one of my dolls!

407
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:38,656
Come here, Bobo.

408
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,330
He's climbing the building!

409
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:55,099
Is this really happening?

410
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:56,704
Sure is, Ted.

411
00:20:58,321 --> 00:20:59,435
<i>True story.</i>
