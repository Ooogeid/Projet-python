1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:03,724
Kids, there is something
I wish my dad told me.

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:06,895
The longest pause
you will ever experience in your life

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:09,109
is the one that follows
asking the question...

4
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:10,514
Will you marry me?

5
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:15,018
Your brain goes into overdrive,
imaging every possible response.

6
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:16,937
No.

7
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:18,897
Oh, God, no.

8
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,180
You want me to marry...

9
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:25,610
No.

10
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:28,787
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't.

11
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:29,821
Mark Johnson,

12
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,916
the quarterback from your high school
football team, already asked me.

13
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:34,295
What's up, Turd?

14
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:36,067
It's Ted!

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,567
But if you're lucky,

16
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:42,279
she may answer with the single
greatest word in the English language.

17
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:43,600
Yes.

18
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:49,010
Synchro : ShalimarFox, Arrow

19
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,434
Stella and I spent that summer
happily engaged.

20
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:04,318
Marshall was still coping
with unemployment.

21
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:05,610
What are you doing?

22
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:09,711
Lily threw herself
into her painting.

23
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:11,273
What are you doing?

24
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:15,081
Barney was rehabilitating
from his bus accident.

25
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:16,663
What are you doing?

26
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:20,991
And well, Marshall just kept coping
with unemployment.

27
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:25,644
What are you doing?

28
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:31,303
And Robin continued to uphold the high
journalistic standards of Metro News 1.

29
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:36,838
Is your favorite brand of dental floss
poisoning your entire family?

30
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,498
Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking...

31
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,110
Tooth.

32
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:46,067
Okay, I officially hate my job.

33
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,324
I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who
shows up at night and scares people.

34
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:52,763
I'm the bogeyman
with a teleprompter.

35
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,870
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."

36
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,737
That's hilarious!
Great joke, Robin, great joke.

37
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,960
Barney, no offense to Robin,
but that wasn't that funny.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,572
Are you kidding?
That was a great joke.

39
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:09,223
It's smart, funny, beautiful,
the whole package.

40
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:11,782
It's everything you're afraid
to let yourself want.

41
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,585
In a joke.

42
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:18,159
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."

43
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:20,068
Classic.

44
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:25,745
Okay, what is so urgent
that you called me and begged me

45
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:28,476
to come over at 7:22 in the morning?

46
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:32,002
I could tell you knew something
was up with me, and you're right.

47
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:35,258
But I can't tell you what it is.
I should tell you, but I can't!

48
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:38,844
I have to. I never will! I'm going to.
Let's just drop it. What's up with you?

49
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,997
Barney, just say it.

50
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,086
I think I'm in love with Robin.

51
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:50,115
Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas
for Stella's wedding shower.

52
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:51,733
Does she like to cook?

53
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,770
Actually, I don't know.

54
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,745
What's her favorite color?

55
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:59,320
Don't know that either.

56
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,050
- Well, does she have any hobbies?
- Yes.

57
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,729
She's exactly the kind of person
who would have hobbies.

58
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:06,505
And interests, too.

59
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,746
I am one lucky son of a bitch.

60
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:09,728
Dude,

61
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,279
you don't know anything
about the woman you're marrying.

62
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,332
What?

63
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:14,948
You're crazy! I know plenty.

64
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,651
What color are her eyes?

65
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:20,287
The color of the ocean
after a storm.

66
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:21,538
Which is?

67
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,321
Beautiful.

68
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,249
I don't believe it.

69
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:31,474
I thought you called me over here
to uncuff you from your sex swing again,

70
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,204
but you're in love?

71
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:35,051
That is so sweet!

72
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,524
It's not "sweet."

73
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:38,555
It's like a disease.

74
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:41,474
I slept with Robin one time
and I caught feelings.

75
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:43,268
I caught feelings bad.

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,456
I used protection and everything.

77
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:50,024
Barney, you don't "catch" feelings,
you just have them.

78
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:52,649
- And they're good.
- They're terrible!

79
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,035
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

80
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,217
She's all I think about.
I close my eyes, I see Robin.

81
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:00,577
I, I hear a song;
it reminds me of Robin.

82
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:01,512
Morning.

83
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:04,366
I sleep with that chick,
I'm thinking about Robin.

84
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:08,209
Okay, so I don't know
every single detail about Stella.

85
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,592
What's really about?
Do you not like her or something?

86
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:13,757
No, Ted, I like Stella lot.
She's a Mets fan.

87
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:14,636
Really?

88
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,144
It's just that everything with you
has moved so fast.

89
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:19,119
You've only known
each other a few months.

90
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,573
Don't you think maybe you should
slow things down a little bit?

91
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,870
- Get to know each other better?
- I'll have a whole life

92
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,580
time to get to know her better.

93
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,521
Right now,
I know the one thing that I have to:

94
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:30,384
that I love her.

95
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,800
You love her?

96
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:34,208
Barney, how can you be in love,

97
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:36,613
and still be sleeping
with anything that moves?

98
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,693
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

99
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,403
That's like saying,

100
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:44,174
"How can an ant carry
"20 times its body weight,

101
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:46,276
but root beer floats
are still delicious?"

102
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:47,874
Are the two even related?

103
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:48,995
Really?

104
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:51,672
Barney, you're going to have
to stop screwing around

105
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,488
if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.

106
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:56,903
"Boyfriend"?

107
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:59,094
I don't want to be
Robin's boyfriend.

108
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:01,137
Well, what do you want, then?

109
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,640
I don't know.
I just want to be with her.

110
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,216
All the time.

111
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:08,441
I want to hear about her day
and tell her about mine.

112
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,648
I want to hold her hand
and smell her hair.

113
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:15,151
But I don't want to be
her stupid boyfriend.

114
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:17,881
Barney, what you just described

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,531
is a relationship between
a boyfriend and a girlfriend.

116
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:23,827
And a pretty clingy one at that.

117
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:27,066
Look, Lily, are you going to help me out
with this or not?

118
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:29,076
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

119
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,899
I see a confused, little kid in the
corner trying to eat the lefty scissors,

120
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,056
I gotta help the poor,
little bastard.

121
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,741
But only if you stop
sleeping around.

122
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:38,787
Deal?

123
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:40,844
Deal.

124
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:42,072
Coming up next,

125
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:46,692
is your local ice cream man actually
driving a roving meth lab on wheels?

126
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:48,922
Stay tuned for the full...

127
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,373
Scoop.

128
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:52,508
Really?

129
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:01,429
I know dudes think it's girlie
for a guy to cook, but us ladies?

130
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:04,326
- We find it mighty sexy.
- Really?

131
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:05,619
You know...

132
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:07,832
My grandma taught me how.

133
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,730
- Oh, yeah, she did.
- Yeah.

134
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,959
I had a lot of time after school
to watch her cook because

135
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,544
I wasn't good at sports.

136
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:16,922
I'm on fire right now.

137
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,470
Delicious. What's in this pesto?

138
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:26,653
Oh, you know, the usual:
basil, garlic, olive oil,

139
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,892
but can you guess
my secret ingredient?

140
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:30,168
Peanuts.

141
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:31,980
Yes. How did you know that?

142
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:40,654
- OK, let's my think, what else?
- You know what, sweetie?

143
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:43,500
I woke up so early
and I had a really long day at work.

144
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,132
And there was that whole thing
where you tried to kill me.

145
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,712
Can we please just go to sleep?

146
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:50,393
No, I clearly need
to know more about you.

147
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,582
Let's do firsts. First kiss?

148
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:54,858
Dale Harris, second grade.

149
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,296
You're talking like peck on the cheek
or a full-on passionate making out?

150
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:01,332
- Passionate making out.
- OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.

151
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,099
First time you had sex.

152
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,056
- Dale Harris, second...
- Stop it.

153
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,222
Billy Devito,
sophomore year of college.

154
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:08,248
Prude.

155
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,693
Molly McKenzie,
junior year of high school.

156
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:11,663
Slut.

157
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,771
Robin just needs
to see this new see of you.

158
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:17,107
- So just call her up?
- Just call her up.

159
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:20,715
It's...

160
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:23,818
Hi, Robin.

161
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,243
She wasn't there.
I left a voice mail.

162
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:30,437
You left a voice,
but it wasn't male.

163
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,533
Barney, I don't get it.

164
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,032
You've called a million girls
a million times.

165
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:36,792
Yeah,
but those were just booty calls.

166
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:39,129
On a booty call,
you barely even have to talk.

167
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:42,425
Around 9:00 p.m., you say...
Hey, baby, it's Barney.

168
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,358
You busy tonight? Sweet.

169
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,634
See you in half an hour? Can't wait.

170
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,616
But the later it gets,
the fewer words you need.

171
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,504
Barney. Busy? Sweet.

172
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,553
And by 3:00 in the morning...

173
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,174
Sweet.

174
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:03,822
A question mark?

175
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,989
You got laid off a question mark?

176
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:11,911
It's no worse
than your super-obvious code words.

177
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:15,511
- Rhinoceros.
- We have to go.

178
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,793
Great. Now we need a new code word.

179
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,972
Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin.
What do I do?

180
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:25,050
No-no-no-no, aah!
Robin...

181
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,044
Great to hear from you.

182
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,262
To what do I owe the pleasure?

183
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:32,333
You called, went, and hung up.

184
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:33,582
What do you want?

185
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:34,809
Help me!

186
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,252
Just ask her something.

187
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,523
How are you feeling today?

188
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:41,940
Fine.

189
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,548
Something personal.

190
00:08:45,455 --> 00:08:48,239
At what age
did you first get your period?

191
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:50,992
Did you just ask me
about about my period?

192
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:52,536
No, I did not.

193
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,799
Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.

194
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,506
Just ask her out.

195
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,538
Robin, I was wondering if...

196
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:05,548
Nothing. Gotta go. Bye.

197
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,790
That was just a practical joke.

198
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,711
I'm not really in love with Robin.

199
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,873
You should've seen
the look on your face.

200
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:16,580
There's cameras right there
and there and there.

201
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:21,856
What a legendary prank that
we're never going to speak of again.

202
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:28,382
Gross.

203
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,994
- First movie you ever saw.
- Benji,1981.

204
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:37,871
I watched it recently
with Lucy and I just thought,

205
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:40,583
"Oh, that dog is so dead right now."

206
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:42,914
What about you?

207
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:45,964
My dad took me to an old drive-in
to see the original Star Wars.

208
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,758
You know,
I've actually never seen Star Wars.

209
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:51,219
She's never seen Star Wars?!

210
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:53,027
Ted, the only people in the universe

211
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:55,372
who haven't seen Star Wars
are the characters,

212
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:57,093
and that's 'cause they lived them.

213
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:00,369
- That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars.
- You've got to calm down.

214
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,224
I told you. You didn't know
this girl well enough. What if...

215
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,838
- you show it{\to her}, she doesn't like it?
- Dude, it's just a movie.

216
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:09,494
Star Warsis your all-time
favorite movie,

217
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:11,919
and whether or not Stella likes
it is {\actually}important.

218
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:14,450
It's like, it's a test
of how compatible you guys are.

219
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,742
It's just a movie.

220
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:18,622
It's just a movie!

221
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:22,597
<i>121 awesome minutes later</i>

222
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,194
If Stella doesn't like this movie,

223
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:27,038
- I can't marry her.
- You can't.

224
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:29,625
- You want to watch it again?
- I do.

225
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:39,448
Where are the boys?
I thought this was a group thing.

226
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:42,311
I lied. They're not coming
and I'm about to leave.

227
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:43,390
Why?

228
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,356
Because...

229
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:47,067
they're not in love with Robin,
and neither am I.

230
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:49,606
I mean, she's great and sweet.

231
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:52,447
I'm not going to pretend
that I haven't noticed her body,

232
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,824
but this is off topic.
Good luck.

233
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,583
Wait, wait, I
can't do this.

234
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,734
She'll never take me seriously.
She thinks I'm some

235
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,121
womanizing idiot.

236
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,652
We both know
you're more than that.

237
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:05,561
How Robin the Barney
I met the other day.

238
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,772
You mean the insecure,
touchy-feely she-male

239
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:10,968
who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?

240
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,444
Ted hit that for over a year.

241
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,637
Wish me luck.

242
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:19,235
I just thought it'd be fun
to watch a movie tonight,

243
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:22,415
and since you've never seen Star Wars,
I figured why not?

244
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:23,826
No big deal.

245
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:25,505
It's pretty good.

246
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:27,399
Sounds like a plan.

247
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:34,902
I'm just grab a beer.
You want one?

248
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:37,016
The movie's already started, so...

249
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:40,495
It's some words flying through space.
I'm not going to read that anyway.

250
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:41,621
Oh, my God.

251
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:43,236
Off to a bad start.

252
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,838
What are you doing down there?

253
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,411
I'm making sure my best friend
is marrying the right woman.

254
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:49,837
That's what I'm doing.

255
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:51,931
What are you doing,
hiding behind the couch?

256
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,300
You need to get a job.

257
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:56,742
I really do, don't I?

258
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,920
So, Robin...

259
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:02,225
tell me about your day,

260
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:05,899
and not just what happened,
how you felt about what happened.

261
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:09,468
- What?
- I'm not looking to problem-solve,

262
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:11,151
I'm just looking to listen.

263
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:15,237
- Why are you acting like this?
- Like what?

264
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:17,789
You're being super nice. It's...

265
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,706
freaking me out. Be...

266
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:22,767
gross, be inappropriate.
Be Barney.

267
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:24,461
I'm being Barney,

268
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:27,715
and I think tonight's going to be

269
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:29,818
de... wait for it... lightful.

270
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:32,249
Delightful.

271
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:34,124
Right.

272
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,096
So I went
to the chiropractor yesterday.

273
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:43,558
That guy bent me over the table
and pounded me for a good hour.

274
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,134
Is insurance going to cover that?
Sometimes they don't.

275
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:50,840
That's it?

276
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:56,416
Today I was at the dentist.

277
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:58,719
That guy drilled me

278
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:00,550
all day long.

279
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:02,869
He drilled me hard.

280
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,596
He filled all of my cavities.

281
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:07,207
Come on, man.

282
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:10,442
- Your teeth look fantastic.
- Who are you?

283
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:20,054
What?

284
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,092
Nothing.

285
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,774
You were staring
at me.

286
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,140
You look really beautiful tonight.

287
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,267
You don't look
so bad yourself, mister.

288
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:34,252
Great scene, great scene.

289
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,613
Star Wars fun fact number seven...

290
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,549
George Lucas based
the film's structure

291
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:42,867
on Akira Kurosawa's
The Hidden Fortress.

292
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:46,037
He also owes a debt to Campbell's work
with comparative mythology.

293
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:48,269
Yeah, Ted,
I'm losing wood over here.

294
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,647
What's going on?

295
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,929
Nothing.

296
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:53,413
Wait, it's

297
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:56,339
really important to you
that I like this movie, isn't it?

298
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,720
I'm not gonna like it with you
staring at me the whole time.

299
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:05,411
Go to your room
and I will come get you when it's over.

300
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,531
Go.

301
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,093
Should I leave, too?

302
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,571
What part, what part?

303
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:26,645
Thanks.

304
00:14:27,838 --> 00:14:28,838
Nothing?

305
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:30,409
Not even a glance?

306
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,218
Even I was thinking about rocking
a motorboat on those bad boys.

307
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:36,171
What the hell is wrong with you?

308
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:40,453
I don't always want to be that guy.
Sometimes I want to be someone

309
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,469
you can have
an actual conversation with.

310
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,644
Now, tell me something about you
that I don't know yet.

311
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:48,183
Seriously.

312
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,291
There's a job opening
at a new cable network

313
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,317
that would be perfect for me...

314
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,895
completely legit world news, interviews
with people who matter...

315
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,033
- but I decided I'm not going to apply.
- Why not?

316
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,638
Because I'm a joke.

317
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:10,872
I'm just the scary news lady
from some stupid local news channel.

318
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,667
We both know you're more than that.

319
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:16,419
Promise me you'll apply.

320
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:20,507
- It's not as easy...
- Promise me you'll apply.

321
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,270
I promise.

322
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:30,698
She's up to the scene
where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape

323
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:33,365
- from the Death Star's trash compactor.
- Great scene.

324
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:35,105
Greatscene?

325
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:39,878
Okay, we should have just heard...

326
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:47,033
but Stella didn't make a peep.
I'm gonna take a look.

327
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:58,377
She's not even watching.
She's texting.

328
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,755
- I'll tell her you {\still}want to be friends.
- I don't believe this.

329
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:05,296
I believe, she knows this is important
to me. She's blatantly...

330
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:10,640
"Stop watching me, jackasses."

331
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:14,662
- To taking chances.
- To taking chances.

332
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:21,503
You know, Robin, there's {\actually}something,
I do want to talk to you about.

333
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:23,887
- Last call.
- Of course it is.

334
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,239
- One more for the road?
- Yeah, why not?

335
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:27,966
Hold that thought?

336
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:31,768
I will.

337
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:41,951
- I loved it.
- Yes!

338
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,572
I am marrying a woman
who is not only hot

339
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,928
but loves Star Wars.
That's the dream.

340
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,986
- What was that?
- I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me

341
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:55,136
through the space-time continuum.
We did it.

342
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:58,313
We did it,
you masturbating little bastard.

343
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,188
Champagne for everybody.

344
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:04,509
It was so good.

345
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:07,347
- You hated it, didn't you?
- It's so stupid. First of all,

346
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:10,575
how do they understand that walking bear
they hang around with all the time?

347
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:12,286
- Wookiee.
- He goes...

348
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,011
They're all like,
"That's a good point, Bear,

349
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:18,044
- "let's try that."
- He's a Wookiee,

350
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:21,146
and his kind is actually
more intelligent than they appear.

351
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,957
That is Ted's favorite movie
of all time.

352
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,411
He watches it
when he's home sick with the flu.

353
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:31,460
He watches it on rainy
Sunday afternoons in the fall.

354
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,390
He watches it on Christmas Eve.

355
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:37,569
Ted watches Star Wars
in sickness and in health,

356
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,479
in good times and in bad.

357
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:44,177
Do you really think that you can pretend
to like a movie that you actually hate

358
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,022
for the rest of your life?

359
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:51,739
I do.

360
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:55,203
Then, Ted's a lucky guy.

361
00:18:00,202 --> 00:18:01,202
Bear.

362
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:06,725
So, here's the deal.

363
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:09,461
April, have... you met Barney?

364
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,557
April just finished her shift,
she's looking to blow off some steam.

365
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,662
Would you excuse us for one sec?

366
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:23,466
- What are you doing?
- You were so nice to me tonight,

367
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:25,900
I wanted to return the favor,
wingwoman-style.

368
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:28,486
So, as I was saying,

369
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:31,008
Barney is the Yankees'
new second-baseman.

370
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:35,061
And Barney, April asked if tomorrow,
you could hit a goal for her

371
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,034
during the baseball match.

372
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:39,205
You can't make this stuff up.

373
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:41,850
So, you two kids have fun.

374
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:46,838
So are you...
nervous about the game?

375
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:48,965
Yeah, I'm nervous
for the other team

376
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:52,052
'cause when I step
up to that plate...

377
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,723
I am not a New York Yankee.

378
00:18:57,884 --> 00:19:00,535
Any other night, I would {\probably}try
to convince you that I am, but I'm not.

379
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:03,994
I'm just some guy who's in love
with the girl that just left,

380
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:07,078
and she's never going
to feel the same way.

381
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:10,774
So I'm just going to go.

382
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:13,463
And that was it.

383
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,241
I'm so sorry, Barney.

384
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,851
You can't give up.

385
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:22,248
You know, it may take some time,
but once Robin sees the new you...

386
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:27,045
When my family gets to Yankee Stadium,
are the tickets under your name or mine?

387
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:29,695
My name, and tell your
nephews to bring their mitts.

388
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,633
They're going to be
in foul ball country.

389
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,347
Come on.
The Robin stuff was completely true.

390
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:39,851
Damn it, Barney.

391
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,080
I mean, for the last time,

392
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,209
you can't... you can't

393
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:46,506
be in love with Robin
and still be sleeping

394
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,492
with every bimbo on the planet.

395
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:50,277
You have to choose right now.

396
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:53,905
- I choose bimbos.
- What?

397
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:58,354
Bimbos make me happy.
Bimbos make me feel alive.

398
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:02,706
Bimbos make me want
to pretend to be a better man.

399
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:06,832
This whole thing with Robin was just
a fling, but at the end of the day,

400
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:08,335
my heart belongs to bimbos.

401
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:12,090
This is just a defense mechanism,
because

402
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,343
you're afraid of getting hurt.
You're just confused.

403
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:17,139
Oh, I'm not confused.

404
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:19,428
You know who is confused?

405
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:20,929
Bimbos.

406
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,017
They're easily confused.
It's one of the thousand little things

407
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:25,498
I love about them.

408
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,801
I love their vacant,

409
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:31,768
trusting stares, their sluggish,
unencumbered minds,

410
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,251
their unresolved daddy issues.

411
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,240
I love them and they love me.

412
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:41,707
Bimbos have always been there for me,
through thick and thin.

413
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:44,539
Mostly thin.
B- man don't do thick crust.

414
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:45,665
What up?

415
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:46,957
See you, Barney.
