1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:01,143
Well...

2
00:00:02,804 --> 00:00:03,947
got another one.

3
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:05,671
- Boy.
- What's in the box?

4
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:08,823
What's in the box?
What's in the box?

5
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:10,398
What's in the box?!

6
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:12,094
Right?

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,555
Brad Pitt... <i>Seven</i>?

8
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:16,838
Nothing?

9
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:18,413
Yeah, I'm the jerk.

10
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:20,144
What's in the box?

11
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,255
Since Marshall
and Lily got their own place,

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,024
his mom keeps sending them boxes
of his stuff she's trying to get rid of.

13
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:28,335
Thanks, Mom.
You really nailed it this time.

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,875
I really needed <i>He-Man</i>'s right arm

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,282
and this old book of Mad Libs.

16
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:38,523
"Fart went to the fart
to fart fartly."

17
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:39,955
That's nice.

18
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,207
That's good stuff.

19
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:43,668
Thanks, Mom.

20
00:00:51,024 --> 00:00:53,344
The window is open.

21
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:59,183
- What?
- The window is open.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,690
The window is open.

23
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:08,023
What are you waiting for?
Run, Ted, run!

24
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:14,564
Lily, the window is open.

25
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:16,189
Make a hole, people.

26
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,167
Run, Ted, run!

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,046
I was just...

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,049
you know...
How are you?

29
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:33,968
I'm fine, I guess.

30
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:37,239
Actually, no, I'm not fine.

31
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,973
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

32
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,923
I'm so sorry to hear that.

33
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:46,759
You want to hang out tonight?

34
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:48,983
Sure.

35
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,421
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

36
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,871
.:: La Fabrique ::.

37
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:04,331
- So fun. You guys liked it.
- It was the most...

38
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:07,341
- Please tell me you got in the window.
- I got in the window.

39
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,795
What is going on?
What is the window?

40
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:13,497
You know how everyone has that guy
or girl who, no matter what happens,

41
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,885
you always rember them
being the perfect one for you?

42
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:17,928
- Mike Schatz.
- Lily.

43
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,542
That girl right over there.

44
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,405
Well, that girl for me was,
and still is...

45
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,453
- Maggie Wilks.
- We all went to college together.

46
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:28,647
She was awesome.
Everybody loved her.

47
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:31,806
I think I know what
we're dealing with here.

48
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,071
Tell me when to stop.

49
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,999
It wasn't that Maggie was hot.

50
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,992
- She was...
- The ultimate girl next door.

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,661
She was the ultimate girl next door.
Still is.

52
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,331
Every guy who meets Maggie
falls madly in love with her.

53
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,560
And that's the problem.
Since I've known her,

54
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,276
she's only been single for, like,

55
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:51,962
three brief windows of opportunity.

56
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:55,841
<i>When she moved here and broke up
with her boyfriend, I waited a month.</i>

57
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,982
<i>You know, so I wouldn't
be the rebound guy.</i>

58
00:02:58,107 --> 00:03:01,153
<i>Well, the rebound guy
lasted two years.</i>

59
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,850
<i>After they broke up,
I only waited a week.</i>

60
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:06,675
<i>I was still too late.</i>

61
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,100
<i>She dated that guy for three years.</i>

62
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:11,732
The next time,
I wasn't messing around.

63
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:15,482
I was at her door not one hour
after they broke up.

64
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:17,016
The only thing she did

65
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,435
between becoming single

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,575
and the moment I got there was
go downstairs and check her mail.

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,911
<i>I was still too late.</i>

68
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,497
<i>And she dated that guy
for four years.</i>

69
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:32,095
<i>I wasn't going to let this happen again,
so I begged her neighbor, Mrs. Douglas,</i>

70
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,296
<i>to call me the second
she and David broke up.</i>

71
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:38,121
And now, a very single
and available Maggie Wilks

72
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:39,927
is on her way to this very spot.

73
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,938
I sent a cab with a female driver,
so she'd have

74
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:45,289
no other interaction with a man
until she got to me.

75
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,583
Where she'll still have
no interaction with a man.

76
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,708
What up?

77
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,106
I feel good tonight.
Tonight's going to be good.

78
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,110
Hell, yeah!

79
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,503
It's my overalls.

80
00:03:57,628 --> 00:04:00,364
I wore these babies all throughout
high school. These were my jam.

81
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:03,909
God, you really were a virgin
before you met Lily, weren't you?

82
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:07,843
- That's unnecessary.
- She's right, baby.

83
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:09,927
If you had worn
these things in college,

84
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:11,897
even I wouldn't have slept with you.

85
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:13,919
And, if you recall,
I was good to go.

86
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:17,022
No one...
I mean no one...

87
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:19,166
could get laid wearing these.

88
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,427
Challenge accepted.

89
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,307
I, Barney Stinson,

90
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,694
being of sound mind
and amazing body,

91
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,643
will wear these overalls
until I have sex with a woman.

92
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:33,564
I actually dated that guy.

93
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:35,995
Quick game plan.

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,338
Maggie shows up, couple minutes
of hugs and hi's,

95
00:04:38,463 --> 00:04:41,096
and then everybody's out of here.
This is my one shot.

96
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:43,032
I am not gonna screw this up.

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,523
- Who'd you get to cover your class?
- Crap!

98
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:46,733
Oh, my God!

99
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:50,479
Oh, my goodness.

100
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:53,584
Stranger.
Maggie, this is my roommate, Robin.

101
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,718
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

102
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,714
I totally forgot,
I have to teach a class tonight.

103
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:02,718
Want to come with me and check out
a real "elive architecture class?

104
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:05,117
Not even a little bit.

105
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:07,772
You know, I'll just hang here
with Marshall. It'll be fun.

106
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:08,724
Fantastic.

107
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,632
Well, have a seat.
Relax.

108
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:12,983
Yeah, this is casual.

109
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:16,982
This is all very, very, very casual.

110
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,884
You want me to find the perfect girl
so we can all grow old together?

111
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:20,903
That is her.

112
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:24,697
Do not let any guy near her, okay?
That means no waiter takes her order,

113
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:27,337
no busboy clears her table.
If she bursts into flames,

114
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:29,745
I want a firewoman putting her out.

115
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,958
I don't think 911 takes requests.

116
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,311
Damn it, Marshall!
Whatever you have to do,

117
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:37,211
keep Maggie Wilks single
until I get back.

118
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:42,758
I left my tab open.
Don't abuse it.

119
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,950
- Target secure?
- Target secure.

120
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:55,437
Oh, my gosh.
How weird.

121
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,637
We all walked out of the bathroom
at the same time.

122
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:01,107
Let's all walk back
to the booth together.

123
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:04,144
Oh, my.

124
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,032
Look at this, the table
where we are sitting.

125
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Back off!

126
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:14,427
Okay, not that I care
about this challenge,

127
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:16,792
but it's cheating to wear
overalls over a suit.

128
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,521
No, it's not. They're not called
over T-shirts, Robin.

129
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,925
They're not called over shirtless fat
guys who used to come fix my mom's car

130
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,438
and then hang out with her
upstairs for a little while.

131
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,959
They're called overalls, okay?

132
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,205
And I can wear them over
whatever I want.

133
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,317
He's not saying hello.

134
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:36,645
He's just telling you
what he feeds his horsies.

135
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:42,489
Man, I can sit here and make
you-look-like-a-farmer jokes

136
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:45,404
all night.
Challenge accepted.

137
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:49,781
Good evening. Tonight, we're gonna have
a nice, quick class on bridges.

138
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:53,839
There are 6 types: Beam, cantilever,
arch, suspension, and 2 others.

139
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:57,041
You got land on both sides, water
in the middle. See you all next week.

140
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,037
We get you for the whole hour.

141
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,001
Come on. 
Who really wants to sit here

142
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,921
and listen to me yap about bridges?

143
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:05,376
Really?

144
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:09,723
I just thought about
how awesome Ted is again.

145
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,308
This is a weird drinking game.

146
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:16,167
Can I buy you a drink?

147
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:19,730
He's got a big brown jug
with three X's on it.

148
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:21,593
What have I done?

149
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,778
One very important thing
to keep in mind

150
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,480
when designing a bridge...

151
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:34,760
I mean, yes.

152
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:37,698
Yes, when you're designing a bridge,
always rember:

153
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:40,292
make adjustments...

154
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,337
... go get it energized.

155
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:47,758
That's good advice for life, too.

156
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:49,957
So, Professor Mosby,

157
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,471
is this Maggie someone special?

158
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,188
She's just this girl I've been
into for a really long time,

159
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:01,571
and, tonight could be the one chance
I have to go out with her, so...

160
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,234
Is she a hottie?

161
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,874
Yes, Jamie.
She's very attractive.

162
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,030
And if we can just
end class right now...

163
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:15,241
Maggie may finally be available,
but what about you, Professor Mosby?

164
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:17,830
Are you ready
for a serious relationship?

165
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:19,331
Totally.

166
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:22,271
I mean, I think so.

167
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:23,547
Maybe.

168
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,016
I don't know.
What do you guys think?

169
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,052
Oh, my gosh.
I totally forgot about this.

170
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:34,278
- What is it?
- It's a homework assignment

171
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:35,596
from when I was 15.

172
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,980
Write a letter
to your 30-year-old self

173
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:40,049
with a list of goals
you hope to achieve.

174
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:43,584
Dear Future Me.

175
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,014
First off,
you'd better be driving either

176
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:49,113
a kick-ass Camaro or the A-Team van.

177
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,779
That's priority numero uno.

178
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:55,365
And by now your rat tail should
hang down to your freakin' knees.

179
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,285
You can still slam-dunk, obviously,

180
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,403
and you've legally changed
your name to "Vanilla Thunder."

181
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,174
Your wife...
let me break it down:

182
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,184
blonde, six feet tall,

183
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,672
has an awesome rack and caters
to your every need.

184
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,822
- Sorry, babe.
- That's OK.

185
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:14,511
You just described your mother.

186
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:15,637
Keep going.

187
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,076
You're still rocking... you're still
rocking the stone-washed overalls,

188
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,429
because this look is working.

189
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:23,882
And most importantly,

190
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:25,647
you'd better be saving the world.

191
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:28,140
If you became some lame,
corporate sellout,

192
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,683
just throw yourself off a cliff

193
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:32,326
because you suck.

194
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:36,254
And I licky boom-boom down.

195
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,208
Yeah, hilarious.

196
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,376
I became a lame, corporate sellout.

197
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:49,588
I work for GNB, the most evil bank
in the history of the world.

198
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,912
Come on, Vanilla Thunder, everyone's
got to grow up and get a real job.

199
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:55,963
Yeah, I remember back
in college Maggie wanted to be

200
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:59,640
a marine biologist by day and mentor

201
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,308
inner-city kids by night.

202
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,561
Those things.

203
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,235
Baby, where are you going?

204
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,442
I gotta do something at work.

205
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,017
It won't take long.

206
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:17,115
What's up with him?

207
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:22,287
I think he's going to quit his job.

208
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,384
I'm sorry, Maggie.
I gotta go stop him.

209
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,694
Ted, I had to leave the bar,
but it's okay.

210
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:39,721
I left Maggie with Robin.

211
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,295
You left Maggie with Robin?

212
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:43,684
Relax.

213
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,944
- I've got things under control.
- You don't understand the situation.

214
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:50,190
This girl is like
a super-powered man magnet.

215
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,756
I know a little something
about man magnets.

216
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,734
Your friend may be
one of those magnets

217
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:58,086
that can hold up a picture of your kids
on the fridge,

218
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:01,994
but I'm one of those magnets
that can pick up cars in a junkyard.

219
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:04,663
Who's this?

220
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,873
Jim, a good friend of mine
from work.

221
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,044
Nice to meet you.

222
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:19,261
What does being "ready" even mean?

223
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,432
I thought I was "ready" last year.
I wound up getting left at the altar.

224
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,120
I'll be honest, guys.

225
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:28,228
I'm a little scared.

226
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:31,356
Louis, then Betty.

227
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:34,234
We're all scared, Professor Mosby.

228
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,405
Doesn't being scared let you know
you're on to something important?

229
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:44,006
I mean, if you're not scared,
you're not taking a chance.

230
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:47,534
And if you're not taking a chance,
then what the hell are you doing?

231
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:48,414
Right?

232
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,128
You're ready, bro.

233
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,636
Jim, you are so funny.

234
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,623
Funny? I think he's hilarious.

235
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,893
In fact, I laughed so hard,
I think I may have just peed my pants.

236
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:13,565
I'd better take off.

237
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:17,314
To the opening of a photography exhibit
they were talking about at work:

238
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,071
Les Chiens Erotique.

239
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:21,823
- I have an extra ticket...
- Me?!

240
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,045
I'd love to!

241
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:27,982
All right, I gotta go.

242
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,791
One last piece of advice.

243
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,617
Make adjustments...

244
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,087
Go get it energized!

245
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:46,244
- Ted, change of plans.
- You left her with Barney?!

246
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,225
Ted, will you take it easy?

247
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,537
- I'm your bro.
- You're an animal.

248
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,717
And even though our bro-lationship
has suffered its setbacks in this area,

249
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:57,319
I assure you I will be
the perfect gentleman.

250
00:12:58,261 --> 00:12:58,985
Thanks.

251
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,071
I really like those overalls.

252
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,532
You have ten minutes
or the window's closing.

253
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,800
Ten minutes?

254
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,128
Because we're bros.

255
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,896
<i>While I was racing through New York,
trying to get back to the bar,</i>

256
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:19,429
<i>your Aunt Robin was doing her best
to keep Jim away from Maggie.</i>

257
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,195
Wanna go back to the bar
and see if Maggie's still there?

258
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,971
No way!
I love erotic dog photography.

259
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,601
Did you see the one over there
of the corgies doing it people style?

260
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,437
I'll get us a taxi.
I feel bad leaving Maggie all alone.

261
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,398
Let's have a glass of wine first.

262
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:46,212
Look how filthy I am.

263
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:47,909
I am just a...

264
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,885
a filthy, filthy girl

265
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,612
who would totally go to second base
with a guy as a favor to a friend.

266
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,900
You like that?

267
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,404
I'm going to call Maggie,
see what she's doing.

268
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,679
Give it a rest, jeez!
She's hanging out with Ted tonight.

269
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:09,723
Ted? What about David?

270
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,807
They broke up.

271
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:12,746
Maggie's single?

272
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:14,352
That doesn't sound familiar.

273
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:19,636
Can I help wipe that off?

274
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:22,019
Please?

275
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,133
I hate Barney Stinson!

276
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:28,074
Me, too!

277
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:33,747
<i>Lily finally got to GNB,
but the place was deserted.</i>

278
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,092
Thought you came here to quit your job.
I forgot about the hoop.

279
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:50,003
I thought if I could just do
one thing in that letter,

280
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,873
I wouldn't feel like
such an old sellout,

281
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:56,353
- so I came out here to dunk.
- Did it make you feel better?

282
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:59,384
I barely grazed
the bottom of the net,

283
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:02,025
and now my legs hurt so bad,
I can't even fall down.

284
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:04,786
I'm gonna.

285
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,364
How could you?

286
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,473
I challenged myself
to get laid wearing overalls.

287
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:14,037
And if you stand in my way,
then you're letting Barney win.

288
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,332
You don't want that. That son of a bitch
will never let us hear the end.

289
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:19,292
Thank God.
Maggie...

290
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,127
Where do you think you're going?

291
00:15:21,691 --> 00:15:24,211
- To tell that girl I love her.
- Get in line, bub.

292
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,861
I'll have sex with her,
then he'll tell her he loves her,

293
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:29,678
and then you can do whatever you want.
Do we agree on the order?

294
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,429
Mister!

295
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:34,572
You just missed out
on the night of your life.

296
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:36,497
The night...

297
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,358
of your life.

298
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:47,647
- I've been in love for five years.
- I've been love for 12 years.

299
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:50,198
I've been in these overalls
for an hour and a half.

300
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,953
Maybe you can't dunk anymore.

301
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,460
But you've achieved more
in your 30 years

302
00:15:57,585 --> 00:16:00,535
than that 15-year-old dweeb
could ever dream of.

303
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,895
You put yourself
through Columbia Law School.

304
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,589
You had the sense
to chop off that stupid rat tail.

305
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:06,715
And...

306
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,010
you married a smoking-hot chick
who looks nothing like your mother.

307
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:15,015
I think that earns you
an entire foot closer to dunking.

308
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,227
There you go, Vanilla Thunder.

309
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:22,314
Step back.

310
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,596
How about instead of dunking,
we go up to your office,

311
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:43,664
and you lie very still
while I go bananas all over you?

312
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,842
Could we maybe instead
just do it right here?

313
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:48,298
Sure, baby.

314
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,717
She loves me!

315
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:52,844
We have to figure this out.

316
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,971
We're dealing
with a small window of opportunity.

317
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,705
If you let me in there,

318
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,142
that window's gonna open up again
in ten minutes.

319
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:02,646
Wait, where's Maggie?

320
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,856
She's gone.
I sent her home.

321
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,984
You were like vultures fighting.
Let her be single for once.

322
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,052
- Jealous bitch!
- Robin, how could you?

323
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:11,624
No, she's right.

324
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,464
Maggie deserves
some time to herself.

325
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,564
Nobody likes to be alone,
especially after a breakup,

326
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,919
but that's when we discover
who we really are and...

327
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:23,881
what we really want.

328
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:25,788
She deserves that.

329
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,170
<i>And kids, I meant that.</i>

330
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,714
<i>Which is why I'm not proud of
what happened next.</i>

331
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,704
It's around the corner.

332
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,817
Sorry.
Class ran a little...

333
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:51,671
- Who's this?
- This is Adam.

334
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,238
It's so crazy.

335
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,592
We grew up next door to each other.
We haven't seen each other since...

336
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,280
A long time.

337
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,696
<i>And then Maggie Wilks told us</i>

338
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,135
<i>the second-greatest love story
I've ever heard.</i>

339
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:32,026
I just moved to town
and I had to look her up.

340
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:35,864
I guess
we've got a lot of catching up to do.

341
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:37,574
Of course.

342
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:38,819
<i>So, kids,</i>

343
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:41,456
<i>I missed out
on the ultimate girl next door...</i>

344
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,186
<i>to the guy next door.</i>

345
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:45,999
See you next time.

346
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,679
<i>There was no "next time".</i>

347
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,637
<i>Maggie's window never opened again.</i>

348
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,429
I got it!

349
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:02,676
That country bar, Giddy-Ups!
The overalls have gotta work there.

350
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:03,801
Wingman me?

351
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,185
I don't want Giddy-Ups.

352
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:07,616
I want that.

353
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:11,670
I forgot what it feels like
to chase the real thing, but...

354
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,444
I think I'm ready again.

355
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:20,047
Let me tell you where I'm at.

356
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:24,468
I want to have sex with a girl
so I can take off these overalls.

357
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:27,739
Come on.

358
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,215
You gotta help me!

359
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,342
I gotta get these damn things off!

360
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:39,144
I just love your overalls.

361
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,575
<i>Dear 60-year-old Marshall.</i>

362
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,970
<i>You should be working somewhere
that's making the world a better place,</i>

363
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:07,525
<i>or at least trying to.</i>

364
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:09,937
<i>No pressure, dude.
I mean, sir.</i>

365
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,586
<i>Also,</i>

366
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:14,743
<i>if time travel is possible,</i>

367
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:17,506
<i>maybe you could give me
a little sign</i>

368
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:19,634
<i>on Tuesday, December 8, at...</i>

369
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:22,297
8:29 p.m.

370
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:31,244
So, someone sent back
these chicken wings,

371
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,326
because they were too hot.
And I'm like,

372
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:35,586
"Too hot? Are you crazy?"

373
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,711
So, free wings.

374
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,526
<i>Old Man Marshall, as long as
you're still married to Lily,</i>

375
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,704
<i>you're doing just fine.</i>

376
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,206
Sir, this is on us.
Sorry the wings were so hot.

377
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:53,862
It wasn't that they were too hot.

378
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:56,170
It's just that I had wings earlier.

379
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:59,413
Much earlier.
