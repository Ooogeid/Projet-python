1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,777
As you know,

2
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:04,713
all faculty at Greendale
are required to give extra credit

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,749
to students who organize
academically-related events

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:11,632
during what would otherwise
be known as our "free time".

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,182
No student in any department
has ever exercised this option.

6
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:18,100
Until now.

7
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,598
Tonight in the library,

8
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,369
I will be hosting
a <i>día de los muertos</i> party.

9
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:27,735
- Relax.
- <i>Día de los muertos</i>,

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,571
or day of the dead,

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,240
is sometimes referred
to as Mexican Halloween.

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,506
Which is quite offensive
to people familiar

13
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,786
with "Mexican Halloween"
as a sexual position.

14
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:40,615
At any rate, if you show up,
you get extra credit.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,773
Me, I don't even get paid.

16
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:44,656
See you tonight.

17
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:54,543
Most of you responded to my e-vite,
but some of you remain "e-vasive",

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,298
- so...
- Count me in.

19
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,641
This is my first college party.
I got some tequila,

20
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,358
and I just rented
<i>Van Wilder 2: The Rise Of Taj</i>,

21
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:02,478
and look.

22
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:06,383
- You took off your wedding ring.
- My husband's been gone for 6 months,

23
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:08,776
so I think it's time for me
to embrace being single.

24
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:10,152
Message received.

25
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,947
Still waiting to hear
from Jeff and Pierce.

26
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:16,664
I thought I'd shout you a response
from this pocket phone here.

27
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:19,286
- Access email.
- You're not going to Annie's party?

28
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:22,872
I have a conflict.
With the enjoyment of my life.

29
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,293
I cannot figure out
the voice command part

30
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,762
of this thing.
It's like I'm my mother.

31
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,267
<i>Calling mother.</i>

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,334
- What?
- Speaking of enjoying life,

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,112
I don't wannabe
at a dead horse here,

34
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:36,705
but are you sure you don't
see anything non-platonic

35
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,597
- ever crystallizing between us?
- Yep.

36
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:41,026
Good, cause one of my professors
is really hot,

37
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:43,602
- I wanted to give you right of refusal.
- <i>Hello, Pierce?</i>

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,884
- Mom?
- <i>How's school going? Are you popular?</i>

39
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:50,152
I'm headed through a tunnel
right now.

40
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:56,181
- Wrong number.
- <i>Has that Jeff stopped teasing you?</i>

41
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,358
<i>How's your Canadian girlfriend?</i>

42
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,205
<i>I saw your father's ghost again.
He's still angry.</i>

43
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:33,261
The Bernoulli distribution
is the number of successes

44
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:37,409
in a sequence
of independent yes-no experiments.

45
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:42,077
For the quiz Monday, brush up
on chapters three and four.

46
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,215
Bernoulli's one of my favorites.

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,774
Little-known fact,
statistics were not his only love.

48
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:52,379
He's also famous for his French sauce
used on meat and poultry.

49
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:55,466
- That's bearnaise.
- Need to settle this at a restaurant.

50
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:57,982
It's cute. A little aggressive,

51
00:02:58,107 --> 00:03:01,263
but as a confident woman of authority,
I'm attracted to men who take charge.

52
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:05,434
- You sarcastic, or am I nailing it?
- You were nailing it, until you asked.

53
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:09,122
Damn it. Starting over.
You in the skirt, date me.

54
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,798
I'd like to, Mr. Winger.
You're tall, you dress nice,

55
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,318
and I've graded you enough
To know I'd never feel inadequate.

56
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:17,530
- Thank you.
- Only problem, I don't date students.

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,070
If you agree to go out with me...

58
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,412
Awkward.
How small is this campus?

59
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:26,732
Bastard.

60
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,981
- It's fine. I don't care.
- It's disgusting the way men behave.

61
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:33,349
You ever see that Heigl poster
where Butler had heart over his weiner?

62
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,341
- That resonated with me.
- Fine.

63
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,796
But just to repeat,
I don't care what Jeff does.

64
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:38,921
Bastard.

65
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,356
I'm barely a student.
I'm older than you.

66
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:43,544
I drive a Lexus.
Saw <i>Ghost Busters</i> in the theater.

67
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:44,849
My gums are receding.

68
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,635
It's uncanny
how many of my buttons you're finding,

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,645
but I have a rule about this,
I stick to it.

70
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,981
Have a cup of coffee with me.
I can change your mind.

71
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,817
I know you can.
That's why you ain't getting the chance.

72
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:03,231
- Are you coming to my party?
- I'm definitely gonna try to swing by.

73
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:05,226
I can mark you down
as definitely being there

74
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,168
from 7:00 sharp
till Spanish question mark?

75
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:09,254
- Here's the...
- No, here's the thing.

76
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,402
I am putting my foot down.
You understand?

77
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:14,763
I am being assertive,
and I am making eye contact,

78
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,589
and it is achieving results.

79
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:19,174
- Trying to get formidable with me?
- It worked on Pierce.

80
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,759
Infomercials work on him.

81
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,220
You're the cool guy, okay?

82
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:26,492
If you show up,
it'll be the first party I host

83
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:30,267
where everyone doesn't say
they need to get home for the news.

84
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:34,064
This won't work.
The last time you did this,

85
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,609
I saved a vial of your tears
and have built up an immunity.

86
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:38,800
I was so unpopular in high school,

87
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,447
the crossing guard
used to lure me into traffic.

88
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:45,233
This party is a second chance
to be...

89
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:46,827
Hip.

90
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,388
Cool!

91
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,049
Laidback!

92
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:54,209
I will come.

93
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:55,603
Thank you.

94
00:04:56,387 --> 00:05:00,287
I'm putting you down for two bags of ice
and a sleeve of paper cups.

95
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:15,744
Taking a pill?

96
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,860
- Yes, I am.
- Xenolovaden.

97
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:21,478
My grandpa took that too.

98
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:23,906
- Fantastic.
- Helping him with his going problem.

99
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,260
By the time he got up in years,
his memory wasn't great.

100
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:27,981
He'd mix pills.
Know how olds are?

101
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:29,311
Heard stories about it.

102
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,546
One time
he ran down the street with no pants on.

103
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,929
Which in the Gaza strip
is considered a real party foul,

104
00:05:34,054 --> 00:05:37,195
- so you should probably be careful...
- I really don't need your advice,

105
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,754
I'm not your pantsless grandpa.

106
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:41,255
Pantsless grandpa.

107
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:55,980
- You look adorable.
- Thank you.

108
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,608
I hate when women use Halloween
as an excuse to dress up like sluts.

109
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:03,857
Okay, everyone.

110
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,417
I think we can begin.

111
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:09,581
I've got everyone's
personalized cookie tombstones,

112
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:10,786
<i>por tradición</i>,

113
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:15,038
and in a few minutes,
we gonna start the dance of the dead...

114
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,293
Don't have to keep doing that!

115
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,462
Party on.

116
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,847
It's nice of you to be here.
You'd rather be with your hot professor.

117
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:32,069
Well, it's funny,
I enrolled here as selfish loner,

118
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:34,309
but the group has given me
a course in friendship.

119
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:36,668
- She blew you off, huh?
- She's grading papers.

120
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:39,042
Professor Slater?
She's not grading papers.

121
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,818
- She's at the party in the cafeteria.
- It's the eavesdropping matador.

122
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,697
- Are you saying my people are sneaky?
- What?

123
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,201
There's a storm building on the horizon,
but you and I will save the night.

124
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,683
Chex mix, pretzels, baby carrots,

125
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,159
prredictable but appetizing.

126
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,379
Can I ask you something
I wanted to ask Batman?

127
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:04,631
Am I good looking?

128
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,280
- You're a very attractive young man.
- I knew it.

129
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,557
Let's get this party started!

130
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,028
Who are you?

131
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,781
I am the beastmaster.

132
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,646
From <i>Beastmaster</i>.

133
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,041
What rock
have you been living under?

134
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,554
What are you going as?
A gay douchebag?

135
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,104
- Just kidding.
- Nice one.

136
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,656
I'm not much of a costume guy.

137
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,262
You're not much
of a liking the ladies guy either, huh?

138
00:07:32,387 --> 00:07:34,495
Body blow.
Is that liquor?

139
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,854
- Here's your drinks, mates.
- Thanks, Urkel.

140
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,877
- I'm Harry Potter.
- Really?

141
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:43,605
What up, Urkel?

142
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:57,544
All right.

143
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,466
What are you taking?

144
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,279
You know, the usual cool stuff.

145
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:03,911
I've got 'ludes,

146
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:06,193
dreamers...
Johnny boys.

147
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,356
Tell you what.

148
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:10,514
I'll trade you one of mine
for two of yours.

149
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,191
- I don't know, Star-Burns.
- I'm... sorry.

150
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,120
Thought I was dealing
with the beastmaster.

151
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,169
Who said you weren't?

152
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:22,154
Saddle up, fruit pie.

153
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:24,468
I don't mind if I do.
May I?

154
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:27,028
Here. Take this.

155
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,258
Give anyone that shows up
their credit.

156
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,927
You going to the faculty party?
Make me your plus one.

157
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,196
Give it up.
Professor Slater doesn't date students.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,355
Or married asians who drive mopeds.

159
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,377
Give you 20 bucks.

160
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,716
I'll bring the hog around.

161
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,792
It's time for the dance of the dead.

162
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,497
Everyone form a circle.

163
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:01,764
Lights.

164
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:03,349
Music.

165
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:05,878
Is it under genre
or on a specific playlist?

166
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,849
What'd you slip me?

167
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:12,604
I keep grinding my teeth,
and I want to kiss everybody.

168
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,290
What'd you slip me, man?

169
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:17,015
My heart stopped racing,
and I can't pee.

170
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:19,305
Now for the first dance,

171
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:22,541
I'd like to invite a very special guest
to the floor.

172
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,766
Jeff Winger?

173
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:31,503
Where's Jeff?

174
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:39,494
Jeff gone?

175
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,082
You know, I'm gonna go.
I don't want to miss the news.

176
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,375
News!

177
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:49,379
He just stepped out.
He's gonna be right back.

178
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,228
He's going to the faculty party.

179
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:56,729
To be with professor short skirt?
We hate her.

180
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:58,932
No, it's not about her.

181
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,974
Can't believe he'd do this to Annie.

182
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,093
Absolutely. It's about Annie.

183
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,896
We should go find that bitch's car
and snap off her antenna.

184
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,046
It's like high school
all over again.

185
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,621
Everyone's leaving.

186
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,481
Not me.

187
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:16,158
I could do this all night.

188
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,915
- There you go, pretty lady.
- What are you doing here?

189
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,852
Showing you my non-student side.

190
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:34,103
I have to admit,
this outfit's doing it for me.

191
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:37,094
I may or may not have been deflowered
by a junior rodeo champion.

192
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,722
- Reminding me of my first time too.
- Lost your virginity to Robin Hood?

193
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,351
With an attractive woman at a party.
We seem destined to repeat history.

194
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,370
I told you no students.
It's unseemly.

195
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,480
I go out with you,
you tell your friends...

196
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,354
What friends?
I have no friends.

197
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,276
I hate everyone here but you.

198
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:55,362
- What you doing here?
- You?

199
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,390
You should be over at the library
with Annie...

200
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,579
- Thought you weren't a costume guy.
- You had to have one here, Squirrel.

201
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:06,039
So where did you get it?

202
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,042
I wouldn't think any costume stores
would be open this late.

203
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,239
- I dunno what you're getting at.
- The words that you're looking for are

204
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:13,671
"I own a cowboy outfit".

205
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:16,341
And it is tight too.
Did you buy it like that?

206
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,427
Your toy gun to my head,
I'd say yes.

207
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:21,763
- Michelle Slater, Ph.D.
- Britta Perry, GED.

208
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:23,348
A classmate of Jeff's?

209
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:26,685
When you say "classmate",
sounds like we take naps together,

210
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,603
but what's great
about community colleges

211
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:31,773
is that a lot of the students
are just as mature as the teachers.

212
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:35,569
You must return to Annie's party.
She's feeling unpopular.

213
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,289
Jeff, Pierce took something,
and he is tripping balls.

214
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,574
He is touching people
and dancing weird.

215
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,784
It's like <i>Grumpy Old Men</i>
but not hilarious.

216
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm at a grownup Halloween party,
all right?

217
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,089
You're all being unseemly.

218
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:50,876
How are we unseemly?

219
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:55,172
Why is Urkel ripping the antenna
off professor Slater's car?

220
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:58,254
That's right, professor slim calves.

221
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,879
This is what you get when you steal Jeff
from a good woman!

222
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:17,944
Is he meowing?

223
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,576
Enough.
I want you guys out of here.

224
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,742
I don't care
about your high school soap opera.

225
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,786
Abed, you're not Batman.

226
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,546
Stop grinding
on the women's studies department.

227
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:33,721
You are too old to be tripping.

228
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm old?

229
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,057
What do you mean old?

230
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:42,699
Whose hands are these?

231
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,169
Help me!

232
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:48,663
Way to go.

233
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,417
I know I'm not Batman.
You could try not being a jerk.

234
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,153
She's pretty hot.

235
00:12:57,973 --> 00:13:00,287
- Where were we, little doggie?
- Unseemly.

236
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,912
Crap.

237
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,129
This is professor Robin Hood's.

238
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:19,482
- What you doing?
- Putting this hose in her desk,

239
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:21,537
- and you going to turn the water on.
- Why?

240
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:23,099
To teach that long-neck

241
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:25,637
weave-having bank teller
she can't steal another woman's man!

242
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,855
That's why.

243
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:33,353
I have a confession to make.

244
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,732
I think some of what I just said
may have more to do with my situation.

245
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,551
The long-neck, weave-having bank teller
didn't feel universal.

246
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,364
My ex-husband came by this morning,

247
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,658
and he asked for his ring back.

248
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:51,362
It was his mother's, he wants to give it
to his new girlfriend.

249
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,599
Shirley, that sucks.

250
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,787
Best thing ever happened to me
was him leaving.

251
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:59,486
I always thought
he'd come crawling back,

252
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:01,298
and I'd get to tell him,
"go to hell".

253
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,533
He couldn't even give me that.

254
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:10,390
- You know what the crazy thing is?
- Everything you've done tonight?

255
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,478
It's like I was too proud
to admit I was hurt,

256
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:17,189
so I had to pretend that you were.

257
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:19,989
I totally get that.

258
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,155
I feel better now.

259
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,071
Let's go check on Annie.

260
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:32,306
Can you believe
I targeted this poor lady?

261
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:35,081
Look at all these awards.
I bet she's nice.

262
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,712
Nice and pretentious.

263
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,306
Pierce, are you okay?

264
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:55,434
What's going on?

265
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,459
You have a full-on erection.

266
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:59,272
Just relax.

267
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,456
Just relax, okay?

268
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:06,696
<i>You are too old to be tripping!</i>

269
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,537
<i>You are too old to be tripping.</i>

270
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,289
Tell me about the Beatles, Pierce.

271
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:19,406
Tell me about Woodstock and Sputnik.

272
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:35,068
Do I feel a breeze here?

273
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:38,478
- Because someone just struck out.
- She blew you off too, Chang.

274
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:41,662
Is that what you had
to fall back on?

275
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,405
Look at me, bro. Look at me.

276
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,883
I've got the body
of a fifth grader, okay?

277
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:47,706
If I was working
with what you've got,

278
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:50,907
she'd be at the comfort inn right now
giving me a Mexican Halloween.

279
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,462
It's this campus.
It feeds on my coolness.

280
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,972
- I got no moves anymore.
- Moves?

281
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,723
Everything's a game
to guys like you.

282
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:02,098
I know one move
I bet you've never tried in your life.

283
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:03,613
What is it?

284
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,411
Please sleep with me.
Please.

285
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:17,684
Pretty please.
I'm so lonely.

286
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,354
I haven't slept in a very long time,
and you are so good looking.

287
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:24,274
Please do me the favor
of having sex with me.

288
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:32,115
Stay three steps behind
and promise you won't tell anybody.

289
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:33,342
I promise.

290
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:35,223
I promise.

291
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:50,299
Everybody, stay out of the library.

292
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,952
Pierce, it's okay.

293
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,350
Come out of there.

294
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:56,972
- No, I'm not ready to die!
- You're not gonna die!

295
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:59,142
Just keep walking.
Don't make eye contact.

296
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,897
He's freaking out.
You're the only one who can help.

297
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:06,534
- What makes you think that?
- Is Jeff out there?

298
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,419
- He's the only one who can help.
- He says he's gonna kill himself,

299
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:11,154
but he doesn't want us to call 911,

300
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,679
cause he doesn't want to get in trouble
for taking drugs.

301
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,746
I can't believe I'm doing this.

302
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:25,429
I think

303
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,848
I have to say goodnight.

304
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:30,298
Are you a court-appointed guardian
for these people?

305
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:35,136
They're my classmates.

306
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:37,036
Goodnight, Jeff.

307
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,389
Loser!

308
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:55,481
What in the Pink Floyd?

309
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,859
I'm gonna crush myself to death

310
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:00,096
with desks and tables, Jeff!

311
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:02,240
Is that a death
befitting a beastmaster?

312
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:05,792
I never saw <i>Beastmaster</i>.
I just wanted to be cool.

313
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,041
I'm coming in there.

314
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,908
Those floating Mexican skeletons
were right.

315
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,333
My life is over.

316
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:24,983
When we go to floating skeletons
with our problems,

317
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:27,832
we get what we pay for, don't we?

318
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:30,817
I'm old, Jeff.

319
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,362
I dunno how you spent
the first 60 years,

320
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:36,525
but I know in the last two months,

321
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,260
you've probably doubled
the national average

322
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,369
for amount of life lived
per lifetime.

323
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:45,999
Well, I do have a young,
African-American friend.

324
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:48,814
And, more importantly,

325
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:52,756
you dressed like a gladiator in a fort
that you built during a bad trip.

326
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:56,509
If life is just a series
of ridiculous attempts to be alive,

327
00:18:57,796 --> 00:19:00,054
you're a hero
to everything that's ever lived.

328
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,470
Batman?

329
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:30,938
Are you staying for the party?

330
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:32,632
If I stay,

331
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,131
there can be no party.

332
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:40,647
I must be out there in the night,
staying vigilant.

333
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:44,157
Wherever a party needs to be saved,

334
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I'm there.

335
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:50,114
Wherever there are masks,
Wherever there's tomfoolery and joy,

336
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,239
I'm there.

337
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:56,448
But sometimes I'm not,
cause I'm out in the night,

338
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,423
staying vigilant, watching,

339
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:02,269
lurking, running, jumping, hurtling,

340
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,920
sleeping...

341
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:06,287
No, I can't sleep.
You sleep.

342
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,783
I'm awake.

343
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,969
I don't sleep.
I don't blink.

344
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:11,945
Am I a bird?

345
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:13,907
I'm a bat.

346
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,382
I am Batman.

347
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:18,591
Or am I?

348
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:21,633
Yes, I am Batman.

349
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:25,905
Happy Halloween.

350
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,187
- I'm Batman.
- You sound like Cookie Monster.

351
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,420
- I'm Batman.
- That's Batman.

352
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,442
Candy corn looks like
tiny traffic cones.

353
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:39,863
- Yeah, it sure does.
- At, like, a candy traffic school.

354
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,284
A little gingerbread man at the wheel,
and he's drunk.

355
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,952
Look out. You'd be driving,

356
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:48,371
But you keep wanting
to eat yourself.

357
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,207
- All day.
- That's one of my biggest fears.

358
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:54,219
- What is?
- If I ever woke up as a donut.

359
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:56,546
- You would eat yourself?
- I wouldn't even question it.

360
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:58,149
That'd be tasty.

361
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:01,926
It's cool to know other people
think about this stuff too.
