1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,210
<i>Good morning,
Greendale community college.</i>

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,486
<i>This is your Dean</i>

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,191
<i>reminding you that
among your school's prestigious alumni</i>

4
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:09,130
<i>is Mr. Luis Guzman,</i>

5
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:12,313
<i>celebrated actor
and model Puerto-Rican American.</i>

6
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:15,831
<i>This Friday,
we'll be dedicating a statue of Guzman</i>

7
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:18,074
<i>and unveiling
our brand-new school song.</i>

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,275
<i>So boy, I don't know about you,</i>

9
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:23,458
but this sure feels
like a real college to me.

10
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,698
<i>Greendale!</i>

11
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:35,576
Good morning! How is student life,
my dry-witted friend?

12
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:38,771
Probably the same as teacher life,
but less tragic, cause I get to leave.

13
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:41,832
Very dry. Very witty.
Not a great friend.

14
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:45,564
I wanted to ask you
about that lady in your Spanish class.

15
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,365
The blonde with the pouty,

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,633
strident Cate Blanchett sexuality
and the ridiculous name?

17
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,451
- Britta?
- That's it.

18
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:56,018
Imagine living with that.
Can you imagine?

19
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:57,313
Unbelievable.

20
00:00:57,438 --> 00:01:00,047
Anyway, are you two an item,
and if so,

21
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:02,311
would that item
be impervious to sabotage?

22
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:05,378
You know,
you have the <i>savoir faire</i> of a hyena.

23
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:08,109
How is it that you and James Bond
come from the same island?

24
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,529
Message received. I'll just wait for you
to finish striking out first.

25
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,030
- Cheers.
- <i>MASH</i>.

26
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:14,990
<i>Fawlty Towers</i>. Game over.

27
00:01:17,305 --> 00:01:19,550
Think Luis Guzman
will ever come to visit his statue?

28
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:23,216
I'd like to ask him about his movies,
particularly <i>Carlito's Way</i>,

29
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:25,626
<i>The Cowboy Way</i>,
<i>The Hard Way</i>, and <i>Q&A</i>.

30
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,372
Luis Guzman is on a private jet
from Hollywood,

31
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:30,589
cause he can't wait
to have that conversation.

32
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:34,218
- How does he know about me?
- Cause he called me on my cell phone.

33
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:35,948
Why would he call you?

34
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:40,099
You don't know?

35
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:44,478
- I'm President Obama's nephew.
- You never mentioned that.

36
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:47,719
Didn't know if I could trust you.
But it's time to tell you everything...

37
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:50,136
Starting with me
inventing the Ferrari.

38
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,143
I guess the phone number you put
on the study group' sheet was fake,

39
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:57,166
which I learned
in the awkward conclusion

40
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,702
of a month-long text affair
with a dude from Boulder.

41
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:01,940
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

42
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:05,166
Just give me your real number.
I'll cleanse my palate.

43
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:06,516
I'll give it to you

44
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:09,086
if you promise not to use it
only for friendship.

45
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,990
Pass.

46
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:15,718
Star Burns...
that means you.

47
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:17,553
My name's Alex, dude.

48
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,790
Should spend hours
sculpting that in your face.

49
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:24,435
Last night I graded your tests.
I'm sure you wanna know how you did.

50
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,798
I'm not gonna tell you.

51
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:29,259
Until I find out who did...

52
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:30,316
this!

53
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:32,725
What is that?

54
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:38,306
It's a tiny piece of paper, okay?
That's all it is. Tiny piece of paper.

55
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:42,161
Containing all the information
covered on the test.

56
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:45,630
Otherwise known as a crib sheet.

57
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:46,791
Who did it?

58
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:48,796
Marianne?

59
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:50,812
Grandpa?

60
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:52,909
Jackee?

61
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,717
Kumar? There's one asian stereotype
that does apply to me.

62
00:02:57,205 --> 00:02:59,220
Whoever did this insulted my honor.

63
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:02,541
They've got 24 hours
to come forward,

64
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,279
or Mr. Miyagi here
will wax off everyone's score

65
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:09,724
and the whole class gets a <i>cero</i>!

66
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,426
'cept you, Toby.

67
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:22,993
The only difference
between <i>señor</i> Chang and Stalin

68
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:25,246
is that I know who <i>señor</i> Chang is.

69
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:28,431
Did you hear him call me Jackee
like I'm some black female caricature?

70
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,793
If God hadn't been watching,
I'd have slapped him.

71
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,045
Who do you guys think cheated?

72
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,150
Flattering.
But if I'm gonna cheat,

73
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,544
I'm not gonna write information
onto a paper.

74
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:41,095
That's practically learning.

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,502
Whoever made that crib sheet
wasn't a cheater.

76
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,641
Just... insecure and naive.

77
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:48,853
I may be naive, but I'm not stupid.

78
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:52,898
I may be stupid, but I'm not trying
to look like I'm not.

79
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,735
I may be a genius,
but I'm not a lesbian.

80
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,280
Who cares?

81
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,700
The only cheater is the guy
who's threatening everyone with a zero.

82
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,249
You're right! It's so unfair.
I can't handle this stress right now.

83
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:09,123
I'm already overwhelmed by my duties
on the school song committee.

84
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,562
Are you a musician?

85
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:14,295
I hired a local composer.
But he's quite a handful.

86
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,921
I guess that's your fault.

87
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:20,426
You got a pianist and songwriter
sitting 3 feet away from you.

88
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:23,596
I wrote the jingle
for Hawthorne Wipe's moist towelettes.

89
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:26,891
I would have done your song for free.
Smooth move, Metamucil.

90
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,351
Troy could do the school song.
He invited rap music,

91
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,250
is related to Danny Glover
and Obama.

92
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,284
Have you been racist this whole time

93
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:36,650
while I'm telling everybody at church
what a sweet caramel angel you are?

94
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,904
Stuff I said this morning wasn't true.
I was just messin' with you.

95
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,028
- You were lying?
- As a joke.

96
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:46,201
- Never had anybody mess with you?
- Yes. Just kidding. No. Like that?

97
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,497
This isn't a table.

98
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:53,203
That's funny.

99
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,227
Remember
when we used to study Spanish?

100
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:02,259
I talked to the Dean,
he said you can write the school song.

101
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:06,874
- Well, that's more like it.
- The statue dedication is this Friday.

102
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:09,892
- So you have to have it done by then.
- This Friday?

103
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,282
- If that's not enough time...
- You don't know much about genius.

104
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,624
- Yes, I can do it by Friday.
- Great!

105
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,901
There's a piano in the rehearsal space.
I'll help you out however I can.

106
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,498
- You're gonna do an awesome job!
- I know!

107
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:25,448
So... this is the last chance

108
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,088
for the cheater to be an adult

109
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:30,602
and face <i>la musica</i>...

110
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:33,332
Or everyone fails.

111
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,467
You got ten seconds...

112
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:36,877
Starting now.

113
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:50,724
I've never... gotten a zero before.

114
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,241
I did it.

115
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,188
You took your time
with that one.

116
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,804
How dare you terrorize a class
by threatening their grades.

117
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,624
It's not that easy to get human beings
to turn on each other.

118
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:02,661
Turn on her!

119
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:07,668
Real mature!

120
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:09,660
That's right.

121
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,403
We are mature!

122
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:14,354
Too mature to sit in a class

123
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,250
with a cheating, lying poop-face!

124
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:21,659
Time to learn some formal greetings.

125
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:33,517
I bet you're enjoying this.

126
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:37,785
When we first met, like you were up here
and I was here, and now...

127
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:40,093
I gave a quarter
to a dirty bum today.

128
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,930
What they're gonna do to me?

129
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:45,145
We're not gonna buy you an ice cream.
Dean Pelton.

130
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:48,157
What an entrance I got to make there.
You would be Britta Perry.

131
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,745
I just spoke with <i>señor</i> Chang,

132
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,121
and I'm afraid Greendale
takes this kinda thing very seriously.

133
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:56,761
Much like a university would!

134
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:00,720
Your case will be reviewed

135
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:03,505
by a disciplinary tribunal tomorrow
in Borchart Hall.

136
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:07,051
- You could be facing expulsion.
- Isn't Borchart Hall the pool?

137
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:10,650
There is an olympic-sized pool there,
yes, but we will be next to it,

138
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,838
using its $6,000 judge's table!

139
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:17,685
Is she allowed to have counsel?
I may not be a lawyer anymore,

140
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,189
but relative to this place,
I'm Alan Dershowitz.

141
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,346
If you'd like, you may represent her.
Dean you later.

142
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:29,583
Ain't gonna sit while some tribunal
gets its jollies judging me.

143
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,163
If you show up with me, follow my lead,
and deny everything, you'll walk.

144
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,330
- That's the Winger guarantee.
- I get it.

145
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,008
You think you're gonna save my bacon
using your lawyer powers

146
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,293
and send me
into fits of grateful arousal.

147
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,761
I can neither confirm nor deny that.

148
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:45,835
See how good I am?

149
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,468
Troy. Did you hear?

150
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:52,414
All dogs are blue now.

151
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:54,598
Every single dog in the world
is blue.

152
00:07:57,974 --> 00:08:00,717
- I'm just messing with you.
- Let me explain to you

153
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,999
a few things about how this works.

154
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:07,059
First of all, I cannot be got,
because I am not gullible like you.

155
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:09,354
Secondly, you are not good at this,

156
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,581
because you are not believable
in your face, okay?

157
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,910
Your face? It's bad.

158
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:16,310
Also...

159
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,997
You gotta ride the line
between believable and...

160
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:23,085
- What are you writing in?
- It's a notepad.

161
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,130
- But what are... What language?
- Probably Arabic.

162
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:38,301
I am convening
this disciplinary tribunal

163
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,894
at our state-of-the-art
judge's table,

164
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,982
which has its own built-in sound system
so take that yale.

165
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,360
Our judges include myself,
Dean Craig Pelton.

166
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:50,070
Professor Ian Duncan.

167
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,114
Professor Ben Chang.

168
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:54,366
No, you're a teacher.
Not a professor.

169
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,785
Maybe because
I don't look like Ron Weasley.

170
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,121
That's the difference,
the qualifying factor.

171
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,822
Gentlemen, point of order.

172
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,870
How can <i>señor</i> Chang
be one of the judges?

173
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:04,745
He's the one accusing my client.

174
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,123
You got Prince Charles over here,
who's your drinking buddy.

175
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,248
Got me.

176
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:13,060
It sounds like there are two biases,
one on each side, and I go both ways.

177
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:16,805
Let's strike that.
Lashonda, can we please strike that?

178
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:20,410
I am impartial,
so it should all work out.

179
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,852
Let's begin.

180
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:25,189
Fine.
The tribunal calls teacher Chang.

181
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:28,942
- Just keep it up <i>Frost/Nixon</i>.
- I was planning on doing that.

182
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,491
Cleared my whole day.

183
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,823
Could you remind us
of the events of yesterday?

184
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,442
With great pleasure.
It was a Tuesday,

185
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,891
crack of dawn, 5:58 am.

186
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,997
I got up, I took my morning deuce,

187
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,000
I made a breakfast consisting of...

188
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:48,764
<i>Green-dale</i>

189
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:51,087
<i>Slop</i>

190
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:58,674
<i>Greendale isn't a slop pail</i>

191
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,268
- Almost done.
- Good.

192
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,480
Tell the Dean I'll have a song
that'll make the Devil poop God's pants.

193
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,321
That's exciting.

194
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,106
Mind if I hear what you got so far?

195
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,110
I'll probably open
with something like this.

196
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:19,541
You know, a note like that.

197
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:22,144
And end with a note like that.

198
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,791
The words, I can't tell you.
You know, the rest is really a surprise.

199
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,295
I'm just a little worried.
I keep hearing the same two notes,

200
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,007
and your sheet music
looks like a Chinese takeout menu.

201
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,475
A musician sees music in everything.

202
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:39,188
I mean, it could be...

203
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,657
<i>Moo shoo pork</i>

204
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:44,341
<i>Squab with lettuce</i>

205
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,435
You see?
I mean, it just comes out.

206
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,745
- You really shouldn't be here.
- What?

207
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,918
You are inside a throbbing,
cosmic womb

208
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,569
of creativity,
and when this baby starts kicking,

209
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:58,018
I cannot be responsible
for your sanity.

210
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:01,727
I know it sounds funny,
but let me play you out.

211
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,362
Playing you out now, this song.
Like on stage?

212
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:09,561
Playing you out, okay?
Thanks for coming.

213
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:10,686
Bye-bye.

214
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,100
And then she yelled "Screw you",
Or "Screw education",

215
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,728
or something like that
and then she stormed out of the room

216
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,896
in her high-heel boots
like it was tampon time.

217
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:33,233
- If you know what I mean.
- Objection. I don't know what he means.

218
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,923
Please don't encourage him.

219
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:38,322
- Do you have any more questions?
- The defense calls Britta Perry.

220
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:41,867
Are those the high-heel boots
he was talking about?

221
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,411
Are they comfortable?
They're cute.

222
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,123
Did you make that crib sheet?

223
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,251
She confessed!

224
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,102
She confessed
to protect her classmates,

225
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:56,757
because you were threatening
to flunk everyone!

226
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,075
You did what?

227
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:01,261
Shut your pompous vortex
of overlapping fangs!

228
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:03,263
British dentistry is not on trial.

229
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,244
Dean Pelton, I move this case
be thrown out of...

230
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:08,973
- The pool area!
- It certainly...

231
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,418
Well, it certainly sounds to me
that this young lady's only crime

232
00:12:16,543 --> 00:12:18,737
is being a hero
and wanting to be taller.

233
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:21,114
- This tribunal is adjourned.
- I cheated!

234
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,487
- And we're back.
- Objection. My client did not cheat.

235
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:25,660
Yes, I did.

236
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:27,994
Yes, she did...

237
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
But why?

238
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,665
That's the real question, isn't it?

239
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,092
The world wasn't the only thing
that changed on September 11th.

240
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,386
5-minute recess?

241
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:45,610
There's nothing In the bylaws
about recesses, all right?

242
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,058
The wheels of justice here
don't stop just because...

243
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,730
Time out!

244
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,105
Save the table!

245
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:56,679
Beginning transmission.

246
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:58,680
The primary purpose
seems to be male bonding,

247
00:12:58,805 --> 00:13:02,457
the attitude during conveyance
is apparently of great importance.

248
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,196
The humanoid
is approximately 5'10" in height.

249
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:06,451
What are you doing?

250
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:11,331
I didn't see you.
How long were you standing there?

251
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,150
- You trying to mess with me?
- That's what I was doing. You got me.

252
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,046
I was, but I guess I blew it again.

253
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:22,077
You did.

254
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,889
- Man, don't turn your back on me.
- It is on like Donkey Kong!

255
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,064
Have you got a problem with me?

256
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,317
I don't like the fact
that you're walking around here

257
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,713
like you're better than me
in front of my students.

258
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:44,448
Do you mind if we have this conversation
in a room with less balls?

259
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,427
You're very confident,
I'll say that.

260
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,248
But you shouldn't be.

261
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:54,666
What are you doing?

262
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,044
- I have a problem with dishonesty.
- You're on trial for cheating!

263
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,277
Look, we'll be fine.

264
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:05,089
I just have to go back out there
and make the case you're a good person.

265
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:08,676
You're just doing all of this
cause you want to sleep with me.

266
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,557
You don't even want to be my friend.

267
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,894
Wait a minute.
Is that what you thought I meant?

268
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,291
- Look at me.
- I am.

269
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:19,691
Look how handsome my face is.

270
00:14:20,364 --> 00:14:22,942
If all I wanted was sex,
I could get it from plenty of women

271
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,751
without having to go
through this crap.

272
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,506
I'm here because I like you,

273
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:29,302
and I'd be psyched
to be your friend.

274
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:32,621
I didn't want to take sex off the table
without doing my due diligence.

275
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,790
- I actually believe you.
- Why wouldn't you?

276
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:39,589
I don't know.
I guess... same reason that I cheated.

277
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:43,150
I just have more experience
being worthless.

278
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:46,984
I left that crib sheet on the floor
because I wanted to get caught.

279
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:50,885
I'm so used to screwing everything up
I just wanted to get it over with.

280
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,648
I think we have our defense.

281
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,016
Gentlemen...

282
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,729
- My client is insane.
- What?

283
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:04,986
Gentlemen, I'm sure you suspected...

284
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,822
that Ms. Perry was pretty odd
before the recess.

285
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:11,670
But if you could've heard all the stuff
she just told me in the shower,

286
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:14,108
you would realize
she is all the way out

287
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,373
of her entire damn mind.

288
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:18,124
She doesn't want to succeed

289
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,168
because she doesn't think she can.

290
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:23,596
So she goes out of her way to fail.

291
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:25,173
That's crazy!

292
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
But...

293
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,504
Do we really want to make it a crime
to be crazy at Greendale?

294
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:31,900
Look at us.

295
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:35,184
I mean, you two are arguing
about status at a college

296
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,227
that correspondence
schools make fun of.

297
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:40,868
Dean, you want so bad for this place
to be Ivy league

298
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,733
that you are putting us
at risk of electrocution.

299
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,061
Everyone on this campus is nuts.

300
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,405
Not me!

301
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,908
Come on. If you're gonna argue with me,
put on a bathing suit.

302
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,218
Busted.

303
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,691
If you want to rehabilitate
your fellow inmate,

304
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:00,959
you need to sentence her
to staying here with us.

305
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,910
Because if crazy people
can't be at Greendale,

306
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,988
where are we supposed to go?

307
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:14,055
On the circumstances, I'll recommend
that the accused be fully exonerated.

308
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:17,350
On the condition that she receives
psychological counseling

309
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,890
on a weekly basis
from a mental health professional.

310
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:22,522
Thinking maybe Fridays,
nine-ish, something like that.

311
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,107
All in favor say "Aye".

312
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:25,692
Wait, what?

313
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,437
That just happened.

314
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,921
- <i>Greetings, Abed.</i>
- Greetings, Commander.

315
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:50,050
<i>Tell me about the one
they call Troy.</i>

316
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,495
Well, he is rather arrogant
and has no mercy for weaker beings.

317
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,597
Stop doing this right now.

318
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,165
I'm not an alien.

319
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:00,212
I never thought you were.

320
00:17:00,337 --> 00:17:02,121
But this is insane, okay?

321
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:04,774
Those are credible
alien hand movements.

322
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,901
You invented a whole language.
I'm sure you rented a green screen.

323
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,946
It would be less creepy
if you were actually an alien.

324
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:13,694
This is what friends do.

325
00:17:16,497 --> 00:17:18,002
From now on,

326
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:20,872
friends don't mess with each other.

327
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,546
It's over. He knows.

328
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,511
- You're getting a little sloppy.
- We went over-budget.

329
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:45,962
I've got it.

330
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:52,996
<i>Greendale, Greendale little star</i>

331
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,043
I'm a fraud, Annie.

332
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,574
I'm no more of a songwriter
than you or Billy Joel.

333
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:13,007
What about the Hawthorne Wipes
jingle?

334
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,114
You want to hear it?
Here.

335
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:20,491
<i>You'll be wiping off that ketchup</i>

336
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,511
<i>With our wipes, Hawthorne Wipes!</i>

337
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,459
<i>You'll be wiping off that mustard</i>

338
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,831
<i>With our wipes at the picnic!</i>

339
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,242
That's
<i>She'll be coming around the mountain</i>.

340
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,235
I know! I steal everything.
You backed the wrong horse.

341
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,267
- I got nothing.
- Pierce, you're musical.

342
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:38,742
You're creative. You can do this.
I believe in you.

343
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:40,410
You shouldn't. I quit.

344
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,203
You listen up!

345
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,041
I gonna tell you what my mother told me
when I wanted to quit cheerleading.

346
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,585
You're not very pretty,

347
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:51,539
you have no boobs, and you can't do
a basket toss to save your life,

348
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,798
but you made a commitment.

349
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,759
So pick up your pompoms,

350
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,344
stuff your bra,
get ready for the team bus

351
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:01,032
to forget you at a taco bell,
because life is tough.

352
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:05,769
But we soldier on,
and that's just the way it goes.

353
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,367
Gonna play myself out.

354
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,115
The way it goes.

355
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,708
That's it.

356
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,074
One, two, Luis Guzman!

357
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,506
- Greendale may never be...
- Just don't talk to me.

358
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:29,677
No problem. Just glad you're here.

359
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,670
I'd like to introduce our student,
Pierce Hawthorne,

360
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,922
who's written Greendale
its own school song.

361
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,137
Thank you, Dean.
This song goes out to Annie.

362
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:44,682
For believing in me.

363
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,022
<i>Standing in the bookstore line</i>

364
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:53,297
<i>Waiting for the bell to chime</i>

365
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,027
<i>So you can go to class</i>

366
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,898
<i>Dancing in your underwear</i>

367
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:02,033
<i>Taking air conditioner repair</i>

368
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,981
- Does Bruce Hornsby know he stole it?
- I don't think so. Let him enjoy it.

369
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:08,145
- Can we get sued?
- Not sure.

370
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,709
<i>Greendale's the way it goes</i>

371
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,190
They got us.

372
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:16,495
<i>Some things are still the same</i>

373
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:20,882
<i>Slop pails and pantyhose</i>

374
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,215
<i>Annie believes in me</i>

375
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:55,920
- How many?
- 46. You win.

376
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,531
- Best of three?
- Yeah.
