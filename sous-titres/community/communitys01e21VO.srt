1
00:00:01,722 --> 00:00:03,544
I think I'm failing
psychopharmacology.

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:05,171
Why are you taking that?

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,758
I thought it was a class
about crazy farm animals.

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,927
Let's finish.
I don't want to be late for lunch.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,554
<i>Amar</i> is <i>to love</i>, right?

6
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:15,762
Speaking of love, Shirley,

7
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:17,808
how's it going
with the sexy dreadlock guy?

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,019
I'm sure
I don't have a chance with him.

9
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:22,615
Abed and I talked to him
by the vending machines.

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,732
- He asked about you.
- Specifically?

11
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,152
When Annie brought you up,
he specifically asked, "who is that?"

12
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:31,656
That's what he said.

13
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,887
Your social skills
aren't exactly streets ahead.

14
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:36,265
You know what I mean?

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,620
You're not alone.

16
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:40,665
Stop trying to coin the phrase,
"streets ahead."

17
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:41,833
Trying?

18
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:44,737
Coined and minted.

19
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,671
Been there, coined that.

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,674
"Streets ahead" is verbal wildfire.

21
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,554
Does it just mean "cool,"
or is it supposed to be, like,

22
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:53,928
"miles ahead"?

23
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:56,305
If you ask, you're street's fine.

24
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,030
We can banter if we want,

25
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:00,351
but I'm warning you
I am leaving for lunch early.

26
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,795
- Me too.
- Me three.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,979
Streets ahead.

28
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,314
You guys really love
these stupid chicken fingers.

29
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:08,651
They're not stupid. They're
the only good thing in the cafeteria.

30
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,945
I haven't had one in weeks.
They run out fast.

31
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,549
If God were edible, not that I'm
catholic, but if it was cool to eat God,

32
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,424
he'd be a chicken finger.

33
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,036
I wouldn't know.
I'm a vegetarian.

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,538
Shocker.

35
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,457
If you knew how they treated
the animals that you are eating,

36
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,501
you would eat them even faster

37
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,753
to put them out of their misery
and then you would throw up.

38
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,883
Maybe I'm feeling extra protective
of animals today

39
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,535
- cause my cat is sick.
- That's awful.

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,682
He has diabetes.
He can't make it to the litter box...

41
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,850
Chicken run!

42
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:46,910
I'm afraid that I'm gonna have
to put her to sleep.

43
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,067
Go on.

44
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,486
God bless you.
Save some for me!

45
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:53,863
Watch out!

1x21: Contemporary American Poultry

49
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:05,723
I can hear those fingers
calling my name.

50
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,670
Did you get my text message?

51
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,297
I think it's...

52
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:17,344
I gotta stop hanging out with her.
She sounds like a chicken finger.

53
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:19,930
Again?

54
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:21,574
Outrageous.

55
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,142
At least apologize.

56
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:26,353
How can you just stand
there like a mute idiot?

57
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:34,487
Throat surgery might humanize you,
but it doesn't make this acceptable.

58
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:35,571
So cute.

59
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,533
And I don't even normally
like dreadlocks. Hello.

60
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,297
His dreadlocks remind me
of the predator,

61
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,781
which is weird, because
you're doing the actual hunting

62
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,604
and you seem invisible to him.

63
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,769
Abed, you know what I do?

64
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:55,758
Before I talk, I ask myself,
"What am I about to say

65
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,344
and how might it affect
each person listening?"

66
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,004
I'm glad you said that.

67
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:02,159
The idea that you
compulsively filter yourself

68
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:04,403
makes your lack of flavor
kind of a flavor.

69
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,062
Sorry, guys.
They ran out again.

70
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,291
Something's gotta be done.

71
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,362
What the hell, man?

72
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:20,858
That's half our problem right there.

73
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,244
Star-burns works the fryer
and skims fingers.

74
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:24,453
No way.

75
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,540
He gives them to people just so
they'll act like he isn't Star-burns.

76
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:31,377
I may not eat meat,
but I am not gonna eat that injustice.

77
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:32,721
Let's complain.

78
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,506
If we complain, he gets a warning
and learns to be sneakier.

79
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,717
I say we knock him out of the kitchen
and replace him with one of our own

80
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,261
all in one move.

81
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,051
- Then we're the ones with the chicken.
- It's like a mafia movie.

82
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:46,392
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be in a mafia movie.

83
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,852
That's exactly what it's like,

84
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:50,823
and you get the most important job.

85
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:53,482
- You're gonna be fry cook.
- We watch different mafia movies.

86
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,109
You work in your dad's diner.

87
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,975
You'll apply for the job
after we get Star-burns fired.

88
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,072
I don't know about the firing.

89
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,032
He really relies on that income.

90
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,898
- Yeah, man.
- Every day you flock here like sheep

91
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:07,788
and wait in line for a broken promise
from a dirty system.

92
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,624
Back in those days, Jeff was the guy
that made things happen.

93
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:14,220
He always knew what to say
and when to slap the table.

94
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:16,231
You want to be sheep, keep flocking.

95
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,465
You want to be wolves, form a pack.

96
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,885
And that was it.
It was that simple.

97
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,304
At that moment,
we stopped being a family

98
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,140
and started being a <i>family...</i>
in italics.

99
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,269
- Britta got cozy with star-burns.
- Can I touch both...

100
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,120
He lowered his guard...

101
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:35,150
he was gone.

102
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:39,354
The way Jeff saw it,
by not respecting us,

103
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,557
Star-burns had basically
brought it on himself.

104
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,759
When his job opened up,
we did what we had to do

105
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,309
to keep the list of applicants
to a minimum.

106
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,587
I worked in my dad's
falafel restaurant,

107
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:50,831
- I had an impressive resume.
- Very impressive.

108
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:53,027
Especially your reference.

109
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:54,501
Give 'em a call.

110
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:57,973
But we weren't taking any chances.
The fix was in.

111
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:00,392
Trump tower, this is Donald.

112
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,344
He can deep-fry the hell out of chicken.
I tell you that.

113
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,597
Troy even applied for the same job
and gave the world's worst interview

114
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:10,059
just to make me look better
and that was that.

115
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:13,956
This was the glorious time.
No more racing to the cafeteria.

116
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,800
No more lines.
To us, lines were for suckers,

117
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,126
hacks, sheep.

118
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:19,753
We were wolves.

119
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:22,698
And we had the chicken to prove it.

120
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:27,159
To victory.

121
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:28,702
It feels unfamiliar,

122
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:30,204
it tastes like chicken.

123
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,245
- Hello.
- You guys are lucky.

124
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,797
- They're always running out.
- Would you like one?

125
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:42,506
Name's Shirley.
Memorize it.

126
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,183
I will, Shirley.

127
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,724
See that, ladies?
The universe goes by supply and demand.

128
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,558
The more you take and use,
the more it sends.

129
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,686
Someone take an extra.
What's in that container?

130
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,916
Eight fingers.

131
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:57,273
Abed's study group.

132
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:00,943
- Why are you giving Chang chicken?
- We have an agreement.

133
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,571
If you get caught, you get fired
and we go back to eating like Britta.

134
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,100
We put you in that job.

135
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:09,702
I dressed like a crazy pharaoh
for you.

136
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,829
You make the fingers,
not the decisions.

137
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,139
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, buddy.

138
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,417
Just remember,
these things have power.

139
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:20,129
So let me know next time
you have any more agreements.

140
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,390
I agreed to give Cheng
8 fingers per lunch

141
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,551
in exchange for a 10% bump
on every spanish test for each of us.

142
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,422
Abed makes the fingers
and the decisions.

143
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,812
Abed, you're the best.

144
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:40,024
<i>At Greendale, they were always out
of chicken fingers,</i>

145
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:43,114
<i>so whoever could get them had power.</i>

146
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,849
<i>And I was the guy in the apron,
so I came up with a system</i>

147
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:49,307
<i>and pretty soon half the chicken at
Greendale was going out the side door.</i>

148
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:53,707
<i>Everybody in our crew had a job.
T- bone was the bag man.</i>

149
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:56,999
<i>He'd move the fingers to a storeroom
where 2 girls did the packaging.</i>

150
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,114
<i>We could trust them not to eat
cause Britta was a vegetarian</i>

151
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:02,796
<i>and Shirley figured that if she stole,
she'd go to hell.</i>

152
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:08,344
<i>They'd hand the stuff out the window
to Annie, the leg man and distributor.</i>

153
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:12,174
<i>The crazy thing was
it was their food.</i>

154
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:16,556
<i>We were stealing it and giving it back
to them like it was a big favor.</i>

155
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,213
<i>Nobody asked any questions
because Pierce's experience as a CEO</i>

156
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:22,845
<i>had taught him how to keep
the wheels from squeaking.</i>

157
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,957
<i>- I had it worked out on a schedule.</i>
- I've never been fired...

158
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:28,166
<i>The minute before
you thought about busting us,</i>

159
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,442
<i>that was when you had
a chicken in your hand.</i>

160
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,455
<i>Everyone had their hand out.</i>

161
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,570
<i>Everyone wanted what we had.</i>

162
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,171
<i>Jeff had the most important job of all.
He was at the top.</i>

163
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,050
<i>He was the boss.
He was our leader.</i>

164
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,134
What the hell is going on?

165
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,142
A-V kids hooked it up.

166
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:53,388
Abed supplied the department
with chicken fingers.

167
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:56,475
You think that's good,
check out my posse and Troy's monkey.

168
00:07:57,948 --> 00:07:59,103
Why you have a monkey?

169
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:02,548
It's an animal that looks like a dude.
Why don't I have 10 of them?

170
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,884
Guys,

171
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:06,235
look what Abed scored for me.

172
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,361
It has a million zippers
and it was free.

173
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:15,654
Oh, robot.

174
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:16,972
I am a robot.

175
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,419
I am programmed
to love this backpack.

176
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:20,624
This is insane.

177
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:23,931
More than programming them
to replace auto workers?

178
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
What?

179
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:29,508
If you're not in this study group,
please.

180
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:32,386
You, sexy dreadlocks,

181
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,929
Britta's hairdresser...

182
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,806
Pierce's hackneyed entourage.

183
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:37,078
Hackneyed?

184
00:08:37,594 --> 00:08:40,444
- You see the turban guy?
- Yes, in a '90s ski movie

185
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:44,064
that featured an entourage. Don't
you think this is getting out of hand?

186
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,793
We're not gonna get caught.
We have security on the take.

187
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,918
Abed's got it all figured out.

188
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:52,217
- That's a relief.
- It's pretty cool being friends

189
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:55,033
with the biggest man on campus.
Isn't that right, Annie's boobs?

190
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:59,788
Rename that thing! This time,
not with a contest on Twitter.

191
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:02,173
It's his twitter account.
He can do what he wants.

192
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,198
They are my body parts!

193
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,461
I do not consent to this!

194
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,759
You wouldn't threaten a monkey.
They have more lactic acid than us.

195
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,512
Shared my chicken with him.

196
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,391
- You're the worst, Annie.
- Streets ahead!

197
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:30,068
- Line starts behind you.
- He's cool.

198
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,707
- Six fingers every wednesday.
- Cool.

199
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,782
- What can you offer?
- I have a bicycle

200
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,035
and I teach beginner's tennis.

201
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:42,020
Six fingers wednesdays.

202
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:43,239
All right.

203
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,203
- We'll be in touch, Janel.
- Thank you.

204
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:47,578
You're welcome.

205
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,005
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hey, buddy.

206
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:54,134
- It's quite a setup you got here.
- I'm pretty excited about it.

207
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,964
It turns out everyone has needs
and everyone has functions.

208
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,474
Look, I've been thinking

209
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:01,749
Maybe I need to hit
the big red button

210
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,931
and bring an end to this operation.

211
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:05,607
It's been fun, but

212
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:08,982
- it's out of control now. Am I right?
- I don't know.

213
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,926
The campus
is controlled by our group,

214
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:14,513
our group is controlled by chicken,
and the chicken is controlled by me.

215
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:16,998
- Float?
- I'm good.

216
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:19,701
The mafia movie is over.

217
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:21,404
I'm not doing a mafia movie.

218
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:24,767
In fact, I don't need to use movies
or TV shows to talk to people anymore.

219
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:28,037
Before, I only needed them because
day-to-day world made no sense to me,

220
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:30,560
but now, everyone's speaking
the same language. Chicken.

221
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:32,868
I understand people
and they finally understand me.

222
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,718
Eventually people are gonna get tired
of chicken. I'm tired of chicken.

223
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,096
You're not tired.
You miss the taste of control.

224
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:42,349
That's crazy.

225
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:45,124
Is it?

226
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,709
The thing that drove you
to this dorm room

227
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,162
is what would prevent you
from properly running this machine

228
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,987
or even being a cog in it.
Your ego.

229
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:02,369
I see.
This has been about me the whole time.

230
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:06,961
You want a shot at
the Jeff Winger throne?

231
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,750
You better bring a powerful ass.

232
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,679
And for your information,
I don't have an ego.

233
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,058
My facebook photo is a landscape.

234
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:21,972
You're the best, Eduardo.

235
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:25,887
- Thank you for coming.
- Can we make quick?

236
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:28,074
I need to give a banana
to Annie's boobs.

237
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,938
Abed is drunk with chicken power.

238
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,941
He's gone from lovable Johnny Five
to <i>Evil Hal</i>.

239
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,652
- Not Hal Holbrook.
- What are you saying?

240
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,071
You have to stop working for him.

241
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,823
Let this operation dry up

242
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:42,576
- and let his wheels spin down.
- At which point

243
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,703
you would be in charge again?

244
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,580
- What?
- This is so sad.

245
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:49,124
You're jealous of Abed
because he's providing for us.

246
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,086
No, I'm concerned about Abed
because he won't listen to reason.

247
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,588
Won't listen to your reason.

248
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,507
Why should he?
Jeff's so not...

249
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,426
Say "streets ahead" and die.

250
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:01,952
Streets ahead.

251
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,057
You want to boss me around?
Get me an entourage.

252
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,851
Get Troy a monkey.
That's what a real boss does.

253
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,188
We shouldn't even be talking
to him without checking with Abed.

254
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,274
I'm already trying him.
He's not picking up. What did you do?

255
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:17,198
I don't believe what greedy sellouts
you people turned out to be.

256
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,321
I'm not gonna stand here
and be ignored.

257
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,492
Voicemail. Hey, Abed.
Jeff says you're not listening to him.

258
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,578
Does that mean we shouldn't
listen to him either? Oh, also,

259
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:29,842
should we make special jackets
for our crime family? Like,

260
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,667
blazers with chicken finger patches.

261
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,502
I don't know.
Long message. Sorry.

262
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,744
That's it!

263
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,428
- I'm walking out this door now.
- Okay.

264
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,719
- For real.
- Good.

265
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,424
I'm not gonna look back.

266
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,557
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye!

267
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:21,673
I got you fired.

268
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:22,968
You deserved it.

269
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,195
Maybe.

270
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:25,929
Maybe not.

271
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,810
The question is.

272
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:30,058
What do they deserve?

273
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:37,023
Key to the kitchen.

274
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:38,524
There's a valve

275
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:41,383
on the back of the chicken fryer
that's not made anymore.

276
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:44,910
Now, say someone were to remove it.

277
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:46,950
The fryer wouldn't work...

278
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:51,746
- Forever.
- How petty do you think I am?

279
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,318
<i>Jeff leaving the family
didn't turn out to be a problem.</i>

280
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,365
I think we're set for the quiz.

281
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,760
- See you guys in class.
- Wait. Before you go.

282
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,721
- Here.
- Free notebooks.

283
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:09,848
<i>But the family's success</i>

284
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,893
- <i>started to go to their heads.</i>
- They didn't have college ruled?

285
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,060
Sorry.

286
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:15,688
It's okay.

287
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,591
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

288
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,384
We have a situation.

289
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:28,200
- Hey.
- Who is this?

290
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,495
It's Travis. You said you wanted someone
in your entourage named Travis.

291
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,024
Show him your license.

292
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,573
Travis is his middle name.

293
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:38,960
- I go by Travis.
- No, you go by the door.

294
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:41,760
See you, Travis.

295
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,056
My monkey hates this caviar.

296
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:55,852
Troy, isn't that...

297
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:58,198
<i>They were spoiled, fat,</i>

298
00:14:58,323 --> 00:14:59,147
<i>lazy.</i>

299
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:02,215
<i>I'd given them everything
and somehow I'd lost their respect.</i>

300
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,658
<i>So I did the only thing
I could think of.</i>

301
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,627
<i>I did what I thought Jeff would do.</i>

302
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:08,365
<i>I sent them a message.</i>

303
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:05,531
<i>These were the bad times.</i>

304
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,390
Abed killed my backpack.

305
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,142
And I caught him stuffing my man

306
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,978
full of chicken and Tyler Perry has
amovies about why that's wrong.

307
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,855
That little Arab is off his rocker.

308
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,573
He released Annie's boobs.

309
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:26,484
He could be anywhere.
He could be on the side of the road.

310
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,278
The monkey's name is
"Annie's boobs."

311
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,447
Look what Abed did to my hair.

312
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,102
I feel terrible for all of you.

313
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:34,117
No, I don't,

314
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,952
because I warned you about all this,

315
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,622
but you were so high
on your backpacks and hairstyles

316
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:40,707
you accused me of being jealous.

317
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,500
You were right. What can we do?

318
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:45,361
I'm sorry,
you brushed over that first part.

319
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,779
Together

320
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,954
You were right.

321
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,153
Now what you can do is go home
and write that on your bathroom mirror.

322
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,305
Wouldn't that make it seem
like I was right?

323
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,001
It's not gonna be reversed because
you're the one who...

324
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,142
As for Abed,

325
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,513
for his sake

326
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,235
I'll have to take him out.

327
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,321
Poor little guy.

328
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:36,277
What are you doing?

329
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:37,929
Making tater tots.

330
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:40,484
You were right,
people got sick of chicken.

331
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,894
But I was close.
I need a new food, a new system.

332
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,428
I'll experiment with jalapeno poppers
next and zucchini zircles.

333
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:46,523
I don't get it.

334
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,359
It's easy. They replaced the "c" in
circle with a "z" for zucchini.

335
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,620
No, I mean, why are you here?

336
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:53,947
You said you were close?

337
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,493
What were you close to?

338
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:02,247
To the group?

339
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:06,292
- To people?
- Don't do a special episode about me.

340
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,669
I wouldn't dream of it.

341
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:11,802
Everyone else needs my help.

342
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:15,743
That's what people don't get,
is that they need to get me.

343
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,974
I need to be able to connect to people
like you, then I can make everyone happy

344
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:27,731
You know why I'm here?

345
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,894
You got caught
with a fake bachelor's degree.

346
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,530
By the way, they started using that as
a seasonal arc on <i>Law & Order</i>.

347
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:33,680
Total rip off.

348
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,018
I'm here to dismantle the fryer,

349
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:39,502
to cut your power off at its source.

350
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:42,704
Don't you see what happened?

351
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:45,725
I manipulated the group
into getting you the fry cook job

352
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,754
so I could have some chicken.

353
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,886
And you turned it all into a way
to make everyone like you.

354
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:54,268
Made me ashamed of myself.

355
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,134
Made me jealous.

356
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,128
Maybe this is a special episode.

357
00:18:58,253 --> 00:18:59,981
It's pretty alarming behavior, Jeff.

358
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,641
- There's specialists you could talk to.
- Yeah, maybe I should do that.

359
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:07,312
In the meantime...
Let's make a deal.

360
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:11,775
I'll help you connect, and you
help me do a better job with them.

361
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,526
- Like <i>Knight Rider</i>.
- Exactly.

362
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,904
- Like <i>Knight Rider</i>.
- Deal.

363
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:18,865
I'll put a leather jacket,
make out with an aerobics instructor.

364
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:22,619
You pull around front and startle
passersby with your ability to talk.

365
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:25,789
Maybe we should stay here
and have a plate of chicken fingers.

366
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:30,293
Can we eat them
like in <i>Sixteen Candles</i>?

367
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,836
Pick one reference, Abed.

368
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:33,546
<i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

369
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:36,424
<i>And just like that,
the mafia movie was over.</i>

370
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,116
<i>I quit the fry cook job,
somewhat for the sake of the family,</i>

371
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:41,031
<i>but mostly
for the sake of Jeff's ego.</i>

372
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:42,592
<i>Poor guy.</i>

373
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:46,339
<i>Things went back to normal.</i>

374
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:48,621
<i>Everyone's back to being
a bunch of regular schnooks,</i>

375
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:50,569
<i>and I'm back to being a weirdo,</i>

376
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:52,686
<i>back to watching from the outside...</i>

377
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:53,899
<i>for now.</i>

378
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:56,896
<i>There's still not enough
chicken fingers.</i>

379
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,067
- No way.
- What?

380
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,884
<i>As soon as our family moved out, a new
syndicate moved in to take its place.</i>

381
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,888
But you know what they'll
never make a replacement for?

382
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:09,043
Friends.

383
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:14,311
Thank you. That's great, Abed.
But could you just

384
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:16,256
- answer the question?
- What was it?

385
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,176
Do you know who might have stolen
a box of hairnets from the kitchen?

386
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:21,719
Someone with hair.

387
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:24,037
I'm gonna write that down.

388
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:28,406
Ready?

389
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,231
- Never been done.
- Here I come.

390
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,819
- It's good.
- Double escalator.

391
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,698
I haven't see that before.

392
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,158
How did you think of that?

393
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:46,822
- And now for our signature trick.
- Awesome elevator.

394
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,163
- I can't do it.
- I got babies.

395
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,151
- I gotta get home.
- It's their loss.

396
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:04,105
That was awesome.
