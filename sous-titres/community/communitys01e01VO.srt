1
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:20,269
How do we turn this off?
Mom, you think you can help me?

2
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:24,370
How do we turn this off?
Can you help me with this?

3
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:27,095
Thank you so much.
I didn't mean to snap.

4
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:28,426
Good morning.

5
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:32,367
Many of you are halfway
through your first week at Greendale

6
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:33,926
and as your dean,

7
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:38,449
I thought I would share 
few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration.

8
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:41,150
What is community college?

9
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,587
Well, you've heard
all kinds of things.

10
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:47,880
You've heard it's loser college
for remedial teens,

11
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,226
20-something dropouts,

12
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,072
middle-age divorcees,

13
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:53,854
and old people

14
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,348
keeping their minds active
as they circle the drain of eternity.

15
00:00:58,113 --> 00:00:59,814
That's what you heard.

16
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,478
However, I wish you luck!

17
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:11,362
There's more.
There's a middle card missing.

18
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:14,552
Can we look around our immediate areas,
'cause I really wanted to...

19
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:17,002
I'm only half-arabic.
My dad is Palestinian.

20
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,400
He's a US citizen.
He's not a threat to National Security.

21
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,662
People wanna know that after meeting him
He is angry.

22
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:23,900
Not at America.
Just at my mom for leaving him.

23
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:26,713
Although she left cause he was angry
and he was angry cause she's American.

24
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:28,588
My name's Abed, by the way.

25
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:32,125
Abed, nice to know you
and then meet you in that order.

26
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,600
Now about that question
that I had...

27
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:37,198
5 after 11:00 when you asked.

28
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,474
What's the deal
with the hot girl from Spanish class?

29
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:42,226
I can't find a road in there.

30
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,251
I only talked to her once
while she was borrowing a pencil...

31
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:47,231
Her name is Britta, 28,
birthday in October,

32
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,584
she has two older brothers.
One of 'em works with children.

33
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,840
She thinks she's gonna flunk her test,
so she focuses.

34
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,363
She's sorry if she seems cold.

35
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:56,657
Holy crap.

36
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:00,513
I see your value now.

37
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:04,832
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

38
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:08,210
Absolutely not.

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,274
These guys knew you like I did,
they'd have given you a small office.

40
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,467
Jeff Winger!

41
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:16,354
Genius at law.

42
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:20,120
- You got to stop saying that.
- I will never do that. Sit down.

43
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,656
I still cannot figure out

44
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:24,685
how you got a jury to connect
September the 11th with my DUL,

45
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,562
let alone why that helped.

46
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,800
Well, 2002 was a simpler time.

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,108
So what is my lawyer doing here?

48
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,046
I'm a student.

49
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,988
That cannot be an inspiring journey.

50
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,187
I am in a bit of a jam.

51
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:40,785
The state bar
has suspended my license.

52
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:44,663
They found out my college degree
was less than legitimate.

53
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,958
- I thought you graduated from Columbia.
- Now I have to get one from America.

54
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,546
- And it can't be an email attachment.
- Well, you've picked a fine school.

55
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:55,611
And I'm hoping that our friendship

56
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:57,650
will yield certain advantages.

57
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,221
Academic guidance, moral support,

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,597
every answer to every test

59
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:05,893
for every one of the classes I'm taking.
Here's my schedule.

60
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,334
Now, Jeff, just by asking that,

61
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,820
you have insulted the integrity
of this entire institution.

62
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,568
Waster!
Not a bathroom!

63
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,550
Duncan,
you did seem less into integrity

64
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,575
the day that I convinced
12 of yours peers

65
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:24,267
that when you made that u-turn
on the freeway

66
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:26,747
and tried to order chalupas
from the emergency call box,

67
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,166
that your only crime
was loving America.

68
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,752
I do love America.
I love it very much.

69
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:36,398
- I love chalupas.
- But?

70
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:38,586
- I'll look into it.
- Thank you.

71
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:40,815
You are a good man.

72
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,265
Jeff, are you familiar with the adage
"cheaters never prosper"?

73
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,548
If I wanted to learn something,

74
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:49,800
I wouldn't have come
to community college.

75
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,180
- Spanish.
- Don't hit on me, okay?

76
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:27,642
I wouldn't dream of it.

77
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:30,185
I wanted to let you know
about my Spanish study group.

78
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:36,836
The guy playing bejeweled on his iPhone
all class has a study group?

79
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,235
Can I sign up twice?

80
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:42,436
I'm taking the class as an easy credit.
I'm actually a Spanish tutor.

81
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,200
- Board certified.
- Can you say that in Spanish now?

82
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:47,120


83
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,279
{\on more hour,
do not scratch my car.}

84
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,502
- I really need help with Spanish.
- I was willing to bet. I'm Jeff...

85
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:57,236
Or <i>jefe</i>.

86
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,546
- The group meets at the library at 4.
- Britta. Thanks.

87
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:04,387
You're gonna be there?

88
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:06,973


89
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:08,557
That means see you there.

90
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,470
Shouldn't be too hard
to fake a study group, right?

91
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:15,318
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,189
I was raised on TV

93
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:20,239
and I was conditioned to believe
that every black woman over 50

94
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:21,654
is a cosmic mentor.

95
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:25,157
Were you conditioned to pay
for your damn tacos, Sein-field?

96
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,233
Yes, I'm so sorry.

97
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,078
It's Seinfeld.

98
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:35,739
<i>Bienvenido.</i>

99
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:37,648
<i>¡Bienvenuto!</i>

100
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,623
All right, come on in.

101
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,548
Got the whole table.

102
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:44,507
- Got the whole room.
- Here's the...

103
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:48,048
Contact sheet.
Just put your stuff there.

104
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:53,145
Rest of the group is running late.

105
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,757
But we can get acquainted.

106
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:57,564
You may have noticed,
not so good at the small talk.

107
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,275
- I like big talk. What's your deal?
- That's not small talk?

108
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,473
What's your deal and is God dead?

109
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:04,835
You want to know my deal?

110
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,616
I dropped out of high school
because I thought for some reason

111
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,076
it would impress Radiohead.

112
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,370
You'd be surprised
what gets back to these guys.

113
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:13,551
I joined the Peace Corps.

114
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,565
Did a little foot modeling.

115
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,751
I got tear gassed
at a world trade rally.

116
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,877
Marry me.

117
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:22,690
And I guess, Jeff,
my deal is, above all else, honesty.

118
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,069
- Honesty?
- Yes.

119
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:28,675
Tell me the truth, I like you.
Lie to me, I will never talk to you.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,389
- That's my deal.
- A good deal.

121
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:32,084
So what's your deal?

122
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,143
I would have to go...
I would have to say...

123
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,230
honesty, because...

124
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:43,209
I would say anything to get what I want
and I want you to like me.

125
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:48,034
That's a very honest answer.

126
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:49,283
Now I like you.

127
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:50,987
Really?

128
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,661
- You're easy.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,039
Abed in the house!

130
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:00,899
- Why?
- Britta invited me. Is that cool?

131
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:03,710
I can't think of a single logical reason
why not.

132
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:05,583
There you go.

133
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,952
Here. Put your contact info
down right there.

134
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:09,227
That's right.

135
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:16,060
- It's like <i>Breakfast club</i>?
- We are in a library.

136
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,915
We've each got an issue balled up
that would make us cry

137
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,482
- if we talked about it.
- Have somethin balled up?

138
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:26,448
I got a little doozy in the chamber
if things get emotional.

139
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:28,906
Text message.

140
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,120
- Let's give this bad boy a read.
- It's probably just for you.

141
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:33,778
I've never gotten one of these.

142
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,581
"Say you have to pee.
I need to talk to you."

143
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,627
- "Say you have to pee."
- That is weird.

144
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,573
- "Say you have to pee. I need to... "
- Do you have to pee?

145
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,217
- That's so weird.
- I'm stumped.

146
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,967
- Very creepy.
- That makes two of us.

147
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:51,958
- What's that?
- Does it say you have to pee?

148
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,633
No, it's just someone

149
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,016
with a misguided
grasp of abbreviation.

150
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:58,769
I need five minutes,
so go ahead and study all the...

151
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:01,215
verbs in Spanish.

152
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:04,024
Abed, what's your read on that guy?

153
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:07,356
You look like Elisabeth Shue.

154
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:13,075
Just act natural. Pretend
you're watching the athletic proceeding.

155
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,202
You couldn't stop me
from watching them.

156
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,580
There's a guy trying out for this team
that is older than the game of poker.

157
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,781
He's kind of trucking.

158
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:26,332
Suppose I was to say to you
it was possible to get those answers?

159
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:29,072
I would say, "Go for that",
and could have said so in a text.

160
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:31,635
I'm asking you if you know
the difference between right and wrong.

161
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,939
I discovered at a very early age
that if I talk long enough,

162
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:38,068
I could make
anything right or wrong.

163
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:40,891
So either I'm God
or truth is relative.

164
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:42,312
And in either case, booyah.

165
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,695
It's just the average person

166
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,020
has a much harder time saying, "Booyah",
to moral relativism.

167
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,521
You don't have to play shrink
to protect your pride.

168
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:51,989
I accept. You're chicken.

169
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,961
Are you trying to use reverse psychology
on a psychologist?

170
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:57,828
I'm using regular psychology
on a spineless, British twit.

171
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,997
I'm a professor!
You can't talk to me that way.

172
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,333
- A 6-year-old girl could talk that way.
- Because that would be adorable!

173
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,170
No, because you're a 5-year-old girl
and there's a pecking order.

174
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,764
- Fine! I'll do it!
- Thank you.

175
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,174
Pleasure.

176
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:14,938
Why am I still shouting?

177
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,722
I'm drawing attention to myself.

178
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:19,725
You guys aren't gonna believe this,
but the rest of the group...

179
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,395
is here.

180
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,690
- Are you the board-certified tutor?
- That means you do my homework, right?

181
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,985
- I need to call my babysitter.
- What board certifies a tutor?

182
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:33,030
- Where's Britta?
- I invited people from the class.

183
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,866
- Cool?
- It's the coolest.

184
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:39,684
I'm gonna go to the bathroom

185
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,201
and bring my jacket,

186
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:44,408
wallet, and keys with me

187
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,496
in case there's a fire.

188
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:48,253
We go with him?

189
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,339
Ileave my homework
with Slumdog Millionaire.

190
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,715
That's racist.

191
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:57,832
And busted.

192
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,099
- Listen.
- Now you know. I'm a smoker.

193
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:04,937
Yeah, but they're filtered,
so that makes them safe.

194
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,106
Ready to get started?
The rest of your group showed up.

195
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,026
Not mine, actually. I think
Abed took out a page on Craigslist.

196
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,111
And I was trained never to say this,

197
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,781
but I think that group
may be untutorable.

198
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:16,907
Really?

199
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:19,284
So why don't you and I
go study over...

200
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:21,119
- Dinner?
- Or drinks.

201
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,701
I think, actually,
we should prioritize here

202
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:26,276
and study first
and then go to dinner.

203
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:31,755
If they really prove to be untutorable,
we'll slip out early.

204
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:35,145
They will be...

205
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,750
untutorable.

206
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,001
All right.

207
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,856
Look at this crew.

208
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,731
All ready to study all night.

209
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,402
- Well, I can stay at least till 10:00.
- But who studies with strangers, right?

210
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:56,347
- My name is Jeff.
- Jeff, it's a pleasure.

211
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:58,403
My name is Pierce Hawthorne and yes,

212
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:01,905
that is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne wipes,
the award-winning moist towellete.

213
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,162
- I was gonna ask.
- Also a toast master,

214
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,476
- so I should do the introductions.
- Definitely!

215
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,667
You already know Brittles.
Abed.

216
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,961
- Abed the arab. Is that inappropriate?
- Sure.

217
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:13,297
- Roy the wonder boy.
- Troy.

218
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,923
- Princess Elizabeth.
- Annie.

219
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:18,719
And finally, this beautiful creature
is named Shirley.

220
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:20,726
Is that even close?

221
00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:23,640
Why did I have to find out
about this group on accident?

222
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,059
- This is way more like <i>Breakfast club</i>.
- There's breakfast?

223
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:29,378
- Maybe we should get started...
- I've been in a lot of study groups

224
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:31,778
that fell apart
because of unresolved tension.

225
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,943
Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?
Did we not invite her?

226
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,115
- Sweetie, it's not behind your back.
- Can we stop with the sweeties?

227
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,897
Being younger
does not make me inferior.

228
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:45,145
If anything, your age indicates
that you've made bad life decisions.

229
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,664
- Shirley has a response.
- I don't.

230
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:55,254
I'm sure I've made
some bad life decisions

231
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:58,216
and maybe Annie's decisions
will be better.

232
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,476
But I think she needs to decide
whether she wanna be considered a child

233
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:04,998
or an adult, because children get pity
when not respected.

234
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:06,762
Adults, they get respect,

235
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:09,644
but they also get their head grabbed
and their face pushed through jukeboxes.

236
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:12,898
Why don't we try
learning "jukebox" in Spanish?

237
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,768
- What are you doing?
- Pierce!

238
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:18,070
- Let's discuss this creepiness.
- Pardon you?

239
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,988
- What are you doing?
- I'm certified.

240
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:23,825
Are you unaware that Shirley
finds your advances inappropriate?

241
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,119
What advances?

242
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,122
You have been sexually harassing me
since the very first day of class.

243
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:31,093
Sexually harassing?

244
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:33,895
What?
That makes no sense to me.

245
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,546
Why would I harass somebody
who turns me on?

246
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,383
Saying she turns you on
is the harassment, dude.

247
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,889
I am a prominent business leader
and a highly sought after dinner guest

248
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,309
and I will not take courting advice
from some teenage boy.

249
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:52,896
Well, this teenage boy is a quarterback
and a prom king.

250
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:56,108
You're not prom king anymore, Troy.
This isn't Riverside High.

251
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:57,919
How'd you know I went there?

252
00:12:58,105 --> 00:12:58,919
Because

253
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,447
you're wearing your stupid letter jacket
and more importantly,

254
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,991
I sat behind you in algebra.

255
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:08,245
You're the one who got hooked on pills
and dropped out.

256
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,707
- You're little Annie Adderall.
- Yes, and you are a stupid jock

257
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:15,794
who lost his scholarship by dislocating
both shoulders in a keg stand.

258
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:18,447
Keg flip.
They're very hard to pull off.

259
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,574
You don't know...
I'm a legend.

260
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,764
Know what I got for Christmas?

261
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,817
It was a banner year
at the bender family.

262
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,163
I got a carton of cigarettes.

263
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:37,649
The old man grabbed me,
he said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny!"

264
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,537
"No, Dad! What about you?"

265
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,411
That actually
was from the <i>Breakfast club</i>.

266
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,130
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

267
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:55,155
<i>Dirty Dancing</i>.

268
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,018
<i>It's professor Duncan.</i>

269
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,128
<i>Come to the parking lot now.</i>

270
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:00,823
What's wrong with your voice?

271
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:02,295
<i>I'm disguising it.</i>

272
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,052
I'll be right back.
But while I'm gone,

273
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,513
you guys need
to hash this stuff out.

274
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:09,931
No stone unturned.

275
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,915
Go!

276
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,235
Get in the car!

277
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,774
Act as if we've either just finished
or yet to begin driving.

278
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:34,205
Every answer to every test
in your curriculum this semester.

279
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,208
I knew you could do it, buddy.
Thank you.

280
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,247
Whoa there, grabby-grabby.

281
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,094
What do I get?

282
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,955
The satisfaction of being even.

283
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,952
Even, fairness, right, wrong.

284
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:46,510
- There is no God. Booyah, booyah.
- What do you want?

285
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,261
Your Lexus.

286
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,680
My car
for a semester's worth of answers?

287
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,833
Will it be just a semester though?

288
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,228
Won't you be taking the easy way out
for the next four years?

289
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,063
I want payment in advance.

290
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,774
I want leather seats
with built-in ball warmers.

291
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:04,402
You know, bluffs this weak
are how your people lost the colonies.

292
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:06,488
Have a nice disbarment hearing.

293
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:11,034
- What am I supposed to drive?
- Why don't you take this car? 

294
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,162
So is wiping your butt with a leaf,
but it's not how a man gets around!

295
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,594
It is a disaster in there.

296
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,167
Yeah, untutorable.

297
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,139
You like Thai food?
I love it.

298
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,600
Wait, so this is a game to you?

299
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,851
You put human beings

300
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,188
into a state of emotional shambles
for a shot at getting in my pants?

301
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:42,899
Why can't you see that
for the compliment that it is?

302
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,970
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

303
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:49,769
I did a little bit of lying
to get close to you.

304
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:52,695
But how was I supposed to know
that you were smart and cool?

305
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,412
- You look like Elisabeth Shue.
- You're unbelievable.

306
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,367
- What do I do?
- Maybe one decent thing

307
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,374
could be to go in there
and clean up your mess.

308
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:06,242
If I do that, then dinner, right?

309
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:10,617
Whatever.

310
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:13,182
As if there's a dinner on Earth
that could make me forget

311
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,746
you are a shallow douchebag.

312
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,280
You're gonna eat those words
when you see my new car.

313
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,402
All right, everybody!

314
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:28,570
I want to say something.
Sit down.

315
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,025
You don't have to yell.
I don't appreciate your tone.

316
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,678
You know what makes humans
different from other animals?

317
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:37,803
Feet.

318
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:39,664
Bears have feet.

319
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:43,710
We're the only species on Earth
that observes shark week.

320
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:47,488
Sharks don't even observe shark week,
but we do.

321
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,742
For the same reason
I can pick up this pencil,

322
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,135
tell you it's name is Steve,
and go like this.

323
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,179
And part of you dies

324
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,500
a little bit on the inside,

325
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:59,434
because people
can connect with anything.

326
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:02,287
We can sympathize with a pencil.
We can forgive a shark.

327
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:05,493
And we can give Ben Affleck
an Academy Award for screenwriting.

328
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:06,594
Big mistake.

329
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,597
People can find the good

330
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:10,945
in just about anything
but themselves.

331
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:12,340
Look at me.

332
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,491
It's clear to all of you
that I am awesome,

333
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:17,160
but I can never admit that
cause that would make me an ass.

334
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,429
But what I can do
is see what makes Annie awesome.

335
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:22,726
She's driven. We need driven people

336
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,929
or the lights go out
and the ice cream melts.

337
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:27,212
And Pierce.
We need guys like Pierce.

338
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:29,874
This guy has wisdom to offer.

339
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:32,429
- The Dalai Lama and I...
- We should listen to him sometime.

340
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:34,778
We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley.

341
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,637
Shirley has earned our respect,

342
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:39,849
not as a wife, not as a mother,
but as a woman.

343
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,546
Don't test her on that,

344
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:44,437
because that thing about the jukebox
was way too specific to be improvised.

345
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:48,274
And Troy. Who cares
if Troy thinks he's all that?

346
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:49,567
Maybe he is.

347
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:52,922
You think astronauts go to the moon
because they hate oxygen?

348
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:55,927
They're trying to impress
their high school's prom king.

349
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:57,052
And Abed.

350
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:58,784
Abed's a shaman.

351
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:02,610
You ask him to pass the salt,
he gives you a bowl of soup,

352
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:04,749
because you know what?
Soup is better.

353
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:06,251
Abed is better.

354
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:09,045
You are all better
than you think you are.

355
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,048
You are just designed not to believe it
when you hear it from yourself.

356
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Soup?

357
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,051
Look at the person on your left.

358
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:19,347
Sorry. Look at the person
sitting next to you.

359
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:20,838
Look at her?

360
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,058
I want you to extend to that person

361
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:29,065
the same compassion that you extend
to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck.

362
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:30,817
Say to that person,

363
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:32,489
"I forgive you".

364
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:37,740
You little twerp.

365
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,868
I'd like you to say,
"I forgive you".

366
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:41,562
He didn't say it?

367
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:45,239
You've just stopped
being a study group.

368
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,216
You have become something
unstoppable.

369
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:50,662
I hereby pronounce you

370
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:52,297
a community.

371
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:53,965
That's nice.

372
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,679
This isn't like <i>Breakfast club</i>.
Now it's like <i>Stripes</i> or <i>Meatballs</i>.

373
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:05,143
- Anything with Bill Murray, really.
- I agree tonight has been very special.

374
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:10,489
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a dinner engagement with Britta.

375
00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:12,906
I lied.

376
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:17,237
Thanks for calming everyone down.
But since you're not a Spanish tutor,

377
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:20,267
just a lying creep
who purposely upset everyone

378
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,952
in an attempt to get with me,
I'd appreciate it if you left

379
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,704
and stopped wasting all of our time.

380
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,623
Everybody ready?

381
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:29,363
Fine.

382
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,311
And I'm happy to report

383
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:35,465
that one of the benefits
of being a lying creep

384
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,176
is having all the answers
to tomorrow's test.

385
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,255
And I'm happy to share them

386
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,181
with anyone whose time I've wasted
more than they've wasted mine.

387
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,058
If you have all the answers,
why did you start this study group?

388
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,188
I don't have a study group.
I made it up.

389
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,482
- The "look left" speech?
- Made it up.

390
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,074
I make things up
and I got paid a lot of money to do it

391
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,498
before I came
to this school-shaped toilet.

392
00:19:58,623 --> 00:19:59,873
I was a lawyer.

393
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,048
That explains everything.

394
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:06,621
I thought you were like Bill Murray,
but you're more like Michael Douglas.

395
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,332
You have asperger's.

396
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:14,087
"Ass burger."

397
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,864
It's a serious disorder.

398
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,801
If it's so serious,
why don't they call it meningitis?

399
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:22,971
- "Ass burger."
- Burger for your ass.

400
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,163
You may want to think
about the gift you've been given.

401
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:51,401
An excuse to punch a hippy?

402
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:53,960
No, not that.
An important lesson, my friend.

403
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:55,211
See,

404
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,882
the tools you acquired to survive
will not help you here at Greendale.

405
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:02,955
What you have, my friend,
is a second chance at an honest life.

406
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,970
Why are people
trying to teach me things

407
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,892
at a school
that has an express tuition aisle?

408
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:12,353
- Give me my keys.
- I have to keep the car for the lesson.

409
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,479
Don't hit me.

410
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:17,329
Are we cool?

411
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:21,988
We cool.

412
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:25,829
I like you, Jeffrey.

413
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:29,829
You remind me of myself at your age.

414
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:32,644
I deserve that.

415
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:36,221
I've been divorced

416
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:37,629
seven times.

417
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:41,626
Sometimes I think
I'm doing something wrong.

418
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:49,223
You keep getting married.

419
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:51,719
I never looked at it that way.

420
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:56,808
Shouldn't you guys be studying?

421
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:59,082
Things got kind of boring
after you left.

422
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:01,361
Let me ask you something.

423
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:04,648
People been clowning me
about this jacket since I got here,

424
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:08,618
but if I take it off to make them happy,
that just makes me weak, right?

425
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,329
Listen.

426
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:11,767
It doesn't matter.

427
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:14,999
You lose the jacket to please them.
You keep it to piss them off.

428
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,129
Either way, it's for them.

429
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,212
That's what's weak.

430
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:24,509
You wrinkled my brain, man.

431
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,602
- He's good, huh?
- He's real good.

432
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:29,722
Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed
covered in test answers?

433
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,744
I don't have any of the answers.

434
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,480
I'm gonna flunk the test.

435
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,577
You just study for, like, an hour.
It's not that hard.

436
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:42,569
You seem pretty smart.
You got a sports coat.

437
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,694
Well, me.

438
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:45,397
Funny thing about being smart

439
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:48,324
is that you can get through most of life
without ever having to do any work.

440
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,662
I'm not really sure how to do that.

441
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:07,093
What's going on?
Can you guys hear me?

442
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,061
Am I deaf?
Can you hear me talking right now?

443
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,622
That's good.

444
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,099
You know what?

445
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,633
Actually,
we didn't get that far without you,

446
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:20,208
so if you wanna come back upstairs.

447
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:24,542
Really?

448
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:27,030
Well, it is your study group, so.

449
00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:29,198
- Come on, let's study.
- Sounds good.

450
00:23:30,152 --> 00:23:31,252
No pressure.

451
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:44,223
I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas
and I see your value now.

452
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:49,414
Well, that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.
