1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,842
I had to get up so early for my bus,

2
00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:04,632
I caught the tail end
of what cinemax gets up to at night.

3
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:05,979
Subscription canceled.

4
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:08,549
I got that channel for
Eddie Murphy movies, not stimulation.

5
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,907
Why are you taking the bus?
Where is your minivan?

6
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:14,757
My ex-husband needed it.
The person he's dating works at a club.

7
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,104
An hour from the city.

8
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:19,352
I'll play a violin for them,
and maybe she can strip to it.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,563
Kind people are always kind,
not just when it's easy.

10
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:23,939
As we stand

11
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,351
once again upon the deadline

12
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:27,855
to drop or add classes,

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,360
I hereby present
this semester's Jeff Winger pick

14
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:33,426
for ultimate blow-off class:

15
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:35,326
Beginner pottery.

16
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,696
Your last "blow-off" class ended up
teaching me to live in the moment,

17
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,960
which I will always
regret and never do again.

18
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,283
This one's different.
I researched.

19
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:45,068
You don't have to make a good pot.

20
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:47,922
You get an art credit
for participation.

21
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:52,229
This class is like a redhead
that drinks scotch and loves <i>Die Hard.</i>

22
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:54,288
I suggest you all get her number.

23
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:58,099
Guess which class I signed up for.

24
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,101
Singing with tennille?

25
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:02,853
Sailing.

26
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,981
The nearest body of water
is 2 1/2 h away.

27
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,326
Leagues, Abed.

28
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,275
We don't measure water by hours.

29
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,443
It's a one-week intensive that gives you
hands-on experience on a real boat

30
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,668
right here in the parking lot.

31
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,492
I'd rather boats than pots.

32
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,854
I was going to take a class on how to
put together an online dating profile,

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,081
but sailing in the parking lot
is less pathetic.

34
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,145
A black person on a sailboat?

35
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,002
I gotta see this. I'm in.

36
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:27,920
How 'bout you, Abed?
Wanna sail?

37
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,541
- There's black people.
- There's two.

38
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,825
Hello, ladies.
What are you making, big balls here?

39
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,343
You guys getting dirty?

40
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:44,392
What are you looking at?

41
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:48,399
Laura Ingalls.
Home depot guy.

42
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,984
Who's making pots?

43
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:53,358
Let's participate this thing.

44
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:55,197
I don't know why you're laughing.

45
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,659
I really do want
to make my mom an ashtray.

46
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:06,250
Hello, my precious blueberries.

47
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,516
Let's spin those wheels and play.

48
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,758
With some clay.

49
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:16,703
Now there's one,
and only one, rule in this class.

50
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,689
I will tolerate no reenacting,

51
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,572
whether it's ironic or sincere,

52
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:24,185
of the Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore
pottery scene in <i>Ghost</i>.

53
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,288
Ever since that movie
was released in 1990,

54
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,961
I have seen every
conceivable variation

55
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,736
of what I call "ghosting."

56
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:37,026
This could be guy-on-girl,
girl-on-guy...

57
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:39,895
the hilarious guy-on-guy.

58
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,592
So, since it never stopped,

59
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,960
I had to adopt
a zero <i>Ghost</i> tolerance

60
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:51,494
policy.

61
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,916
If you so much as 3 notes
from that righteous brothers song,

62
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,361
with God is my witness,
I will come at you.

63
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:00,095
With everything I've got.

64
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,220
Let's have a great time!

65
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:07,441
I'm making falafel.

66
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,114
Not edible.

67
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:14,038
What are you making?

68
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:15,194
A vase.

69
00:03:18,738 --> 00:03:20,088
Look what I made.

70
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,758
Participant badge.

71
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:27,957
I don't know how.

72
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,251
I just...
I stuck my hands into the clay

73
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,746
- And it happened.
- You look at me.

74
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:35,339
You have a gift.

75
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,577
Jeff's competitive side
had come out before.

76
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,147
He had even displayed envy.

77
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:42,773
But on that first day of pottery class,
he discovered...

78
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:45,919
- What did we discuss?
- No voiceover. Sorry.

79
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,518
It is kind of a crutch.

80
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,159
- Feygnasse Team -

81
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,903
. :: La Fabrique ::.

82
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,867
1x19: Beginner Pottery

83
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,655
I've never been on a boat before.
I didn't know what to wear.

84
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:01,782
Yeah, it's intimidating.

85
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,683
We're in Pierce's world now.

86
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:06,340
He's got all the boat clothes.
Look at him christen.

87
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:08,539
That were me,
I would have broken the bottle.

88
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:11,584
I'm professor Slaughter.

89
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,093
Welcome aboard the <i>S. S. Nose Candy</i>,

90
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,464
purchased
through government auction.

91
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:18,799
That's nice.

92
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,712
It's your only weapon
against the raging sea.

93
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:23,800
You don't know how to use her,
you're dead.

94
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:25,514
You'll work as one crew.

95
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,666
You will succeed or fail
as one crew.

96
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,763
You'll consider
this parking lot the ocean.

97
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:31,687
Whatever you drop, you lose.

98
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,981
Mishandle the sails,
you capsize and die.

99
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,734
Does little miss nice have a name?

100
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,446
Now you're Captain Bennett.

101
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,573
Man!

102
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,491
You will follow her every order.

103
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:49,914
- I've never been a captain before.
- I have.

104
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,583
I commanded a jet ski
through an electrical storm

105
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,712
and only had one casualty.

106
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:58,756
- Jet skis only hold two people.
- Exactly. Saved half the crew.

107
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,019
- Pottery's much cooler than I thought.
- And harder!

108
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,803
Except for that guy Rich.
He's, like, a natural.

109
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,932
I'm worried about the effect
that it's having on Jeff, though.

110
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:11,018
Someone call a shrink.
What?

111
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,561
You're usually the cool one.

112
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,899
You understand the point
of a blow-off class is to blow it off,

113
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:20,486
not to be cool, making
really important mud pies.

114
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,279
You don't admit he's talented?

115
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,331
No, because he's not.

116
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,981
If I were to make an effort,

117
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,952
you'd think I was
the cat's pajamas too.

118
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,320
Cat's pajamas?

119
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,959
Somebody's mommy gave him
too much praise.

120
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,419
So did someone's psyche teacher.

121
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:47,541
Yes, I was robbed at the YMCA.

122
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,056
Again.

123
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:55,663
All right.

124
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:57,727
Let's do this.

125
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,458
Jeff, do you know what you are?

126
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,057
You're special.

127
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,992
You're very special, Jeff.

128
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:18,583
You're the most special little boy
in the world.

129
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:32,641
- Take her back to Harbor!
- Flank the sheets and

130
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,477
trim the head sail.

131
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,897
Eyes on me for a moment.

132
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,985
I don't see students here.
I see seamen.

133
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:44,862
And I didn't create them.

134
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,115
From the moment you climbed aboard,
I saw seamen inside you.

135
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,962
More importantly, you've stopped
giggling at the word "seamen."

136
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,829
And that's the mark
of a real seaman.

137
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,497
As you were.

138
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,543
Okay, then.
Crew, make fast the topping lift.

139
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,587
I'll get the rope.

140
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,467
- Oh, my God!
- Damn, he's ghost riding the jib.

141
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,302
Hang on!

142
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,864
That hat's gone. Lost at sea.

143
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:14,433
I might be able to reach it!
It landed on that Hyundai.

144
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:18,354
I mean, mermaid's car.

145
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:20,189
Get back on this boat!

146
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,526
I spoke too soon.
Everybody gets a "d."

147
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:28,380
If I'd have chosen to hit
you with a storm just then,

148
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:29,782
you would have failed.

149
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,076
You better get your crew in line,
captain.

150
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,953
Permission to speak!

151
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,248
You screwed the pooch on that one,
Captain,

152
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,542
and I can't swim.

153
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,366
So you see, ladies,
it's actually a working fountain.

154
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,849
With a bird.

155
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:52,346
Jeff, ready to make some art
in the shape of a vase?

156
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:54,181
No, I can't.

157
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:57,375
- Let me take a look.
- Come on, Rich.

158
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,104
Being good at beginner pottery
doesn't mean you can heal people.

159
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,921
That's true.
But my medical degree does.

160
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:04,900
- I'm a doctor.
- A doctor?

161
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,446
I take pottery to unwind.

162
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:09,488
Haven't lost a patient in 5 years.
Puts a lot of pressure.

163
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:13,539
So the good news is
this is neither sprained nor broken.

164
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:16,107
Thank God.
But I'll have to get a second opinion

165
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:18,038
from a guy
in my basket weaving class.

166
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,583
That's great. That's funny.

167
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,837
Good to see you getting along with Rich.
What's he like?

168
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,339
He's a ringer.

169
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:29,299
A what?

170
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,344
You know, a conman.
A grifter. A ringer.

171
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,638
An expert potter
who signs up for novice classes

172
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,140
to impress people.

173
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,358
But, why join a pottery class?

174
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,394
Why not just say: I'm a doctor."

175
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,104
Because he's crazy.

176
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:44,829
Fancy jobs don't impress people.

177
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:46,608
You weren't impressed I'm a lawyer.

178
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,280
Anyone could be a lawyer.
You can even represent yourself.

179
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,621
You can't do surgery on yourself.
It's illegal. You'd get arrested.

180
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:54,366
And you'd get a free lawyer.

181
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,752
Rich showed me
how to make a flared lip on my pot

182
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:58,787
and check for breast lumps.

183
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,829
I don't know how
and I don't know when,

184
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:03,992
but one day,
that guy is gonna slip up.

185
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:06,670
And when that happens,
I am gonna be there to expose him.

186
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,187
Check it out.
If your finger's still bugging you,

187
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:10,712
just get creative.

188
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:15,220
- I wanna kiss you on the mouth.
- I'm sorry?

189
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:25,189
Don't run so fast.
You're among friends.

190
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,184
- How you doing? What's up?
- Not much. <i>Nada mucho</i>.

191
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,775
Noddily... merchant.

192
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:32,390
I just wanted to thank you,
doc pottery-wood,

193
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:35,503
- for taking a look at my finger.
- Anytime.

194
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:38,035
Doc pottery-wood.
I like it.

195
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,953
Have you taken many pottery classes?

196
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:43,081
- This is my first. Ever.
- Of the year?

197
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,917
- No pottery at school?
- Medical?

198
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,836
- Pottery school?
- How long?

199
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:51,632
It's weird.
I feel like I'm being interrogated,

200
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,468
by someone who doesn't want to know
anything important.

201
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,932
New Mexico.
Long way from home.

202
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,434
Yeah,
I did my residency in Santa Fe.

203
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,435
Santa Fe?

204
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:06,021
Can I give you a lift somewhere?

205
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:07,468
No, thanks.

206
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,941
I'm gettin' there.

207
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:11,933
Of course, yes...

208
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:18,671
Did you sleep here?

209
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:20,218
Only for a few hours.

210
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:23,038
Guess where Rich is from.

211
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,749
Couldn have been crazy town.
You have gone toschool together.

212
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,964
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

213
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:31,171
Nobody gets out of Santa Fe
without learning how to make a pot.

214
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,422
45% Hispanic,

215
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,007
fifth highest native

216
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,515
American population.
They eat and breathe clay there.

217
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,430
Some of this research
may have been done on wikipedia.

218
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,807
You're mocking me?

219
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:42,975
You?

220
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:45,038
No, fine. Go ahead...
Mock me.

221
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,896
- You're goldbluming.
- Goldbluming?

222
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,093
I don't know what that means.

223
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:55,093
I have work to do, before class,

224
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:57,489
because
I want to catch rich when he slips up.

225
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,866
Who even cares if he's pretending
to be a beginner?

226
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:01,583
Pottery cares.

227
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,860
Integrity cares.

228
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,581
I don't care.
I just care that he cares.

229
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,895
It's lame that he cares.

230
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,447
My shoelace came untied.
It could happen to anybody.

231
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:11,586
It's your excuse?

232
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,631
Britta weighs five pounds, Troy
can't swim, I've never seen the ocean.

233
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,092
I can swim, racist.

234
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,456
Listen, Pierce.
On my boat, the crew comes first.

235
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,514
No single person is above it. You
either shape up or ship the hell out.

236
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:26,018
Now I know what the "c"
in "captain" stands for.

237
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,860
Crabapple.

238
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,189
Shirley, I thought you said
that kind people were always kind.

239
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,251
Yes, and strong people change.

240
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:36,490
If the sea was always still and calm,
nobody would respect her.

241
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:37,821
I'm like the sea.

242
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,033
Cuckoo birds, do you mind?
This is important.

243
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,119
Most mental problems
are activated in College.

244
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,166
I hope I get multiple personalities.

245
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,615
I get lonely in long showers.

246
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:54,415
Barometer's dropping.
Temperature's warm.

247
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:57,227
We're heading into
a high pressure flow.

248
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,958
That's a perfect storm.

249
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:02,971
Reef the mainsail and furl the jib!

250
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,094
Is that nautical talk
or urban speak?

251
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:06,699
We have to turn back.

252
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:08,935
- Accidental jibe!
- Hit the deck!

253
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:13,732
Man overboard!

254
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,275
My god, Pierce is dead!

255
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,235
No, wait.
His stomach is moving.

256
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:22,866
Pull me in!

257
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,072
The storm is overtaking you,
Captain.

258
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:26,453
We don't have time.

259
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,955
I'm trying.
I have skinny arms for a quarterback.

260
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:30,101
I said

261
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:32,125
we don't have time.

262
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,213
What?
No.

263
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,381
Wait.

264
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,477
Pull me in.
What do you mean "time"?

265
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:40,467
That's it.

266
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,228
Bring the boom Amidship.

267
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:58,568
What in God's name have we done?

268
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,367
Get out of my parking spot, dip-wad!

269
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,625
Security!

270
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,973
Take an intermediate class
if you're intermediate.

271
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,969
Don't come in here making
your fear of failure our problem.

272
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:16,621
I mean, it's crazy.

273
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:17,828
It's crazy.

274
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:19,673
He's a crazy person.

275
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:20,882
I'm scared.

276
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,386
It's okay. This is good for him.
He's confronting his own limitations.

277
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:26,968
Busted!

278
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:30,132
Fatal mistake, Richy boy.

279
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:32,686
You... are... busted.

280
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:35,230
- I am?
- You just used

281
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,199
the throwing off the hump method.

282
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:40,926
That's an advanced pottery technique,
which I know,

283
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,742
because last night, I read

284
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:45,615
the entire encyclopedia of pottery.

285
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,659
What are you talking about?

286
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,535
You are no beginner...

287
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:51,953
Santa Fe.

288
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,234
What is going on, my blueberries?

289
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:56,863
Show him what you did.

290
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,902
- No.
- I rest my case.

291
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,130
What case?

292
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,007
Throw the freakin' hump, imposter!

293
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:07,846
It's the hilarious guy-on-guy.

294
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,972
One rule I asked you to follow. One.

295
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:12,360
Look!

296
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:16,110
I had it made before he died.
It's not in bad taste.

297
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:17,575
Out, Winger!

298
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:18,964
Fine.

299
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,270
That's fine.

300
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,618
No, that's fine.

301
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:24,407
Congratulations.

302
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,434
You failed a class so easy

303
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,451
that people pass it in the hallway
get a contact credit!

304
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:32,505
My love.

305
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,001
My darlin'.

306
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,583
You son of a...

307
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,157
I've hungered for your touch.

308
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,512
This is abuse!

309
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,801
This is abuse! Stop it!
That is a satanic sound!

310
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,512


311
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,811
Do you still have
the number of thatinvestigator

312
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,016
When you thought
Ross Perot was sleep with your mom?

313
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,147
It's about that guy
in your pottery class?

314
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,022
Face the facts. This kid's got
some natural talent you just don't have.

315
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,274
- How you know?
- It's all over the school.

316
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:02,975
Great.

317
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:06,573
Why aren't you in sailing class?

318
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,031
they drowned me.

319
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,953
 - Why?
- For a better grade.

320
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,452
Weren't we discussing your flaws?

321
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:15,664
Why are you letting this guy get
to you so much? What's going on?

322
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:17,999
I made a bad pot.

323
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:23,887
For some reason, I always thought
that I was special and different.

324
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,438
And I guess
I just have a really hard time

325
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:30,297
when I want to be good at something,

326
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:31,763
and I suck.

327
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:37,519
Give me a hand.

328
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,062
What you doing?

329
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,106
I'm going back to my sailing class.

330
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,649
After they murdered you?

331
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,109
When I was born,

332
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,883
I got my umbilical cord wrapped
around my neck,

333
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:48,655
both arms, and one of my ankles.

334
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:51,783
Mom said that there came a point
when the doctors stopped delivering me

335
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,470
and just started laughing.

336
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,759
If I ever let being bad
at something stop me,

337
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:59,499
I wouldn't even be here.

338
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,025
That thing some men call failure,

339
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,580
I call living.

340
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,115
Breakfast.

341
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,748
And I'm not leaving till
I've cleaned out the buffet.

342
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,511
Now, how 'bout a shove?

343
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,769
Good luck.

344
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:21,276
Don't need it.

345
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:22,542
Never had it.

346
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,474
Britta, trim the boom flat.

347
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,572
Troy, sit windward to heal the boat.

348
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:33,021
My, the sea has a worthy opponent.

349
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,416
Oh, my God.
It's Pierce.

350
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,128
Man, that guy's life is one,
big joke.

351
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,487
I feel bad for him, but things have
been running smoother since he drowned.

352
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,263
I bet he gets that all the time.

353
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,313
- My God.
- I'm going down!

354
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,677
Pierce is going to be the only person
ever to drown in a parking lot.

355
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,072
Twice.

356
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:12,739
Help!

357
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,116
Damn the storm!
We're going after Pierce.

358
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,118
Jump the halyard.
Star-burns,

359
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,704
get down there and man the iron jenny.
Man overboard!

360
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,048
That's an order!

361
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:22,916
I'm gonna sink!

362
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:26,252
I am about to get the only "a"
I will ever get,

363
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,546
- and Pierce isn't even dying.
- Bailing!

364
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,215
You don't have to do this.

365
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,360
I know.

366
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,028
But I'd rather be kind and get stepped
on every once in a while than

367
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:37,829
be a hard-ass
and turn my back on a friend.

368
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:39,724
Hoist the mains.

369
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:44,354
I don't wanna go this way.

370
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,392
We're coming, Pierce!

371
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:52,646
Help!

372
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:55,130
How's it looking?

373
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:58,352
- We gotta go faster!
- Okay, come on, star-burns!

374
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,828
It's filling with water!

375
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:11,339
It's going down!

376
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,058
Pierce, we're coming!

377
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,732
Dear God.

378
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:16,044
Dear God.

379
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,352
Here you go.
We got you.

380
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:30,524
Here you go.

381
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,196
- You okay?
- You all right?

382
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:38,658
You just steered your boat into a storm.
Any last words?

383
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,305
The sea may be cold and unforgiving,

384
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:43,288
but I'm not.

385
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:45,790
The ship might go down, but,

386
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,919
- At least she'll go down with honor.
- I'll take your Captain's hat.

387
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:52,282
'cause I'm promoting you to Admiral.

388
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:53,888
You all get an "a."

389
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,884
Admiral Shirley.
I like that.

390
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,886
It means nothing.
The class is over.

391
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,345
But you deserve it.

392
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,139
Somebody has to to this.

393
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,308
I'm king of the wo...

394
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,187
Don't ruin a perfect week.

395
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,274
I'm not

396
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,901
gonna spoon you again.

397
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,072
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah, I can't...

398
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:16,768
fully explain my behavior.

399
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:19,151
I'd love to blame booze
or demon possession, but...

400
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:22,065
you know what? Don't worry about it.
I'm bad at holding grudges.

401
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,647
I'm bad at pottery.

402
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:25,663
I'm an amateur

403
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,291
pottery enthusiast
trying as hard as I can

404
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,169
at something I suck at. It's great.

405
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,712
The teacher said I can stay,

406
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:35,308
if I don't have any more
ghostbursts.

407
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,761
Fantastic.

408
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:37,967
Good luck.

409
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:39,972
Don't need it.

410
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:45,222
You're a normal person.

411
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,765
There's nothing very special
about you at all.

412
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:50,732
You're going to be great
at a few things,

413
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,108
but really crappy at many more.

414
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,326
And that takes a lot
of the pressure off,

415
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,940
so you can live a full, happy life.

416
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:01,922
And sorry it took me so long
to tell you that.

417
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,367
And it was only in your imagination.

418
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,492
My bad.

419
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,414
Kind of a sloppy mom.

420
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,804
That's okay, mom.
Nobody's perfect.

421
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:13,168
I'm still scared.

422
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,511
A clay ashtray.

423
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,116
You're an idiot.

424
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,694
Why do you have time
to make pottery?

425
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,557
Couldn't you use
a little more practice being a doctor?

426
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,663
Not that it'll
ever bring your brother back to life.

427
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:30,506
It was supposed to be you
on that roller coaster, Richard.

428
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:33,002
It was supposed to be you!

429
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:43,250
Oh, come on!

430
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,592
Again?
