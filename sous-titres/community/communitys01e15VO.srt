1
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:03,753
Missed you at lunch today.

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,921
You had a quickie
with professor hot stuff?

3
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,579
It's Michelle, how did you know?

4
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:09,567
There's a gold star on your fly.

5
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,520
You weren't kidding.

6
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,219
Nice to have a girlfriend with humor

7
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:16,073
and one who recognizes good work.

8
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:17,683
Let me teach you the chords.

9
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,602
See, that's "g".
The most important chord.

10
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:22,271
In my mind, it stands for "god".

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,220
Why is Annie talking
to micro-nipples?

12
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:25,900
Vaughn?
Whatever.

13
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,736
But not like a bible god,
cause I think god is in everything.

14
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:30,655
You're complicated.

15
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,130
<i>Annie</i>

16
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:34,917
<i>Annie, where are you going today?</i>

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,119
Spanish class?

18
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,257
<i>Spanish</i>

19
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,960
You know what I don't get?

20
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:42,507
He never wears a shirt.
He never wears shoes.

21
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:44,736
Why hasn't he died
from lack of service?

22
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,898
Watching another movie tonight?

23
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:52,343
<i>Kickpuncher,</i> starring
Don "the demon" Donaldson

24
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,470
Cyborg cop whose punches
have the power of kicks.

25
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,597
That sounds awful.
I'll bring the popcorn.

26
00:00:58,162 --> 00:00:59,975
You watch bad movies on purpose?

27
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,811
Yeah, we make fun of 'em.

28
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,029
Don't embarrass yourself.
They don't want to invite a housewife.

29
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:07,437
Actually, if she doesn't mind
reinforcing the stereotype,

30
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:09,638
She would have fun
talking smack at a movie.

31
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:11,362
- You join us?
- When a movie's bad,

32
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,405
I stop watching,
but this sounds college-y.

33
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,295
What time you want us there?

34
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:20,204
Pierce, you don't wanna watch
a cyborg movie in Abed's dorm.

35
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,249
You wanna lay on your twin bed
and think about what you used to be.

36
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,217
What?

37
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:27,425
You think I'm too old
to make monkeyshines at a picture show?

38
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,755
I'm younger
than the three of you put together.

39
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,804
Everyone talks about his nipples,

40
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,388
but his feet freak me out.

41
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,670
Can I ask you something...

42
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,190
about Vaughn?

43
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,315
Still don't know
if that's his first or last name.

44
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:51,185
He's sweet, actually.

45
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,053
I mean, you must have thought so.

46
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,199
He has a sincerity
I found attractive in a simpler time.

47
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,163
Would you...

48
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:02,561
I haven't...

49
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:03,733
We haven't...

50
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:04,790
anything.

51
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,908
I mean...

52
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,293
Wow, you and Vaughn.

53
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:10,332
- Would it bug you?
- What about you and Troy?

54
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:15,681
The other day after Spanish,
I thought he tried to hold my hand,

55
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,153
but he'd just mistaken me for Abed.

56
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,274
He'll never think of me that way.

57
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:21,354
Well...

58
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,769
I would have to be a villain
to tell you who to date, which I am not.

59
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:28,189
Thank you!

60
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,148
You're the coolest girl
I've ever met.

61
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,026
Damn right!
Give me some fivesies.

62
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,333
Turning it into a snake.

63
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,330

65
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:48,995
1x15: Beginner Pottery

66
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,760
How's it going? Did you hear?
It's cute, Annie and Vaughn.

67
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,385
- Get to the cute part.
- She's into him.

68
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,225
- She asked for my blessing!
- And you gave it?

69
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:08,136
- Yeah, I'm done with him.
- It's not about you, groovy hipster.

70
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,064
It's about Annie.
We're like her Greendale parents!

71
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,697
You gotta say no to that stuff.

72
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:13,984
He's not that bad.

73
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,371
Not if you're 28
and fooling around with him.

74
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,488
She's 18.

75
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,698
Her taste in men
is still being established.

76
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:22,575
Creepier and creepier dudes
will start thinking of her

77
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,515
as an option,
and it all starts with Vaughn.

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,872
A gateway douche bag.

79
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,207
People collide, things happen.
It can't be controlled, right?

80
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,212
And that can be your toast
at her shotgun wedding to Star-burns.

81
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:38,300
Yeah, turn to your left.
Now turn to your right.

82
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,331
Yes, we can see both of them.

83
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:42,137
Like a constellation on your face.

84
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:45,891
What's up, dude?

85
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,627
That guy over there,
he's a douche bag.

86
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,292
- Hey, guys.
- <i>Hola</i>.

87
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,981
You don't mind I invited Senor Chang.
We're Netflix friends.

88
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,903
Cool that you're hanging out,
drinking beers with your students.

89
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:01,240
Clearly,
none of my other plans fell through.

90
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,158
Let's get to the movie.

91
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:04,827
Wait, sorry Shirley.

92
00:04:05,497 --> 00:04:07,538
I'll wait
if you wanna serve beverages.

93
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,540
You gonna be waiting
a long-ass time.

94
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:15,796
FBI warning... I'm so scared!

95
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,966
That's not fair.
I didn't know we started.

96
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,218
<i>It is the year 2006 a.d.,</i>

97
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,429
<i>and nuclear war
has ravaged the planet.</i>

98
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,976
I must have missed that.

99
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:27,099
Nice.

100
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,534
<i>... is a free-fire zone</i>

101
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:31,478
<i>ruled by scavengers,
drug dealers, and terrorists.</i>

102
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,355
Sounds like a thanksgiving
at my house.

103
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:35,232
That's pretty crazy.

104
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:38,318
They just come to me.

105
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,238
<i>You guys wanna buy some mega dope?
It gets you mega high.</i>

106
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,324
Will it get me through this movie?

107
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:45,951
Shirley is in the house.

108
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,601
<i>Freeze, police!</i>

109
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,570
Freeze police?
Don't do that, they'll get cold.

110
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:01,258
<i>You have done so much for our city.
Kickpuncher,</i>

111
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,761
<i>is there anything
that we can give you?</i>

112
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,429
Two hours of my life back.

113
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,733
<i>Don't call me Kickpuncher.</i>

114
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:12,144
<i>Call me David.</i>

115
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:14,635
"Directed by Kim Yang."

116
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,399
Asian...

117
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,567
Can't direct, can't drive.

118
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,362
Dude, I'm right here.

119
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,190
Right there.

120
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:24,418
So...

121
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,091
Clearly we're all a bunch
of funny people.

122
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,745
- When are we doing this again?
- Well actually...

123
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:39,003
Tomorrow we'll get together to watch
<i>Kickpuncher 2: Codename Punchkicker.</i>

124
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,708
I was just warming up tonight.

125
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,676
Tomorrow you better foam the runways,
'cause I'm bringing my "a" game.

126
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,303
Awesome.

127
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,437
He's got her
in some kind of hippie collar.

128
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:00,576
I can hear her armpit hair
growing from here.

129
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:02,257
We got to do something.

130
00:06:02,471 --> 00:06:04,947
Even if I agreed with you,
what are we gonna do?

131
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:10,343
If we disapprove, we'll drive her
into his hemp-braceleted arms.

132
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:12,329
We need to be smart, hatch a scheme.

133
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,373
Hatching schemes
is not my wheelhouse.

134
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,281
Let's not confine
to your wheelhouse.

135
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:17,908
It won't respond to tap dancing

136
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,337
or casual revelations
that you spent time in New York.

137
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,798
If you get upper east side
about this, we're done.

138
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,037
Hey, Winger, check out Annie.

139
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:28,162
Somebody just went to the top
of my "to do" list.

140
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,266
OK, we need to hatch a scheme.

141
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,435
Thank you.

142
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:38,220
It's all very simple.

143
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,815
In Annie's world,
long before Vaughn,

144
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,401
she only had eyes for Troy.

145
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,719
So if Troy becomes a real option,

146
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,905
Annie will drop Vaughn
in a hippie's heartbeat.

147
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,298
Crash course in manipulation...

148
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:52,040
You don't actually tell the person
what you want them to do.

149
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:54,488
You help them realize
they want to do it

150
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,813
so it can't be traced back to you.

151
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,798
Chemistry... sexy.

152
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:06,951
You know what else is sexy?

153
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,555
I know chemistry is sexy.
But Annie? I don't see it.

154
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,640
Every other guy on campus does.

155
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,600
You really don't see
how pretty Annie is?

156
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,779
Maybe cause I knew her in high school,
before she dropped out.

157
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:22,240
She had braces, acne,
a pill addiction, a nervous breakdown

158
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:25,235
ending with her running through a door,
screaming, "everyone's a robot!"

159
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:30,240
I see what's happening here.
I want you to clear your head.

160
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,286
- Done.
- I'm gonna describe to you

161
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,621
a complete stranger
who happens to be in our study group.

162
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,499
Would you excuse us for a moment?

163
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,960
No kidding.

164
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,534
Come on, you gotta be exaggerating.

165
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:50,886
Oh, man.

166
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:53,539
And she's jewish?

167
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:56,560
I can't believe I didn't see that.

168
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,650
I guess she deserves another shot.

169
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:01,688
Wait, never mind. It's too late.
She's hooking up with Vaughn.

170
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,690
- Only to make you jealous.
- What?

171
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,317
She's in love with you.

172
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,459
She's with Vaughn to get your attention.
You have to give it to her now, right?

173
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:10,988
Sure.

174
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,442
But the point is,

175
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,535
we're not telling you what to do.

176
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,372
Yeah, you didn't hear it from us.

177
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,092
I have the weirdest boner.

178
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,779
<i>I saw you die.</i>

179
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,388
<i>How can you be alive?</i>

180
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:38,139
<i>I guess it's just a bad day
for drug-dealing terrorists</i>

181
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,814
<i>and a good day for...</i>

182
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:41,422
<i>Kickpuncher!</i>

183
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,547
All right, guys,

184
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:45,688
you hear that pause
after "and a good day"?

185
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:48,152
- What do you got?
- A good day for a nutritious breakfast.

186
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,145
I don't get it.

187
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,233
It's a good day
for a terrible movie.

188
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,185
A good day for hair products.

189
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:59,989
Buzz, how many times
can you keep going to that well?

190
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,687
Come on, guys.
I'm starting to wonder if you deserve

191
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:05,127
to call yourselves a community
college sketch comedy troupe.

192
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:09,104
Told you, on movie night, I need
to blow these punks out of the water.

193
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:11,175
I need Phyllis Diller-grade stuff.

194
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:14,887
Wouldn't you rather just watch a movie
with your friends and have a good time?

195
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,994
What are you,
my third wife's therapist?

196
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,067
What if he said,
"it's a good day for... "

197
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,976
and you said, "for being gay"?

198
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:28,609
You're a genius.

199
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,903
He likes gay jokes.

200
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,447
- What?
- I said we write great jokes.

201
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,948
Don't flatter yourselves.

202
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,524
It's me, Troy.

203
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,177
I don't know where Abed is.
I could try calling him.

204
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,971
Not looking for my other half.

205
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,680
I'm looking for you, girl.

206
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:08,156
Let that sink in for a second.

207
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:14,528
You know, I never noticed how...

208
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,240
beautiful you are.

209
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:17,908
Troy, you're being weird.

210
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:20,869
Sorry it took me so long.
They made me find a shirt.

211
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:22,849
Vaughn, you remember Troy.

212
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:25,457
We went to high school together,
he's in my study group.

213
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,611
What's up, man? Hi, bro.

214
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,796
I'm not your bro... bro.

215
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:32,876
Actually,
everyone

216
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:35,467
is my bro in the entire universe,
everything's connected...

217
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:37,177
Rocks,

218
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,204
eagles,

219
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:39,263
hats.

220
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,575
Some things
are more connected than others,

221
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,445
like tarantulas
and me peeing my pants...

222
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:46,728
- Or me and Annie.
- What? Wait.

223
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,011
- Troy, what?
- Tell him.

224
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:50,774
That you love me since high school.

225
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,157
What?

226
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,361
Is that true, mountain flower?

227
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,146
I never wanna lie to you,

228
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:03,954
I will tell you I did have feelings
for him, but it's over, I swear.

229
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,279
You're swearing?

230
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,649
Like Britta swore she didn't like Jeff
and then gave him my poem

231
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:11,191
so he could laugh at me
with that Sherri Shepherd lady?

232
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,145
It's happening again.

233
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,799
Your study group is evil.

234
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,573
And you don't deserve ice cream.

235
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:27,061
He's a baby.

236
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,313
Where were we?

237
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,065
I like him.
Why would you do that?

238
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,843
Come on. Everybody knows
you want a cut of the T-Bone steak.

239
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,155
Jeff and Britta
told me how you feel.

240
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,491
Jeff and Britta did what, now?

241
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,026
You're even hotter
when you're angry.

242
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:45,540
Let's do this.

243
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,487
<i>Red Shoe Diaries</i>...

244
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,501
I think you know I have
a thing for butt stuff.

245
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:55,918
To Annie's inevitable breakup
with Grodie J. McConaughey.

246
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:57,582
And to her and Troy.

247
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:59,947
We did the right thing.
They belong together.

248
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:02,471
Plus, their babies will be so cute.

249
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,191
- Why you say that?
- Come on.

250
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:08,602
Babies are extra cute
when their parents are...

251
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:12,105
Both cute?

252
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:15,650
You want kids?

253
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:18,862
We'll see. Put on something nice,
and find me after lunch.

254
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:25,327
Thanks for involving in my love life.
That was cool and mature of you.

255
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,315
Since you're both clearly idiots,
I should probably let you know that

256
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,040
I'm being sarcastic.

257
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:34,978
Thanks for taking ugly Annie
out of the palm of my hand

258
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:37,881
and turning her into yet another
hottie that will never get with me!

259
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,512
Thanks for eating all the macaroni!

260
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,098
Shut up, Leonard.
Nobody knows what you're talking about.

261
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,962
I did eat all the macaroni.

262
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:51,937
It's messed up that he knows.

263
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,773
Let's light this candle.

264
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:58,824
Who's ready for some kickpunching?

265
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:02,781
We decided to watch <i>Runaway</i> instead.
Tom Selleck fights mechanical spiders.

266
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,699
What?

267
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,840
You can't. We just watched <i>Kickpuncher</i>.
We have to see <i>Kickpuncher 2</i>.

268
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:09,410
I have many unanswered questions.

269
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:12,124
I want to watch Tom Selleck
fight mechanical spiders.

270
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,669
My brother died
on the set this movie.

271
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,754
One of the mechanical spiders...

272
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,134
just went haywire

273
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:25,555
and tore him to pieces.
Tom Selleck just stood there.

274
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:28,724
He just stood there
and watched him die.

275
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,518
Okay, then let...
Let's watch <i>Kickpuncher 2</i>, then.

276
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,480
- Sorry for your loss.
- That's messed up, dude.

277
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:38,776
<i>Kickpuncher 2</i>.

278
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,069
<i>My punches were only
as strong as my punches,</i>

279
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,572
<i>and then things changed.</i>

280
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:44,699
Change?

281
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,574
Time to change the channel.

282
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,964
He's gonna be begging for change,
if he keeps making movies this bad.

283
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:52,873
Change this to something good.
This movie stinks.

284
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,916
We better change his diaper.

285
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,668
A change we can believe in.

286
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:58,962
Something strange is happening.

287
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,423
What do you mean?
I'm making jokes during the movie.

288
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,033
But you're doing it
with the speed and the determination

289
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:06,219
of the incomparable Robin Williams.

290
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,554
I'm that brilliant.

291
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:10,015
I think you came prepared.

292
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:11,183
Dude,

293
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,723
even I know you're lame,

294
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:15,395
and I'm a tenured professor
sitting in a beanbag chair.

295
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:17,689
- You're not a professor.
- Shut up.

296
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:18,911
Fine!

297
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:20,293
You got me.

298
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:22,736
I did a little advance work.

299
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,105
Pathetic?
I'll tell you what's pathetic,

300
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,532
you sitting there
making fun of other people's work.

301
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,619
You don't feel good about yourselves,
so you tear down everything.

302
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,537

Mama Chang didn't breast-feed?

303
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:34,915
She read
it wouldn't make a difference.

304
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,208
You all sicken me!

305
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:39,461
And I will no longer participate
in your destructive, negative behavior.

306
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,420
Pierce, that was deep

307
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:42,849
and total b.s.

308
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:47,052
This isn't about us, it's a deflection,
cause you can't get a genuine laugh.

309
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,869
That in itself is a laugh.

310
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,281
I know I'm funny.
I don't need any of you

311
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:52,682
people to validate me.

312
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:02,885
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:05,803
Biggest laugh of the night.

314
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,659
Then I was gonna say,
"it's a good day to be gay".

315
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,706
We're sorry.
We were worried about your well-being.

316
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:19,436
I guess we feel like
we're sort of all a family,

317
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,035
and Jeff and I are like...

318
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:22,849
your Greendale parents.

319
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,216
You're not my mom.
She'd never wear boots going that high.

320
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,469
And what about respecting me
as an adult and as a friend?

321
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:32,973
You want to be treated
as an adult and a friend?

322
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:35,559
Try not dating your friend's ex.
Find your own man.

323
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,479
But you don't like Vaughn.

324
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,666
No, I don't, but I also don't like
seeing him with anyone else.

325
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,527
I asked you if you cared,
and you said no.

326
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,414
Fine, I cared.
I'm a girlie-girl. I like boys.

327
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:51,157
I don't like when they're mean to me,
and when they stop

328
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,615
kissing me and start kissing my friends.
I'm not that cool.

329
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,203
I'm not "Juno", homeslice.

330
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,124
This is what it was about?
You were jealous?

331
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:02,363
Please, you can't tell me
that you weren't jealous that Vaughn

332
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:05,463
had his hippie hands all over
your debate/makeout partner.

333
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:08,300
What are you insinuating?
I took that kiss for the team.

334
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:09,829
What?

335
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,513
That kiss wasn't for pleasure.
It was strategic and joyless.

336
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:14,865
What?

337
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,978
You did get weirdly specific
when you were describing Annie's body.

338
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:23,857
More specific than the stuff
you told me about Britta?

339
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,280
What?

340
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:28,028
- Does anyone get specific about me?
- Check your email.

341
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:30,905
- I'll mark you as spam.
- Who the hell is Pam?

342
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,658
First, we were wholesome and healthy
as the family in <i>The Brady Bunch</i>.

343
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:37,621
Now we're dysfunctional and incestuous
as the cast of <i>The Brady Bunch</i>.

344
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,851
I agree with Abed.
This is getting creepy.

345
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:42,758
No more creepy than when Jeff
wears tight jeans and you say,

346
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:44,809
"i'd like to slap those
buns on the grill."

347
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:45,687
What?

348
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,781
I don't talk like that,
and where I'm from,

349
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,640
it's normal for women to talk
about their male friends' backsides.

350
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:53,386
You don't see me saying anything crazy
about Abed and Troy's.

351
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:54,804
They're jealous.

352
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,806
All right,
maybe we're not a family.

353
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,612
Maybe it's more complicated.

354
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,998
Because unlike a real family,

355
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,135
there's nothing to stop any one of us
from looking at any of the others

356
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,461
as a sexual prospect.

357
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,765
Why are we even talking about this?

358
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,476
Because you started having sex
with Britta's ex-boyfriend.

359
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,228
What?
We haven't even kissed.

360
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,230
That doesn't mean
you're not having sex.

361
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,265
Vaughn told me he would take
things as slowly as I wanted.

362
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,902
He likes me for who I am,
and I like him.

363
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,308
Do you guys hear that?

364
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,549
- Old man river.
- Eat me.

365
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,008
Did you get my messages?

366
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,501
I threw my phone into the river.

367
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:21,110
I thought that, if I can't be with her,
who am I gonna call?

368
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,801
And then I thought, well,
my landlord, my sister, and...

369
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:26,271
you.

370
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,688
Anyway, I've been doing
a lot of soul-searching, and...

371
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:32,981
this is something
I really need to say.

372
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:37,341
<i>I see you when you smile</i>

373
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:39,513
<i>And I want to sing a song</i>

374
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,482
<i>But then I write the words</i>

375
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:44,400
<i>And they always come out wrong</i>

376
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,872
<i>They come out wrong</i>

377
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:50,564
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

378
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:52,497
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

379
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,581
<i>But then the words get frozen</i>

380
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,979
<i>In my mouth like eskimos</i>

381
00:18:58,058 --> 00:18:59,909
<i>I like your nose</i>

382
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:19,029
<i>Annie's song</i>

383
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,054
His songs are dumber than he is.

384
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,623
Yeah, but they're honest.

385
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:31,506
I'll be right here.

386
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,174
Vaughn wants to show me a cloud
that looks like a pumpkin...

387
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,094
If that's okay.

388
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,098
Annie, it's more than okay.
Please date Vaughn.

389
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:46,726
Or anyone else outside
this creepy circle.

390
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:50,068
I wouldn't hang out with you guys
if you were creepy.

391
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:51,304
Trust me.

392
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:53,066
I have good taste.

393
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:03,046
So just to be clear,
I don't have a shot with any of you?

394
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,058
I am kickpuncher.

395
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:25,800
My cyber punches have
the power of kicks.

396
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:37,569
I am punchkicker.
Meet your match.

397
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,922
I love you, kickpuncher.

398
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,591
The only thing beyond
the reach of my fists is humanity.

399
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,931
You're sure Britta
couldn't do your part?

400
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,818
I asked her.
She wasn't available.

401
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:08,641
Let's go film the sex scene.
