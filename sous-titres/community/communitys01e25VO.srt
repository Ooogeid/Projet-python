1
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:13,929
- Thanks for a great year.
- Mr. Winger!

2
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,475
I hope you will be seizing
the day this summer.

3
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:21,647
Thanks, Pr. Whitman. I hope you'll
be seizing a more contemporary movie.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,220
Looking good, Leonard.
Stroke or tai chi?

5
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,095
- Tai chi.
- Keep it up.

6
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:29,195
And keep up whatever
it is you're doing, Garrett.

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,355
It's called "chillaxing".

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,701
- What's up, Jeff?
- Hello, good morning, howdy.

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,371
Wait, Jeff. I'll walk with you.

10
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,212
I got class in, like,
five hours, so...

11
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:48,756
All right, I'll see you, babe.
<i>Sayonara.</i>

12
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:51,927
I can't believe I made it
through my first year of college.

13
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,913
I finally get to click send on so many
"I told you so" emails.

14
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:57,838
It's pretty great.
Not much could ruin today.

15
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,252
Shoot.
I forgot saying that summons him.

16
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,973
Will you two be attending
tomorrow's transfer ceremony

17
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:05,746
to send off all the students leaving
for so-called real schools?

18
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:07,441
There's a formal dance afterward.

19
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:09,860
How many dances
is this school gonna have?

20
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:12,105
Five.
If you come to all of them,

21
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,655
you get one of these.

22
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:16,312
I assumed your posse
would be coming to the dance,

23
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:19,116
having heard
the exciting news about Britta.

24
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,938
Banana Rhino.

25
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,415
Banana Sam Elliott.

26
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,880
Levar Banana Burton.

27
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,421
- Banana King Tut.
- Here, give me that.

28
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,661
It's more like this.

29
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:36,878
Banana penis.

30
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:40,730
You would've loved it if he did it.

31
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:43,269
- What?
- What's happened to you and me, Troy?

32
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,188
Remember how hard we laughed
when we heard the term "teacher's aids"?

33
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:49,483
Yeah, and then we found out
a teacher did have aids.

34
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:51,867
So what's everybody doing
this summer?

35
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,473
I'm taking the boys on a trip.

36
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:55,631
Money's tight, so I hope
I can convince them

37
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:57,992
for one more year
that motels are tiny theme parks.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,283
Yeah, I got to find
a new place to live.

39
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:03,122
My dad wants me to leave, so he feels
less weird that his girlfriend is 20.

40
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,957
You could live in a pyramid.

41
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,913
Wait!

42
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:08,836
Your dorm room's
got a bunk bed, right?

43
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:16,339
Everyone has to go
to the transfer dance tomorrow.

44
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,763
I'm going.
My friend Gary's transferring.

45
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,813
- Good.
- Finally.

46
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,350
- Hope he transfers to hell.
- More importantly,

47
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:26,282
our very own Britta Perry,
it turns out,

48
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,939
has been nominated
for transfer queen.

49
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,358
That's nice!

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,486
What the hell is a transfer queen?

51
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,425
It's like prom queen.
You wear a sash.

52
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,851
There's a vote, and if you win,
they put a crown on your head,

53
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:40,284
and I am so jealous, I want
to murder you. Aren't you excited?

54
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,536
No.
How did I get nominated?

55
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,645
Don't let it upset you.
It's the last day of the semester.

56
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,686
Nothing can ruin that.

57
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:50,011
Amazing. He's like an evil genie.

58
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,601
Just spreading the news.

59
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:54,858
Some folks say "transfer formal"
isn't really rolling off the tongue,

60
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:57,885
so we're just gonna call it
"the tranny dance"!

61
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,596
Much more Greendale.

62
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,154
- Feygnasse Team -

63
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:03,898
.:: La Fabrique ::.

64
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:08,646
1x25: <i>Pascal's Triangle Revisited</i>

65
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,073
What kind
of community college has a prom?

66
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:12,826
Proms weren't cool in high school.

67
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,096
It's that kind of crap
that made me drop out.

68
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,656
You don't actually have to lie
on a sofa like it's a Woody Allen movie.

69
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:21,313
Thanks for telling me that
in the last session, dumbass.

70
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,889
Look... There are bugs
on the windshield of your mind

71
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:28,582
you may never be able to squeegee,
like a certain birthday party

72
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,378
attended by an enterprising
transient in a dinosaur costume.

73
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,965
But there are more recent streaks
that you might be able to wipe clear,

74
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,640
like your adolescent fear
of being a so-called blow-up doll.

75
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,056
I really think this nomination
may actually help that.

76
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,485
You think I'd feel better about myself
if I got all sexed up, went over there,

77
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,770
and tried to be crowned
queen of the dingbats?

78
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,938
Precisely.

79
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:54,191
Guess you really get
what you pay for with free therapy.

80
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,819
That stung a little bit.
Thanks.

81
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,781
I'll save you some time.

82
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,450
He listens to you talk for a year,
then recommends a makeover.

83
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:06,327
Don't wear as much lipstick
as you did on Valentine's day.

84
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:08,752
Your mouth looked like a coin purse.

85
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,753
Señor Chang...

86
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,794
Greendale's foremost,
if only, spanish teacher.

87
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:17,756
- What can I do for you?
- I am actually a student now.

88
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:21,889
But I was thinking,
as a teacher and as my friend,

89
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:24,929
if you could help me...

90
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:27,433
Cheat my way through school.

91
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,226
I have a counterproposal.

92
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:30,936
How about...

93
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:34,050
I point out to you
that we've never been friends,

94
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,817
then laugh
at your very well-deserved misfortune?

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Let's just try that a second.

96
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,867
No, Jorge, you killed it.

97
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,600
Are you going to Abed's kegger?
Sweet.

98
00:04:49,609 --> 00:04:51,644
You probably don't want
to talk to me.

99
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,240
It's not junior high.

100
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:55,812
We're mature adults, Michelle.
We can talk.

101
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:58,387
I think
I handled our breakup poorly.

102
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:02,217
Before I respond to that, I'll have
to take a extra-strength vitamin duh.

103
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:08,149
We started getting serious,
and I got scared,

104
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,567
and it's possible I made a mistake.

105
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:12,791
Maybe we can talk about it sometime.

106
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:14,879
I miss you.

107
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:21,106
Just take a picture.
It'll last longer.

108
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:22,771
Cool.

109
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:37,988
- Dope kegger.
- Thanks.

110
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,254
Funny...

111
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,632
You know, I spend so much time here,

112
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,759
I forget
that we don't live together.

113
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,847
Then I think...
"what if we lived together?"

114
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:51,611
Here, I'm gonna check
on the other keg.

115
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,520
You ever seen one of these?
It's a beer bong.

116
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,940
You're not supposed to inhale, though.
I almost died outside.

117
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,451
- Why does Abed hate me?
- Are you kidding?

118
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,319
Look at him.
He probably hates America.

119
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:03,696
Babe, babe.

120
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,326
Guess what.
Your boyfriend just got offered a spot

121
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:09,201
on the number-one community-college
hacky sack team in the nation.

122
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:11,239
My god! Sweetie!

123
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:13,539
- I'm assuming that's huge.
- Of course it's huge.

124
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,280
I'm not into the fame and stuff,

125
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,751
but I could be the next
Yngwe Mackadangdang junior.

126
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:19,336
I know.

127
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,540
There's just one thing,
mountain flower, and that's that the...

128
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:24,758
The school's in Delaware.

129
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:28,842
- Thank you.
- You know...

130
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:32,224
If you don't go to this dance,
we couldn't see each other for months.

131
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,977
It's not a Jane Austen novel.
We have cell phones.

132
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,313
- What?
- Jeez, sorry.

133
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:41,650
- What are you doing?
- You had hair I was gonna move.

134
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,070
- You were gonna move my hair?
- I don't know.

135
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,155
Have you thought of yourself
as a guarded person?

136
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:47,768
Am I? Watch.

137
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,407
See? It's alarming, right?
Right?

138
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,833
Professor Slater, hi.
What are you doing here?

139
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:00,820
You know, end of the year,
randomly wandering.

140
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,338
Are you two...?

141
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,091
The two of you aren't...?

142
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,385
- Just friends.
- Same here.

143
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:09,970
Good... For you.

144
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,298
Will I see you at the dance, Britta?

145
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,726
Kind of obligated,
seeing as I'm nominated for queen.

146
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:18,812
I thought you were
all into female empowerment.

147
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,939
What's more empowering
than a woman in a crown?

148
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:25,402
Just did my first keg stand!

149
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:28,789
Can't feel my legs.

150
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,051
<i>Dancing in your underwear,</i>

151
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:37,628
<i>Taking air conditioner repair</i>

152
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,459
<i>So you can get a job</i>

153
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:44,419
<i>Greendale's the way it goes.</i>

154
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:52,197
Our original school song
by the venerable Pierce Hawthorne.

155
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:53,889
He made that up.

156
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:57,266
Everyone remember to vote
before the coronation.

157
00:07:57,391 --> 00:08:00,544
The nominees are identified
with sashes that say

158
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:01,919
"tranny queen."

159
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:05,776
By the way, we do offer summer classes,
which are a great way to...

160
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,802
broaden your mind. Have fun.

161
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,866
- You're here for me.
- Guys!

162
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,464
Vaughn got recruited
to a college in Delaware.

163
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:17,287
I'm gonna go with him.

164
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,706
Finally, a classic
last-day-of-school plot twist.

165
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,544
He's gonna be the next
Yngwe Mackadangdang junior.

166
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,322
- It's a hacky sack guy.
- You don't have to tell us

167
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,089
who Ingmar Mackadingdong junior is.

168
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,592
Help me with some refreshments.

169
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,864
Don't tell anyone
until after I'm gone.

170
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:37,435
I'm not just going to Delaware
for the summer.

171
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,017
I'm transferring with Vaughn.

172
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,770
What?
When did you decide that?

173
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:45,148
I spent three months
researching backpacks

174
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:47,457
before I chose the one
that I use now.

175
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,195
I don't want to be
that person anymore.

176
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,240
I want to live in the moment.

177
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:57,295
For your and Vaughn's sake,
I hope it works out.

178
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:01,540
But on behalf of the rest of the group,
I hope it's a catastrophe.

179
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,191
You better visit.

180
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,509
I can't believe
nobody's taken this cookie.

181
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:11,536
Señor Chang...

182
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,635
Is there a word in spanish

183
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,096
for someone who used to pretend
to be a professor,

184
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,053
but was a teacher,
but wasn't actually a teacher,

185
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:21,516
and he's now a student?
Is there a word for that?

186
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,229
If it was in spanish,
you wouldn't know, would you?

187
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,733
Hit a professor,
you'll get expelled.

188
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,771
I will find a loophole.

189
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,091
- Good luck with that.
- Then I'll kill you.

190
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:37,184
- Dudley Moore.
- Spray tan.

191
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:41,330
I'd go easy on that punch if I was you.
I've put in a little... hot person.

192
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:44,670
Hot people.
There are two of them coming this way.

193
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:46,746
Which one do you want?

194
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:52,299
Britta, you look great.
Such a stunning improvement.

195
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,161
God, you look gorgeous.
It must've taken all day.

196
00:09:58,316 --> 00:09:59,348
You've got a...

197
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,725
- It's right there.
- I do? What?

198
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,772
Guys, guys...
Cleanest face ever.

199
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,274
Am I okay?

200
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,633
You know, Troy, our study group
after all we've been through,

201
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,073
we got to stick together.

202
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:17,563
You,

203
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,504
me, and Jeff and Rain Man

204
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:21,482
and big boobs and medium boobs

205
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:23,497
and black boobs.
We're a family.

206
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:24,843
What's your point?

207
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:27,292
I've look at your situation,
and I'd like to make an offer.

208
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,338
Am I black boobs?

209
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,465
Last call.

210
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:44,437
Study over.

211
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,817
- What you doing?
- Giving things a finale vibe.

212
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,859
How's this for a finale vibe?

213
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,989
Pierce asked me to move in with him...
in his mansion.

214
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,116
More of a spin-off vibe,
you should do it.

215
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,326
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

216
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,679
Best friends,
that's why we shouldn't be roommates.

217
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:06,248
We'll end up fighting and putting
a line in the middle of our room.

218
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:08,035
We just won't get masking tape.

219
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,007
You should live
with someone you like,

220
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:13,380
but whose friendship wouldn't be altered
by constant irritation, that's Pierce.

221
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:15,507
If you move in, we jump the shark.
That'll end it.

222
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,302
Maybe you're ending it.

223
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:20,915
And for the record,

224
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,767
there was an episode of <i>Happy Days</i>

225
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,679
where a guy literally jumped
over a shark,

226
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:27,543
And it was the best one.

227
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:33,034
I think I'm winning.

228
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,527
- Winning... tranny queen.
- Yeah.

229
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:39,855
So, isn't it nice that Jeff and Slater
are getting back together?

230
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,175
- What?
- And psych!

231
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,145
But they will get back together
If you don't stop competing with her

232
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,872
and start communicating with Jeff.

233
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,583
She already has a head start.
They slept together.

234
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:56,214
Holy macaroni with pepper Jack.
When? Where?

235
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,925
During paintball In the study room

236
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,261
with Colonel Mustard.
Does it matter?

237
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,597
Now it does matter.
Where in the study room?

238
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,183
On the couches.

239
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,831
We use those!

240
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,431
Get over it. I've seen you shake
the Dean's hand.

241
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:11,897
Who knows where he's been?

242
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,505
Do you believe in soul mates?

243
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:18,318
Now, don't be mad at me.

244
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:21,740
I didn't think that more than one person
would answer the ad. Dream coming true.

245
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:23,700
You leaving already?

246
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,827
Got to be in Delaware
by tomorrow night.

247
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:31,700
See you soon.

248
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:36,142
Have a good summer.

249
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:38,131
I'll see you in the fall.

250
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,848
We're gonna miss you.

251
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,309
You're the one that didn't even want me
in the study group.

252
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,728
- That's not true.
- Yeah, none of us did.

253
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,773
I say things others won't.
That has value.

254
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,430
See ya.

255
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:00,529
Lates.

256
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:07,321
Good evening, Michelle.

257
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,975
Or may I say, "Meow-Chelle"?

258
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,666
- Who has your car keys?
- They're in the taco meat.

259
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,058
Now, what say you
and I blow this pop stand

260
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:17,308
and head off for a spot
of slap n' tickle?

261
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:21,174
I mean sex, in case the lingo
hasn't made it to the States.

262
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,468
I think I'm probably leaving here
with Jeff.

263
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,855
Really?
I'm sorry,

264
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:27,480
Just assumed that you two were done,
since...

265
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,225
Jeff and Britta did,
the Yankee doodle.

266
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,549
Don't tell me that didn't make it
to the States.

267
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,063
It clearly originated here.

268
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:41,903
We finished tallying all 36 votes,

269
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,498
so everyone get ready!

270
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:46,199
Yo, Goldilocks.

271
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,307
Drop the smirk.

272
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:50,315
I know about your grungy tumble,
I'm sure it was the best of your diary,

273
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,487
- during a pit stop in something real.
- You were the pit stop.

274
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:56,001
He used you to numb the pain
of not getting with me.

275
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,544
He needs a girl who doesn't

276
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,688
just not wear underwear because
Oprah told her it would Spice things up.

277
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,593
He needs a girl who doesn't
cause she hasn't done laundry.

278
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,245
He's been to flavor country now.

279
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,496
They should retire
the table we did it on.

280
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:11,115
- Table?
- <i>Miss</i>

281
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,559
<i>Britta Perry!</i>

282
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,757
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

283
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:16,980
I just won a contest for being hot.

284
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,819
This is a huge honor.

285
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,154
This may come

286
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,122
as a surprise to you, but I've never
actually won anything before.

287
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:28,863
Okay, you still haven't.

288
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:31,661
I'm just listing the nominees,
so not a great time to get cocky.

289
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,765
Do not get back with Slater.

290
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:55,727
I love you.

291
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,486
Your lipstick looks better.

292
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:18,481
How's it going?

293
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:22,281
Don't shoot the messenger,
but everyone at this dance

294
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:25,336
is kind of waiting for your reaction
to all this.

295
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,843
- I'm trying to think, okay?
- That's cool. Take your time.

296
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:30,902
How's it going?
You look great.

297
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:32,648
Very fatal attraction.

298
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,439
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sick.

299
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:39,266
I don't know why.

300
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,399
Have you considered the 60-inch-diameter
cookie you're eating?

301
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,572
How can something that's delicious
make me sick?

302
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,095
Unless too much of a good thing...

303
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:52,134
is actually a bad thing.

304
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:55,620
My friendship with Abed
is a giant cookie.

305
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,009
I kind of got my own thing
going on right now.

306
00:15:58,134 --> 00:15:59,040
Absolutely.

307
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:13,274
First of all...

308
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,794
I'm flattered.
Second...

309
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,394
Have you ever heard of...
email?

310
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:22,486
You love me?

311
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:25,775
Do you love me?

312
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:27,527
I have something to say.

313
00:16:31,997 --> 00:16:32,866
I love you.

314
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:35,035
I wonder where she got that from.

315
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:37,662
I'm sorry.
Do you have a patent on loving people?

316
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,207
Would you like a patent
in getting your ass kicked?

317
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:43,752
Can you stand over there?

318
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,393
And can you sit down...

319
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,715
Please?

320
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:58,808
Choose Britta.

321
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,993
- Yeah, team Britta.
- Britta's lame.

322
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,316
Team Slater.

323
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:04,981
Bring Conan back!

324
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:10,487
It's been a great year.

325
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,905
No one can hear you.

326
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,123
Come on, who are you choosing?

327
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,135
I don't know.

328
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:37,949
Com on Jeffrey.

329
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,604
Everybody close their faces.

330
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,342
All right, he's got a lot on his mind.
Leave him alone. I got it from here.

331
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,191
My name is

332
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,818
Professor Ian Duncan,

333
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,061
And I would like to rap for you.

334
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:54,455
Drop a beat.

335
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:59,494
<i>My name is Ian Duncan,
and I'm here to say</i>

336
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,802
<i>I'm going to rap to the beat
in a rapping way</i>

337
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,333
<i>I've got a real big penis,
and I drink lots of tea</i>

338
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,152
you know what, Duncan?
That's enough.

339
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:08,420
You have a problem.

340
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,132
I have a problem? Who is it here
who has a dalmatian fetish?

341
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:16,886
That is a oversimplification,
and you are suspended.

342
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,054
Come on.

343
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,848
Not a teacher anymore.

344
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:22,726
- What's this?
- A roll of quarters. Why?

345
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:29,688
I'll do it.
I'll move in with you.

346
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,082
Fantastic, buddy!

347
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,112
Why don't you come over on Saturday?
My tailor will fit you for a uniform.

348
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:05,643
I thought you left.

349
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,587
- I couldn't go.
- What happened?

350
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,837
I guess as we were driving away,

351
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:14,004
I finally started living in the moment,
and I realized that,

352
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:15,376
in the moment,

353
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,155
Greendale is where I belong.

354
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,493
- What are you doing out here?
- You know...

355
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,120
Britta and Slater told me
they loved me.

356
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:25,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

357
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:28,041
- What did you do?
- I ran away.

358
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,043
I don't know.
It's hard.

359
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,798
Slater makes me feel like I do
when I write my new year's resolutions.

360
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:36,257
She makes me feel like the guy
I want to be.

361
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:40,102
And Britta makes me feel like the guy
I am three weeks after new year's,

362
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:43,306
hen I'm back to hitting my snooze button
and screening my mom's phone calls.

363
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,849
Back to who I really am.

364
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:46,216
So...

365
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:48,380
Do you try to evolve...

366
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,563
Or do you try to know what you are?

367
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:54,791
I don't know.
I wish I could live two lives.

368
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,654
One of me would go with Vaughn,
and one of me could stay here.

369
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,834
One of me could be back with Slater,
and the other could try it with Britta.

370
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,493
And then we could all get together
for some weird foursome.

371
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:08,873
I guess I got to...
got to deal with it.

372
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,250
Good luck.

373
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:15,014
I'm glad you're staying.

374
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:45,480
God. I'm finally popular enough to be
in the yearbook.

375
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:48,316
What do you mean "video yearbook"?
Where do I sign?

376
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:50,577
Photo not available.

377
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:53,056
This better not be one
of those take-your-top-off videos.

378
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:54,693
I don't believe in yearbooks.

379
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:57,833
I just want people to remember
there's a guy in between these things.

380
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:00,758
What a year.
Only two pregnancy scares.

381
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:02,861
I give this year a "d"

382
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:04,485
for "delightful."

383
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,790
I can't believe
I spent ten bucks on this.

384
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:10,184
I don't know any of these people.
