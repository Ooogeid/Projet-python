1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,127
So then the guy says to the housekeeper,
"make sure she's dead."

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:06,923
- Stop me if you heard this one before.
- He'd could say it27 minutes ago.

3
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:08,779
The housekeeper says to the guy,

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,617
"we don't have a pool."

5
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:15,282
- And the guy says...
- <i>Good morning, Greendale!</i>

6
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:17,732
<i>Just a reminder,
our debate team will bring home</i>

7
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:20,186
<i>the championship tomorrow
versus City College.</i>

8
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:22,021
<i>Go, Human Beings!</i>

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,812
Great. Now I got to start
the whole joke over again.

10
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,567
So this guy...

11
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,152
I've got one for you.

12
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,737
A doddering old fool

13
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,604
walks into a bar,
tells a stupid joke,

14
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:34,075
and I crush his windpipe
with my three-ring binder.

15
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,537
- I don't get it.
- She's trying to stop smoking.

16
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,948
Don't tell them my business.
I will slap that smug look

17
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:43,923
right off your pointy face.

18
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,880
I'm saying this
because I care about you

19
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,561
and you're my friend.

20
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:50,383
You need to start smoking again.

21
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,010
You should.
It makes you lose weight, and your skin

22
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,512
looks great when you do it.

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,890
Guys, I really appreciate your support,
but I've got to quit this time.

24
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,394
Have you thought about hypnotherapy?
I know a dynamite hypnotherapist.

25
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,938
- Ten-to-one says it's him.
- His name is Pierce Hawthorne.

26
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,718
And I'm very effective.

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,901
Can you block out people's voices
I find extremely annoying?

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,611
Jeff, she's right there.

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,449
I would be grateful for your help.

30
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,493
You would?
Super. I'll set it up.

31
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,079
What?
I feel bad for him.

32
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:22,832
- Plus, I just yelled at him.
- You yelled at me too.

33
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,084
Did I hurt your feelings,
pointy face?

34
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:29,662
Have you seen the film
department's web site?

35
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:31,187
What do you think?

36
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,093
All of Abed's films are about us.

37
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:35,720
- What?
- Check it out.

38
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,641
<i>What else is new?</i>

39
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,573
<i>Stop being so relaxed.
We need to talk to you about...</i>

40
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:48,315
<i>You're living out of your car.
Why, on lord's good earth, boy?</i>

41
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,651
Those people look just like us.
That's eerie.

42
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,944
<i>Fine, it's true.</i>

43
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,862
<i>I'm living out of my car.</i>

44
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,656
<i>And I don't want anyone's help.</i>

45
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,243
We had almost
that exact conversation last week.

46
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:02,872
Yeah, but Abed posted this video
two weeks ago.

47
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:05,458
That boy's a soothsayer.

48
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,087
- This is wrinkling my brain.
- <i>This is wrinkling my brain.</i>

49
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,423
That's wrinkling my brain.

50
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,215
<i>Get a load of these wrinkles.</i>

51
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:17,426
- Who's that old guy?
- <i>Hi, I'm Pierce Hawthorne.</i>

52
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,763
Come on!

53
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:26,837
There he is.

54
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:30,858
- Did you hear my announcement?
- I hang on every word.

55
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,556
I'm gonna assume that's sarcasm.
So you didn't hear my announcement?

56
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,431
I'm barely listening now.

57
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:39,450
My debate partner dropped out,
we need you to fill in for him tonight.

58
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,703
Jeffrey, as debate coach,
I am offering you an opportunity

59
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,956
to spend the night
drinking from the cup of life

60
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,708
rather than romancing your nether
regions in front of the e! Channel.

61
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:50,529
Come on, Jeff.
Who better than a former lawyer

62
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:53,185
to really stick it
to those city college snobs

63
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,709
and their star debater Simmons?

64
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,384
Pass.

65
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,312
Wait. Wait.
Okay, no, no. Look.

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,500
Listen, jerkwad... I'm sorry.

67
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,069
That got heated.

68
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:06,684
Greendale needs a win.

69
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,446
The best compliment
our sports program gets

70
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,713
is that our basketball team
is really gay,

71
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,069
so what's it gonna take?
A plum parking space,

72
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,287
free meals,

73
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,187
a night of companionship

74
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:21,992
if you know what I mean.

75
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,745
I'll do it for the parking space.

76
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,914
And if you promise
not to tell me what you mean.

77
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:30,758
Thank you.

78
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:32,711
I really appreciate
you helping me out.

79
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,729
And I appreciate the opportunity.
You know, sometimes,

80
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:38,634
- people don't take me seriously.
- So what are you gonna do?

81
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,607
Wave a pocket watch
in front of my face

82
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:43,180
and tell me I'm getting very sleepy?

83
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:46,044
Just checking the time.

84
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,394
Now close your eyes.

85
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,659
Keep them closed at all times.

86
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:54,765
And listen to the soothing sound
of my voice.

87
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,695
The only word
that will bring you out is...

88
00:03:58,892 --> 00:03:59,697
gorilla.

89
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:04,158
Okay, now focus on the rhythm
of your own breathing.

90
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:08,271
And when you feel the desire
to light up a cigarette,

91
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:10,218
you will associate these urges

92
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:12,156
with things in your life
that disgust you.

93
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:13,631
Bad-tasting food.

94
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,171
Sex with men.

95
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,173
Wearing attractive clothing.

96
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:18,698
And soon...

97
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:22,928
Oh, God,
I think I really hurt myself!

98
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,596
Somebody help me.

99
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,515
Britta, wake up!

100
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,714
Why'd I put you under so well?

101
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:30,576
Damn my talent.

102
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,274
Topic for debate is
"are people inherently good or evil?"

103
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,610
So when do you want
to get together to strategize?

104
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,216
Annie, I was a lawyer.

105
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,905
I was a debater for money.

106
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:42,874
I think I can handle this.

107
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:47,468
- How was hypnotherapy?
- He fell down and screamed in pain

108
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:50,497
while I laid there with my eyes closed
to make him feel like he's good.

109
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,000
- This will never end.
- It's already done.

110
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,461
He just wants one more session.

111
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,590
Where's Abed?
I need to talk to him about his films.

112
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,926
That boy's flat-out prescient.
He can read our minds.

113
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,723
I know what you're gonna say.
You watched my movies.

114
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,166
- He's a witch!
- Get him!

115
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,475
I'm not a witch.
I'm a student of human character.

116
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,542
I know you guys all so well
I can predict your behavior.

117
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,483
Like Shirley.
I know you're a sweet, christian,

118
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,100
generous person.

119
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:20,655
Oh, that's nice.

120
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,669
You have thinly veiled rage issues.
Careful, boy.

121
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,761
Here. Check this out.
May I?

122
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,248
Jeff's character acts
like nothing affects him.

123
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,731
But things bother him.

124
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,546
<i>Hey, I'm top of the class.</i>

125
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,547
He's also very vain.

126
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,046
Ridiculous.

127
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,220
Why am I crying?

128
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:49,014
What, I accidentally listen
to <i>Come sail away</i> by Styx again?

129
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,927
You don't have to worry. It's a movie.
I can't predict the future.

130
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,781
<i>My leg. I hurt my leg.</i>

131
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,689
What up, happy people?

132
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:01,553
You tell me my future right now,
you evil wizard!

133
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,863
By the way, I think your shirt's trying
to get out of your pants.

134
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:10,442
As golding's <i>Lord of the flies</i>
demonstrates, man,

135
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,621
when left to his own devices,

136
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:14,123
will descend

137
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,291
into chaos

138
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:16,945
and evil.

139
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,500
And now, from City College,

140
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:28,998
Jeremy Simmons.

141
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,160
There were 23,000...

142
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:47,452
kidney donations
in America last year.

143
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:49,781
Man is good.

144
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:52,684
The average life expectancy

145
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,808
for a man in a community

146
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,291
is 23 years longer than a man...

147
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:00,586
alone.

148
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,128
Man is good.

149
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:04,822
And just ten minutes ago,

150
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:08,224
a bald, bespectacled man
held the door

151
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:09,762
for a man in a wheelchair.

152
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,306
Man is good.

153
00:07:15,323 --> 00:07:16,518
I hate this guy.

154
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,885
By the end of this debate,

155
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,564
I will prove with... facts

156
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:22,828
and data

157
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,304
that man is inherently...

158
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:27,029
good.

159
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,516
Old trick for achieving
the proper competitive mindset,

160
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:35,828
I always envision my opponent
having aggressive sex

161
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,081
with my mother.

162
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,809
This feels so formal.

163
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,633
Let's just talk.

164
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:52,595
People are evil.

165
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:54,873
They can't help it.

166
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:56,716
I didn't catch your name.

167
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,602
It's Jean.

168
00:07:58,771 --> 00:07:59,835
Take Jean here.

169
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,860
She spent a lot of time this morning
making herself look so lovely.

170
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,918
Tell me.

171
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,612
How many people bothered to tell you
how great you look today?

172
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:10,714
- None.
- Man is evil.

173
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,239
But you just said
how great I looked.

174
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,904
For my own selfish purposes.

175
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,791
The fact is, as hot as you look,

176
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:20,666
and it is quite hot,

177
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,001
I wouldn't have said anything.

178
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,213
When I talk about people being evil,

179
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,471
I could cite quotes
or dig up statistics,

180
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,845
but those are just words
and numbers.

181
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,970
I think...

182
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,301
we could...

183
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:34,929
have a little more fun

184
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:37,099
if I express myself

185
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,267
in song.

186
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:41,723
<i>Evil woman</i>

187
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:45,273
<i>Evil woman</i>

188
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,653
That's my time, everybody.

189
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,221
Thank you very much.

190
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:56,578
At the end of round one,

191
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,871
City College: 50,

192
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:02,875
Greendale: 8.

193
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:13,698
- I only got 8?
- She got 8. You got 0.

194
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,254
It's a debate.
Not <i>American Idol.</i>

195
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,517
Nice work, <i>L.A. Law</i>.

196
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,103
All sizzle, no steak.

197
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,861
I don't care, dude.
I'm doing this for a parking space.

198
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:29,807
Let's go, boys. Come on.
I want to see some hustlers out here.

199
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,165
Let's go.

200
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:34,071
By Zeus,
what sort of jackassery is this?

201
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,158
We're in the middle
of a championship debate.

202
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,614
We reserved the gym for practice.

203
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,955
They reserved it.
They've got us by the short ones.

204
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,992
The debate is suspended
until tomorrow.

205
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:49,004
Hopefully, by then,
we can get our act together.

206
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,928
Oh, great try, Bruce!
Great try.

207
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,950
When are we getting together
to prepare for tomorrow?

208
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,814
Never, it's stupid, I don't care.

209
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,557
Bite me.

210
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,834
Maybe Simmons is right.
You really are all sizzle and no steak.

211
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:09,684
- You couldn't beat him if you tried.
- What do you mean I can't beat him?

212
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,300
You and I will study harder
than we've ever studied before

213
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:14,363
- and beat City College tomorrow.
- Really?

214
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,281
No, who am I, Carly?

215
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,369
Abed is right.

216
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,744
You act like things don't bother you,
but they do.

217
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,163
Look, six months ago,
I was a lawyer.

218
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,998
I wore suits.
I used to say stuff like,

219
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:27,057
"objection" and "sidebar".

220
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:29,709
Now I'm losing
a community college debate

221
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,797
to Jeremy "soul patch" Simmons.

222
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,533
You like to sing?

223
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,761
I like to sing too.

224
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:41,008
<i>Zero for Winger...</i>

225
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:43,638
Kick that.

226
00:10:43,763 --> 00:10:46,175
<i>Was a big shot lawyer...</i>

227
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:48,992
<i>Now he's a...</i>

228
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,903
<i>looser.</i>

229
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,029
Lay off.
Jeff didn't understand the rules.

230
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:01,936
- What's your excuse, eight points?
- Dude, leave her out of this.

231
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,140
<i>Little Annie Adderall</i>

232
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,790
<i>was an outcast</i>

233
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,458
<i>in high school</i>

234
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,451
That's it.

235
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,837
Dude, we are gonna debate
the living crap out of you.

236
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,280
We've got some preparing to do.

237
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,264
I liked you better
when you were smoking.

238
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,343
I'm so sorry.

239
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:19,992
No, you're right.

240
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:21,888
My feet are long and stupid.

241
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:23,765
You can't unring that bell.

242
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:29,903
- That's my newspaper.
- What do you need a paper for?

243
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:32,899
You knew what's happened yesterday,
you middle-eastern magic eight ball.

244
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,319
Pierce hurt his leg,
Britta made Troy cry.

245
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:37,142
What's my destiny?

246
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,615
Am I gonna die in a car?
Is it gonna happen soon?

247
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,159
I have no psychic abilities.
I'm just an entertainer.

248
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,124
But if it'll make you feel
any better,

249
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,149
here, let me show you
what I'm working on.

250
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:55,297
I'm sorry. Is that me
being chased down by a werewolf?

251
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:57,883
That's how you'd behave
in that situation?

252
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,969
The situation being me
being chased down by a werewolf.

253
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,716
And that's Jeff
locking lips with Annie.

254
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:11,602
You're a fool.

255
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:16,013
So, in the experiment, Stanford students
were divided into prisoners and guards.

256
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:18,288
The guards immediately started...

257
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,358
- What's wrong?
- I've this weird pain

258
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:21,900
right above my eyebrow.

259
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,243
It's called a stress headache.
I got my first one when I was four.

260
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,411
I hate it.

261
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,829
Get used to it.

262
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,417
You're knee-deep in it now.

263
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,566
This is debate.
If you want to win,

264
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,177
you need to prepare.

265
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,012
Agreed, but if you want to win,

266
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:38,077
you need to loosen up.

267
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:40,495
Go off book, robot debater.

268
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:45,593
You're right.

269
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:49,163
Simmons is so good at using his...

270
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:51,145
inherent magnetism
to sell his points,

271
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,545
and here I am,
like a spinster librarian

272
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,982
with my hair pulled back.

273
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:07,744
What do you think?

274
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Thanks.

275
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,377
Be careful.
Abed thinks you two are gonna kiss.

276
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,804
Ridiculous.

277
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:19,845
Us.

278
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,842
Kissing.
That is ridiculous.

279
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:23,009
Totally.

280
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:30,285
We should get back to work.

281
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:34,896
The people are inherently evil.

282
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:37,448
We can use this Hobbes quote.

283
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:40,193
"Man is a collection

284
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,910
"of base animal urges."

285
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:44,030
"To act on them and experience

286
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,678
"sinful pleasure would be morally
no different than taking a breath."

287
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,001
That's poignant, right?

288
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:55,917
You know, maybe we should study alone.
Separately.

289
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:58,962
That way we can be more reproductive...
Productive!

290
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,507
Bye.

291
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,350
- You forgot your phone.
- Well, I can get another one.

292
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:13,759
The next time you even see

293
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,078
a cigarette,

294
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:17,488
you will think of things
that disgust you.

295
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,941
And while you're under so deep,

296
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:30,619
you'll find yourself attracted
to slightly older men.

297
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:33,497
Perhaps, some barrel-chested stud

298
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,014
with just enough tummy to love.

299
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,128
You'll want to buy him dinner,
then go back to his hot tub.

300
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:44,132
Perhaps, you'll invite one friend
to join us for a three-way.

301
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,890
Maybe someone
with low self-esteem, and...

302
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:48,428
slightly larger breasts.

303
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,807
Go to hell, you disgusting pig.

304
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:55,284
Pierce, I was awake the whole time.
I was faking it.

305
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:56,970
I know.
I saw you.

306
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,147
What do you think I am, a joke?

307
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,235
I was trying to make you feel better
about yourself.

308
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,957
How dare you pity me?

309
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:09,019
I may be a little older,

310
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,390
my ideas may seem weird,

311
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,537
and my fashion sense may cause envy.

312
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,219
But I have a lot to offer.

313
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:17,346
And I will not be pitied.

314
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,120
Do not help me up.

315
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:32,132
And as German poet Franz Wickmeyer
once wrote...

316
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:37,365
"Snow falls from the heavens pure.

317
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,543
"We cannot blame
the snow for being...

318
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,984
"soiled by the earth."

319
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:49,934
Man is good.

320
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,455
What?
That dude gets it.

321
00:15:57,995 --> 00:16:00,500
Jeff Winger will now offer
a two-minute rebuttal.

322
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:08,683
What are you gonna sing tonight?
I'm in the mood for some Sade.

323
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,007
In the Stanford prison experiment,

324
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:17,999
21 out of 21 students,

325
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,911
when given absolute power,

326
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:22,680
abused and tortured
their fellow students.

327
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:26,274
My competitor likens people to pure,
falling snow.

328
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,256
I would respond,

329
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,735
"There is none righteous."

330
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:32,862
"Not one."

331
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,913
Now I realize Mr. Simmons' quote

332
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:37,288
was from the great Franz Wickmeyer.

333
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:40,755
Mine was just
from a simple desert handyman...

334
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:42,918
named Jesus.

335
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,214
That's nice!

336
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,968
Survival of the fittest

337
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,802
wires an impulse
to eliminate people into our hearts.

338
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,597
- Counterpoint.
- Mother Teresa. Joan of Arc.

339
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,538
- Rebuttal.
- Nuclear bombs.

340
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:59,516
- Nuclear families.
- Abu Ghraib.

341
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,852
- Apu from the Simpsons.
- Double rejoinder.

342
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,693
- Telemarketers.
- Organ donors.

343
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,273
- Hate crimes.
- Executions.

344
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,858
Ketchup is a vegetable.

345
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:08,820
This is a real barn-burner.

346
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,119
God, did I just say cross-burner?

347
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:13,239
- No, you did not.
- Good.

348
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,825
- We make an amazing team.
- I know. We're so in sync.

349
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,828
It's like a perfect duet or great...
Professor Whitman.

350
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,279
Your preparation was impeccable.
You remind me of a young me,

351
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,852
with slightly worse hair.

352
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:26,142
I checked with the judges.

353
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,431
They'll need a miracle
to win in rebuttal.

354
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:30,056
Simmons is finished.

355
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,955
This is too much for me.

356
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,231
He's going off book.

357
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,307
Why is he ripping up the cards?
Doesn't he need them?

358
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:44,432
It's a gambit.

359
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:25,446
He hates me.

360
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,094
Yet he caught me.

361
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,155
Man is good.

362
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,883
He was horny.
So he dropped him.

363
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,964
Man is evil.

364
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:08,480
<i>Greendale wins.</i>

365
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:15,820
Eat that, Simmons.

366
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,574
That off-book enough for ya?

367
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:30,071
Simmons got robbed.

368
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:31,176
They kissed.

369
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:32,553
You do have powers.

370
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:34,132
I'm gonna die by werewolf.

371
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,195
Shirley, I don't have powers.
Trust me.

372
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,760
In my next film,
we discover that Pierce is an genius.

373
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:41,453
- That's not gonna happen.
- No, it's not.

374
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,075
I can't smoke a cigarette

375
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,508
without thinking of a three-way
in your hot tub.

376
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:47,683
You did it.

377
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:50,750
- I did?
- You're a genius.

378
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:52,538
Who's the third?

379
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,532
You did great in there!

380
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,694
Let's take this bacchanalia outside.

381
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,219
Full moon tonight.

382
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,582
I'm going this way, so...

383
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:11,744
Congratulations...

384
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:13,503
buddy.

385
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:15,227
Thanks...

386
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:16,636
pal.

387
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:23,885
Just pat me.

388
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,496
Cut.
Let me ask you a question.

389
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,947
Do you hate this?
Do you hate doing this?

390
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:52,072
Do you?

391
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:54,460
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just hold on.

392
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,872
Just have fun with it.

393
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:06,472
Take 36.
