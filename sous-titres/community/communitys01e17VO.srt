1
00:00:04,277 --> 00:00:06,589
- Good morning, everybody.
- Hi, Jeff.

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:07,798
I brought bagels.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,316
I'd love a bagel.

4
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:12,891
Be a perfect beginning...
For my first day of billiards class.

5
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,432
Did you pick a special outfit...
You can look sexy shooting pool?

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:19,477
Shirley, I have no idea
what you are talkin' about.

7
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,229
13.

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,251
Great, so much for "baggels."

9
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:27,318
- So much for what?
- The baggels.

10
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:28,736
You dropped 'em.

11
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,113
They're called bagels.

12
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:34,158
I lived in New York, Troy.
I know what a baggel is.

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,702
What is wrong with you?

14
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,080
- What?
- You say bagel wrong.

15
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,623
I say it the same as you.

16
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,791
Say it again.

17
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,526
Can we just keep studying?

18
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:50,216
We're on page 258.

19
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,344
- What "padge" was that?
- Two "five -ty" eight.

20
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,740
Check this out.

21
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,685
It's a drawing of Abed with...

22
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,398
Hearts all around it.

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,731
Strictly speaking, Troy,
the bible condemns this friendship.

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,246
I didn't draw that.

25
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:09,735
I bought it used.
It must have been whoever had it last.

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,861
Obviously,

27
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,135
it's a girl who has a crush on Abed.

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,407
this is so romantic.

29
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,959
It's just like the notebook, accept,
instead of alzheimer's, Abed has...

30
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:20,121
Someone who likes him.

31
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,892
Whoever she is, she's fat.

32
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,083
These thick pencil are
drawn with a heavy hand.

33
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,930
We gotta find this person for Abed.

34
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,830
Unless it's a boy, we have to find
him for jesus. But, either way,

35
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,297
this is going to be fun.

00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:54,187
Class is over.

40
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:55,865
I'm trying to get you to leave.

41
00:01:58,957 --> 00:01:59,910
Pick that up.

42
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,183
Senor Chang?

43
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:05,249
We're trying to figure out whose
Spanish book this was before Troy's.

44
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,176
Jenny Adams.

45
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:17,764
Come on.

46
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:19,357
If Chinese were psychic,

47
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,724
you'd have started birth control
centuries ago.

48
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,185
Her name's in the front
of the book, morons.

49
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,103
He's right.

50
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,981
Them, I understand,
but how did you not think of that?

51
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,117
I may have been thrown off...

52
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:33,110
by Britta's pronunciation of
"bagel."

53
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,196
How you pronounce bagel?
Come on.

54
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:37,948
You're the worst.

55
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,535
We have a name.
Jenny Adams.

56
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,115
It's a fat girl's name.
Might as well be Gravy Jones.

57
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,349
It doesn't matter
what she looks like.

58
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:50,044
This will be great for Abed.

59
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:51,504
It will?

60
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,380
You not excited
about talking to her?

61
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,174
- I wasn't planning on it.
- What?

62
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,219
Guys, come on. You heard Abed.
He's not interested. Drop it.

63
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,365
You need to mind your business.
And, Abed,

64
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,681
you need to get with this girl
immediately, If not sooner.

65
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,289
Abed, for guys like you,

66
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:08,295
This opportunity only comes around
once in a life...

67
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:09,522
while.

68
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,338
It's important to date in college.

69
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:15,277
It's a time of freedom
and exploration,

70
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,107
a time when a simple pillow fight...

71
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:21,146
between two innocent girls could turn
into a steamy night of unbridled lust.

72
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:24,954
Britta knows all about it.

73
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:29,041
- You are gonna can't buy me love me?
- We're gonna what you?

74
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,336
Gonna can't buy me love me. Transform
me from zero to hero, geek to chic.

75
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,823
He wants us to love
don't cost a thing him.

76
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:38,202
<i>Can't buy me love</i> was
the remake for white audiences.

77
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:40,886
That's bad when they do that.
I can't believe it doesn't insult them.

78
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:44,825
All right, nobody here...

79
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,973
Is can't buy me love-ing...
Or love don't cost a thing-ing anyone.

80
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:50,688
Because we've all seen enough
afterschool specials...

81
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,232
<i>Fat Albert</i>...
To know

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,527
that Abed only needs to be himself.

83
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,202
Sure glad there are
no old people here.

84
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:03,471
This conversation would probably
be total gibberish to them.

85
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,235
Jeff's unprecedentedly
right about this.

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,170
Abed, when we find this girl,

87
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,958
You're gonna approach her just the way
you are, that's good enough.

88
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,240
Yeah, and then you can
take her to a nice deli...

89
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:14,951
And treat her to a baggel.

90
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:40,863
Nice shooting.
Good, clean strokes.

91
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:43,445
- Thanks.
- Form a line, please!

92
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:45,660
My name...

93
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,676
is coach Bogner.

94
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,851
Welcome to the art of...

95
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,636
pool.

96
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,919
Which is a Phys. Ed. Class.

97
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,620
Which means...

98
00:04:57,218 --> 00:05:00,288
that you all have to wear
the proper equipment at all times!

99
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:01,425
So suit up.

100
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,344
See you back on the felt in five.

101
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:08,098
You're gonna look
like an ass in those.

102
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:11,595
Shut up, Leonard.
I talked to your son on family day.

103
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,562
I know all about your gambling.

104
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,247
Touche.

105
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:20,794
All right, everybody just hang out
and be casual.

106
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:24,990
My sources tell me that Jenny Adams
is the blonde who's reading right there.

107
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:28,244
That's her?

108
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,522
She's pretty!

109
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,289
Whit which is not
a surprise at all, Abed.

110
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,221
Abed, we're gonna
be here for moral support.

111
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:36,919
Go over there and do your thing.

112
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,397
- Be yourself.
- Got it.

113
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:39,827
- Great.
- Cool.

114
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,065
- What you doing?
- I'm being myself.

115
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:52,601
Go be yourself by Jenny.

116
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:56,313
I wouldn't go.

117
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:58,816
- How do you know that?
- A lifetime of observation.

118
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,027
Do you think there a version of you
that might go over there?

119
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,595
- Absolutely.
- Could you be him?

120
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,167
What was that?

121
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,981
A different version of me.
I think it was a vampire.

122
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:23,716
If this is gonna turn ugly,
I can't be here, I'm a two-striker.

123
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,668
No, Pierce, please.
Hang on.

124
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,803
Abed, will you excuse us, please?

125
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,261
I know that we're all good people,

126
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,793
and good people believe
that people should be themselves.

127
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:36,895
If Abed is himself,
he's gonna die alone.

128
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,222
If we let him be someone
else without our help...

129
00:06:39,347 --> 00:06:40,316
Be right back.

130
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,250
I'm out of here.

131
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,238


132
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,626
- You're not in uniform.
- Yeah, about that.

133
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:26,528
We seriously have to wear shorts
to play pool?

134
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:29,114
If you play in this class,
it's regulation.

135
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,741
Pool or regulation you?

136
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:33,550
Do you have something
against playing pool

137
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,163
with a full range of motion
and optimal comfort?

138
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,831
I'm comfortable in my clothes.

139
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,917
- I bet you are.
- I'm sorry?

140
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:43,046
I said, I bet you're comfortable

141
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,297
dressed like a model
instead of an athlete,

142
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,548
sippin' martinis

143
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,926
and smoking
Instead of keeping your game.

144
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,017
Listen, man. You're implying
I'm some sort of pool poser,

145
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:54,515
because I don't want to wear
a bathing suit.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,423
You're the weird one.

147
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:57,643
That's weird.

148
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,739
Not me.

149
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,605
- Nobody plays pool like that.
- What do you call this?

150
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,753
I call that your personal business,
okay?

151
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:06,206
And I call this class...

152
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:08,773
the desecration
of America's coolest sport.

153
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:11,573
Yeah, see?
Right there. "Coolest sport"!

154
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:15,115
I want everybody to know
what's going on here.

155
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:16,815
This hipster

156
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,872
is dropping this class.

157
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,407
Because he cares more
about what he looks like...

158
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,356
than how he's playing.

159
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:26,587
Please. You're the one
with the rules about clothes.

160
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:27,852
And, by the way,

161
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:30,217
I could kick your ass
all over that table.

162
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,094
Is that a challenge?

163
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,972
Because if you play me in pool,

164
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,565
you play me in shorts!

165
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,977
And if you can't do that,
my point's already made.

166
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,471
I don't have anything
to prove to you.

167
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:47,811
You're stupid.

168
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:49,611
This is stupid!

169
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:52,311
Pool in shorts is stupid!

170
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,159
Vanity, thy name is...

171
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,518
his name.

172
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,038
It's first day.
I didn't catch it.

173
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, Abed. We know that, normally,
you wouldn't approach a girl,

174
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,377
But if you don't learn how,
you won't get Jenny.

175
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,629
And you got two days.
Then I'm going after her.

176
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,299
What? I'm incentivizing him.

177
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,719
Also, if she's into Abed, let's face it.
Anybody could hit that.

178
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,388
Understood, I need to change who I am
to someone likable.

179
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,316
No, sweetie.
It's not about changing.

180
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,809
- It's about learning.
- Learning to change?

181
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:24,128
Good grief!
Clear the chickens off the runway.

182
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:28,025
I'll be the bad guy.
Yes, you need to be someone else.

183
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,904
Someone who gets a girlfriend.

184
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,271
Because I can't think of anything
more frightening...

185
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,642
than a half-polish,
half-arab virgin in his 30s.

186
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:39,661
One way or the other,
that story ends with an explosion.

187
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,830
Let's try a practice run.

188
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,189
All right,
Annie, you sit here, okay?

189
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:45,626
And be a girl.

190
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,920
Abed, you take a run at her.
Let see what you got.

191
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,603
What are you reading?

192
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,765
<i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

193
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,176
So you're familiar with two sins.

194
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,481
How about a third?

195
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,680
I don't think
we're allowed to smoke in here.

196
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,534
Then you picked the wrong outfit.

197
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,913
Didn't you?

198
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,959
What are you doing?

199
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,835
<i>Mad Men</i>'s Don Draper...

200
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,753
Weird.


201
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,838
- Put your tongue in her ear.
- I liked it.

202
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,203
Don't be him.
He cheats on his wife.

203
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:36,009
Be somebody nice, like Mike Brady.

204
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,596
He always had that housekeeper throwing
herself at him, he never touched her.

205
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,868
Don't be Mike Brady.
Mike Brady's not sexy.

206
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:44,017
You should be like Jo
from <i>Facts of Life</i>.

207
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,437
But, the dude version.

208
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:48,563
I knew it.

209
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,146
You should be like Calvin.

210
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,693
His best friend was a tiger.
He always went on adventures.

211
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,486
If there's a problem, he peed on it.

212
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,476
- Calvin Coolidge?
- No, you guys,

213
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,851
Don Draper was clearly the sexiest.

214
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,036
What are you guys doing?

215
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,817
Teaching me to be someone else.

216
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,833
For God's sake.
What did I tell you?

217
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,362
For God's sakes, everybody,
do whatever you want!

218
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:13,714
Leave each other alone!

219
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,758
That's a good Jeff.
How'd you do that?

220
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,897
10% Dick Van Dyke, 20% Sam Malone,

221
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:22,222
40% Zach Braff from <i>Scrubs</i>,
and 30% Hilary Swank in <i>Boys Don't Cry</i>.

222
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:24,391
- Zach Braff?
- Sorry.

223
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,351
What if you just did Jeff for Jenny?

224
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,095
And your point is?

225
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,259
I don't want any part of this.

226
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:33,646
And I can't believe
that you're still doing it...

227
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:36,294
after I already explained
the obvious lessons,

228
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,280
smacking you in the face.

229
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,783
- Why aren't you in billiards class?
- Because I don't look cool in shorts!

230
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,850
'cause I'm not cool in shorts!

231
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,707
That was good.

232
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,375
That was really good.

233
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,007
I don't want to spoil the ending, but...
Pride ends up with Prejudice.

234
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:58,842
Funny.

235
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:00,118
I know.

236
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,538
Stick with me, and you'll get a laugh
or two. That's the Abed guarantee.

237
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:10,103
I feel like I've seen you before.

238
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,897
- It's working.
- I know.

239
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,400
I get that a lot, from art students.
I'm told my face is made for sketching.

240
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,695
I'd rather think it
was made for kissing.

241
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,227
How'bout for punching?

242
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,393
What are you doing
hitting on my girlfriend, ugly?

243
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:29,915
This is awkward.

244
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:31,541
My God.

245
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,146
It's a white Abed.

246
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,879
It's like Abed, but employable.

247
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,673
Let's do this, boss?

248
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,341
Let's go, slumdog.

249
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,051


250
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,611
<i>And one last
lost and found announcement,</i>

251
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,189
<i>Jeff Winger,
I've been informed by coach Bogner</i>

252
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:48,475
<i>that you left your panties
in his pool class.</i>

253
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,191
<i>Better pick those up.</i>

254
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:53,345
When is he gonna stop doing that?

255
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:55,607
Do you know he called me a hipster?

256
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,566
Hipster!

257
00:12:57,261 --> 00:13:00,821
Do hipsters walk around
wearing $300 jeans from Italy?

258
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,282
Can we please talk about Abed?
Thanks to us, his heart's been broken.

259
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:06,753
I hate to say that I told you so.

260
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,838
So I'll shout it
through cupped hands.

261
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:10,112
I told you so!

262
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:11,706
We were only trying to help.

263
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,979
Come on. Who are we kidding?
Jeff's right...

264
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:16,088
Abed was happy being Abed,
till we had...

265
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,491
to sully his mind with
thoughts of love...

266
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:20,716
and romance... and vaginas.

267
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,158
The big three.
That's how they call 'em.

268
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:26,566
Poor Abed, he's probably too sad
to get out of bed this morning.

269
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:31,893
- About yesterday...
- You guys must be pretty upset.

270
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:33,832
Why would we be upset?

271
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:36,121
It's important for you
that I get a girlfriend.

272
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,817
When Jenny went off with white Abed,
It must have really hurt.

273
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,028
- It did.
- White Abed?

274
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:44,987
Jenny's boyfriend is a white guy
that's almost identical to Abed.

275
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:47,200
Joey, that's why the sketch
was in Troy's book.

276
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:50,954
- Does that make Abed "brown Joey"?
- If you are racist about it.

277
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,295
You know
we just want you to be happy?

278
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,210
Everybody wants me to be happy.
Everybody wants to help me.

279
00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:00,419
When they find out they can't, they get
frustrated and stop talking to me.

280
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:03,091
Or trick me into buying them ice cream
and shove me into a dryer.

281
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,095
I didn't want it to happen with you,
wanted to be sure it felt like you help.

282
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:11,141
Truth is, lots of girls like me,
let's face it, I'm pretty adorable.

283
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,105
And my aloofness unconsciously
reminds them of their fathers, so...

284
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:17,022
I'm used to them approaching me.

285
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,609
So we didn't damage
your self esteem or anything?

286
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:23,236
But self esteem
is falling out of my butt.

287
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,572
That's why I changed for you.

288
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,908
When you know who you are
and what you like about you,

289
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,619
changing for other people
isn't such a big deal.

290
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:36,500
You're a God.

291
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,512
If you'll all excuse me...

292
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,716
I have a man to beat in pool
while wearing shorts.

293
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:49,930
Is that code for going number one,
or number two?

294
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:52,843
You've inspired me too.

295
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,573
People can mock me all they want.

296
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:56,976
I don't care how I say
the word "baggel."

297
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,673
- She said "baggel."
- Would you like another one?

298
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:07,950
Nice cross corner, Leonard.

299
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:08,876
Totally.

300
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:10,982
I'd like to see
Jeff Winger try that shot

301
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:13,150
without the benefit of
his stylish clothing.

302
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:14,369
Would you?

303
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,585
Shouldn't you be
at a urban outfitters?

304
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:22,768
I'll go there later,
if I feel like it.

305
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:24,654
But first, I have to hand someone

306
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,300
their tightly polyester-swaddled ass
in a game of pool.

307
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:29,845
Burn.

308
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,296
Do you wanna talk
about clothes like a girl?

309
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:36,142
Or use tapered sticks to hit balls
around a cushioned table, like a man?

310
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,769
Balls, like a man.

311
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,354
Rack 'em!

312
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:41,665
I'll break.

313
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:43,900
Why? 'cause it looks cool?

314
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,274
I don't know.

315
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,829
You tell me.

316
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,598
Get out of the way.

317
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:27,319
Let me just clean
this side of the table, all right?

318
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,237
There you go.
See that?

319
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,631
- What do you think of that?
- See, you haven't learned anything!

320
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:36,286
Except how to look cool
playing pool in shorts!

321
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:37,658
You're wrong.

322
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:40,665
I'm just having a good time
because I love playin' pool.

323
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,205
Liar!

324
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,628
You think you look cool.

325
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:47,320
How cool...

326
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:49,090
is this?

327
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,723
Stop projecting your obsession
with clothes onto me as an excuse

328
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:59,010
for when I beat you in a game

329
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,185
of real pool!

330
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,937
You wanna play real pool?

331
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:05,482
I'll play real pool.

332
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:08,026
Now who doesn't care how they look?

333
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,027
Me!

334
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,601
- Shouldn't you be stopping this?
- Soon, soon.

335
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,699
Just... gathering evidence.

336
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:24,537
Three to one against Winger.
Who's on?

337
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:30,350
Tres.

338
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,777
You know what, Jeff?

339
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,864
One of us is about to win this game.

340
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,183
But years from now,
when the story's retold...

341
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:01,433
all they're gonna remember...

342
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:04,751
Is one of us loved clothes.

343
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,165
And the other loved...

344
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,755
the game.

345
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,738
Look at me.
Look at me!

346
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:19,909
You beat me.

347
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:23,828
From now on, you play pool
dressed however you choose.

348
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,497
I choose shorts.

349
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,541
I choose shorts!

350
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,421
Shorts!

351
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,495
You son of a bitch.

352
00:19:33,554 --> 00:19:35,673
You magnificent son of a bitch!

353
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,515
That was awesome.

354
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,964
Let me get in here.

355
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:47,577
Okay, you're sweaty.
All right, all right.

356
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:52,982
Nice game.

357
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:57,429
I hope this doesn't sound too...

358
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,905
forward, but...

359
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:02,257
Could you introduce me
to your friend?

360
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:09,523
You know what?

361
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,129
I know that guy's m.o.,

362
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:13,878
and I think it's better
if you introduce yourself.

363
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,094
- Courtney.
- Abed.

364
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:25,573
Man...

365
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:27,718
why couldn't I be brown Joey?

366
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,150
- Here's the spanish book.
- Thank you.

367
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:41,033
- Did you finally get your own book?
- Something like that.

368
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,326
Wait a second.

369
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:50,524
It's okay.
Let's have cookies.

370
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:02,482
- My cousin's funeral is today.
- That was today ?

371
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:05,000
I knew there was some reason
I couldn't do this today.

372
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,215
Poor Demetri.
