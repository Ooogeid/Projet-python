00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:04,231
- Welcome back!
- Hi.

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,926
Hello. What did you do over break?

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,550
It was awesome.
Me and Abed played this video game.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,273
- It is so dope. It's a whole city.
- You can drive. 

5
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:15,389
 Rent an apartment.
But don't get audited 'cause that's bad.

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,500
 Even enroll in community college.

7
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,587
Right now it sounds
as boring as real life, but it is not.

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,610
Vacations are wasted on the young.

9
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:25,449
You gotta get out there
and see the world at some point

10
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:27,860
- or you're gonna miss your lives.
- Where did you go?

11
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:31,822
Amsterdam, I think.
I'll know when I find my camera.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,790
Guess what happened to me.

13
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:36,744
Pierce, you became a grandfather?

14
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,339
No, I became even cooler.

15
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:40,539
These ironic tee shirts
are all the rage.

16
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,002
Let's get one thing straight.
I wish I was still a lawyer.

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,754
I'm here cause I'm hot for Britta,

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,361
and I don't want to be
anybody's friend.

19
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:54,579
Just kidding.
Bring it in here, ya knuckleheads!

20
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:00,047
You know,
I gotta say I took a look back

21
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:01,939
at the guy I was last semester,

22
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,605
and I realized that guy was a drag.

23
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:07,441
- Good to hear you admit it.
- The truth is

24
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,288
this is a new semester, a new Jeff.

25
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:13,451
Greendale is where I am,
and I am gonna make the best of it.

26
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:15,698
- Nice.
- You're like hawkeye on M.A.S.H.

27
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:18,844
He kept his upbeat humor and charm
even in the 11th year of the korean war.

28
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,755
Yeah, don't go changing too much.

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,488
We all like you
just the way you were.

30
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,584
I appreciate that, but...

31
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,387
Did you teleport here?

32
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:30,840
No, I snuck in during the group hug.

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,161
You guys don't remember me?

34
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:36,560
Buddy... from spanish class?

35
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,170
Yeah, this Buddy...

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,973
I've never seen you
before in my life.

37
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,354
I've seen him before, sits in
the corner next to the dead plant.

38
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,433
Thank you.

39
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:49,243
 I have a tendency
to melt into the background.

40
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:50,821
It's my body type, but...

41
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:52,528
I definitely know you

42
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:55,698
from watching you all
last semester grow together.

43
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,869
"F." "f"- minus.

44
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:01,954
Did you say "s"?

45
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:03,581
He said "f."

46
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,167
- Who cheated?
- I did it.

47
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,242
Britta cheated?

48
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:10,921
But why?

49
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:13,340
Gimme back my bra, Annie.

50
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,399
I'm not even wearing a bra.

51
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:21,932
I don't even care who wins.

52
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:23,392
What?

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,811
I sleep in class.
That one might have been a dream.

54
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,417
Buddy, as you know,
we haven't had spanish class yet.

55
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:32,443
So this meeting was more
for catching up... between friends.

56
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,223
I heard that. Let's do it!

57
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:39,675
So... Sorry, britta.

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,133
I'll go first.

59
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,684
I'm sure you have
a natural rapport and timing,

60
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:47,561
and, you know, you're scared
that adding a new member

61
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,960
might throw everything off
of its natural...

62
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,861
- Feygnasse Team -

63
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,589

64

65
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,156
rhythm. I feel like
I know you guys already.

66
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,509
So let me in.
Just tell me the rules,

67
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:04,892
and I will follow.

68
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,278
You already broke
the only rule I have.

69
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:09,271
The rule about
worrying about rules.

70
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,592
That's what I'm saying too!

71
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,203
Yeah!

75
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:32,538
Excuse me.

76
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:35,584
I received a text message
about free Sephora samples.

77
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:37,235
It was me.

78
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,176
Sorry about the ruse,

79
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,018
but I have something better

80
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:43,544
than exfoliating soap to rub on you.

81
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:45,786
An opportunity.

82
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,989
As you can see, I am resurrecting

83
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,689
<i>the Geendale Gazette Journal Mirror!</i>

84
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,673
We need a student editor.
Someone with real world savvy

85
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:56,903
that extends beyond
how to huff the ink.

86
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,246
Actually, dean, I'm resolved
to spend this semester being more...

87
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,575
This would be your office.

88
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,008
Relaxed...

89
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,348
and awesome.

90
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:10,457
First desk I've seen in 6 months
without "Zeppelin rules" carved into it.

91
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,495
And you get an english credit.

92
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,461
That ain't bad neither. I'm in.

93
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:16,547
Guys, meet your new editor!

94
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:20,342
Mr. Winger is very excited
to help you bring a voice

95
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,677
back to the campus.

96
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,510
I need to take your picture.

97
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,725
- We got it.
- You guys knock yourselves out!

98
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,936
Welcome aboard. This is my article
on the school's new water heater.

99
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:34,773
You got chops, but we need
your talent on a bigger story.

100
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,878
Pizza wars...
Who's got the best slice in town?

101
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:40,196
Start with Big Nick's.
Bring a large, with sausage.

102
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:43,699
You. I heard a rumor
that Riley's Liquor is selling

103
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,629
to underage students.
I need an undercover <i>exposé</i>.

104
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,496
Find out how much they'll sell you
of anything cold and imported.

105
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,417
You expect me to watch you do that
without telling on you?

106
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,712
That's a hard-hitting question.
Are you a reporter?

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,700
No, they've got me editing
the crossword because I'm a girl.

108
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:01,133
And 'cause I love that.

109
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,063
Now you love the streets.

110
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:04,511
You're my ace news hound.

111
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,888
You can do that?

112
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,333
We can do anything we want.
It's Greendale.

113
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,267
Now go find me that story.

114
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,610
This character reboot
is gelling for you.

115
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:16,815
That was all classic hawkeye.
Sending soldiers out for liquor.

116
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,586
Slyly sidestepping the problematic
scrutiny of Annie "hot lips" Edison.

117
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,405
I should build you a still
for making hawkeye martinis.

118
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,846
Of all your pop culture fixations,

119
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:27,701
this is one I can work with.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,621
- Call me radar.
- When you've earned it.

121
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,971
Now, I know the news
of <i>Señor</i> Chang's death

122
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,502
over winter break
was a shock to us all.

123
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:40,895
But we should take comfort
in the fact that he did not suffer

124
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,217
when his moped hit
the side of that Arby's.

125
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:44,631
So sad.

126
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,603
But best semester ever.

127
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,801
<i>Feliz año nueva, chicas!</i>

128
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:55,799
Beat it. All right.

129
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,357
That was a actress.

130
00:05:58,675 --> 00:05:59,608
I am a man

131
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:01,825
who can never die.

132
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:05,888
And this has been your first taste
of spanish <i>1-0- dos</i>...

133
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,381
the semester I get inside

134
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,048
your <i>cabesas</i>!

135
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:31,894
I saw that coming.

136
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,718
Guys, see you in study group.

137
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:42,443
Jeff, can he really
decide he's one of us?

138
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:44,194
He throws off our balance.

139
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,729
We've got three chicks,
three dudes, and now two weirdos.

140
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:50,540
- Sorry, Abed.
- Not all weirdos are bad.

141
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:53,954
He might be a puckish agent that
change our lives through a musical.

142
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,665
Or he could have a row of jars
waiting for our genitals.

143
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,333
I need my genitals.

144
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,454
You know who you sound like?

145
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:02,212
Me, from last semester.

146
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:04,224
Cynical, elitist,

147
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,258
- rakishly good-looking.
- Thanks.

148
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,678
We should at least get together
to talk about membership policies.

149
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:11,085
Don't ask me.

150
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,567
Dealing with problems
ain't my job no more.

151
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:17,686
My new job is hanging out,
having fun, and cracking wise.

152
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,355
It must be nice.
Suppose I decide that's my job.

153
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,875
I hope you've got an army of raisins

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,884
because I've got a major scoop.

155
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,496
In october, there was a free

156
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,956
- Toni Braxton concert.
- No need to remind me.

157
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,015
When a last-minute mix-up
shifted the show time by an hour,

158
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,065
an anonymous SMS went out
alerting students of the change.

159
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,921
Not okay. Because the SMS was sent
exclusively to black students...

160
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,054
And one french kid named Lebron.
That's profiling.

161
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:54,209
This is front-page juice.

162
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:55,641
Gotta find out who sent it.

163
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,862
Have you called
the number that sent it?

164
00:07:57,987 --> 00:07:58,806
Well...

165
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,555
Nobody's that stupid, right?

166
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:07,397
Hello?

167
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:13,364
Wrong number.

168
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,081
No, that...
That was a good cover.

169
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,641
So whoever it is keeps hanging up,

170
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:23,752
but he can't hide forever.

171
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,755
Annie the reporter.
Good times.

172
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,151
Listen up.

173
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,567
I just want to say

174
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,727
thank you guys real much...
much... real much?

175
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,307
Thank you guys very much for this.

176
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:39,268
It's a dream come true.

177
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:42,146
Let's study some spanish.

178
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:45,793
So for the essay, we conjugate...

179
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:46,859
Conjugate.

180
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,986
Conjugal visit!

181
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,112
Lame.
Okay, stick and move.

182
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:58,537
Okay, so for the essay portion...

183
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,123
<i>Annie got an essay portion</i>

184
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,695
<i>Annie gonna move her luscious fanny</i>

185
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,752
<i>all day long</i>

186
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,919
Buddy can sing, you guys.

187
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,819
That's great.

188
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,588
Annie's pretty young.
We try not to sexualize her.

189
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,658
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:17,890
Look... You know what,

191
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,493
it's your study group, and
I don't know if you perceive it

192
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:23,270
as something that could be improved,
but I do have some ideas.

193
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,943
Here's the one right here.

194
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:27,941
As a group, we could start saying,
"you go, girl."

195
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,568
Not in a way that's... 

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,405
I'm so cool saying "you go, girl."
But in a way that we're winking at it.

197
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:37,657
Bottom line, you guys need
a chubby, agile guy.

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,070
Did anyone see
Paul Blart: Marl Co...

199
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:41,538
Paul Blart: Mall Cop?

200
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,809
I'm like that, okay?
I'm fat and I'm...

201
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,477
Physical, okay?
And I'm strong.

202
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,122
And I can kick.

203
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:53,342
Dude, sorry.

204
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,198
No, it's fine.
It's just a little nosebleed.

205
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:58,639
I get 'em when it's dry

206
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,349
and when my face gets kicked.

207
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,059
I'll get some paper towels.

208
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,757
Someone say something
about a meeting

209
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:09,473
to discuss member policy?

210
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,910
Well, I think it's obvious to everyone
that Buddy has a few froot loops loose.

211
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:20,620
So I think no matter what we do,
we gotta do it with grace and caution.

212
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:22,454
I say we keep Buddy in the group.

213
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,723
- What?
- I've given it a lot of thought,

214
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:26,818
and frankly
I like his in-your-face style.

215
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,835
I can't stop thinking
about his high kick.

216
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:32,544
His ratio of girth to hip flexibility
is mesmerizing.

217
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:34,888
I like his idea
of ironically saying "you go, girl."

218
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,426
You go, girl.

219
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,637
So you kick high enough
and you get in the group?

220
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,640
If we're going to add people,
we should consider my friend Gary.

221
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,977
Sorry, Shirley,
your friend Gary is so boring.

222
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,063
He was raised in Finland.
He doesn't get our humor.

223
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,954
If we're gonna add a chair for every

224
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,431
bong-ripping good-time Charlie
with a song in his heart,

225
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:55,028
I move we institute hazing.

226
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,407
- The novel by Tom Wolfe...
- This is why we need new blood.

227
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,577
I'm bored of you pop culture references
and your cigarette-legged jeans.

228
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:04,413
My friend Gary wears nothing
but loose-fitting jeans.

229
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,748
Gary is off the table.
He is a buzz kill.

230
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,709
He grew up in a land without sun!

231
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,048
- Take a vote.
- They'll probably vote him in.

232
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,425
They won't.

233
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:19,386
Guys, guys, let's take a vote.

234
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,513
Secret vote.
Everybody cover your eyes.

235
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:25,684
- We won't know the result.
- Say your vote out loud.

236
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,436
- We'll know each other's voices.
- Troy's got a point.

237
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,730
Holy crap.

238
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,082
It says here
some guy in Seattle went nuts

239
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:35,569
and killed his entire driver's ed class
with a meat tenderizer.

240
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,227
We have to be careful.

241
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,201
On the count of three,

242
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,928
everybody who wants to keep Buddy out,
raise your hand.

243
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,342
You lied about the guy in seattle
with the meat tenderizer.

244
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,556
You put your thumb on the scale.

245
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:04,289
But you did it with a smile,
so you could keep smiling.

246
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:06,281
You're Hawkeye.

247
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:09,770
And with Buddy gone,
staying that way will be a lot easier.

248
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,679
I am not racist!

249
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:15,525
I had 20 minutes to let people know
that Toni Braxton was starting early

250
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,261
and 273 text messages left
before my rate tripled.

251
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:22,574
Racial profiling may not be right,
but it can be economical.

252
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,426
When I refer to you in my article,

253
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,370
would you prefer
"imbecile" or "incompetent?"

254
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:28,705
I prefer "incompetent,"
but what I really want...

255
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,131
It doesn't matter what you want.
The people want the truth.

256
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:34,920
I have to give it to them.
And I won't let anyone stand in my way.

257
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:38,173
Excuse me.

258
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,426
I am the least racist person
in the world.

259
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:46,290
My best friend when I was six
was a black man.

260
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,683
I've learned my lesson.
I've got unlimited texting now.

261
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,626
But if she runs that story,
I will lose this job.

262
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:52,896
And this job

263
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,114
is my life.

264
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,169
She listens to you.

265
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:00,301
Next time we're both
hanging out having fun

266
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,447
I could try cracking wise
about it with her.

267
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,575
You do what you think is right.

268
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,015
That's enough.

269
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,134
I'm just saying
it's not exactly Watergate.

270
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,795
I mean, you like the dean.

271
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,487
He's trying to help you transfer.

272
00:13:23,612 --> 00:13:25,510
Yeah, and this time
he might succeed.

273
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:29,145
If this article breaks out,
I can apply for journalism scholarships.

274
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,893
Nobody will care about my time in rehab
if they think I'm a writer.

275
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:35,397
As your upbeat friend,
I gotta say let this go.

276
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:38,859
This is Greendale, Jeff.
We can do whatever we want.

277
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,489
<i>Sorry, I'm sorry</i>

278
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,644
<i>I'm so damn sorry</i>

279
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,448
Didn't anyone tell Buddy he was out?

280
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:54,557
I guess we thought you would.

281
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,733
Milord, milady.

282
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:00,255
You missed my apology song.

283
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,674
I'll tell 'em about it later.

284
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,345
I am so sorry about the other day.

285
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:12,938
Yesterday the group took a vote.

286
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,838
You seem to have figured out
the rest of it.

287
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,069
Was it the high kick?

288
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:25,719
Was it "You go, girl"?

289
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:27,657
You guys think you're so cool.

290
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,202
- No, we don't think we're cool at all.
- A little bit.

291
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:32,537
I put myself out there for you!

292
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:35,415
I laid my soul bare!

293
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:38,031
I made you guys

294
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:41,546
lemon squares with free-range eggs
that I baked with my own hands.

295
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,591
- Maybe a little less sugar next time.
- Well, I'm not leaving.

296
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,130
Come on.

297
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,589
Be relaxed, like me.

298
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:52,057
- Leave.
- You're not relaxed.

299
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,101
You're an uptight puppet master,
and these are all your little puppets.

300
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,317
Just be reasonable

301
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,318
and go.

302
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:05,028
Make me... Hitler.

303
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:10,367
Since Buddy's not leaving,
he'll just be the person

304
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,036
who we wish wasn't here
while we study.

305
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,789
Try getting that deal from Hitler.
Shall we?

306
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:20,877
- I'm studying with you.
- No, you're not.

307
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:25,111
Everyone stop studying.

308
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,528
You're not in the group.

309
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,054
Okay, then go study somewhere else.

310
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,116
I want to study spanish!

311
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:09,930
I hate you!

312
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:12,000
I hate your study group!

313
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,125
I hate it!

314
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,015
You suck!

315
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,436
I hate you!

316
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:24,733
And you are not running that story!

317
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,693
- Why not?
- Because I said so!

318
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:30,697
Does anybody have a problem
with how that was handled?

319
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,158
It's exactly the way
I would have done it.

320
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:42,646
Who are you kidding, Abed?

321
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,173
I just dragged
a screaming, crying man

322
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:47,363
out of a library
with his pants down.

323
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:51,176
Martinis are for Hawkeyes.

324
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:55,305
I'm the same uptight jerk
I was last semester.

325
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:00,977
What's your favorite episode
of M.A.S.H.?

326
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:02,817
The one with...

327
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:05,497
- the army.
- That's what I thought.

328
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,222
If you've seen it,

329
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,851
you'd know that Hawkeye
doesn't drink martinis.

330
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,968
He also barked orders
when the choppers came in.

331
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:14,893
If he didn't, people died.

332
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:18,119
He was a leader.
That's your job.

333
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,664
What's in it for me?

334
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:25,251
I'm sorry that I yelled.

335
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:27,032
I'm glad you did.

336
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,459
It didn't even really occur to me
what I was doing until

337
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,334
I saw how upset you were.

338
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,427
And I never want to be
the reason you're mad because...

339
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:37,681
you're Jeff Winger.

340
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:39,849
So...

341
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,526
thanks...

342
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,072
for getting mad.

343
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:47,344
It was nothing.

344
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,802
I guess that's the upside, isn't it?

345
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:00,541
Thank you...

346
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:02,414
Radar.

347
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:05,603
You made me so happy
I just peed a little.

348
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:11,131
I don't think violence is the answer
when we make decisions about...

349
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:12,882
Hi, guys.

350
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,972
Hi, buddy.

351
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:15,097
Can you...

352
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:16,658
excuse us...

353
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:18,156
For one...

354
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:19,989
Crazy stalker?

355
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,313
Listen up.

356
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,955
We outnumber this guy six to one.

357
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,052
Annie, you flash your breasts
as a decoy for the bum rush.

358
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,873
- Pierce!
- Don't be upset.

359
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:36,239
I didn't pick you
'cause your breasts are so old.

360
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,907
Why is he even here?

361
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,076
I invited him.

362
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:44,547
Buddy's crime...

363
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:46,124
is thinking we're cool.

364
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:47,709
But I get it.

365
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:49,462
I mean, if I were him

366
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,337
and I missed out on you guys,

367
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:54,242
I'd be sitting in that classroom,

368
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,209
watching, wondering.

369
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,698
So how can I exclude someone
from something that

370
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,246
I'm so lucky to have?

371
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,811
I say we let him in.

372
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,574
Welcome to the group.

373
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:18,031
You will not regret this.

374
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:23,378
There he is.

375
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:28,129
The group thought
about what you said.

376
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,502
We took a vote, and you're in.

377
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:34,339
No way! I'm in the cool group?

378
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:37,884
Look at him.
It's like Christmas morning for the guy.

379
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:39,741
Welcome.

380
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:44,364
This is awkward.

381
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,137
You guys were my safe date.

382
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:49,495
You don't have to worry about them.

383
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,064
You're with us now.
Come on.

384
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,650
I love the kicks.

385
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,695
- He's amazing!
- The kicks are the best.

386
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,358
He's just got that kind of...

387
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,353
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why I voted to keep him.

388
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,635
It would have been nice
to have another person in the group.

389
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,901
I'll call Gary.

390
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:22,589
So it says here
you want to join as a twosome.

391
00:20:22,714 --> 00:20:25,431
- I don't see that as a selling point.
- We work really well together.

392
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,392
Let me hear
that rap thing of yours again.

393
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,607
I'm gonna talk it over
with the others.

394
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,693
- Cool. Thanks for your time.
- You traitors!

395
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:39,195
I'm appalled
at your lack of loyalty!

396
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:44,272
Yeah, you better run.

397
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:48,872
- Have you decided?
- We saw your tape. We're passing.

398
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,400
I don't pop on video.
Let me do the song in person.

399
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,490
<i>Getting rid of Britta</i>

400
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:55,842
<i>Getting rid of the B</i>

401
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,241
<i>She's a G-D B</i>

402
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:01,384
<i>She's a no-good B</i>
