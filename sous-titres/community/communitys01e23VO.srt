1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,663
Raisins don't belong
in a chocolate chip cookie.

2
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:10,107
- It gives them depth.
- Watch it, punk!

3
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:13,199
- What are you, 80?
- He's trying to bring back disco.

4
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:15,598
I don't have to be old
to know it's not gonna happen.

5
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:20,464
What it is, soul brother.

6
00:00:21,228 --> 00:00:23,698
My boys are gonna make me
breakfast in bed for mother's day.

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,866
Actually, I'm gonna make
breakfast and get in bed,

8
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:27,485
but they're gonna bring it to me.

9
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,092
I know! And then they said
the cutest thing last night.

10
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:32,239
They said, "mama,"
'cause they call me mama...

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,465
- ... the fun police.
- If I'm the fun police,

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,285
you're director of Funland Security.

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,247
- Good, more of this.
- More of what?

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,292
The constant bickering.
It was cute at first, but...

15
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:45,086
Abed explains it best.

16
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,673
Jeff & Brita is no Ross & Rachel.
Sexual tension and lack of chemistry

17
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,674
are putting us on edge, so, ironically,
and hear this on every level...

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,344
You keep us from being friends.

19
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:55,805
Jeff and I do not have
sexual tension.

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,696
We just argue all the time.

21
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,476
- Like Sam and Diane.
- I hated Sam and Diane.

22
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,571
- Who are Sam and Diane?
- We get it.

23
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,272
- You're young!
- See what you're doing to us?

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,482
Want my advice?

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,651
Pork her and move on.

26
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,965
- We did it all the time in my day.
- You also put hydrogen in blimps,

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,073
- and that was bad.
- Hey, everybody.

28
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:17,034
Just a reminder.
Our spring fling

29
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,494
is on the quad today.

30
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,038
Music, food, activities.
What, what?

31
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:22,748
He makes me uncomfortable.

32
00:01:23,763 --> 00:01:24,750
Still here. 

33
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:28,445
There's also going to be
a game of paintball assassin

34
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,362
with a prize for last man standing.

35
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:32,383
Or in a wheelchair
with no paint on him.

36
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:35,261
- Or last woman.
- Give it a rest, Britta.

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,690
- What's the prize?
- A blu-ray dvd player,

38
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:41,642
but it was stolen.
So now it's tbd.

39
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,602
I want tbd.
Is that new?

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,150
If it's what I think,
I had it for a month in the '70s.

41
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:49,775
- Let's get back to Britta and Jeff.
- There's no Britta and Jeff.

42
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,235
He said, fully erect.

43
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:54,405
I'm gonna let you figure this out
while I go take a nap in my car.

44
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,463
What are you waiting for?

45
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,482
- Feygnasse Team -

46
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,826
.:: La Fabrique ::.

47
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,069


48
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,005
What the hell?

49
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:11,440
What is going on?

50
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,407
The paintball game was... starting,

51
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:16,384
and the... dean...

52
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:19,114
The dean announced...
the prize.

53
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:21,144
The prize!

54
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,537
We turned on each other
like animals!

55
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,580
- What was the prize?
- Was?

56
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:28,286
This is not over!

57
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:31,293
This is still happening...
Right now!

58
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,432
I'm not playing!

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,778
Everyone's playing!

60
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:52,824
You suck!

61
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:01,606
Come with me if you don't want
paint on your clothes.

62
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:13,158
Look what I found
wandering the neutral zone.

63
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:17,048
You son of a bitch!

64
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,968
I thought you were dead, man!

65
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:24,638
I was taking a nap.
Has everyone lost their mind?

66
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,390
It's just a game of paintball.

67
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,809
With one rule,
last man standing gets the prize.

68
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,561
The prize.

69
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:31,937
The prize.

70
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,647
What is this prize?

71
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:38,039
You don't know.

72
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,323
- Priority registration.
- Priority registration.

73
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:46,235
That's why everyone's running around
like a bunch...

74
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:48,871
Does that mean what I think?

75
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,707
Like you could have first choice
of your classes next semester?

76
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:56,803
Easy, sugar bear.

77
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:59,351
But you could schedule
your classes on a monday,

78
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:02,743
- then take a six-day weekend.
- You could do a lot of things.

79
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:04,845
Talk him through the hunger.

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,643
All students wants that prize.
And there's no way to share it,

81
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,266
so we'll turn on each other.

82
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,976
But the longer we wait to do that...

83
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:13,979
The longer we work together,
the longer we last.

84
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,739
- Is everyone running in packs?
- The debate team was the 1st to do it,

85
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:19,582
- but they fell to infighting.
- The glee club is luring stragglers

86
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:22,112
into sniper traps
with cheery renditions of hit songs.

87
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,281
Really?
And people fall for that?

88
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,549
I'm all for winning,
but let's not resort to cheap ploys.

89
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,500
- Are the girls in the game?
- Britta?

90
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,335
I don't mean Britta.
Did I say Britta?

91
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:37,920
Twice now.

92
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:39,906
Chess club!

93
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,350
He's a pawn.

94
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,896
Checkmate, bitches.

95
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,946
And tell the drama club
their tears will be real today.

96
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,818
That's all sugar, man!
Get some protein.

97
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:11,443
Right here. Peanuts.

98
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,304
Peanuts, peanuts.

99
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:15,833
Take the stuff out closer to you!

100
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,669
The ones in the back are the freshest.
That'll keep us going.

101
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:22,965
- What the hell?
- I cover you.

102
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,718
You formed an alliance without me?

103
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,803
Yeah.
You with Star-burns?

104
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,881
Not if I can be with you.

105
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:36,448
- It's just Star-burns.
- Anyone else need a pee break?

106
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,109
I'll stand guard. I don't need to pee.
I'm wearing a diaper for the game.

107
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,895
Yeah. "For the game."

108
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,951
Guys, make this quick before
Pierce's chewing attracts enemies.

109
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:13,315
Guys?

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,767
- Hold it!
- Don't move!

111
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,562
Freeze, mamma jamma!

112
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,406
Everybody be cool.

113
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,327
- We can beat the others if we merge.
- We're doing fine.

114
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,121
- You gonna win camped on a crapper?
- Worked on you.

115
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,749
- Or do you have a gun in your face?
- Kinda matches yours.

116
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:40,918
- Nice comeback.
- Shut up!

117
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:43,082
- Jeez!
- Jeez!

118
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:55,454
So the agreement is we're allies

119
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,479
until we're sure
we're the last seven standing.

120
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:04,064
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Our team's walking with God.

121
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,656
I'm thinking we might
already be the only seven left,

122
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:09,004
in which case,
this is a window for the two of us

123
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:11,573
- to take out the others.
- Real nice.

124
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,549
That'd be great p.r.
for the black students.

125
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:15,609
I am not an ambassador.

126
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:17,913
I am gladiator.

127
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:20,755
Now, you want to win or not?

128
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,440
Troy made god mad!

129
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,582
Take cover!

130
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,120
Run, Pierce!

131
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,185
- Glee club.
- How do you know?

132
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:41,589
Listen.

133
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:46,718
<i>Hit me with your best shot.</i>

134
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:47,943
Brother!

135
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,361
That is so uninspired!

136
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:53,073
I'm not so sure.

137
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:57,411
I got a plan. Get ready.

138
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:01,331
Don't come over here, okay?

139
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:04,126
Screw you!
I'm coming over there.

140
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,025
Medic!

141
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,841
In the trees! There!

142
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,813
Write some original songs!

143
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:31,320
What are you gonna do
if you win priority registration?

144
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,738
I'll make my schedule airtight.

145
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,158
Maybe get out of here
in 3 years instead of 4.

146
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,428
I'd take any class
with no tests and no papers.

147
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:44,291
- What would you do, Shirley?
- I'd choose all morning classes

148
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,084
so I could get home early
to spend some time with my boys.

149
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,709
It's hard being away
from them so much.

150
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,676
You know what?
I say if any of us win the prize,

151
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,885
we give it to Shirley
as a mother's day gift.

152
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,003
- Absolutely.
- What?

153
00:09:57,636 --> 00:10:00,406
You don't have to do that.
I am so sick of you guilting people

154
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:02,392
with your phony
humanitarian schtick.

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,895
Phony?
When I win, you can watch me do it.

156
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:07,273
Of course,
but that won't make it less phony.

157
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,774
You'd be more likeable...

158
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,776
If I never did anything for anybody?

159
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,028
When you help people,
that turns out great.

160
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:15,739
Let's do it.

161
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,208
Study group!

162
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,663
Come out and play!

163
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,224
It's post-ironic disco stu.

164
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:28,961
You still trying to bring it back?

165
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,298
Damn, he brought it back.

166
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,059
The Lord is my shepherd...

167
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:41,723
I shall not want.

168
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:46,812
Here we come!

169
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:48,397
Three Stooges gonna...

170
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,735
- They shot us!
- Waste of time!

171
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,948
Let's go, fool!

172
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,123
Last guy almost got me.

173
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:12,976
My legs.

174
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:20,429
I'm so sorry.

175
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:22,785
I'm going home, Britta.

176
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,558
I know, Shirley, I know.

177
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:27,548
No, seriously, I'm going home.
Can you help me up?

178
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:29,646
Yeah, sure.

179
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,705
I'm gonna win that prize
for you and your boys.

180
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,124
That's nice.

181
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:52,085
I'm gonna win that prize,
but not for you and your boys.

182
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:53,906
That's less nice.

183
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,622
My god, you've been hit.

184
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:57,897
What?
Oh, no!

185
00:11:58,682 --> 00:11:59,732
Wait, wait.

186
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:02,232
It's blood.

187
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,932
Thought it was paint,
but I'm just bleeding.

188
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,357
Talk about luck!

189
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:12,933
I can't believe it's still going on.
It's 2:00 a.m.!

190
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:15,375
What if someone gets hurt
and the police come?

191
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,026
They'll think I'm a bad dean!

192
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:21,167
There's classes in the morning.
This has to stop!

193
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,452
Put me in the game,

194
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,341
I'll take everyone out.

195
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,579
I play paintball
three times a week, bro.

196
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,209
I'm one of those douche bags
with his own equipment.

197
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,628
But it wouldn't be fair.
You're not a student.

198
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:37,040
But you can change that, can't you?

199
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:39,656
Enroll me in a class.

200
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:53,238
- What are your interests?
- Arts and crafts.

201
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:54,940
- I do watercolors.
- Cool.

202
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:01,805
The group would be thrilled.

203
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,558
The wounded soldier fantasy,
we're moments from doing it, right?

204
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,077
Can you feel that tension?

205
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,032
It's a miracle
we still have clothes on.

206
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:13,508
You're right, you know.

207
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,706
I am a phony.

208
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,182
I try to act compassionate,
because I'm afraid that I'm not.

209
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,419
Please, I invented phony.

210
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,247
You care about people.

211
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:27,013
I accuse you of faking
to convince me I'm not a jerk.

212
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:30,808
You help people more than I do,
and you don't even want to.

213
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:32,067
You're not...

214
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:34,146
You're not a jerk.
You're fine.

215
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:37,870
Especially now that I've repaired
your overworked torso

216
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,943
with my trembling feminine fingers.

217
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,625
Too... much... sexual... tension!

218
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:44,364
Dam... bursting!

219
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:49,661
It would serve them right
if we did it here in the study room.

220
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,122
- Could you imagine?
- I can't stop imagining.

221
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:53,540
Neither can I.

222
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:06,576
We should get dressed
before the librarian shows up.

223
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,764
We don't want this to turn into
a letter to <i>Penthouse,</i> right?

224
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,059
The group is right.
We did need to relieve some tension.

225
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:19,806
Please tell me we didn't have sex
to win at paintball.

226
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:22,191
No, I had sex with you,
and now I'm gonna win.

227
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:24,243
- Don't be gross.
- <I>I'm</I> gross?

228
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:28,408
You seem pretty practiced at putting on
panties one-handed while holding a gun.

229
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:32,188
Can I get dressed
before you assassinate me?

230
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,028
So...

231
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,001
all that happened,
it meant nothing to you?

232
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:41,087
I didn't say that.
What did it mean to you?

233
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,714
- I asked first.
- Very mature.

234
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,967
- Said woman with Hello Kitty underwear.
- Said woman holding the gun.

235
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,217
You sure that's a gun?

236
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,307
Maybe it's a metaphor
for your fake, jaded persona.

237
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,688
- No paintballs? You think, I'm stupid?
- When'd you take it?

238
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,922
- When you started seducing me.
- I wasn't though!

239
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,568
- Assuming that makes you way grosser.
- Not when I'm right.

240
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:32,899
<i>Buenos dias,</i> children.

241
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:35,642
You'll be happy to know
you made it to the end.

242
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,519
- You're not a student!
- Wrong!

243
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:41,105
Critical media literacy
and Politics of gender, biatch!

244
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:48,154
- Give me your clip.
- That would be brilliant of me!

245
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:51,950
You got the drop on me. I lost.
Let me do this for you.

246
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,377
Be pretty crazy
if I shot you right now?

247
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:38,622
What's so funny, Chang?

248
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,541
Maybe the fact there's no such thing
as priority registration.

249
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:43,509
Or...

250
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,302
maybe it's this.

251
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:14,282
Dean!

252
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:19,015
Just one moment.

253
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,458
Hi there, Jeffrey.

254
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,433
Good look for you.

255
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:30,353
Everybody out there
is shooting each other...

256
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:32,249
for nothing...

257
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:34,830
while you sit here...

258
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,596
in your ivory tower.

259
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:38,664
I can explain.

260
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:40,975
I messed up
promising priority registration.

261
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:43,926
Apparently, it's a violation
of some student equality act,

262
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:44,851
but...

263
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:46,742
This isn't.

264
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:51,069
Now, it's not Blu-ray,
but it comes with its own remote,

265
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,037
so...

266
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,219
You get it all out of your system?

267
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,185
Almost.

268
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,400
What do you want?

269
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:31,696
Guess.

270
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:42,145
- Oh, hi.
- How's it going?

271
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,543
You still have some paint.

272
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:45,999
Thanks.

273
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,500
I was thinking...

274
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,379
- You don't have to.
- It didn't happen.

275
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,713
Not that it was a mistake.
It just didn't happen.

276
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,492
- A crazy night of paintball.
- Exactly, tension relieving!

277
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,559
Absolutely.
No need to mention it.

278
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:59,134
Right, no big deal.
Nothing's changed.

279
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,720
Something's changed.

280
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:05,385
Crazy Abed.

281
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,147
- Something's different.
- Could be me. I'm sporting a man-thong.

282
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,148
Maybe.

283
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,318
Or maybe it's that I
have emerged victorious...

284
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,595
with a priority registration form.

285
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,959
Well done, Jeff.

286
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,430
And in recognition of her bravery,

287
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:24,276
not to mention her children,

288
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:25,929
I hereby award this

289
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:27,539
to the best soldier...

290
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:31,461
The bad news is,
for legal purposes, next semester,

291
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,796
if anybody asks...

292
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:34,557
you have gout.

293
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:36,459
Do you mind walking with a limp?

294
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,129
Thank you, Jeffrey.

295
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:39,219
Look, Annie.

296
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:41,137
I didn't see that coming.

297
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:42,806
Neither did I.

298
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,240
So no one feels it?

299
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,894
- No one senses anything's different?
- Nope.

300
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:48,061
Not at all.

301
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:50,068
It's riding up a little.

302
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,662
Abed, it's Troy.
Meet you at the flagpole in...

303
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:09,420
<i>If you're satisfied with your message,
press one.</i>

304
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,295
<i>To erase and re-record...</i>

305
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,214
Hey, Abed, it's Troy!

306
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,872
Yo, I'll meet you
at the flagpole in like...

307
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,700
<i>If you're satisfied

308
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:24,008
<i>If you're satisfied
with your message...</i>

309
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,683
- When are you gonna meet him?
- Ten minutes.

310
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,094
<i>To listen to your message...</i>

311
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,495
Your girlfriend will meet you
at the flagpole in ten minutes.

312
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,570
Good-bye.

313
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:36,917
<i>If you're satisfied with your message,
press one.</i>

314
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:39,617
- <i>To erase and re-record...</i>
- Did I sound like a jerk?

315
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:41,984
<i>To listen to your message,
press three.</i>

316
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,109
<i>To send...</i>

317
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,045
Abed, sorry to bother you.

318
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:49,543
Troy will meet you
at the flagpole in ten minutes.

319
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:52,691
<i>If you're satisfied...</i>

320
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,728
Maybe you should send
a text message.
