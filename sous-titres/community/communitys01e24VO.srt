1
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:05,879
It's hard to believe,
but finals are here.

2
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,237
And I know that during
this stressful time,

3
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:10,998
my voice blaring over a P.A.
Can't help.

4
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:13,232
Which is why,
for the next three days,

5
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:16,432
you'll hear nothing
but soothing sounds of nature.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,409
And to kick it off,
here's a babbling brook.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,562
Will anyone back me up
if I say this is ridiculous

8
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:26,734
or is it gonna be
another <i>Avatar</i> situation?

9
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,211
I love Avatar.

10
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:33,366
Nature sounds or not, we'll have
no trouble passing our Spanish final.

11
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:36,994
I've transcribed this semester's notes
from my digital recorder.

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,954
You record every class?

13
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:41,332
- Spoiler alert.
- You mean "nerd alert."

14
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:43,212
Alert nerd.

15
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:46,462
Here's a spoiler: We're gonna spend
the next three days boning up.

16
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:49,465
Then pass the exam
and move on to Spanish 103.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,386
That sounds like a good ending,
except where I take Spanish 103.

18
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,305
- What do you mean?
- 102 fills my language requirement.

19
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:00,976
I guess I just figured
we're a Spanish study group,

20
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:03,646
so we'd keep
taking Spanish together.

21
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,523
That's what I thought too.

22
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:09,647
I'm on tight four-year schedule
to replace my bachelor's.

23
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:12,937
- I'm not gonna take an extra class.
- Spanish has value beyond credit.

24
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:15,640
Not really.
I know the family downstairs hates me.

25
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,743
- I don't need to understand why.
- Fine.

26
00:01:17,987 --> 00:01:19,650
You want me to say it?
I'll say it.

27
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:22,581
I like this group
and I want it to stay together.

28
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,945
You be the cool guy,
and next fall when that gets lonely,

29
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,423
I'll be in the front row
of a Spanish 103.

30
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,427
Monday through Friday, 6:00 am.

31
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,591
6:00...

32
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:40,910
And now, crickets.

33
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,921


34
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:17,516
If we're not interested
in Spanish 103 next year,

35
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:19,597
what about anthropology?

36
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,726
Anthropology.
The study of man.

37
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,089
I'm still trying to forget
what I learned about that subject.

38
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,565
- Go, girl.
- You "go girled" yourself.

39
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:31,817
- Shut up.
- See, it's fun!

40
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:35,304
And they have a class at noon.
Noon, everybody.

41
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,407
Anthropology?
Anthropology?

42
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:40,878
I'm not big on planning ahead,

43
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:44,955
but I have one unmovable
appointment may 23, 2013.

44
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,328
To buy a flying car?

45
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:48,544
I have a table for one
at Morty's steak house

46
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,836
where I will celebrate
becoming a lawyer again,

47
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:53,951
which can only happen
if I take a full load.

48
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,215
Don't.

49
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,843
A full load of classes every year.

50
00:02:58,188 --> 00:02:59,553
I can make it until then.

51
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:02,139
But not by building my schedule
around bffs.

52
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:03,933
We'll build ours around yours.

53
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,102
You know that we'll be friends
whether or not we have a class together?

54
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,397
Of course you think that.
From your name, your parents smoked pot.

55
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,133
I haven't said a single word
In this entire conversation,

56
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,445
and I find that outrageous.

57
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,583
Hola, el losers.

58
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,201
Winger, may I have a word
with you in private?

59
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:23,805
- Sure.
- Good.

60
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,997
Got it. Cool.

61
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:34,648
Come back in 10 min.
If anyone asks,

62
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:36,507
I sent you to learn things.

63
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,802
Pierce, close the door.

64
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,728
<i>Gracias.</i>

65
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:47,457
Other side of the door.

66
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,735
You're here because
your college degree was fake, right?

67
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:59,446
I prefer the term
"better than real," but yes.

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,101
Two questions.
Where did you get it?

69
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:04,410
Could you have prevented
being caught, and how?

70
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,269
One question.
Where did you learn to count questions?

71
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:10,336
And are you telling me
you need a fake degree?

72
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,877
In High School, I was in a band.

73
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:14,461
We could've been huge,

74
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:18,048
but the world wasn't ready
for an Asian man on key-tar.

75
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,622
Did you say "key-tar"

76
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,804
or did you pronounce guitar
like a hillbilly?

77
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,358
Key-tar. It's a keyboard
you can play like a guitar.

78
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:28,681
Get with the times, man.

79
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:31,087
Anyway, next thing you know, I'm 32,

80
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:35,193
and I'm bagging groceries for,
like, 5 bucks an hour plus tips.

81
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:37,264
- Shocked?
- Confused.

82
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,987
- I'm supposed to tip my bag boy?
- I did what anyone would do.

83
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:44,794
I faked my way into a job
as a teacher at a community college

84
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,744
relying on phrases
from <i>Sesame Street</i>.

85
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,898
Oh, my God.

86
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:50,099
Save the judgment, Winger,
all right?

87
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,538
If the Dean finds out
that I'm not a real teacher,

88
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:55,878
your grades are invalid
and you'll have to repeat this class.

89
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,981
- That was the chair.
- Good.

90
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:04,647
Good.

91
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,516
It's unsolvable.

92
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:44,843
Hold on. I forgot my...

93
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:46,595
What the hell are you doing?

94
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:51,292
Come back here!
Come back here!

95
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:54,789
Jerry, check this out.

96
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,069
<i>And that is what Milton
was really saying.</i>

97
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:07,262
<i>Exams are on Tuesday.
Class dismissed.</i>

98
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:13,043
<i>If the Dean finds out
that I'm not a real teacher,</i>

99
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:14,649
<i>your grades are invalid,</i>

100
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,292
<i>and you'll all have
to repeat this class.</i>

101
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:21,443
<i>If the Dean finds out
that I'm not a real teacher,</i>

102
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:23,012
<i>your grades are invalid,</i>

103
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:25,737
<i>and you'll all have
to repeat this class.</i>

104
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:30,129
- <i>That was the chair.</i>
- Right.

105
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:36,654
Hi, everybody.

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,648
I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you, kids.

107
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,979
It's bad news
for the older people as well.

108
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,654
<i>Señor</i> Chang is no longer with us.

109
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,575
He's not faking his death again, is he?
I can't handle that roller coaster.

110
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,786
First he's alive. And then we're happy.
And then he's alive again and...

111
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,758
I received an anonymous tip

112
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:57,973
that Chang had misrepresented
certain aspects

113
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:01,170
of his qualifications,
for instance, having them.

114
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,985
<i>Word of advice,</i> if an Asian man says
he's a Spanish teacher,

115
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,064
it's not racist to ask
for proof, okay?

116
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,221
You ignore your mother's voice
and get right into that horse's mouth.

117
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:15,309
So if Chang's a fraud,
hat about our grades? Are they invalid?

118
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,814
No. That's not fair to you guys.

119
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,718
I'm sure you've all worked
very hard and learned.

120
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:23,442
So just take your final
with Chang's replacement.

121
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,194
Doctor.

122
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:34,945
<i>- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.</i>

123
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,620
<i>Soy doctora Escodera.</i>

124
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:39,543


125
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,381


126
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:00,896
Listen to this back and forth.
It's like I'm at an embassy.

127
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:05,035
- What's on the final?
<i>- En español, por favor.</i>

128
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,904
I know it's in Spanish, dummy.
I'm saying, what chapters? All three...?

129
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:12,555
<i>- Veinte.</i>
- I know that one.

130
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,746
She wants a large coffee.

131
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,190
In English.
You'll be taking a standard exam

132
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:21,106
for students at your level.

133
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,752
It will cover this entire textbook.

134
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,708
El crappo.

135
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,334
I couldn't understand a word
Dr. Escodera was saying.

136
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,829
And why is she teaching Spanish
if she's a doctor?

137
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:40,321
Go cure something.

138
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:43,967
I got to pass that exam
or my four-year plan will be thrown off.

139
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,483
- That might be your car.
- What?

140
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,682
I was on my roof for the fourth of July,
the fireworks set off the car alarms.

141
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:52,322
- That one sound like a brand-new Lexus.
- My Lexus isn't brand-new.

142
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,783
I know. Yours is a 2002.
That's the year I heard it.

143
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:04,001
You two-faced jag!

144
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,211
You wear protective goggles
to destroy my car?

145
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,639
- Safety first!
- Stop!

146
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,383
I ask you for help
and you turn me in?

147
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,927
What? I did not.
Why would I screw myself?

148
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,555
What, am I Dr. Drew?

149
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,643
I didn't do it, okay?

150
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:23,687
Then tell me who did
so I can murder your face!

151
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:28,978
- We're writing a song.
- For the battle of bands.

152
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,994
Good luck passing your exam, Winger.

153
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,205
At one point,
I was teaching you Klingon!

154
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,875
Why don't you tell that to your really
weird sounding magical chair?

155
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,377
I have a condition!

156
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:51,016
I'm peeing. I'm peeing.
I'm peeing.

157
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:13,563
Impressive.

158
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,899
I dismantled that valve
and I put out that free cake

159
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:17,921
because I wanted to see
what you could do.

160
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:19,952
You got a gift, kid.
You know that, right?

161
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:21,774
A gift for sinks.

162
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,139
Big deal.

163
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,957
I'm a student.
I like learning.

164
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,666
Yeah, right. Learning.

165
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,087
Learn everything.

166
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,786
Learn until you're dead.

167
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:31,065
Or

168
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:33,960
you can call this number.

169
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:37,007
That's a company that fixes toilets
and sinks.

170
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:38,553
Listen to me!

171
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:41,255
Toilets and sinks.
Real things.

172
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:44,522
Things that people always use
and always need to get fixed.

173
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:47,086
This is a life, kid.
A real one.

174
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,825
Doing something that matters.
Something that makes sense.

175
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,524
The only thing that makes sense

176
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:52,825
is this.

177
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:54,139
Learning.

178
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:55,737
Thoughts.
So I can think,

179
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,239
and get a student loan,

180
00:10:57,546 --> 00:11:00,284
and grind my own coffee,
and understand HBO.

181
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,292
You don't have to do that, kid.

182
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:04,246
You're special.

183
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,078
You could be a plumber!

184
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,449
You could be a plumber!

185
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:23,749
14 HOURS TO SPANISH FINAL

186
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,851
So we know three kinds of verbs,

187
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,311
which took 40 minutes.

188
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,731
At this rate, if we don't sleep or pee,
we can cover about 10% of the exam.

189
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,859
And if it's multiple-choice,
25% of our guesses will be right.

190
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:37,029
That's a lot of right answers
when you're guessing almost everything.

191
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:41,045
I don't want to sound like a defeatist,
but we're defeated.

192
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,983
Face it.
Why even take the exam?

193
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:47,666
We're all gonna be
retaking Spanish this fall.

194
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:50,794
What was that?

195
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:52,544
What?

196
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,067
I don't know. I said "retake Spanish"
and everyone went

197
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,567
"ugh," And you went

198
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:57,692
"hmm."

199
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:01,178
Maybe it's one of those recessive genes.
I can also curl my tongue.

200
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,346
Who else?

201
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:06,892
Annie ratted out Chang.

202
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:09,770
What?

203
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:13,315
You made this 'cause you're obsessed
with all of us being together next year.

204
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,067
I wouldn't say I was obsessed.

205
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,902
Permission to treat the witness.

206
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,153
I'll allow it.

207
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:24,659
Did you record
yesterday's Spanish class?

208
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:26,661
- I don't think so.
- Abed?

209
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,724
You said you record all your classes.
Pierce called it a "spoiler alert."

210
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,042
You heard Chang

211
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:34,044
tell me he was bogus,

212
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,431
and then dropped the dime
'cause you would do anything

213
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,048
to keep this group together,

214
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:39,883
because you

215
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:41,927
are insecure.

216
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,264
Because you didn't get hot
until after High School.

217
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:47,516
That's true.

218
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:50,519
Fine! I did it.

219
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,561
For real?

220
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,773
Someone make her a dude
so I can punch her.

221
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,554
Go ahead and hate me! It's better than
what was going to happen.

222
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,487
We were all gonna drift apart
and you were too cool to do anything.

223
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,740
Maybe not too cool, maybe just,
you know, not psycho enough.

224
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,991
A little crazy.


225
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,667
Now she is going to make
the Disney face.

226
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:10,081
Her lip is gonna quiver
and her eyes will flutter,

227
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,040
but they won't ever actually close.

228
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:14,000
But do not feel sorry for her.

229
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:17,963
She stole a year of our lives,
and we're right to be pissed.

230
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:23,427
Everyone close their eyes.
Do it. Close them.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,929
Abed, close.

232
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,014
I can only connect
with people through...

233
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,810
- movies.
- She's the ark of the covenant!

234
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,813
You guys, I'm sorry!

235
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,065
I only did it so that
we could stay friends.

236
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:39,359
Picture her as Paul Giamatti!

237
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,823
Friends don't do what you did to us.

238
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,908
Did the sisterhood
of the traveling pants

239
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:49,887
poison each other's food
so they were too sick to leave?

240
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:52,762
No! I've never seen it,
but I'm pretty sure

241
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,458
they mailed each other pants!

242
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,084
I said I was sorry!

243
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,876
Who cares if you're sorry?
We're still screwed!

244
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,747
Be sorry about this stuff
before you do it!

245
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,462
Then don't do it!
It's called growing up!

246
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,012
We were still gonna see
each other all the time.

247
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,738
That's what
my rehab group used to say.

248
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:12,642
The only one that keeps in touch is the
guy that sells jewelry of bottle caps.

249
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:16,326
I had hoped that this group would amount
to more than passing hellos

250
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:18,607
and whatever the hell this is!

251
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:24,362
Nobody even think about going after her.
That's what she wants.

252
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,573
More personal drama
so we fail the exam

253
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,877
and stay in Spanish forever.

254
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,328
We have to beat her.
Don't text her.

255
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:32,871
Don't call her.

256
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,963
Don't mention her.
We do not need her to study.

257
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:46,132
- Anybody know how to study?
- Annie usually...

258
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:47,550
Whose side are you on?

259
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:53,491
40 MINUTES TO SPANISH FINAL

260
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:56,338
<i>Happy finals week, Greendale!</i>

261
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:59,475
<i>Continuing our stress-reducing
nature sounds,</i>

262
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,788
<i>That's cut five from
sounds of the Serengeti.</i>

263
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,131
<i>Here's a b-side from that album,</i>

264
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,545
<i>antelope slaughter at Ndutu.</i>

265
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,827
Did we miss the exam?

266
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:14,579
It starts in 40 minutes.

267
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:20,335
I can't wake up Pierce.
Is this gonna take an unexpected turn?

268
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,348
You have to know how to do it.

269
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,339
- Discrimination lawsuit.
- Preposterous!

270
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,091
Should we call Annie?

271
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,410
Absolutely not.

272
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,715
Keep your eyes on the prize
and let her grow up.

273
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,096
I'll see you at the exam.

274
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:37,102
- I was with you in the bathroom.
- You're with me everywhere.

275
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:40,146
- I know you could be a plumber.
- I'm not gonna be, okay?

276
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,775
I'm gonna be sophisticated
and have no job,

277
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,607
or a job that looks from a distance
like I do nothing.

278
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:49,848
You know what the best part
of my day is?

279
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:52,531
For about 10 seconds
from the time I sit down in Spanish

280
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:54,750
to the time I look at your desk,
'cause I think

281
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:55,870
maybe I'll look

282
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:57,945
and he won't be there.

283
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:06,301
2 MINUTES TO SPANISH FINAL

284
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:10,087
Between our studying for 12 hours
and Pierce being asleep for 11 of them,

285
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:13,054
- We may actually stand a chance.
- My horoscope predicted suffering.

286
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,766
No. That's good. Horoscopes
are the devil trying to trick us.

287
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,950
That make you happy?

288
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,738
- Why aren't you at your desk?
- 'cause I don't want to sit near you

289
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,581
because you're a bad friend.

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,209
He said the best part of his day
is when he thinks I won't be there.

291
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:45,789
Abed, what a terrible thing to say.

292
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:48,465
- It's from a movie.
- Then the movie it's from is terrible.

293
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:51,461
We will begin the exam
in one minute.

294
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:52,927
Where's Annie?

295
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,013
I sent her a text,
she hasn't responded.

296
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:58,353
What did I tell you?
Don't play into her ploy for attention.

297
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,061
What does it say?

298
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,647
She says she's fine.
And this isn't a ploy for attention.

299
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,857
She's sorry.
She does need to grow up.

300
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,109
Starting by making things right
with Chang.

301
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:10,822
- What?
- He'll kill her.

302
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:13,735
Mr Winger, please sit down.

303
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:15,241
Our friend is dying!

304
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,514
Annie is dying?

305
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,009
Let's go! Hurry!

306
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,442
If you leave,
you will fail the exam!

307
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:26,010
Who cares about a stupid exam?
We're a study group.

308
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:27,853
And Annie's our friend.

309
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:29,271
Tell her, Troy!

310
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:31,966
Land of fire.

311
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:37,555
I'm friends with Hannah too.

312
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:39,530
The whole class is.

313
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:42,225
And you can't have an exam
without a class.

314
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,428
Right, guys?

315
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,291
We love Hannah!

316
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,967
We love Hannah!

317
00:17:57,624 --> 00:17:59,183
The devil told the truth!

318
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,836
- Winger, what the hell?
- What was that screaming?

319
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,630
I was showing Annie the magic
of electronic sampling.

320
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,317
We thought you were murdering her.

321
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,097
Annie getting me fired was
the best thing that ever happened to me.

322
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:21,493
She's helping me replan my life.

323
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,810
She's got a real mind
for stuff like this.

324
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,637
We gonna find Ben a job so he can stay
at Greendale as a student

325
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:30,137
- and work on his teaching degree.
- And music classes. You know?

326
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:32,785
Maybe get the band back together?

327
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,801
Listen to that.

328
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,952
Music lessons
would be great for you.

329
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:43,262
Thanks, Britta.

330
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:47,361
Now go pass that test.

331
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:55,467
- It was kind of easy, right?
- Yeah,

332
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,093
I think I might've passed.

333
00:18:58,154 --> 00:18:59,888
I can never forgive myself
for what I did.

334
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:04,517
I treated you like a child
for having feelings.

335
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,103
Maybe because that's, you know,

336
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:10,013
when I stopped having them.
But you shouldn't.

337
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:11,326
You don't have

338
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,665
to be a kid
to admit that you like people.

339
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,671
And you don't have to dress like this
to grow up.

340
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,783
You look like a travel agent.

341
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,825
You don't like it?
I was

342
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:24,454
going for more of a Professor thing.

343
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:25,912
What?

344
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,282
- What?
- Nothing.

345
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,376
I think I got half of it.
Which got me through the half I didn't.

346
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,817
- Like the first season of <i>The Wire</i>.
- Exactly the...

347
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,215
hell, I can't stay mad at you.

348
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,009
I think I nailed it.

349
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,177
Me too.

350
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:45,747
I'm feeling pretty confident, everybody.
I think we're gonna make it.

351
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:46,643
Still,

352
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,782
we should plan
for the worst-case scenario.

353
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:50,891
'cause if we do all pass,

354
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:53,258
that means next year,
we won't have a class together.

355
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,895
We're gonna need a backup.

356
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:59,147
Anthropology?
Anthropology?

357
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,566
I want you to be in my next film.

358
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:10,730
Troy, 68.

359
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:12,734
Shirley, 81.

360
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:15,172
Annie, 95.

361
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,644
Pierce, 70.

362
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,152
Abed, 85.

363
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,527
Britta, 79.

364
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,084
I'm sorry, Jeff.

365
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,689
I'm sorry for the half-hearted mislead.
80. We all pass Spanish!

366
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:38,728
Not to take anything away from anyone,
but didn't the test seem extra easy?

367
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,162
Thanks...

368
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,082
for making it easy.

369
00:20:51,364 --> 00:20:53,134
I was going to say
the same to you...

370
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:56,129
But you were gone before breakfast.

371
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,881
I'm an early riser.

372
00:20:58,395 --> 00:20:59,395
I'll say.
