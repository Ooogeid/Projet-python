1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:02,958
It's Valentine's week,

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,004
when the Greendale human being

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,136
is the cupid being,

4
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:10,355
delivering your gift
to that special someone.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,985
But remember, Cupid's face
is magic marker on nylon,

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,061
so love is not only blind but
also dizzy and a little belligerent.

7
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,177
I'm chaperoning tomorrow's dance.

8
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:23,710
You should come.
Maybe your study buds'll go.

9
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,533
What's the blonde's name,
Bitter, Butter... Beetlejuice?

10
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:29,506
She says Valentine's day
ritualizes a connection

11
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:33,165
between affection and candy so girls
can learn the ropes of prostitution.

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,077
- Translation: No date.
- I'm gonna join you at that dance.

13
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:39,880
But as a novice boyfriend,
could I get a map of the minefield

14
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,333
known as
women's Valentine expectations?

15
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,628
Every day of the year,
I want you to do what makes you happy.

16
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:49,757
I'm gonna be happy spending the night
with an insatiable statistics professor.

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,522
<i>Jeff, it's the registrar's office.</i>

18
00:00:57,647 --> 00:01:01,029
<i>Seems you were wrong about
paying tuition with airline miles.</i>

19
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:03,330
<i>We're gonna need a check...</i>
<i>Message deleted.</i>

20
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:07,049
<i>Jeff Winger.
I am calling you.</i>

21
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,836
<i>You're probably... Whatever.</i>

22
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,121
<i>So...</i>

23
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:15,227
<i>wassup?</i>

24
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,982
It's the Cupid being.

25
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:21,205
Now it has arrows.
That's safe.

26
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:25,459
It's from the cook with the long beard
in the cafeteria.

27
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,177
I guess when he said,
I'm gonna git you,

28
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:30,673
He meant chocolates.

29
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,008
A flower from Vaughn.

30
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,593
He's on a vision quest.

31
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,394
You got something, Abed?

32
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,557
Another muffin basket
from another actress

33
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,851
- to be in my film.
- Does that work?

34
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,253
Meryl Streep has two Oscars
because of her baking.

35
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:48,116
That's sarcasm, but I forgot to inflect.
This sounds way more like sarcasm.

36
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,192
Inflection is so interesting.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,403
That big bag, at the bottom,
is that for me?

38
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:56,605
Anything in there for Troy?
Troy Barnes?

39
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:58,824
Barnes, Troy?

40
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,042
Who cares about getting things?

41
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,331
It destroys the meaning
of Valentine's day:

42
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,709
- The birth of saint Valentines.
- Good.

43
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,163
Now it has arrows.
That's safe.

44
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:11,547
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

45
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,133
- You look very early.
- I'm really late.

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,751
- Yes, you are.
- Yeah, see you later.

47
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:20,629
Can I get you something?

48
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:22,963
Water, smelling salts,

49
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,852
alibi for Cobain's suicide?

50
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,940
No, but you can help yourself
to a shorter forehead,

51
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,563
a non-keebler nose, and shutting up.

52
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:31,609
That stings.

53
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,213
I mean, not the words.

54
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,821
The clouds of bourbon vapor
forming them.

55
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:40,529
A girlfriend from my anarchist days
was in town and we drank.

56
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:41,869
Everything.

57
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,389
And then you said,
"I should call Jeff."

58
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:49,148
'cause the first thing I do
when I'm having fun

59
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:51,879
is think about... <i>Jeff Winger.</i>

60
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:55,480
<i>I am calling you.
You're probably...</i>

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,803
<i>Whatever.
So wassup?</i>

62
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:00,805
A drunk dial.

63
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,505
So much subtext, so much intrigue.

64
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,933
So much of
what the kids are calling B.C.I.

65
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,940
That's... booty call implication.

66
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:21,185
- What happened to Britta?
- Justice.

67
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:24,083
Having spent the year
denying her attraction to me

68
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,872
just to be alternative,
Britta called me.

69
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:28,408
At 3:00 a.m.

70
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:30,862
Just to ask: "What's up?"

71
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,379
A drunk dial?
Was there B.C.I.?

72
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,726
- Booty call with a capital "B."
- This can't be good.

73
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,759
No biggie.
We give crap all the time.

74
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,040
That's the point. What crap can
she give you when you hold the cards?

75
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:45,182
You've shifted balance, like in a sitcom
when a character sees another naked.

76
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,518
Is that really a sitcom staple?

77
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,272
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm Abed, I never watch TV.

Now we all know that in english,

82
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,284
the rooster says:

83
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:06,373
<i>En espanol</i>...

84
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:08,156
the <i>gallo</i> says,

85
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,088
What? I'm teaching.

86
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:23,888
I knew you were holding back.

87
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:27,679
It's from the girl I'm dating.

88
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,339
I met her in biology.

89
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:31,995
She was looking for geology
and misread the sign.

90
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:35,148
Yeah, I said,
"we do not study countries in here."

91
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:37,473
Yeah, she's...
She's dumb, but...

92
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,855
- But sweet.
- Mine's from Danielle. She's a...

93
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,082
A lovely lady in my marketing class.

94
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,118
We're sleeping together.

95
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,662
They sound like very lucky ladies.

96
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,289
They're not made up.

97
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:52,275
What's going on?

98
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,228
My bullcrap meter's going crazy.

99
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:02,574
It's these presents
you've obviously sent to yourselves

100
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,386
to pretend you have girlfriends.

101
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,860
That's ridiculous.

102
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:09,767
This is obviously your handwriting,
Mr. Tremor.

103
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,186
Yours is signed, "love, Troy"?

104
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,648
This is the most pathetic thing
I've ever seen in the classroom.

105
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,035
Look at him over there.
Cutting the gristle off his steak

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,116
as ruthlessly as he cut off
Troy and Pierce's dignity.

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,953
Now he's eating the gristle.

108
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,866
I'm so sick of Chang.

109
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,874
Tearing people down,
making them feel horrible.

110
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,377
Somebody needs to humiliate him
like he humiliated our boys.

111
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:37,836
Moustache.

112
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,382
Get me a juice box.

113
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,925
- Now!
- And that somebody is us.

114
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:48,180
You can vomit into this food,
cause it already smells like it.

115
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:51,821
Totally.

116
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,855
My law firm went on a retreat
at Disney World once,

117
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,315
and I got so drunk

118
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,690
that I got into a fight
with animatronic Ben Franklin.

119
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,771
- Why are you telling me this?
- The point is that when I'm sober,

120
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,740
I don't secretly hate Ben Franklin
or even think about him.

121
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:10,786
So you drunk dialing me,

122
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,123
- I mean, it's not a big deal.
- You're pitying me now.

123
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,414
- You're acting really weird.
- I'll talk to you in class.

124
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,837
Leave me alone until then.

125
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:27,135
What is going on here?

126
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:31,765
My doody meter's going crazy.

127
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,308
Cut, cut, cut.

128
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,945
Leo, I'm not feeling it. I wanna believe
you're holding a doody meter.

129
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,441
The problem is not me.
It's you and your stupid script.

130
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,409
Idiot!

131
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,610
The anger.
Use it.

132
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,142
A Papa John's commercial,
and he thinks he's Christian Bale.

133
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:49,776
You were right.

134
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:52,578
Britta is totally weird around me.
Like I saw her naked.

135
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,831
Resident premise. Tony saw Angela naked
on opening credits of <i>Who's The Boss?</i>

136
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:58,167
Did Tony do something to fix that?

137
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,502
Don't know.
Could'nt get past the opening credits.

138
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:04,340
When Chandler saw Rachel on <i>Friends</i>
to get even, she saw Chandler's penis.

139
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:07,468
I'll show Britta my penis.

140
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,246
Don't waste my time.
I lose my Chang to cub scouts in 20 min.

141
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,932
So what? To even the score,
I have to drunk dial her?

142
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,894
Isn't that absurdly simplistic?
Would it even work?

143
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:17,862
Maybe.

144
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:19,965
No room for error.

145
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,359
She'd have to believe it was real.
Have you ever acted drunk before?

146
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,249
I can totally do it.
I'm fine.

147
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:27,853
I can drive.

148
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:30,324
I can totally drive right now.
Give me my keys.

149
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,618
- That's enough...
- Hold on a second.

150
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,705
Seriously, give me my keys.

151
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:39,541
That's a wrap, people.

152
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,878
Be at my place at 4:00
so we can work on this.

153
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:45,798
No, I can't do that.
Here's why.

154
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,614
Dumbest idea ever.

155
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,327
Britta's defining weakness.
She cuts and runs.

156
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:53,055
You do this half-assed and fail,
she may leave. And we lose her.

157
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,015
Not gonna happen on my watch.

158
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,683
Deal breaker. Saddle up.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,395
Sorry I lost my cool.
I just quit smoking.

160
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:03,398
Kid's gonna be a star.
He's a young "the asian guy" from <i>Lost.</i>

161
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:06,068
Try it again.

162
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:08,722
Come on.
You're a big guy.

163
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:12,821
Action.

164
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,791
Your call got my thinkin'
and thinkin' got me drinkin'.

165
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,446
- That was terrible.
- What?

166
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:27,318
I can get drunk alone
if that's what helps people act.

167
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:30,008
That's your problem.
You've been acting your whole life.

168
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,761
Time to pass that act up,
and find the actor playing you.

169
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:35,389
They're gonna love you
in California.

170
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,351
Do you like Britta?

171
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,984
- Sure. Who doesn't?
- Over half the people that meet her.

172
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:45,892
They could be put off
by her mannequin face.

173
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,844
And her Jodie Foster severity.

174
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,766
- But you're different.
- She's no barrel of monkeys.

175
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,934
She wants everyone to be honest,
but she lies to herself.

176
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,116
She's seen the world,
but doesn't get it.

177
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,706
She fights more about stuff that doesn't
matter than a YouTube comment section.

178
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,179
She's passionate, which...

179
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,743
I find stupid.

180
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:07,296
- But entertaining.
- Attractive.

181
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:11,216
There was only attraction at first
'cause she bothered to play hard to get.

182
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,178
- I'm happy with Michelle.
- Slater is low maintenance.

183
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:17,055
- The lowest.
- Britta's irritating, impossible,

184
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,992
unpredictable, and didn't like you
so it felt useless to like her.

185
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:23,747
Slater likes you how you are,
expect nothing, you're safe from change.

186
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:24,938
And passion.

187
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:26,607
Watch it.

188
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:30,152
What? A phony drunk dial soaked
in phony pity that insults Britta more?

189
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:31,357
Or...

190
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,448
a believable performance
informed by feeling?

191
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,290
I am sure you're a good director,

192
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:42,039
but a horrible drinking buddy.

193
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:44,041
I can't feel things

194
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,835
with you studying me
like a beige praying mantis.

195
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:48,962
Right.

196
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:57,973
- I thought you never drank.
- Scorsese drank with de Niro.

197
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:04,728
Not for me.
For the audience.

198
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,019
All right, class.
Turn to page...

199
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:02,148
Looks like the law firm of seacrest
and slumdog's taking the day off.

200
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,753
Another special delivery
from Troy and Pierce's imaginary lovers?

201
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:18,916
That one's for me.

202
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:20,887
All right.

203
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,270
It's from Princeton.

204
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:32,522
They want to make me associate professor
of the Spanish department?

205
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:36,528
They're telling me I can name my price?
Oh, my god.

206
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,886
At Princeton?
Come on!

207
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,490
You two idiots

208
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,826
really thought I'd fall for this?

209
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,357
This is your pathetic attempt

210
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,956
to punish me for humiliating you.

211
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,293
- But we didn't do it.
- Save it!

212
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,005
As punishment,

213
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,883
because you two obviously
don't have any girlfriends,

214
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,590
you'll escort me
to the Valentine's dance wearing...

215
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:02,429
elegant ladies pantsuits.

216
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,348
Yeah, right.

217
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:07,017
You'll do it
or you'll fail my class.

218
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,751
- You can't do that.
- Have you met me?

219
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,605
I mean it.
Tonight,

220
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,357
you are my bitches.

221
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,330
Holy crap.

222
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,612
It's 3:00.

223
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,041
What happened?

224
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,819
The last thing I remember is...

225
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,603
you were dancing like that girl

226
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:47,849
in that movie...

227
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:51,561
- <i>Kids in Detention</i>?
- <i>Breakfast Club</i>.

228
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,655
Dear god.

229
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,399
- What have you done to me?
- Wait.

230
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,259
Did I call Britta?

231
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:00,834
- Where's my phone?
- Got it.

232
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,091
You made two outgoing calls.

233
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:06,785
One to Britta,
one to your girlfriend.

234
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,620
I don't remember.

235
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,868
Neither do I.

236
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,150
I don't remember the name of the girl
in <i>The Breakfast Club</i>.

237
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:15,739
Mary.

238
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:18,036
Margaret.

239
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,251
Molly ringworm.

240
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:23,218
You broke me.

241
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:29,453
I still can't believe i'm a size 14.

242
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:33,562
I know that 12's a little tight,
but I could have pulled it off.

243
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,897
You guys
really going through with this?

244
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,101
We have to.
He'll fail us.

245
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,112
We'll find out who wrote that letter.
We have leads.

246
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,251
It was written
on fake Princeton letterhead.

247
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:46,324
Whoever wrote it worked at Princeton,
ran out of stationary,

248
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:48,118
didn't have time to go to the store.

249
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:49,975
You guys...

250
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:52,101
What?

251
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,716
Women's sizes run slimmer.

252
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,336
I'm sure you're a 12
everywhere that it counts.

253
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,794
I'll take every little
victory I can get right now.

254
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,844
You look about ready
to marry Courtney Love.

255
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,315
That's the reverse
of my zinger from before.

256
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,852
Please stop shouting. All right.
I feel like that person in the TV show.

257
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,688
Do you remember
calling me last night?

258
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:20,442
Why?
Are we cool?

259
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,784
Have a seat, Drunky Brewster.
Let's study.

260
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:29,448
- Balance restored, I guess.
- Movie reference.

261
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,197
Hey, there.

262
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:50,599
Happy Valentine's day.

263
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,599
- I've been calling you.
- Yeah, I know.

264
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:56,895
I just let it go to voice mail
in case you had the wrong number again.

265
00:14:58,234 --> 00:14:59,189
Elaborate?

266
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,276
You don't remember calling me
and hanging realizing I wasn't Britta?

267
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:05,090
I guess not.

268
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:14,524
I was trying to call Britain
to order you toffees.

269
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,078
Now that may sound dumb,

270
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:20,717
but I needed to open with it
to make the truth less ridiculous.

271
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:27,463
Two nights ago,
Britta drunk dialed me

272
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,111
and it embarrassed
her and made her sad.

273
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:32,443
And the only way for her
to get her power back

274
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,740
was for me to get believably drunk

275
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,060
and leave her an equally
embarrassing message.

276
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,822
It sure seems
like you and Britta are friends

277
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:42,899
the way my mom's pool cleaner
was my uncle.

278
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,901
- You had sex with her?
- Not even a little.

279
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,347
What doesn't make sense,

280
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:48,899
you did all this work
to put a smile on her face,

281
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:51,169
but can't pick up ice cream
for <i>Law & Order</i> night

282
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:52,909
cause it feels too marriage-y.

283
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,246
First of all, chubby hubby?
Could you pick a scarier flavor?

284
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,792
Let's talk about this later.

285
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,762
I need to chaperone...

286
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:02,419
something.

287
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,319
There he is...

288
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:29,955
I thought I'd be embarrassed,
now I'm just scared.

289
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,307
I'm seriously reconsidering how
much I want this language credit.

290
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:35,529
Remember what we said.

291
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:37,991
Never let him see us cry.

292
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:39,330
Right.

293
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:41,732
One,

294
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:42,792
two...

295
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,533
Wait!
Keep your coats on.

296
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,630
We're the ones that sent the letter.

297
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:47,624
What?

298
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:49,813
You work at Princeton?

299
00:16:49,938 --> 00:16:51,734
We were mad at him
for humiliating you.

300
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:55,900
Nice fix,
tweedle dum and even tweedler dum.

301
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,070
We're gonna tell Chang the truth.

302
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:01,603
And we'll pay the price.

303
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:03,146
Wait.

304
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,598
We can't make you do that.

305
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:07,305
He's right.
First we gotta

306
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,569
get out of these pantsuits
so you can put em on.

307
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,155
Look, Pierce,
this whole thing started because...

308
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:15,325
you and I were ashamed
we didn't have ladies caring about us.

309
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,785
Good news is, we do.

310
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:19,788
The bad news is...

311
00:17:20,154 --> 00:17:21,478
That it makes it our

312
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:23,541
manly duty to protect them tonight.

313
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,176
That's nice. But we really
can't let you do that...

314
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,421
No, he's right.

315
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:30,006
He's right.

316
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:31,466
Step aside.

317
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,653
Let's handle this like men.

318
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,682
Oh, ladies...

319
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,775
- They're gonna be okay, right?
- Get in my Mercedes.

320
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,576
Just look away, baby.

321
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,526
Just look away.

322
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,426
Looking for someone?

323
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,304
Slater.

324
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,813
Very funny.

325
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,599
You know, when you called me last night
and invited me to the dance,

326
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,017
I was shocked.

327
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:27,655
And...

328
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:28,690
thrilled.

329
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,233
Are you okay?

330
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:37,005
No, look.

331
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,276
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,472
I don't...

333
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,705
Don't remember asking you to the dance.
I don't remember anything.

334
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,999
Now Slater knows
about all the drunk dialing

335
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,878
and I'm in the dog house.
And if she finds out about this,

336
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,050
it's over.

337
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:53,173
So again, I am sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

338
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,717
And you are messing with me right now,
aren't you?

339
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,104
I knew you didn't remember anything
from that phone call last night.

340
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,524
You got dressed up...

341
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,266
just to see me sweat?

342
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,685
Believe me, you're worth it.

343
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,027
- Just chaperoning. Enjoy the dance.
- Wait.

344
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,900
What's left to say?

345
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,813
I don't know.

346
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:17,110
I do.

347
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:20,860
He said it last night.

348
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:25,141
<i>So look,</i>

349
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:28,251
<i>I am really into Michelle,</i>

350
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:31,878
<i>I don't wanna screw it up.
She's a perfect</i>

351
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:32,910
<i>girlfriend.</i>

352
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:35,006
<i>And I want you to be as happy as me</i>

353
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,175
<i>cause you're, like,
my favorite friend.</i>

354
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,344
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

355
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,763
<i>Abed just made a turtle face.</i>

356
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,133
In his defense,

357
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:46,434
Abed's turtle face is really funny.

358
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:47,727
Thanks, Britta.

359
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:49,245
Yeah, thanks.

360
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:56,194
That was the first 20 s
of a 40 min message.

361
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:58,461
Very informative.

362
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,612
Happy Valentine's day.

363
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:05,453
Perfect boyfriend.

364
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:07,452
Yeah. That's me.

365
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,166
Man, I cannot wait to get out
of these ridiculous outfits.

366
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,852
I know.

367
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:32,524
What you doing?
I'm parked here.

368
00:20:35,953 --> 00:20:36,853
Come on.

369
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:39,737
What the hell is this?

370
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,413
- We're gonna get frozen yogurt.
- I'm not gay, man.

371
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:45,034
- They close in seven minutes.
- I could have driven you.

372
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,534
You said he hated fro-yo.

373
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:48,889
Just drive.
