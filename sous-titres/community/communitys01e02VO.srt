1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:03,131
<i>Good afternoon,
Greendale community college.</i>

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:07,137
<i>I am your dean with a few corrections
to the fall class catalog.</i>

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:10,200
<i>Cosmology should be cosmetology,</i>

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,529
<i>astrology should be astronomy,</i>

5
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:15,097
<i>and the students on the cover
should be smiling,</i>

6
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,955
<i>but that's a matter of opinion.</i>

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,711
<i>Whoever is growing a patch of cannabis
behind the gymnasium,</i>

8
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:23,614
<i>congratulations.
You have won a cruise.</i>

9
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,650
<i>Report to security
to claim your tickets.</i>

10
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,944
<i>In order to increase
awareness of homelessness,</i>

11
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,009
<i>security has been given binoculars.</i>

12
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,018
<i>In campus news,</i>

13
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:35,993
<i>the debate over our library's PA system
continues</i>

14
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:38,954
<i>with some students
suggesting its volume be lowered,</i>

15
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,411
<i>while others
question its very purpose.</i>

16
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:43,780
<i>More on that story as it unfolds.</i>

17
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,587
- He makes a lot of announcements.
- I like it,

18
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:49,173
every ten minutes
feel like a new scene of a tv show.

19
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:52,944
Illusion only lasts until someone says
something they'd never say on tv

20
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:55,388
like how much their life is like tv.
There, it's gone.

21
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,390
I guess Jeff's running late again.

22
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,350
What a shame.
We should get started...

23
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:02,353
We should wait for Jeff
before we start studying.

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,095
But when Jeff gets here,

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,275
we could talk to him
about his tardiness.

26
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:10,611
Don't use that word around Abed.

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,253
If you want me to have a chat with Jeff,
I'd be happy to do it.

28
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:17,066
We've got a bond going, kind of.
Sorta like brothers.

29
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,287
Hope you didn't take baths together
'cause one of you would've been 30.

30
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:21,664
That's funny.

31
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,961
Jeff probably comes late
not to sit through your tardiness.

32
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,689
Sorry.

33
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,190
Will you have some self respect?

34
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:33,092
You're obsessing over someone
who does not give you a second thought.

35
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:37,012
In Guatemala, journalists are killed
by their own government.

36
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,014
You jumped a column.
What's happening there?

37
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:42,435
- Nothing.
- Journalists are being murdered?

38
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,748
Believe me, every day in that country,
people are killed for speaking out.

39
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,733
The worst part of it
is when it's over...

40
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,193
- Spoilers.
- It would never even happened.

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,519
Real stories...
They don't have spoilers.

42
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:59,493
You understand that tv and life
are different, right?

43
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,708
- Milady.
- Milord.

44
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:08,457
- Baby.
- Sweetie.

45
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,946
- You smell nice. Vitamin P.
- Morning, Jeffrey.

46
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:13,039
People were jazzed to see me too.

47
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:14,956
- Word 'em up.
- Word 'em everywhere.

48
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:17,172
- Good entrance.
- That was for you.

49
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:27,438
There's something
that the group would like to tell you.

50
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,506
Actually, there's nothing...

51
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:34,181
If you're gonna study with people,
it would be cool to show up on time.

52
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:35,756
Were you waiting?

53
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:39,477
- I just got here.
- Cause you usually spend 20 minutes

54
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:43,324
talking about your personal lives
and your cool emotional problems.

55
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:45,956
I never have anything to offer.

56
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,220
Truth is my life is emptier
than this three-ring binder.

57
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:54,048
You have any Spanish notes
that might fit in there?

58
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,051
Double-spaced. Thank you.

59
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,060
What's a guy got to do
to get a C around here?

60
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,641
One-liner.

61
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,285
- Feygnasse Team -

62
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:09,689
- La Fabrique -

63
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,457
Episode 1x02
<i>Spanish 101</i>

64
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,139
Good studying.
See you later. Bye.

65
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:38,482
You know what today is?

66
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,512
The two-week anniversary
of my horrible first impression.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,597
- There's a card for that?
- Not specifically,

68
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,221
but if you think of grandsons
as a metaphor for friendship,

69
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:48,594
you'll agree
with this transformer here

70
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,746
that it's time for ours
to become a man.

71
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,273
By reading from the Torah.

72
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,236
You're harmless to me
cause a life full of ups and downs

73
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,860
has given me douche-ray vision,
but those are good people in there,

74
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:02,241
and they trust and respect you.
Watching you exploit them bums me out.

75
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,669
- Exploit them? They're my friends.
- You want me to bring your car around?

76
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,918
I don't want you
to bring my car around.

77
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,808
I'll bring yours around, good guy.
You get going, all right.

78
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:14,588
You're cute,

79
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,923
but selfish and narcissistic
to the point of near delusion.

80
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,792
She said I was cute.

81
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,096
Tell you what, you take her.
I have less to prove.

82
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:27,350
You can't pursue people
so desperately.

83
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,105
It starts to creep them out.

84
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,090
Why don't we go get a beer?
I'll give you some advice,

85
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,690
and we can have what the kids calls
a sausage fest.

86
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:38,360
I'm not much of a sausage guy.
Maybe next time.

87
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:40,963
Next time, then.

88
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:48,743
- Will you tell us more about Guatemala?
- I never went to a real college.

89
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,502
You should discover that stuff
on your own.

90
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:52,850
But we need your help.

91
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,348
We've been living
on the wrong side of the looking glass.

92
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:57,630
You're like Jodie Foster
or Susan Sarandon.

93
00:04:58,051 --> 00:05:01,383
- You'd keep it real than be likeable.
- Can you tell us what to google?

94
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,063
You could start
with this journalist Chacata-Panecos.

95
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:07,671
He wrote an article critical
of the government, and they killed him.

96
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:09,727
- That's horrible.
- Can we have a protest?

97
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,322
- I want to protest something.
- We could have a candlelight vigil

98
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:15,147
- like lesbians have on the news.
- I could make brownies.

99
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,057
Brownies?

100
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,236
Every once in a while,
a student come up to me and ask,

101
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:23,972
"<i>Señor</i> Chang,
why do you teach Spanish?"

102
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,257
They say it just like that.

103
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,288
"Why do you teach

104
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,601
Spanish?"

105
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:35,315
"Why you?"

106
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:38,878
Why not math?

107
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,019
Why not photography?

108
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,650
Why not martial arts?

109
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,612
I mean, surely
it must be in my nature

110
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,637
to instruct you in something

111
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,729
that's ancient and secret

112
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,357
like building a wall
that you can see from outer space.

113
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,272
I'll tell you why I teach Spanish.

114
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:03,597
It is none of your business, okay?

115
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:06,407
Now, I don't want to have
any conversations

116
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:10,561
about what a mysterious
and inscrutable man I am.

117
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,085
I am a Spanish genius!

118
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,484
In <i>español</i>, my nickname is

119
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,772
"<i>El tigre chino</i>"!

120
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:29,711
'Cause my knowledge
will bite her face off!

121
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:36,040
So don't question <i>señor</i> Chang
or you'll get bit.

122
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,331
Ya bit.

123
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:39,720
Ya bit!

124
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,573
Friday <i>mañana</i>, we'll have conversations
with the rest of the class

125
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:50,826
using some of the phrases
we learned in unit one.

126
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:54,513
You'll be partnering up
in pairs of <i>dos</i>.

127
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,083
If you look under your desk,

128
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,878
you'll find a card with either a picture
or a word on it.

129
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,533
For <i>ejemplo</i>, blondie <i>aqui</i>

130
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,645
has a card
with a picture of a house on it.

131
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,774
So that means the person with the card
with the word <i>casa</i> on it is her partner.

132
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,349
<i>Comprende</i>, Star-burns?

133
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:20,522
See you Friday.
Find your partners. Have a great day.

134
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,973
What do we say
at the end of every class?

135
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,210
Come on, hands...
90% of Spanish.

136
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,498
You want to trade cards?

137
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:39,427
I'll give you 20 bucks.

138
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:44,505
- 50 bucks.
- I don't want your money. Your shirt.

139
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,716
- What?
- I've had my eye on it sincefirst day.

140
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:52,096
- Fine. Give me your card.
- I want to wear it out of here.

141
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,996
What are the odds?

142
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,311
Are you sure
you didn't adjust the odds?

143
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:03,070
I know Abed's been eyeing that shirt
for three weeks.

144
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,958
It's almost like you gave it to him
so he would switch cards.

145
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,139
I gave Abed my shirt
because I'm not selfish,

146
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:12,990
which is something you'll discover
while we are working on this.

147
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:15,432
Tomorrow night?
Dinner, drinks.

148
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:18,378
I think that's something
we should discuss with our partners.

149
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,166
See, I did switch cards.

150
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,981
Can you believe this?
What are the odds?

151
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,480
That's a nice shirt.
Want to sell it?

152
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,055
What's the moist towelette
industry like?

153
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,822
Believe me,
it's nothing like the product.

154
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,978
It's a hard, dry, large business.

155
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:42,729
Destroyed all my marriages.

156
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,066
It didn't help I can't have children.
I'm not sterile.

157
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:49,375
In fact, it's a rare condition
they call "hyper-virility".

158
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:53,762
Apparently my sperm
shoot through the egg like bullets.

159
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:55,767
- Can you believe that?
- I can't.

160
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:57,411
But you can, so that's fine.

161
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,192
The assignment is

162
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:02,374
to write a Spanish conversation
using those five phrases.

163
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,253
Hemingway's lemonade.

164
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:10,465
- No need to make it a long evening...
- Am I a piece of garbage to you?

165
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,035
What?

166
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:16,979
Got ya.

167
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,613
Let's have one drink before we work.

168
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,901
To the "empowerage" of words.

169
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,403
To the irony of that sentence.

170
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,075
So what's up with you, Jeffrey?
Seems like you got a burr up your ass.

171
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,970
I guess that it's...

172
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,624
- It's Britta.
- Forget her.

173
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:47,051
You just have to know her name.
What is she, a water filter?

174
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,378
She's ugly.

175
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,009
- Why don't we start with me saying...
- What are you doing?

176
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:56,695
Our assignment.

177
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,016
This is the first time people'll see
Winger and Hawthorne together.

178
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,268
We show them
we're a force to be reckoned with.

179
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:05,979
Come on,
let's brainstorm some story ideas.

180
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,533
Better yet, before we do that,
let's ask ourselves...

181
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:16,374
- What is a story?
- My God in heaven.

182
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,210
Like that brownie,
you'll hate what's up on in Guatemala.

183
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:29,655
Google it.

184
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,404
Raise the truth.

185
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:34,519
Once it gets dark,

186
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:37,427
I hand out the candles
and we do a speechless protest.

187
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,179
We put tape over our mouths,

188
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,432
and gather hand-in-hand
in a sea of outraged silence.

189
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,069
- What with you?
- This ain't how you do this.

190
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,613
We know it's not how you do it
cause we're doing everything.

191
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,431
But this is tacky and lame.

192
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,303
I didn't mean that.

193
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,744
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,312
What I meant to say

195
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,819
is that this cause
is really personal to me.

196
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,460
Are you saying
that we're not allowed to protest?

197
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:15,381
- You sound like Guatemala.
- Somebody has a case of

198
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,929
"likes to use French politics
to make themselves special,

199
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,429
"but doesn't actually ever want to do
anything-itis."

200
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,697
I do things.

201
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:23,874
I went to...

202
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,040
I don't do anything.

203
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,565
What can I do?

204
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,319
You hang the Chacata-Panecos piñata.

205
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,196
You guys realize
he was beaten to death, right?

206
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,138
That's where we got the idea from.

207
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:41,263
Poignant.

208
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,481
- Tell me what I've got so far.
- What we have so far?

209
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,465
We have something incredibly long,

210
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,881
and very confusing,
and a little homophobic.

211
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:58,298
And really, really, specifically,

212
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:01,136
surprisingly,
and gratuitously critical of Israel.

213
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:04,206
It's called "two conquistadors",
should probably be "<i>dos</i>".

214
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,989
I mean, it is a Spanish class.

215
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:09,185
Which reminds me,
the only thing not included in this

216
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,689
are the five phrases required
to get me a passing grade.

217
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,901
You're right.
Needs more work.

218
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,320
- What're you guys doing?
- I have no idea.

219
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,697
- We head to the demonstration.
- Hippies?

220
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,954
- Some cause Britta's into.
- A silent protest. Lots of candles.

221
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,638
Gets the ladies in the mood
for social change.

222
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:30,613
- A chance to put miles on this shirt.
- Conversations are due in the morning.

223
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:33,829
Right.

224
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,323
What do you want to do?

225
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,642
Hacks.

226
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,646
What do we do
about the ending of act two?

227
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,548
I tell you what we're gonna do.

228
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:58,777
We gonna take this, and we gonna put it
in a museum for crazy people.

229
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,080
Then we're gonna take this,

230
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:05,020
and memorize five phrases from it
tomorrow morning before class.

231
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:07,195
- Good night.
- Wait a minute.

232
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,456
You're bailing
on our first sausage fest?

233
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,772
This is
your definition of friendship?

234
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:14,989
This is my definition
of you trying way too hard,

235
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:17,892
and me finding it harder and harder
to stay polite.

236
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,799
Now this was a fine enough way
to spend an evening devoid of hope,

237
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,759
but a woman I kind of like

238
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,627
is out there
caring about something stupid,

239
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:29,858
and this is my chance to show her
I care enough to act like I care too.

240
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,897
- That's all you had to say.
- That was it?

241
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:35,814
That would've been great
if I had done that two hours ago!

242
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:19,566
Nice sign.

243
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:23,442
I like what you've done
with the place.

244
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,329
I think
I was a little too harsh on you.

245
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:28,754
I'm not perfect.

246
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,162
I am.
I'd be happy to show you the ropes.

247
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Awesome!

248
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,501
Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger.

249
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,196
Too awesome for old Pierce

250
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:41,929
with your hip shirts,

251
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,382
and your gelled hair,

252
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:46,248
and your cool

253
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:48,163
tape over your mouth.

254
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:51,389
Why are you wearing tape
over their mouth?

255
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:53,099
It's a protest.

256
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:54,377
Good.

257
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,891
Cause I know
what I'd like to protest...

258
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,327
How much you hurt me.

259
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:02,016
Conflicts like these will ultimately
bring us together as an unlikely family.

260
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:05,899
- You have horrible breath right now.
- You constantly blow me off,

261
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:07,447
you want me to do your homework,

262
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:11,368
you tell me I'm trying too hard
to be your friend so you have to go.

263
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:14,097
You have to come out here to pretend

264
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:17,415
to care about the stupid stuff
she cares about.

265
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,502
- His words, not mine.
- He is paraphrasing.

266
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,391
Pierce, I got an idea.

267
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:23,694
Get a coffee,

268
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:26,633
hold some waitress hostage
with a monologue about your sperm.

269
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:29,104
I'll show you some sperm, buddy.

270
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:32,514
Was this your idea?
What the hell? Fire.

271
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,393
I'm not ready to die.

272
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,250
He's jumped in the fountain.

273
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:42,954
He's fine.

274
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,453
- Have you seen it?
- We did it, girl... Page three.

275
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:53,765
Mostly about Pierce,
but listen to last paragraph.

276
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,141
"The incident occurred during a protest
regarding events in Guatemala."

277
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,142
- Awareness!
- It's not the school paper.

278
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,418
It's a real paper,
there's a marmaduke in there.

279
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,461
It's more than I ever accomplished.

280
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,505
You know
about the ethnic cleansing in Burma?

281
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,624
Need to bust out brownie mix.

282
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:13,518
Morning.

283
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,762
I get it.
Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor Day,

284
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,729
- you'd like a fresh start.
- Nice try.

285
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,378
It's secretary's day, and it says
I'm sorry about crashing your protest

286
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,735
with that drunken,
self-immolating baby boomer.

287
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,267
We don't blame you.
He has always been on my watch list.

288
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:31,894
That dude is crazy...
He told me girls have two pee holes.

289
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,201
I sang Christmas carols
at a nursing home once.

290
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,454
I've seen the face of dementia,
and last night I saw it again.

291
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,660
You know what he did
that's really crazy?

292
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,032
He offered me $100
to switch cards with him

293
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:47,339
just so he could be
partners with Jeff.

294
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:51,578
He thought getting closer to Jeff
would bring him respect in the group.

295
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,138
I think he spent his whole life
looking out for himself

296
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,849
and he would trade it all
for a shot at some kind of family.

297
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,694
Time for our presentations.

298
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:12,444
First up was supposed to be
Jeff and Pierce,

299
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,716
but Pierce explained the situation.

300
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:18,702
Apparently there was a falling out,
things were said, people were betrayed.

301
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:22,540
Jeff, having heard
Pierce's side of the story,

302
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,835
the only humane thing to do
would be to give you a C

303
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,058
and let him do his presentation alone,
if that sounds fair to you.

304
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,861
That doesn't sound fair
to me at all.

305
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,808
I understand
if you don't want to be my friend,

306
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:41,643
but this thing we've created...

307
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,259
It is bigger than the both of us,

308
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:47,049
and it deserves to be done right.

309
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:50,755
All right.

310
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:57,164
Why are there costumes involved?
These are short conversations,

311
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,619
- they're not supposed to take...
- Your breath away?

312
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,080
Well, tough.

313
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:04,266
You ready, <i>amigo</i>?

314
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:28,513
F.

315
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:29,918
F-minus.

316
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:31,744
What?

317
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,589
Did you say S?

318
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:39,680
So.

319
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,598
That was one of the worst things
I have ever seen,

320
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,448
which I guess makes being a part of it
a pretty selfless act,

321
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:49,027
so I'm impressed.

322
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,353
How do you know I didn't do it
just to get another shot at you?

323
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:54,367
Cause a smart guy like you
would know

324
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,957
no woman would be able to look at you
as a sexually viable candidate

325
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,072
ever again.

326
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:02,450
No, I know.

327
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,861
I thought of that.

328
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,499
She looked back.

329
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:12,795
You did an all right job up there,
my friend.

330
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:17,272
You got this thing you do with your face
when you're trying to be funny

331
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:20,997
that forces people to think
about how cool you think you are.

332
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,755


333
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,347
{\My name is T-Bone
the disco spider.}

334
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:46,130


335
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:48,873


336
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,504


337
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,465
{\head is ice cream,
beer is good}

338
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,087


339
00:20:57,212 --> 00:21:00,026
{\the goat's mustache
is Cameron Diaz.}

340
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,397
