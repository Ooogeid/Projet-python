1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,324
I'm Jeff.

2
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,324
I try to lock down my schedule
before the deadline.

3
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,438
I heard this class was a cakewalk.
Are you passing it?

4
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:25,316
- Do you like Dane Cook?
- Yeah, he's awesome.

5
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:27,033
So far so good.

6
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:28,947
Death...

7
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:31,132
so-called...

8
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:32,710
is a thing

9
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,031
that makes men weep.

10
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:36,772
And yet

11
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:39,932
a third of life is spent

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,415
in sleep.

13
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,585
Open your textbooks to page 37.

14
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:48,823
Now...

15
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:50,758
Close them and throw them away.

16
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,212
Throw it away!

17
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:00,101
For those of you who are new,
the motto of this class:

18
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:01,903
<i>Carpe diem</i>.

19
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,572
"Seize the day!"

20
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,197
No tests! No papers.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,482
You want an A?

22
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:07,958
Live in...

23
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:11,529
the moment.

24
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:15,072
Jackpot.

25
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:18,452
Take off your shoes. Quick.
Everyone, take your shoes off.

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,385
Throw them across the room
over there.

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,997
Today, we learn to walk!

28
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:26,001
Get up and walk out the door!
This day could be your last!

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,821
You could die in your sleep.
You could get hit by a bus.

30
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:31,449
You, that mole is raised and dark.
It's not a good combo.

31
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:33,572
- You are new.
- Yes, I'm new.

32
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:35,134
But I'll be old too soon.

33
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,245
<i>Carpe diem</i>, sir.

34
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:40,182
I like it!

35
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:41,817
Voice command.

36
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,744
Would you please use the buttons?

37
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,209
Okay, grandpa.

38
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,625
God bless you, dear.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,820
- What's so funny?
- You guys, I found it.

40
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,465
The ultimate blow-off class.

41
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:15,947
Professor Whitman.
He thinks he's in <i>Dead Poets Society</i>.

42
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:17,883
There's no tests.
There's no work.

43
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:19,758
It's just "day seizing".

44
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:23,768
The deadline to enroll is tomorrow.
I suggest you all do it.

45
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,395
Well, some of us are here
to actually learn things.

46
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,814
- I'm in.
- Me too. It sounds educational.

47
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:31,400
I'll do it.
I love Robin Williams.

48
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:35,237
Not a fan. An authority figure
always gets mad for making us laugh.

49
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,008
- Are you going to take the class?
- Can't.

50
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,118
My dad pay for classes that will help me
run the family restaurant.

51
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:44,955
It's been struggling since 2001.
9/11 was the same for falafel business.

52
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:48,136
So your dad has your whole life
planned out for you?

53
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:51,696
- Are you even interested in falafel?
- I'm interested in making movies.

54
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:54,882
Dad says all media's western propaganda
that negatively stereotypes arabs.

55
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,696
Then he should see <i>Aladdin</i>.
Jafar was a bad-ass.

56
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:03,307
- How much does a film class cost?
- $70.

57
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:12,533
Isn't Abed's dad a hardcore muslim?

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,910
Ain't as understanding as christians.
You can get your head cut off.

59
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,448
That's the most racist thing
I've ever heard.

60
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,200
Pierce beat it in one minute.

61
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:29,500
This is really nice of you.
The memo says "for dreams".

62
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,122
Are we going to study Spanish

63
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,381
or keep getting involved
in each other's lives?

64
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:39,794
- Troy sneezes like a girl.
- And how about I pound you like a boy?

65
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,303
That didn't come out right.

66
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,265
Why don't you all just leave him alone
with his cute baby sneezes.

67
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:46,976
- You're not my mother.
- She's not?

68
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,894
29 seconds.

69
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,637
- Feygnasse Team -

70
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:54,024
- La Fabrique -

71
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,743
Episode 1x03
<i>Introduction to Film</i>

72
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,301
- What's your name?
- Shirley Bennett.

73
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,719
Shirley, you get an A.

74
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:25,014
If you can tell me
why you are here at Greendale.

75
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:27,596
What'd I tell you?

76
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,644
Okay, but never again.

77
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:35,733
To get a degree in business
to sell my baked goods on the net.

78
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:38,861
Why... are you here?

79
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,740
To get a degree in business
to sell my baked goods on the net.

80
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:44,617
Why are you here?

81
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,968
Cause I wasted 15 years
on a man who left me

82
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,582
with nothing but stretch marks
and a memory of two orgasms.

83
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,900
And it's time to get what's mine.

84
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,270
Day seized.

85
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,716
Only when we stop stopping our lives

86
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,636
can we begin to start starting them.

87
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,304
Ms. Edison here,

88
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,140
would rather write
about what happens to other people

89
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,517
than live what is happening to her.

90
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:14,104
- I thought there might be a quiz.
- Well, here's a quiz for you.

91
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,074
Why did the pretty young girl
die alone

92
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,278
surrounded by sweater-wearing cats
who are trained to use human toilets?

93
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,458
Get up on your desk.

94
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,410
Come on.
Stand on your desk.

95
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,883
Up on your desk.

96
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:32,039
She made it!

97
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:34,718
Everyone stand on your desks!

98
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,502
Up, up!
Come on.

99
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:39,762
Rise, rise above the programming.

100
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:42,767
All your lives you were told
don't stand on your desks.

101
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,092
Well, why not?

102
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,724
She's okay. Go to the nurse.
Seize the day.

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,311
You know, I was really moved
by your honesty earlier.

104
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,357
Particularly the part about your husband
not being able, you know...

105
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:00,769
Your homework.

106
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:06,323
I want you to swim in a lake
and tell ten people that you love them.

107
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:11,036
Can I have a word?

108
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,956
- Are you okay.
- Maybe I'm not.

109
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,212
I like to think every life that passes
through this class is changed.

110
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,873
But every year,
there's always one cocky opportunist

111
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:25,175
who's just here to coast
and grab an easy A.

112
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:29,889
His name's Pierce.
I can talk to him for you.

113
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,807
It's actually you.

114
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,268
You have no intention
of seizing the day.

115
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:38,523
What? Listen,
I have never lived until I met you.

116
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,857
I love you.

117
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,317
There's one down.
Nine to go.

118
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,154
- Not that I want the grade!
- Well, I'm glad to hear it.

119
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,238
Cause if you don't genuinely
seize the day before the end of the week

120
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,994
then you will be seizing an F
for the semester.

121
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,745
This is no way to teach accounting!

122
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:00,077
I have to plan in advance

123
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,893
how to prove
that I live in the moment.

124
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:06,019
I'd rather take an actual class,
but now it's too late to drop or add.

125
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:08,469
It is not fair how hard it is for you
to cheat here.

126
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,511
- How's your film class, buddy?
- It's cool.

127
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:17,811
Our first assignment is a documentary.
Like real movies, but with ugly people.

128
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,930
- I'm learning a lot.
- That is wonderful.

129
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:22,900
Some don't like getting involved
in other's lives. I think it's great.

130
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,473
If you're making a documentary
about Britta patting herself on the back

131
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:29,517
- you're gonna need a backup battery.
- I'm doing a movie about my dad.

132
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:32,594
That is brilliant. How did he react
to you signing up for the film class?

133
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,162
That part hasn't happened yet.
Here he comes.

134
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:37,706
You want to get involved
in my family's business?

135
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:39,828
Holy... War.

136
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:41,627
Where do I find Mr. Britta?

137
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:43,670
I'm Mr. Britta.

138
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,405
That's right.
I'm a woman with rights.

139
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,759
And you can see my whole face.

140
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:52,513
I get it!
Because I'm Arab, I must hate women.

141
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:55,017
Let me tell you something,
I love women.

142
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,115
But I'm getting a major B-word vibe
from you.

143
00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:01,146
Can't believe I missed out
on getting involved in this.

144
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:04,048
You go host <i>American Idol</i>
and you stop messing with my son.

145
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:05,577
He's a special boy.

146
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,486
I raise him, okay? Not you.

147
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,823
- Means letting him follow his dreams.
- Dreams are for sleeping.

148
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,699
- False!
- It's clinically proven.

149
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,326
- So's polio.
- You lost me!

150
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:17,199
Abed wants to study film.

151
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,542
- What is he saying?
- "We're leaving".

152
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:24,795
- Tell him you wanna stay to study film.
- I'm not really in the scene.

153
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:28,715
It was hard enough to talk to him.
Now we have this between us!

154
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,884
Let's go!

155
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:31,953
Don't touch me!

156
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,578
Guys, guys, stop it.

157
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:38,321
You have a right to your faith
and your family's privacy.

158
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:40,896
But Abed is an adult
and a US citizen.

159
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,190
Right?
And he has the right to stay.

160
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,089
Fine.

161
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,652
You want to raise him,
you raise him.

162
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:50,777
I'm out!

163
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:54,199
- Wait, what?
- You know, I had a father like you.

164
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,050
And the day
I finally cut myself loose

165
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:00,679
is the day
I finally started being happy.

166
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,390
That went well.

167
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,962
I'll have to make some adjustments.
You should play the role of my father.

168
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:10,841
- I don't wanna be your father.
- You already know your lines.

169
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,139
What?

170
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,826
Why are you dressed
like an '80s rapist?

171
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,937
Professor whitman comes by here
every morning and I need him to see me

172
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:26,412
celebrating life.

173
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:31,830
- What's all that?
- I am calculating Abed's expenses.

174
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:34,239
There's books, meals.
He's renting that camera.

175
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,200
He needs a little spending money.

176
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,327
All money is spending money.

177
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,413
It's amazing
what you're doing for Abed.

178
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,916
A lot of people talk a good game.
But you, you follow through.

179
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,587
- Love you.
- Shirley, thank you.

180
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,141
- Bet that doesn't happen to you a lot.
- Happened yesterday.

181
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:55,952
- Shirley's just doing her homework.
- Thank you for getting people coffee.

182
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:57,077
I love you.

183
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:02,415
Abed, how's it going, buddy?

184
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,889
Good. My film is coming together.
Cool tie, Jeff.

185
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:08,228
You wearing it cause you play my dad,
or is it really Christmas?

186
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:10,642
- Definitely Christmas.
- Is that a new camera?

187
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:13,282
It's more expensive, but it lets me
adjust really specific settings

188
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,364
that most people don't notice
or think about.

189
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:19,219
Hi, I would like a latte.
And, Jeff, let me get you something.

190
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:21,119
- I'm okay.
- Come on. I got you.

191
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,039
- I don't need anything.
- You insult me. Look at this cash.

192
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,875
I will get a small, black coffee.

193
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,463
An ordinary coffee
for an ordinary life.

194
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,549
Good morning, professor Whitman.

195
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:37,894
Sorry, Mr. Winger,
these won't cut it.

196
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:41,098
- Shazbot!
- I shall have...

197
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,378
A birthday cake!

198
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,823
I've seen men in your situation.

199
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:00,534
No, those are both for me.

200
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:04,413
You were on top of the world before
and now no one gives a rat's ass.

201
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:06,523
I can help you with your image.

202
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:09,710
First, lose the jacket.
You look like a high school bitch.

203
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,878
But more importantly,
it's your sneeze.

204
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,579
When I was a CEO,

205
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:18,166
I had an array of masculine sneezes
that asserted dominance.

206
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:21,888
You know, like, the explosive,
shock-the-room-into-silence sneeze.

207
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,835
Or the draw-them-in sneeze.

208
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:37,154
And maybe I wouldn't sneeze
because I'm in control.

209
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:40,198
You could even use a sneeze
to drive home a point even.

210
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,201
I think the cubs are going to win it
all this year.

211
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,274
What do you think?

212
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,584
Tell me more.

213
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,368
It's showtime.

214
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:07,456
Good morning.

215
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,230
Hi! Good morning!

216
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:13,855
Watch the kite.

217
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:16,597
Mind if I get a chance?

218
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:26,104
Bring it in here.
Nice. Thank you so much.

219
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,730
That was really fun.

220
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:30,624
Sloppy.

221
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:33,877
And considering the age of these girls,
unwittingly creepy.

222
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:35,299
Damn it.

223
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:38,777
- Beat it.
- Professor,

224
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:41,103
look at the amount of work
I'm putting into this.

225
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,427
Throw me a bone!

226
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:45,530
Had I not already cried
at the sunrise this morning,

227
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,808
I would be weeping right now.

228
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,989
- What does that mean?
- What do you mean, Jeff?

229
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,230
What does your life mean?

230
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:56,566
How long does it take you in the morning
to make it look like you have bed head?

231
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,737
How many sweat pants,
sport jacket combos did you try

232
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,823
before you found the one
that said "I don't care"?

233
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:05,784
Seize the day, Jeff, for real.

234
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:09,055
Go running naked in a hailstorm,
kiss a girl in the middle of the day,

235
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,430
fly a kite, but do it for yourself.

236
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,016
Or you won't just fail my class,

237
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,253
you'll fail life.

238
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:28,932
- That guy's really got your number.
- Drop the flower.

239
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,792
I really need to talk to you about Abed.
I went by his film class.

240
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,728
He wasn't there.
He's cutting.

241
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,417
I want to know
why he would do something like that.

242
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:39,241
- Ask him.
- Every time I try to ask him about it,

243
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:43,071
he just keeps filming me and telling me
that I'm playing the role of his mother.

244
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:45,808
Abed is not normal.

245
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:49,786
That's what you bought
when you tangled yourself in his life.

246
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,999
Look, will you please talk to him?

247
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,710
I've got problems of my own!
I'm trying to seize a day!

248
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:02,890
What in the hell?

249
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:06,542
Is he gonna kill us?

250
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,415
Thanks for the pizza, Abed.
I was starving.

251
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,854
- Yeah, it's nice. Like a picnic.
- Or a family dinner.

252
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,106
It's just a study group
and a pizza. 

253
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:29,659
- How's film class?
- Good.

254
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:32,871
- Did you go to class today?
- Not really.

255
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,254
Not really.
Well, Britta's paying for those classes.

256
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,584
- Don't think you should go?
- I was shooting my movie.

257
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,462
- But your movie's for class.
- My movie's more important.

258
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,883
- Someone order seven lattes?
- I got that.

259
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:47,103
No, you don't got it.

260
00:14:47,228 --> 00:14:49,721
I got it, Abed.
I got everything.

261
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:53,558
What is wrong with you?
All I want to do is take care of you.

262
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,353
I know you're not stupid.
Are you doing this on purpose?

263
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:02,317
- Why won't you answer me?
- Cause it's the scene where you leave.

264
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:04,953
You better believe it.

265
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,486
- What do you think, Dad?
- I think you are really weird, Abed.

266
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,832
The wrong person just left.

267
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:24,756
That's a wrap.

268
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:30,095
That guy was your dad?

269
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:37,519
You don't really have tickets
for Ravi Sshankar.

270
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:41,189
I lied to get you here
because it's time to communicate.

271
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,816
Communicate.
Have you met Abed?

272
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,888
It ain't the two of you who need it.

273
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,613
- Wait a minute, where's Weezer?
- They're coming.

274
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:51,742
The only reason why
this whole mess got started

275
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,494
is because both of you wanted the best
for Abed.

276
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:57,644
And I think the lesson
we can all take away from this

277
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,167
is that everyone should always do
whatever they want

278
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,545
and leave each other out of it.

279
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:07,666
- Is that your take?
- Let me give you mine.

280
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,844
You and your pillow-lipped girlfriend
got all up in my stuff

281
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,518
because you wanted to be cowboys
and then you turned chicken

282
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:17,183
when you found out it will take
more than speeches and guided missiles.

283
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,994
Interesting.
Hadn't seen the Iraq metaphor, but...

284
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:23,727
What Iraq metaphor? I am talking
about your speeches and her guided...

285
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:24,601
Got it!

286
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:27,777
- Point is that Britta is sorry, right?
- Wrong.

287
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,523
Abed may not be a great filmmaker,
that doesn't mean he wanna make falafel.

288
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:34,743
You need to let him
make his own decisions.

289
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,912
Make his own decisions?
Have you met Abed?

290
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,246
You know who he is?

291
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:41,447
I'm finished.

292
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,070
<i>How's it going, buddy?</i>

293
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:13,702
<i>I don't want to be your father.</i>

294
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,912
<i>I think you are weird, Abed.</i>

295
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,352
<i>Look, I need to talk to you
about Abed.</i>

296
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:22,832
<i>He's not normal.</i>

297
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,130
<i>What is wrong with you?
All I want to do is take care of you.</i>

298
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:32,509
<i>Why will you not answer me?</i>

299
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:43,065
<i>What do you think, Dad?</i>

300
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:45,565
<i>I think you are weird, Abed.</i>

301
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,630
<i>I think the wrong person just left.</i>

302
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,033
It's not exactly <i>Citizen Kane</i>.

303
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,134


304
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:15,468


305
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:19,000


306
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:24,602
I feel a little out of the loop.

307
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,522
That's called the joy of freedom.

308
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,529
My son is hard to understand.

309
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,463
If making movies
help him be understood,

310
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,661
I pay for the class.

311
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,730
- I made this all happen.
- With falafel as a fallback.

312
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:03,600
Did you do all of that to me
on purpose?

313
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,562
That's not a very nice way
to treat your friends.

314
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:12,166
It isn't called friend business,
it's called show business.

315
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,229
- He's smoking.
- Honey, let him leave the nest.

316
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:22,275
Get your hand off my knee.

317
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,196
God bless you.

318
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,850
Thank you.

319
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:38,386
For someone
who doesn't like getting involved,

320
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:39,718
I owe you.

321
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:41,662
You owe me.

322
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:44,693
That cannot be comfortable for you.

323
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:50,168
You should kiss me right now.

324
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,938
Day seized!

325
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,599
We're even.

326
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:06,967
A plus, Winger.

327
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:09,792
I know a life-changing kiss
when I see one.

328
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:16,988
Fooled you.

329
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:35,608
- Am I crumping?
- No.

330
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,754
This is crumping.

331
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,505
We're crumping.

332
00:20:58,148 --> 00:20:59,398
No, you're not.
