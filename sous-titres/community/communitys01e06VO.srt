1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:03,104
A small fading remnant of a star.

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,233
- A white dwarf.
- That's right!

3
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:07,715
I used a memory technique.

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,926
Dwarves hate being called midgets,
and midgets are small.

5
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:15,732
And... what does a star turn into
after it collapses?

6
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:17,933
- A movie of the week.
- Black hole.

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,964
Right! You could be an astronomer.

8
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:24,023
As far as I'm concerned,
only one black hole's worth studying.

9
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:30,321
It's called Sagittarius A,
is located in the center of our galaxy,

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,406
and has the density of 40 suns.

11
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,359
Just like my weiner.

12
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:38,704
You said weiner.
That's funny.

13
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,499
Pierce and Troy didn't get along,
now they bond through adolescence.

14
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:43,167
Shut up, fart head?

15
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:49,077
Look at this group
having some kind of meeting

16
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:52,058
and being so diverse.
There is just... Boy!

17
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,512
There is just one of every kind of you,
isn't there?

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,473
We are missing a pipsqueak,
but we don't want one, so beat it.

19
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:59,225
That's the Dean.

20
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:02,076
Are you kidding?
Sorry.

21
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,814
- Just my luck.
- It's okay. Don't let me interrupt.

22
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:08,546
Sometimes I just roll around campus
like a little football.

23
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,221
I can't believe this.

24
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:13,679
Here I am in a random conversation
about football,

25
00:01:13,804 --> 00:01:17,808
and I'm talking to Troy Barnes,
star quarterback from Riverside High...

26
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:21,122
Did you know
that Greendale has a football team?

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,040
Did you know they had a football?

28
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:24,917
Very funny.

29
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:29,096
I was sorry to hear about your injury.
But now that you have recovered,

30
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,757
we would love for you to play
for the Human Beings.

31
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,093
The team's name is the Human Beings?

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,840
My idea. It was the Greendale Grizzlies,
but I thought...

33
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:41,767
a lot of these students have been called
animals their whole lives.

34
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,603
Unfortunately,
I dunno what to do about the mascot.

35
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:46,313
I can help you with that.

36
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,816
I have a wealth of experience
in image management,

37
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,777
icon development,
and Y2K preparedness.

38
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:54,136
Well, aren't you found money?

39
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:58,241
All of your friends are lining up
to turn Greendale around.

40
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,619
- How about you?
- He isn't interested in football.

41
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:03,497
Getting injured in keg stand
was the best thing to him.

42
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:05,666
Yoko ono much?

43
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:09,170
Bros before hoes, Troy.

44
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,689
Listen, man. No offense,
but I was the best, I finished on top.

45
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,676
I wouldn't play for this school.

46
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:18,752
Dean, I'm sure
Troy will sign up for football

47
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:22,881
if and when some accident damages
the part of his brain that feels pride.

48
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:26,045
- Until then, would you excuse us?
- Well...

49
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:29,125
if you change your mind,
the field is always open.

50
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,268
Figuratively speaking.
Wednesdays and Sundays,

51
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:33,778
it's used as parking overflow
for the mega-church.

52
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:38,949
Let's meet the minimum requirements
for a language credit, shall we?

53
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,952
Yes, but I need to go
to the bathroom first.

54
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,704
No, I don't have to go.

55
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,451
I'll go with you.

56
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:52,254
She's offended?

57
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:53,964
Girls go in groups.

58
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:56,675
Did you learn nothing
from stand-up comedy in the '90s?

59
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,033
I'm familiar with the concept.
I'm just...

60
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:01,584
If it's important to Shirley,
I'll go with her next time.

61
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,683
I'm willing to try
some more mainstream feminine stuff.

62
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:08,145
Well, then you should know
that nothing says "I'm a woman"

63
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,219
- like doing it with me.
- Nothing says, "I'm a pig" like you.

64
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,236
Will they or won't they?
Sexual tension.

65
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,112
It makes the group uncomfortable

66
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,782
when you talk about us
like we're characters in a show.

67
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,335
That's sort of my gimmick.

68
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,084
But we did lean
on that pretty hard last week.

69
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,704
I can lay low for an episode.

70
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,383
You sure you made the right call
on the football team?

71
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:40,548
It looks like they won something once.

72
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:43,514
"Most valued customer.
Henderson trophy cases."

73
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:47,709
So we should still study
a little more astronomy later.

74
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,854
Maybe over some Milky Ways
or some Mars bars.

75
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,282
Or pancakes!

76
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,858
"I'm Jeff.
And I'm a student at Greendale."

77
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:58,945
That's not good.

78
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,412
Wood undergoes
rapid oxidation

79
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:05,973
because it reacts
spontaneously to...

80
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:09,105
Seriously,
we've talked about this.

81
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,555
You got to turn off
your cell...

82
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,671
- That's mine. My bad.
- I'm going to the bathroom.

83
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:18,007
Would you like to come with me?

84
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:20,098
Well, yes, I would.

85
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,802
That's nice!

86
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:23,637
Okay, what's it called?

87
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,605
Antoni... An... Hold on.

88
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,680
Does anyone have a pen?
Pen?

89
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,458
No one has a pen.

90
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,564
Why would you not bring a pen
to class?

91
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,789
Idiot.
No, you're not an idiot.

92
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:37,926
I had my blinker on about 5 minutes,
and this no-good, clearly bald

93
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:40,335
but trying to hide it
with a bandana loser swooped right in.

94
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,333
- Couldn't believe.
- Maybe he didn't see you.

95
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,358
- He saw me!
- Maybe he had his blinker on too.

96
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:48,772
Maybe. So you...
got any family, Britta?

97
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,147
Yeah, whatever.

98
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,958
Think my mom
might visit this weekend.

99
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,100
She and I are gonna get makeovers
at that spa...

100
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:58,125
Makeovers.
They sure have us programmed, right?

101
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,233
I am a female pleasure unit.

102
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:02,586
I require a new coat of paint.

103
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,521
- Just something I thought might be fun.
- Here's something I think might be fun.

104
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:10,396
Find out the number of makeup companies
that are owned by women.

105
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:12,753
I'll save you the trouble.
It's zero.

106
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:15,512
But of course you're saying,
"Britta, aren't you a hypocrite?

107
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:19,207
"You're plastered with glitter and goo
from head to toe, like the rest of us."

108
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:22,010
Well, I also pay income tax
and pull over for cops,

109
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,073
but that doesn't mean I support...

110
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:29,835
Thanks for offering to help
design the new mascot.

111
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,414
- I have been a little stumped.
- That's no problem.

112
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,898
By the way, I took the liberty
of thumbnailing a Human Being prototype

113
00:05:36,023 --> 00:05:39,438
which I modeled
after Da Vinci's Vitruvian man.

114
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:43,274
The penis is a little small,
I think.

115
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,468
I think it's...

116
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,261
It... looks a lot like you.

117
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:51,286
Here's the thing.
If we are the Human Beings, you know,

118
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:55,388
and we have a white guy as a mascot,
what message are we sending?

119
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:58,981
Our symbol should reflect the diversity
of our school and our species.

120
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,859
So... black?

121
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:03,512
No, because we're not
the Greendale Blacks,

122
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:06,146
or the Greendale Asians
or any other creed.

123
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,471
We are the Greendale Human Beings.

124
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,996
Sorry to disturb you.

125
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:16,581
Who are clearly looking at a drawing
of Pierce doing jumping Jacks.

126
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:20,156
- Dean, a quick download, please?
- Absolutely. Excuse me.

127
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,660
Fill me in later.

128
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,512
I'll go with a pencil.

129
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,458
First of all...

130
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:33,645
- I'm flattered.
- You're a very photogenic man.

131
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,478
Is that real bed head,
or do you put something in there?

132
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,412
- Crispy.
- Thinking about the disembodied heads,

133
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:41,895
I thought, where's the heart?
The soul?

134
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,155
Where's the different poster design?

135
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,483
I did think those
were less than personable,

136
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:49,414
which is why
I went with the full bodies

137
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,789
in these mailers we have going out.

138
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,914
Mailers?
I didn't give permission for this.

139
00:06:56,953 --> 00:07:00,085
Did you not read the release agreement
on the back of your registration form?

140
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,964
I'm starting to see
why someone used to be a lawyer.

141
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:07,422
- Up top!
- If someone from the outside...

142
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:12,379
If someone were to find out
I am a student at a community college,

143
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:15,726
that could have a negative impact
on my future career.

144
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:19,082
Goodness.

145
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:23,331
Look what we have stumbled onto...
an opportunity to help each other out.

146
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:26,278
I suppose I wouldn't need
this promotional campaign

147
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,615
if I could announce to the press
Troy Barnes is playing football here.

148
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:33,035
I think he's been pretty clear
about declining that offer.

149
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,083
If you said "jump",
he'd say "how high?"

150
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,482
If you said "stop",
he'd say "hammertime".

151
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,334
- You starting to get what I mean?
- No. I need another example.

152
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,181
You know, I didn't realize before,

153
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:45,964
we should send those
out to local businesses.

154
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:49,127
Law firms.

155
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:50,893
Lawyer...

156
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,317
companies?

157
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:55,567
Legal...

158
00:07:57,654 --> 00:07:58,685
gatherings?

159
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,687
- You trying to blackmail me?
- I think so.

160
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,956
Gentlemen...

161
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:05,032
I present to you
the Greendale Human Being.

162
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:07,778
That's a falcon with a gun.

163
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:11,406
Now it's a falcon with an erection.

164
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,099
He's just laying low.

165
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,502
- You going to the bathroom?
- Yes.

166
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,521
- I'll go with you.
- You know what? I'm good.

167
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,010
She probably just, you know,
had to go number two.

168
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:38,600
- What's the closest planet to Earth?
- Planet Hollywood.

169
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:44,273
That's not the right answer.
But it shows how fun astronomy can be.

170
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,569
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- We're studying, so Troy's busy.

171
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,905
Well, the galaxy's not going anywhere.
I'll bring him back.

172
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,576
You ever miss being a quarterback?

173
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,884
I miss being the best at something.

174
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,609
I miss having a coach.

175
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:02,870
I miss knowing what to think.

176
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,710
You still know what to think.

177
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:06,650
- Good.
- For instance,

178
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:09,882
after the Dean talked to you,
you and I were thinking the same thing.

179
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,300
He looks like Moby!

180
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,178
We were thinking...
what if Troy did play for Greendale?

181
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:17,218
You'd be surprised at how many
of your favorite football players

182
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:19,224
got started at community college.

183
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:20,893
Really? Name one.

184
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,445
- Who's your favorite player?
- Me.

185
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:28,319
Maybe you and I should go check out
the Greendale thunderdome.

186
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:36,177
The dome arrives later.

187
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:37,998
It comes with thunder.

188
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:40,204
Let me tell you
a little secret about me.

189
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,302
Every day on my way to school,

190
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:45,037
I drive through downtown
past the courthouse

191
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:48,022
just to get a glimpse of the world
that I once ruled.

192
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:51,333
And I just wanna jump out of my car,
run up the steps

193
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,337
and exploit the legal system for profit.
But I can't.

194
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:56,532
I'm locked out of my old kingdom.

195
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,972
You're not.
You see what I'm saying?

196
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:03,148
- You're saying I could be a lawyer.
- I'm saying you're a football player!

197
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:04,895
- It's in your blood!
- That's racist!

198
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:06,480
- Your soul.
- Racist.

199
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:07,773
- Your eyes?
- Gay?

200
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,358
- That's homophobic.
- Black.

201
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,109
- That's racist!
- Damn.

202
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,362
When you played, you were a God.

203
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:15,322
Now you're not playing,
and you're not.

204
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:18,053
I'd tell you to do the math,
but math isn't important.

205
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:19,868
The only thing important is this.

206
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,461
- But Annie said...
- That Benjamin Button was compelling.

207
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:26,086
Look, she's a smart girl,
but sometimes she's just wrong.

208
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:27,411
85... go long!

209
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:31,678
It's like a drug, isn't it?
Feel it, Troy. Throw it!

210
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,773
The scoreboard lights up.

211
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,711
There will be a scoreboard there.

212
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,899
It's complete!
Nice catch!

213
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:42,712
The girls, the glory,
the scouts, the career!

214
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,037
It starts when you join this team.

215
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:48,689
- Is that linebacker a pregnant woman?
- Look, you can meet them later.

216
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,400
But this decision has to be yours,
T-Bone.

217
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,027
And this decision has to be yes.

218
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,837
How did you know about T-Bone?

219
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:59,366
Because you're a football player,
and your name begins with "T".

220
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,558
Your name... begins...

221
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:05,080
with "T".

222
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:14,335
Are you finished?

223
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:15,861
I have to go, but apparently,

224
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:19,136
I failed yesterday's tryouts
for the position of bathroom companion.

225
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:23,835
- I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.
- You didn't hurt my feelings.

226
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,085
I don't need to go to the bathroom
with other people.

227
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,061
Was trying to throw you a bone.
I like you.

228
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,834
You can keep that bone.

229
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,026
Listening to a story about a stranger
pissing me off and taking his side?

230
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,342
You can't talk about your own business,
but you insinuate my mama's a robot.

231
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,191
Because she and I want makeovers.

232
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:40,741
That is the ladies' room,

233
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:44,709
a place where ladies go to share,
listen, support each other and...

234
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,684
discreetly eliminate waste.

235
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:50,083
And I like you too.
Even like that you're a little hard.

236
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:53,085
But if you can't learn
to be soft in there,

237
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,182
you need to pee alone.

238
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:59,009
I've peed alone my whole life.

239
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,123
Women have always hated me.

240
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,522
I don't even know how it started.

241
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:08,497
Maybe it was when I got boobs
before everyb...

242
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:11,646
Not out here.

243
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:14,147
In there.

244
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:19,863
Troy, Troy, the wonder boy!
You dropped your books, Poindexter.

245
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,661
- I've been waiting for an hour.
- It's all right, I'm worth it.

246
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,692
<i>Hip, hop, body don't stop</i>

247
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:28,709
<i>Riverside got the broom,
don't need a mop</i>

248
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,975
<i>Put your team in a box,
put a ribbon on top</i>

249
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,835
<i>We're not John Kerry
'cause we don't flip-flop</i>

250
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:38,432
Why you doing a conservative high school
shamefully outdated fight rap?

251
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,551
- Have you been playing football?
- Threw the skin around couple of times.

252
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:42,986
Still got it.

253
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,350
But you knew we had
an astronomy test tomorrow.

254
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,452
Class blows.

255
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:53,581
What I need to know about the universe
is that I'm at the center of it.

256
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:56,040
<i>Bing, bong, sing along</i>

257
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,045
<i>Your team's Al Gore
'cause your views are wrong</i>

258
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,272
Don't become this person again.
This isn't the real you.

259
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:05,867
This is the arrogant Jock

260
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,452
that totally ignored the only people
that truly liked him

261
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:10,749
for non-superficial reasons
but couldn't say anything

262
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,024
because their parents are bigots!

263
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:16,832
Football is bad for you, Troy.

264
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,757
Jeff said you'd say that.

265
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,468
What now?

266
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:31,024
I think if we add in
a little bit of Phylicia Rashad,

267
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:34,312
- we'll be in better shape.
- That beige is a little light.

268
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:41,684
We are developing
the perfect mascot.

269
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:45,257
No stereotypical identifiers
from any race or gender.

270
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:48,633
This is a chart of the features
we're staying away from...

271
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,258
Pan-asian eye folds,

272
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:53,665
- irish chins, women's breasts.
- Is that Seal?

273
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,522
That is our human color wheel.

274
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:58,628
It goes from Seal to Seal's teeth.

275
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:02,841
- So?
- Not being racist is the new racism.

276
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,510
What happened to the prototype?

277
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,512
I left the nose in the kiln.

278
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:11,725
So... Troy is gonna play football.

279
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,728
Which means
I'll be getting rid of these.

280
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:17,688
I won't mail these out,
but they are staying with me

281
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,083
until the press announces
that Troy is a part of the team.

282
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,457
And I want him
at that pep rally tonight.

283
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:26,406
Reporters are gonna be there.
We're gonna unveil the new mascot.

284
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,775
And things are finally
going to start turning around.

285
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,944
My ex-therapist is gonna think twice

286
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:34,998
before he makes fun of my job!

287
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:36,500
Here it is. Still hot.

288
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,271
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
You want anything?

289
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:43,089
A Desmond Tutu with just enough cream
to make it a Lou Diamond Phillips.

290
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,257
La bamba.

291
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:53,896
I've been following you.

292
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:55,769
How much did the Dean pay you?

293
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:58,521
I'm not having a conversation
with someone who emerges from a bush.

294
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:01,946
- Because I'm right?
- Because I'm not in a commercial.

295
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:05,445
The Dean has pictures of me, okay?

296
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,447
Horrible pictures of me...

297
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,616
attending his school.

298
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:13,832
And for that you'd convince Troy
to flush life down footballs toilet?

299
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:16,206
Britta's right,
you are the most selfish person alive!

300
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,082
And all that is gonna end right now.
I'm telling him what friend you are.

301
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,504
Maybe you should tell him
you're hopelessly in love with him.

302
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:28,009
High school must have been tough, huh?
Waiting for a superstar to notice you.

303
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,628
But here... here...

304
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,931
he's all alone,
and he needs so much help!

305
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,685
Did you enroll in all of his classes,
or you worried that might freak him out?

306
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,270
The important thing
is that you are there for him.

307
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:42,395
The important thing is that
you are the only one there for him.

308
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,394
You don't really care
what he wants...

309
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,144
as long as you don't have to share him
with the rest of the world.

310
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:50,115
Because, really,
you are just as selfish as I am.

311
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:53,344
You're just not as good at it yet.

312
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,938
You're right.

313
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:58,809
I could never be as good as you.

314
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,667
Probably because I actually care.

315
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,921
Profound,
but technically meaningless.

316
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,222
Don't bother trying that thing
women do where they walk away

317
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:11,747
and make the guy feel like crap,
because it won't happen!

318
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:17,073
Damn it.

319
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,381
Will you please come
to the bathroom with me?

320
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,532
Where's Shirley?

321
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:34,284
Shirley's not coming.

322
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,869
But I'm here...

323
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:38,085
to listen... girl.

324
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,018
Why do we inflict so much pain
on ourselves for men?

325
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:45,143
I don't...

326
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:47,505
know... sweetie.

327
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,231
Maybe...

328
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:52,985
it's because men
make the world go round?

329
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,025
Kleenex?

330
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:01,042
I've been...

331
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,521
I've been infatuated with Troy.

332
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:05,815
Now he's joining football.

333
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,817
He'll have his pick of the litter
and...

334
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:11,251
I'll never get to be with him!

335
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:14,204
Screw him!

336
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,868
There are guys out there
that would kill to be with you.

337
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,079
And if Troy isn't one of them,
that's him failing your standards.

338
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:21,289
You got that?

339
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:24,169
You're right.

340
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:25,835
I can't control him.

341
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,879
If I truly cared about him,

342
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,581
I wouldn't want to.

343
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:34,768
Thanks for talking to me, Britta.

344
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:35,887
It really helped.

345
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,180
Seriously?

346
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:39,886
Who's my girl?

347
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,643
I did it, I did it!

348
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,292
Yes, you did!

349
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,174
Human Beings, Human Beings!

350
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:03,831
- Don't go in there, man.
- What?

351
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:06,769
You got the most
you were ever gonna get out of football.

352
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:10,898
A life of disillusionment and depression
begins on the other side of that door.

353
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,299
Is this your first pep rally
or something?

354
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,105
You told me football was
the most important thing in the world.

355
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:21,850
Well, buckle up. I was exaggerating.
It's kinda my gimmick.

356
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:24,269
- Let me tell you...
- No, I tell you.

357
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:27,555
You know that keg flip
that cost me my scholarship?

358
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,941
I hurt myself on purpose.

359
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,109
What?

360
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:34,658
There was a scout coming
to the final game at Riverside and...

361
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,532
I couldn't take the pressure,
so I took the easy way out.

362
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:42,203
But when you showed me that field,
I saw there was nothing to worry.

363
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:45,456
I could play football for the fun of it.
Have you seen these guys?

364
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:48,877
- There is nowhere to go but up.
- Dude, we have feelings.

365
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:52,107
I don't know about you,
but I know I ended up here

366
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,982
because things weren't that great
out there.

367
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:58,920
You should try accepting
where you're at.

368
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,245
Take a pottery class or something.

369
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,475
Greendale, we're number one!

370
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,680
Nancy Pelosi is no fun!

371
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,041
I've decided to support Troy.

372
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,452
They deploy things in football, right?
I went for rhyme over clarity.

373
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:25,370
I'm really sorry about before.

374
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:28,550
- I just think we were both wrong.
- Really?

375
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,753
Because I'm an 18-year-old girl,
and you made me cry in public.

376
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,214
Maybe I was a little more wrong.

377
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,186
I should grow up
and make peace with being here.

378
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,845
It's not like Greendale's gonna kill me
or anything.

379
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,294
Holy crap!

380
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,851
Sorry. Say hello
to our ethnically neutral mascot...

381
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,688
The Greendale Human Being.

382
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,065
The costume makes it difficult
for him to see.

383
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,344
He can't move his mouth either.

384
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:58,378
Take it from me,
that's human for "Hello".

385
00:19:58,737 --> 00:20:01,699
- Let's get you into the pep rally!
- Great idea. Let's do it!

386
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:07,259
- We've solved racism. What's next?
- Let's do something for little people.

387
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:09,716
- Or albinos!
- Little albinos.

388
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:13,578
This has the potential
to be a uniquely Greendale experience.

389
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:15,234
Milady.

390
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:17,742
Milord.

391
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,328
- <i>Attention, students, this is Abed...</i>
- <i>And the disco spider...</i>

392
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,953
<i>Here at Greendale...</i>

393
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:37,391
<i>Say what?</i>

394
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:39,952
A few quick announcements.
Announcement number one:

395
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:42,505
all announcements will be cool
starting right now.

396
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,398
Announcement number two: butt soup.

397
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:47,766
Announcement number three:

398
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:50,691
I am not Haji from <i>Johnny Quest</i>,
Jeff Winger.

399
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:54,836
In security news, you got to start
locking the door so we don't get in.
