1
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:04,779
Good morning.

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:08,006
I'm here to kick off
the first day of a new tradition

3
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:10,968
at our school called "Green Week".

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,379
What?

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,015
First, a month of Black history,
now seven days on the Irish.

6
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:17,233
All this week,

7
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:20,660
Greendale College
is becoming so earth-smart

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,856
that we're Changing our name
to Envirodale!

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,417
But we were already
called Greendale.

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,947
Well, there's also

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,954
going to be
a free rock and roll concert

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,874
by a certain band called Green Day.

13
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,712
- That make you happy?
- Not really.

14
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:50,132
- We need to redo these.
- We printed 5,000.

15
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:53,052
Print 5,000 more.
I'm trying to save the planet, here.

16
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:03,312
Pencils down.

17
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,933
I want you all
to write a one-page essay,

18
00:01:40,175 --> 00:01:43,122
in <i>español</i>,
entitled "Annie's mistake".

19
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:48,996
Why doesn't Annie have to write it?

20
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:52,232
Two pages, entitled

21
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:54,780
"The consequences
of questioning authority".

22
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,443
This is Spanish 101.

23
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:59,272
I know how to say "hello", "tomorrow",
and that tables are female.

24
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:03,038
- That's the only Spanish you taught us.
- Six pages on ignorance.

25
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:06,693
Guys, put your hands down.

26
00:02:06,913 --> 00:02:10,254
<i>Señor</i> Chang, please continue.
We respect your authority.

27
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:14,091
Thank you, Britta.
20 pages on ass kissing!

28
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:15,913
Due on Monday.

29
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,381
This Monday?

30
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:25,826
If <i>señor</i> Chang gets any crazier,

31
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,885
he'll win
one of those Grammy Awards.

32
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:33,630
I've reported him to the Dean.

33
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:36,636
Been trying to fire him for 3 years.
Nobody wants his job.

34
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,033
I can't write a 20-page paper.
I got a presentation on Friday

35
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:43,879
and public speaking
gives me the nervous sweats.

36
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:46,191
- I can help you with that.
- I accept.

37
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:48,539
That's how messed up things are.

38
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:49,835
We're screwed too.

39
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:52,195
We're three days behind
on our biology lab.

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,556
- Because he's afraid...
- I'm not afraid.

41
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,881
I choose not to be around rats
because they are unpopular.

42
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,805
Same goes for centipedes and lakes.

43
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,141
There's only one solution.
Someone has to talk to Chang.

44
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:06,685
I vote we all look at Jeff
at the same time.

45
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:13,180
In a way, all of you are right.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,820
What?

47
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:18,444
You have to get Chang to call off
some of this homework.

48
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,679
- You're the one with the silver tongue.
- Go tongue Chang.

49
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:24,197
How can I convince Chang of anything

50
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:26,789
if I can't even convince you
not to make me do it?

51
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,875
Jeff does raise a good point.

52
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,402
Wait, you are convincing!

53
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,380
You just made us change.
You could do it.

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,801
You want me to risk the C
that I'm pulling in that psycho's class

55
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,505
by putting myself on his radar?

56
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,347
That guy goes any more nuts,
he's gonna win a Grammy.

57
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:44,942
You are hilarious.

58
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,475
What is it, the chair?

59
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,487
How are you gonna keep pulling a C
in that psycho's class

60
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,272
if he keeps assigning
this much work?

61
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,607
Because I have you guys.

62
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:57,879
Well, guess what, handsome hobo.

63
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,454
Your gravy train's
leavin' the station.

64
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:06,354
Ignore what she's doing.
We are serious.

65
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,916
Fine. I'll do it.

66
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,667
But when you find my body,
don't believe the suicide note.

67
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:19,231
This better not awaken
anything in me.

68
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,169
Green Day's here.

69
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,478
- What's this about, now?
- We're Greene Daeye.

70
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,128
What do you want?

71
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,079
Here to complain about the homework
on behalf of the class?

72
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,868
Can I ask you a personal question?

73
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:47,918
Okay, Freud.

74
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,791
Sure. You try to penetrate
my psychological armor, and...

75
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,309
- Did your wife leave you?
- Holy...

76
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,845
How did you know?

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,451
Well, when you pick juries,
you learn to read the little stuff.

78
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,191
Same shirt twice in one week.

79
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:06,966
Teaching us the word "<i>esposa</i>"
means "liar".

80
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,992
The picture of you with a woman

81
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:11,810
with a post-it note dialogue balloon
above her head that says,

82
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:13,562
"Enjoy it while it lasts."

83
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,358
We met at a salsa club.

84
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,614
She loved the way I danced.

85
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,059
You know how it goes.

86
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:31,288
- Get a job...
- Stop salsa dancing. Of course I know.

87
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,630
You make no mistake about this.

88
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,626
I pleasured that woman greatly.

89
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:40,243
You look like you would have to.
I'm not surprised you said that.

90
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:47,721
I like you.

91
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:55,187
Pickled bull testicle?

92
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:58,816
Are you offering or collecting?

93
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:16,250
Troy, sing.

94
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:18,502
Assignment is to train a rat
to respond to a song.

95
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:20,853
Did you have to pick a duet?

96
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,382
He did it! Good boy, Fievel.
Commencing reward.

97
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:39,314
- I have to open the cage.
- Don't have to warn me, I'm not...

98
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,613
Fievel.

99
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:48,699
Everybody shut up!

100
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,551
I'll kick all your asses!

101
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,872
But y'all have to come up here!

102
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,042
Dude, you are gonna be fine.

103
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:00,377
You just have to move on.

104
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,624
If you hang out with me sometime,

105
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:05,016
you will see how great
single life can be.

106
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:09,065
What about tonight?

107
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:11,555
Absolutely.

108
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:13,808
Shoot.

109
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:17,061
My Spanish study group
has to get together every night now.

110
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,564
You have been really
letting us have it with this homework.

111
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,733
I really have, haven't I?

112
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:24,880
Tell you what.

113
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:27,531
For my new buddy Jeff,
essay canceled.

114
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,828
Fantastic. That is fantastic.

115
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:32,326
Everybody will be so happy.

116
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,663
I didn't say everybody.
It's for my new friend Jeff.

117
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:39,458
You're the one coming out with me.

118
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:41,335
Right.

119
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:44,949
Suppose it will put you in an unenviable
and uncomfortable position,

120
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:48,453
- and want to be...
- Here's your jacket. Let's do this.

121
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,961
Is there a rat in here?

122
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,181
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

123
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,443
Talk to Chang?

124
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:09,306
But it didn't do any good.

125
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:11,476
My head still hurts
from all the yelling.

126
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:14,701
My pupils are more sensitive to light
because he yelled at me so much.

127
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:18,997
I feel bad that we made you do that.
Maybe we can help with your essay.

128
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,265
That's okay.

129
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,167
I'm working on mine by myself.

130
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,425
You could do my homework next time.
See you in class.

131
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:28,841
He's hiding something.

132
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,619
Britta, Jeff suffered for us.
Give him a little credit.

133
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:34,367
You can be pretty cold.

134
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,392
Here comes Abed. He needs my help.
I got to get out of here.

135
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:44,457
Seen a rat? Troy knocked over
Fievel's cage and he escaped.

136
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,233
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,946
He probably found more rats
and is very happy living with them.

138
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,283
Try to join the rest of us
in reality.

139
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,820
I believe that,

140
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,469
fusing brownies with the,

141
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:03,045
internet is going to create
the next napster

142
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,215
for brownies.

143
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:07,796
Can't I write it on cards?

144
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,177
Do you know anybody
who reads from cards?

145
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,764
No, you don't, and that's why.
Also you might consider a darker top.

146
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,730
Note taken.

147
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,342
Don't lock your knees.
Never lock your knees.

148
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,217
Know what happens when you lock it?

149
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:28,342
You die.

150
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:29,292
Second,

151
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,738
when you want to drive home a point,
hand them a sandwich.

152
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,872
Try it.
Hand them a sandwich.

153
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,363
Except you just dropped
the sandwich,

154
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,710
as opposed to handing it to them.

155
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,468
And try attention-grabbing words
to wake up the audience

156
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,669
such as "multiple orgasm".

157
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,993
I don't think that would really fit
into my message.

158
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:53,018
Maybe we should focus...

159
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,196
About these filler words of yours.

160
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:59,296
I mean, nobody wants to buy brownies
from somebody who says,

161
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,094
"Um" and "Like".

162
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:04,354
I have a method for fixing that.
Start from the top.

163
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,105
These brownies are,

164
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:09,998
They...

165
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:14,001
These brownies are...

166
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:15,706
Delicious.

167
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,574
- They taste like,
- Like!

168
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:21,095
- That's not a filler word.
- Whatever, valley girl.

169
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,891
The difference between <i>usted</i>

170
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:28,293
and <i>tu</i> is a matter of formality.

171
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,132
<i>Usted es viejo.</i>

172
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,924
"You are old."

173
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,824
<i>Usted es feo.</i>

174
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:42,476
- "You are ugly."
- No, you're not, Abed.

175
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,196
<i>Y tu paco...</i>

176
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:52,966
<i>Ustedes estan sucios.</i>

177
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,904
"You are dirty."

178
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,782
- Dirty?
- Still formal, but plural.

179
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:01,175
Because, while both are dirty,

180
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:03,069
neither are my friends.

181
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:05,664
Another subject,

182
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,851
hope you're working hard
on your essays.

183
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:10,506
Because that's gonna be
30% of your grade.

184
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,173
Already turned in his essay.
Great job.

185
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,844
As soon as you turn in
your essays on monday,

186
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:21,923
there's gonna be a big-ass quiz.
So study hard.

187
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,196
Class dismissed.

188
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,779
Hey, dude.

189
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:31,898
Crazy night last night, man.

190
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,381
Hey, when you go out with me,
it gets crazy.

191
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,439
That's the Winger guarantee, huh?

192
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,594
Let's do it again.

193
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:41,491
I want to.
It's just the quiz, you know?

194
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,938
Study, study.

195
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,026
Well, how'bout this?

196
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,099
A+.

197
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,574
Nice work, Winger!

198
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:51,793
I knew I could do it
if I applied myself.

199
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:54,648
Cher... Cherry Daiquiri.

200
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,599
You devious clump of overpriced
fabric and hair product.

201
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,685
Speaking as one of the meek, as soon
as I inherit the earth, you're dead.

202
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,439
- You got a weird forehead.
- We're all very disappointed.

203
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,494
All right,
dial it back a little, Britta.

204
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,033
If anyone should be disappointed,
it's me.

205
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:20,405
What kind of a group threatens to
kick someone out unless he helps them?

206
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,742
What kind of a person is asked to help
other people and then helps himself!

207
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:28,205
Helps himself?
I don't like being talked to that way!

208
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,045
He's using fake outrage
to justify leaving.

209
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,582
Fake outrage?
Justify my...

210
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:35,253
that's it.
I'm out of here.

211
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:39,257
- You're breaking up with the group?
- That's what you guys want.

212
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,821
I've been divorced seven times.

213
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:44,711
Don't answer your phones
and bury all your money in the backyard.

214
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,128
Here you go.
Look at Pierce's paragraph from unit 2.

215
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:49,593
Let's see.

216
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:53,078
"I took a computer class
at tienda de manzana..."

217
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,440
- the Apple store. Adorable.
- Keep going.

218
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,069
"And the saleswoman had

219
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,487
"manzanas gigante".
Ruined it.

220
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:03,262
- Can you imagine being married to him?
- Seven times!

221
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:05,931
Seven different women
agreed to marry that guy.

222
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:07,438
It's cra...

223
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,042
I'm so alone.

224
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,100
I'm so lonely!

225
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,816
I want to die.

226
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:20,132
Come on man, it...
Come on, don't do that.

227
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,172
I...

228
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:26,494
just miss her so much.

229
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,811
- I'm sorry. This is so stupid.
- No, no, it's fine.

230
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,803
- It's just... You know...
- I'm dumb!

231
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:35,365
I can see that you're hurting.

232
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,065
But I have to get to accounting.

233
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,568
And it's not like I'm hitting
strip clubs with Whitman.

234
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:42,028
- You better not be!
- What?

235
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:46,406
All I ask is for you to keep
filling the void in my soul.

236
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,005
Well, I'll have to
think of something.

237
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,015
Let me rest gently on your pecs.

238
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,806
Best closer to a presentation,
a Nicholson quote.

239
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,881
You take a phrase from one of his films
and you tailor it to your product.

240
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,008
You can't handle a moist towelette!

241
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:05,794
Something like that,
But you can't use that one.

242
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,246
- That's... mine.
- Thanks, Pierce.

243
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:10,697
I'm just gonna write it
on some cards.

244
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:14,430
Just don't let anybody
know I was involved.

245
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:30,508
Why do you care so much?

246
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:33,121
- I don't.
- Because Fievel's going to die.

247
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,123
I'd rather die than listen.

248
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,541
Who's going to die?

249
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,127
The Dean says the exterminator
is coming for our rat.

250
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:41,546
I'd like to exterminate
this conversation.

251
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,006
What are you doing?

252
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:46,024
He's sitting in Jeff's chair,
so he's trying to act like him.

253
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:51,139
An email.

254
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,867
I thought you might wanna help me out
because we're friends.

255
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:56,022
Abed, take it
from a former prom king.

256
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:58,504
Real friends help me with things.

257
00:14:58,794 --> 00:14:59,801
Not vice versa.

258
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:02,331
- I would face my fears to help you.
- Exactly!

259
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,319
'cause you're my friend.

260
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,169
Am I?

261
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:16,320
he gets any nuttier,
they're gonna put him on the view.

262
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,768
- That works.
- What are we gonna do? We gonna study?

263
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:24,909
Fievel?

264
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:33,214
Thank you.

265
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,989
Green week was a rousing
success here at Greendale.

266
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,588
And now for our band, Greene Daeye!
They're not the real Green Day.

267
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,858
Thought we'd just rip
that band-aid off quickly.

268
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,116
What's up?
Just got your text.

269
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,556
Wanna hang out?

270
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,822
If you don't, I will fail you.

271
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,164
Actually, I had an idea for
an extra credit project.

272
00:15:58,502 --> 00:16:01,501
We've been asked
to dedicate our first song

273
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:05,130
to senor and senora Chang.

274
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,611
She said
she didn't wanna talk to me.

275
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,857
I didn't tell her
you wanted to talk.

276
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:17,100
Estimation of market...

277
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,572
value of... brownies

278
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:20,729
has...

279
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,759
- Target group...
- Ms. Bennett,

280
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,277
I'm afraid I have
to ask you to put down the cards.

281
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,450
they are... wonderful.

282
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,620
We all love...

283
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,203
brownies.
They are delicious.

284
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,223
If you love brownies, you love life.

285
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,513
Organismicly delicious...

286
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,719
Here's brownie!

287
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,681
It's on my leg!
It's on my leg!

288
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:36,285
Disgusting!

289
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:39,576


290
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,454
What's Chang doing?

291
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,168
He's getting a refill on his void.

292
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,476
I got an "A" on my presentation,

293
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:52,424
and a lot of the credit for Pierce.

294
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,424
And I had a great sandwich.

295
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,866
We found the rat.

296
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:58,219
- Abed's gonna shut up about it now.
- It's true.

297
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,295
I have something to say.

298
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,185
I've been a horrible husband.

299
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,395
And I've been a horrible teacher.

300
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,144
I'd like to thank
my student Jeff Winger

301
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:13,193
for showing me that
and helping me fix my marriage.

302
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:16,613
No more 20-page
essays due on monday!

303
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:18,490
- That's nice!
- Thank you.

304
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,491
Although, Winger

305
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:23,091
you should write
a one-page essay called

306
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:26,333
taking advantage
of the emotionally-vulnerable.

307
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,337
You did that for us?

308
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:35,254
Kinda.

309
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:41,136
I thought hanging out with you
was the worst way to pass spanish.

310
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,598
- I was wrong.
- We're the best.

311
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:46,931
I'm sorry I called
you a handsome hobo.

312
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:48,846
If you need help with that essay,

313
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:50,480
you can rejoin the group.

314
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,859
What are you guys talking to me for?
You go dance!

315
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:02,363
I know your secret.

316
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,577
I know about the chair.

317
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,080
What model did you get?

318
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,109
It's the Tsunami 3000
anniversary edition.

319
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,856
- You?
- The devil's drench XJ-11.

320
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:26,084
This is awesome.

321
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:28,544
We should establish base camps.
What part do you want?

322
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:30,137
I'll take the northeast,

323
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,413
- it's closest to fountain...
- Are we gonna do this thing?

324
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:38,675
I hope that's the tiny gun
that you throw at us to confuse us

325
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,210
while you grab giant gun
that's duct-taped to your back.

326
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:43,585
Seriously,
this hardly seems like a fair fight.

327
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,611
It's pepper water!

328
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:49,780
It's pep...
Who puts pepper in water?
