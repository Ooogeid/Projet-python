1
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:06,505
Whatcha gonna knitta?

2
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:08,627
Good mood, bad rhyme,

3
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,862
and is that a carb on your plate?

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,831
I got a "b" on my nutrition final,

5
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:16,098
and I am celebrating with pie
and a dollop of whipped irony.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,788
Nice. I'm knitting something
for my new cat.

7
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:20,839
It's been 2 weeks
since I lost Suzie B.,

8
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:22,374
so it's time to move on.

9
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:24,943
Not being an animal lover,
I assume it'll be nice

10
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:27,443
- to start over with a fresh kitten.
- Fresh kitten?

11
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,813
I go to a shelter

12
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:31,849
and rescue an animal
that genuinely needs my help.

13
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:36,035
Why do you think
I'm knitting a tiny, little eye patch?

14
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:37,555
Excuse me.

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,227
We're in high school, but we're taking
some classes for college credit.

16
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,262
All right. Way to be go-getters.

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,460
Thanks.

18
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,499
So we were wondering...

19
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:49,468
Can you tell us what you did
in your lives to end up here

20
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:52,134
so that we don't make
the same mistakes?

21
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,054
Because if I end up 35,

22
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:57,021
celebrating a "b"

23
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:59,396
in nutrition in community college,

24
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,227
I'll kill myself.

25
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:03,135
Watch it.

26
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,152
- Watch it.
- Or what, Schmitty?

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,442
Schmitty!

28
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,657
You'll knit me something sad in your
house full of cats without furniture?

29
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:14,288
Listen, it is a studio apartment,

30
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:15,727
and knitting is hip.

31
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:18,030
Winona Ryder knits.

32
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:20,273
Who?

33
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,295
I have done things with my life.
Awesome things.

34
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,005
I've been to 14 countries.

35
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,478
I helped build a school in Kenya.

36
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,759
I once met Sting
at a cracker barrel.

37
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,762
Why are you letting
some teens get to you?

38
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:40,141
I don't even remember what they said.
It rolled off my back...

39
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,445
Would you stop tuning that guitar?

40
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,456
You are 105 years old!

41
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:47,426
Tell me exactly what you did
with your life to end up here

42
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,274
so I don't make the same mistakes!

43
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:52,995
Excuse me!

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,126
But it's springtime,
and I thought I might woo a few chicks.

45
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,478
<i>No one to watch while we're kissing</i>

46
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,691
<i>No one to see while we spoon</i>

47
00:02:07,592 --> 00:02:10,143
<i>Let's take a trip in my airship</i>

48
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,524
<i>And we'll visit the man in the moon</i>

49
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,646
What the...

50
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,928
Hey! What?

51
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,820
What the hell?

52
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,090
Sorry.

53
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:29,774
<i>Animal house.</i>
A reference my ears applaud.

54
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,927
I couldn't resist.
Smashing the guitar of someone

55
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,820
singing a cloying love song
was on my college experience list.

56
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,156
- Your what?
- A list

57
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,408
of all that movies have taught me
contain a successful 1e year at college.

58
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,327
Bond with a group
of loveable misfits.

59
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:43,537
- Check.
- Take on the school bully.

60
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:45,831
Make out with the hottest girl
on campus.

61
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,240
Check-a-rooni.

62
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,045
Unfortunately, the year's over,

63
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,483
- and there's stuffs left.
- I'll help you finish.

64
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:56,091
- I'll be your Morgan Freeman.
- Like in <i>The Bucket List.</i>

65
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,092
The what?

66
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,484
Stand up for a second.

67
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:01,978
Over here.

68
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:03,999
Stand there.

69
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,101
Turn around.

70
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,983
- What the hell?
- Pantsing someone was on my list.

71
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,445
It would have been better if you had
hearts on underwear, but I'll take it.

72
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:20,288
I hope getting pantsed
is on your list.

73
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:23,693
It is.

74
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:28,899
What's so funny?

75
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,219
This!

76
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,388
Get it?

77
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,987
- Feygnasse Team -

78
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,731
.:: La Fabrique ::.

79
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:49,852
1x22: The Art of Discourse

80
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:58,946
Finally.

81
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,740
Shirley is too angry
to talk to you right now.

82
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,920
You'll have to apologize later.

83
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,689
Apologize? For what?
She should apologize to me.

84
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,293
She ruined my joke.

85
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,174
Oh, my God.

86
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,464
There's a grandpa schlip-schlap.

87
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:19,758
<i>Have you seen my schmitty, Sonny?</i>

88
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,596
- <i>Help me. I'm gonna crap my pants.
- Someone help me.</i>

89
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,724
Seriously, nutrition,
this is your life?

90
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,684
Actually, I was a lawyer.

91
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,144
Looks like that went well.

92
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,462
And now you hang out
with schlip-schlap and schlap.

93
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,026
Oh, my God,
is she wearing a discman?

94
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:43,598
- How could you do this to me?
- What? Discmans are retro.

95
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,042
Is retro when you're 30 and broke

96
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:49,298
and can't afford an ipod, schmitty?

97
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:51,123
Bug-a-bah.

98
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,481
I think schmitty means loser.

99
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:56,606
We know!

100
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,299
You may come back in now.
I have something to say.

101
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,617
This better be a good apology.

102
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:05,679
This has been a long time coming,
and we have joked around

103
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,849
and rolled our eyes at him, but
there has been a transgression today,

104
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,353
and I will no longer continue
to be a part of the group with this man.

105
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,104
Just skip to the "I'm sorry."

106
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:16,732
You're pathological,
and you'll never change.

107
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:20,037
That is the pot
calling the kettle...

108
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:21,353
A kettle.

109
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,180
You can say black.
I'm a black woman.

110
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,658
The cat is out the bag.

111
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,161
You have literally identified me
to strangers as "the black woman."

112
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,663
Out of context.

113
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,388
Context is everything.

114
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:36,251
I call the other women "flat-butt"
and "the one Abed wants to nail."

115
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:42,967
So what's the context for constantly
referring to me as a lesbian?

116
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:46,887
If the wallet chain fits. I'm trying
to help you find yourself.

117
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,752
At least he doesn't think
that Shirley's my mom anymore.

118
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:52,184
- He thinks that we're cousins.
- You're not?

119
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,853
- He still assumes I'm a terrorist.
- If you're not, sorry.

120
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:58,189
And if you are, I'm a hero.
I'm willing to take that chance.

121
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,234
You said I have a crafty, jew brain.

122
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,486
Nobody knows how to take
a compliment anymore.

123
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:05,322
Either he leaves the group, or I do.

124
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:10,082
You just dug your own grave.

125
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:25,884
What's up?

126
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,429
- They kicked me out of the group.
- Damn.

127
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,280
Want to buy some cookies?

128
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:31,705
Ten bucks a box.

129
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,562
Have you seen a chinese kid?

130
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Twerps.

131
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,168
How's it going?

132
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,545
- Unrepentant child.
- Such a child.

133
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,540
Here comes Stinkyfa.

134
00:06:56,824 --> 00:06:58,542
Remember,
we don't stop till he's crying.

135
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:00,586
Check out Franken-mom.

136
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,755
Use that.
No wedding ring.

137
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,285
He's a child of divorce.

138
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,308
We can make fun of him
for coming from a broken home.

139
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:10,095
I don't care if this gets dirty.
He asked for it.

140
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:12,223
You're right.

141
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,681
Get ready to meet Jeff Winger,
esquire,

142
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,685
attorney at "ah, snap."

143
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,229
It'll be better than that.

144
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,483
Clearasil,

145
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,934
what time
your mommy's picking you up?

146
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:27,071
After she's done shooting
<i>The Real Housewives of Greendale County?</i>

147
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,575
<i>After she's done shooting
The Real Housewives of Greendale County?</i>

148
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,203
That's a clever retort.

149
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,871
<i>That's a clever retort.</i> Duh.

150
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,290
- Brilliant.
- <i>Brilliant.</i> Duh.

151
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,058
- Your parents are divorced.
- <i>Your parents are divorced.</i>

152
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:46,992
Schmitty.

153
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,302
- Forget it. Come on.
- Come on. Forget that...

154
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:54,695
- Where you going, Schmitty?
- I'm sorry, little schmitty.

155
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,275
- Mimicry is the lowest form...
- Stop talking.

156
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:01,139
Stop talking. Duh!

157
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,050
What is that?

158
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,737
Billy. City college's mascot.

159
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,198
Stealing a rival school's
mascot was on Abed's list.

160
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,151
Check.

161
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:15,240
Bringing a goat to our study group...
Great idea, Troy.

162
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:17,371
Thanks. Must have been hard
for you to say that.

163
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,039
It's called sarcasm.

164
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:21,166
Ask the goat to explain it to you.

165
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,241
- Why do I feel like I'm being dissed?
- Because you are.

166
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,966
- Why are you two dissing Troy?
- Because they no longer have Pierce.

167
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:32,499
- What?
- Pierce's recognized social flaws

168
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:34,648
made him the scapegoat,
a lightning rod.

169
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:36,306
He's gone, lightning is everywhere.

170
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,715
That sounds dangerous.
My uncle was struck by lightning.

171
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:42,312
You think it'd give you superpowers,
but now he masturbates in theaters.

172
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:44,777
It's very dangerous.
We've lost our Cliff Clavin.

173
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:47,052
Our George Costanza.
Our Turtle.

174
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,192
Or Johnny Drama.
Or E.

175
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,072
- That show is sloppy.
- So what's gonna happen?

176
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,117
It's only a matter of time
before one of us takes Pierce's place.

177
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,828
I sure as hell am not gonna be
the new Pierce.

178
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:02,966
And if all we need
is an escape-goat,

179
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,836
I think we should let this one go.

180
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,880
Sometimes
you've got to be pretending.

181
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:10,174
- Maybe the new Pierce is Britta.
- Right.

182
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,967
How do you pronounce bagel again?

183
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,095
- Bah-gel.
- She calls bagels bah-gels.

184
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,431
We do make fun of a lot
of what you do and say.

185
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,374
Yeah. Right to my face,

186
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:22,102
'cause I can take it,
unlike a certain someone else.

187
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,039
Come on,
let's not make fun of Annie.

188
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,220
I don't want anybody's pity.

189
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:32,715
Come to think of it, after Pierce,
you're the most bigoted.

190
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,644
What?

191
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,115
When you found out I was jewish,
you invited me to a pool party

192
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,369
- that turned out to be a baptism.
- Sorry for trying

193
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,786
to sneak you into heaven.

194
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,872
What about Abed?
Abed's weird.

195
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,877
- It's not Abed.
- He's all right. We like Abed.

196
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:51,089
Have you considered
the new Pierce concept is stupid?

197
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,759
Spoken like the new Pierce.

198
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,178
- You're right.
- I am not the new Pierce.

199
00:09:57,378 --> 00:09:59,450
- You said the world wide web.
- Damn the old Pierce.

200
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:01,025
He makes me so mad.

201
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,912
- Don't double Pierce me.
- And you're the triple Pierce.

202
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:08,438
I can't believe
I'm gonna utter these words,

203
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,567
but we need Pierce in this group.

204
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,820
We can't ask Shirley to let him back in.
That would be so insensitive.

205
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,700
Maybe he'll admit he's wrong...

206
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,317
two, three, four.

207
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:19,817
Not!

208
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,208
We need Pierce.

209
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,877
Just stick to the script
and make it sincere.

210
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,583
It's not gonna be sincere
'cause I'm pretending to apologize.

211
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,132
You're not getting back
unless she thinks you're sincere.

212
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:35,884
Stubborn fool.

213
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:37,845
Can we hurry this up?

214
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:41,193
We're in a cool fraternity, unbeknownst
to us but we're the target of ridicule,

215
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:43,077
and don't have a chance
of getting in.

216
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:45,628
They're making us walk around
with pretzels in our butts.

217
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:47,562
I put mustard on mine like an idiot.

218
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:51,265
You can do this.

219
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:13,101
I know you don't want to hear
what I have to say,

220
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,881
but I owe you this.

221
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,237
At the moment we first met,
I knew you were gonna be...

222
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:18,362
Seriously!

223
00:11:24,846 --> 00:11:26,335
You are unbelievable!

224
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,655
I'm not wearing my contacts.
These are mine.

225
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,065
I'm a bag guy.
You even have the same bag, I thought...

226
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,859
Yes, nothing is ever your fault.

227
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,737
Screw you. I don't even owe you
an apology. They wrote this.

228
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:43,160
Just pretend like you asleep.
Pretend like you asleep.

229
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:47,678
Now I fully understand
where I have always stood.

230
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,001
I'm entitled to my pride until it gets
in the way of what you guys want.

231
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,807
Got nothing to say?

232
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:55,272
Well, I do.

233
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,591
- I'm out of the group.
- What?

234
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,768
Sassy,
black Schmitty's out of the group.

235
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:05,724
Not the group.

236
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,142
Sad, little Schmitties.

237
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,895
Can't all of us little Schmitties
get along?

238
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,108
Who was that?

239
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,511
A punk-ass
who needs to be destroyed.

240
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,196
And I just figured out how.

241
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:23,158
Can we focus on what's important here?
Shirley thinks we don't care about her.

242
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:24,929
No, you're right.

243
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,093
That's totally more important.
I just thought of one thing.

244
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:30,108
You need to bang that kid's mom.

245
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:32,886
After we fix everything
with Shirley.

246
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,258
Yes, we'll deal with Shirley,
but that's brilliant!

247
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:38,707
I know. Because then anything
that he says about you.

248
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:40,842
He'll be saying to a dude
that banged his mom!

249
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,344
Oh, my God, you guys.

250
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:43,781
Sorry. Shirley.

251
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,202
Bye, everybody.

252
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,725
Have a great day.

253
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,123
Be right here at 3:00, please.
I'm in a hurry.

254
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:15,794
Excuse me.

255
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,838
Sorry to bother you.

256
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,674
You don't happen to have an extra bottle
of sports drink?

257
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,169
Actually, I do.

258
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,868
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

259
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,512
Gotta hydrate, right?

260
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,722
But obviously you know.
You work out.

261
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,308
I try to keep things
where they should be.

262
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,644
I think I might be
where should I be.

263
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:38,984
I don't know about your robot, Abed.

264
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,274
Boobatron's great.

265
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,252
And once someone spills bong water
on his circuitry and he comes alive,

266
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:45,657
He's go make us the coolest guys
and help us get babes.

267
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,189
Those are real babes.

268
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:49,244
Who will really laugh at us.

269
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:51,246
Hey.
You're my friend, right?

270
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:54,749
Friends are supposed to help each other,
no matter what!

271
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,740
Ridiculous situation descending
into heavy-handed drama

272
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:03,300
for the illusion of story.
Check.

273
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,387
That was awesome.

274
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:08,805
I am back in.

275
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,833
All right, here we go.

276
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:18,612
Just so you know, I'm Shirley.

277
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,788
Wouldn't want you reaching for me
should you get a hankering for pancakes.

278
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:25,913
I'm old, and I do not see well.

279
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:28,309
- You already won, so shut it.
- I won?

280
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,453
They want you in the group, and I quit,
so you go ahead and hang with them.

281
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,615
No, thanks.

282
00:14:33,412 --> 00:14:35,081
I'm sick of the way he's treats me.

283
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,948
- Preaching to the choir.
- Tell you what I'm not gonna miss.

284
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:40,045
Abed and Troy's silly little games.

285
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:41,796
Grow up, already.

286
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:45,425
- And, thanks for including me.
- Please, you think Annie and Britta

287
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,802
invite me when they take those
weekend trips to the mall?

288
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,180
They just think of me
as some sort of mom.

289
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,370
They both need to learn some manners,
and, Annie needs to stop dating Vaughn.

290
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:55,894
He is not the boy
I envisioned her ending up with.

291
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,436
No matter how hard you try,

292
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,648
you can never be as cool
or funny as they are.

293
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,499
It's called respect,
and no one ever gave me diddly.

294
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:04,573
Except me.

295
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,781
I respect you more than anyone else
in the group.

296
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:09,824
Is why you pantsed me?

297
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:11,879
Well, but, you see,

298
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:13,453
that wasn't wrong.

299
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:16,540
For heaven's sakes, you are such
a arrogant, self-righteous ass.

300
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,650
And you are a strong,
dignified woman who's raising a family,

301
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:23,134
a bigger accomplishment
than anybody else in that room.

302
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,642
And nobody can ever strip you of that,
not even me.

303
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:27,926
You believe that?

304
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:31,429
That's why you think
pantsing me wasn't wrong?

305
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:32,650
It wasn't.

306
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:44,317
What are you doing?

307
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,819
Did I misread that?

308
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,449
Oh, here, let me just do that.

309
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,429
You sure you don't want some vodka?

310
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,597
I'm good.

311
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,167
I'm at school.

312
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,497
At 2:00 P.M.

313
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,624
Did someone just take a Schmitty?

314
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:04,087
Looks like you'll be
calling somebody daddy soon.

315
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,679
Or at least your mom will be

316
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,015
tonight.

317
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,102
Dude, you are so pathetic.

318
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,868
I've been powning this loser
all week,

319
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:23,940
he thinks that he can get back
at me through you.

320
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,650
What? Powning?

321
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,776
Powning.

322
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:29,188
Do you even know what it means?

323
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,110
I see what's going on here.

324
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,489
I don't want to come between a son

325
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:36,286
And his beautiful, vivacious mom.

326
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:38,955
Oh, my God, you are pathetic.

327
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:41,166
Yes. The dumb whore who's in on it.

328
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,127
I gotta tell you,

329
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:47,297
you have raised
a terrible human being.

330
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,029
- We're better than this.
- No, you're not!

331
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:52,529
I raised a winner

332
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:56,640
who will continue to crush
Junior college losers like you.

333
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:02,318
I'm sorry.
This is a matter of pride.

334
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,623
- What are you looking at?
- "What are you looking at?"

335
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:15,865
"What are you looking at?

336
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,121
School his ass, Mark.

337
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,860
"School his ass, Mark."

338
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,398
Why are he's making fun
of those handicapped kids?

339
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,942
They don't even realize
how much they need us.

340
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,674
Why are they doing this?

341
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,240
Have you've noticed, he's have
the two most fragile egos of the group.

342
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,901
These kids
will pretty much destroy them.

343
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,484
What the hell?

344
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,571
- You didn't say "duh"!
- We win.

345
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,948
You're the Schmitties.

346
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:40,452
No, we're minors.
I'm calling the cops.

347
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:41,925
No, you're not.

348
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:45,123
You have already embarrassed me
by getting powned.

349
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:46,666
Don't be such a girl.

350
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:50,086
- See that.
- Suck it!

351
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:51,463
Schmitty face!

352
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,214
We showed you, high schoolers!

353
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,183
Suck it!

354
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:57,218
Congratulations on your victory.

355
00:18:58,062 --> 00:19:00,030
- Thank you, Annie.
- Yeah, thank you.

356
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:01,723
And thanks, you guys.

357
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:02,691
Any time.

358
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,468
Pierce and I are considering
rejoining the group,

359
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:08,271
and maybe we can all be
a little more mature.

360
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:09,664
I hear that.

361
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,608
Abed, I've had enough of this list.

362
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:13,818
Doing this stuff isn't fun.
It feels forced.

363
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,308
Fine.
I'll deactivate boobatron.

364
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:19,157
Trust me, classic college experiences
never happen organically.

00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:28,120
Are you sure

375
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,776
it's the name of my grade school
and my favorite soft drink?

376
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:34,151
- Pretty sure.
- George Washington lemon fresca.

377
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:37,235
- That's a horrible porn name.
- I don't make the rules.

378
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,620
- What's yours?
- Henry David Thoreau diet squirt.

379
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:40,808
That's good.

380
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:44,409
Hello, Henry David Thoreau diet squirt.
How many pornos have you been in?

381
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:48,162
6,012. How many pornos have you been in,
George Washington lemon fresca?

382
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:50,123
2,019.
It's my first week.

383
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:51,935
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

384
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,201
You're welcome.

385
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,380
Someone here order a pizza?

386
00:20:58,896 --> 00:20:59,883
Is it you guys?

387
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:01,467
It has extra sausage.

388
00:21:03,724 --> 00:21:05,974
- It's big and hot.
- That's my pizza.

389
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:09,337
But you took longer than 30 minutes,
so I'm not paying.
