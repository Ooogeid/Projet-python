1
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:02,765
<i>Happy last day before winter break,
Greendale!</i>

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,453
<i>Time to visit our loved ones.</i>

3
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:07,048
<i>Some of you will travel
as far as three miles!</i>

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,094
<i>Don't forget to visit
our winter wonderland in the quad</i>

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,869
<i>where we're giving away
catalogues of next semester's classes.</i>

6
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:19,142
<i>What's that sound?</i>

7
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:22,800
<i>Is that the tippy-tapping
of secular boots on the roof?</i>

8
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:27,151
It must be yet another sign

9
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,333
that it is the season,

10
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,388

because rumor has it

11
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:34,666
that non-denominational Mr. Winter

12
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,091
is on his way to the student lounge!

13
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,749
I'm so sick of the Dean
jamming his PC-ness down my throat.

14
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:45,127
Pierce, I'd like to commend you
for letting that one go.

15
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,628
"PC-ness".

16
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:48,284
Now I get it.

17
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,341
It sounds like "penis".
I just got it too.

18
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:54,578
It's still Christmas to all of us,
and I made you all a little gift,

19
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:56,263
because you're like my new family.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,099
"WWBJD"?

21
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,163
If this stands
for "What Would Billy Joel Do",

22
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:03,649
I'll tell you right now...
He'd write another crappy song.

23
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:05,824
Yeah, in your face, Billy Joel.

24
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,733
"What Would Baby Jesus Do?"

25
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:11,862
It's to remind us that the real meaning
of this season is Christmas.

26
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:17,414
Thank you. I'm gonna put that
in the pocket closest to my heart.

27
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,079
No, it's a bracelet. You put 'em on.

28
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:22,373
Everybody put 'em on.

29
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,945
You took all the winter-doodles.

30
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,179
What are you, a douche bag?

31
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,266
There's a lot of other cookies left.

32
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:43,269
There's macadamia nut cookies there.
I have a tree-nut allergy.

33
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,006
Stay away
from Christmas-tree-shaped cookies.

34
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,107
That did not make allergic sense.
You an idiot?

35
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:53,264
We get it.
You and the A-Team are awesome.

36
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:55,244
- Now beat it.
- Look at that.

37
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,700
Pretty boy standing up
for bird face over here.

38
00:01:57,973 --> 00:01:59,673
Give me a winter-doodle.

39
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:02,621
If you're trying to be menacing,
don't call the cookie by its name.

40
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,083
You're funny.
You're a funny man.

41
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:07,585
Wanna hear something funny?

42
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,983
Knock, knock.

43
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:10,713
My fist up your balls!

44
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:12,715
Who's there?

45
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:17,515
Merry happy!

46
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:19,930
This ain't over.

47
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,560
There won't always be a Dean around.
All right?

48
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,855
Still waiting on those cookies.

49
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:56,967
Jeff protected my honor.
Like my bodyguard,

50
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,762
I was the kid from <i>Meatballs</i>,
Jeff the guy from <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>,

51
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,181
and the moustache guy
was the brother on <i>Entourage</i>.

52
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,704
- Thanks for dumbing that down for us.
- You got it.

53
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,229
So what's the deal?
Leave your stones in your other suit?

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,428
- Why didn't you rap him in the face?
- For the same reason that I floss,

55
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:13,452
have a bed frame,
keep my guitar in its case...

56
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:14,443
I'm over 23.

57
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,361
I'm proud of you
for handling it peacefully,

58
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,310
like a certain little birthday boy.

59
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,077
Real men turn the other cheek.

60
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,454
- Let's see 'em.
- Nonsense.

61
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,833
Men were wired to fight each other
so women could choose the right mate.

62
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,628
The real reason men fight
is to release their pent-up gayness.

63
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,547
He wasn't gay.
He had a moustache.

64
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,433
You know what I have?
Finals.

65
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:38,203
Are we cramming for Spanish or not?

66
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:40,469
I need a 65,
or I'm gonna flunk the class.

67
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:45,006
Why didn't you do extra-credit tasks
if you knew that you were...

68
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:45,933
failing?

69
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,401
Doing more than the minimum work
is my definition of...

70
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:52,014
- failing.
- Quick question...

71
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,530
You all coming to my Christmas party
right after the final,

72
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:57,361
or are you stopping home
to change into your Christmas outfits?

73
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,564
I could wear
one of my Hanukah sweaters.

74
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,581
I didn't know you weren't Christian.

75
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,418
One might even say I'm Jewish.

76
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:15,077
That's good for you.
That's wonderful.

77
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:17,882
- I respect all religions of the world.
- I'm Muslim.

78
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,466
- Jehovah's witness.
- Atheist.

79
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:23,200
- The lord is testing me.
- It is a subject that breeds conflicts.

80
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:24,513
Can we please do...

81
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,232
- What religion are you?
- I'm agnostic.

82
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,728
Agnostic... Lazy man's atheist.

83
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,439
I'm born-again.

84
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:36,577
We had a re-birthing ritual
in my friend's hot tub.

85
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:40,487
I'm now a level-five laser lotus
in my Buddhist community.

86
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,699
That does not sound like Buddhism.
Are you sure you're not in a cult?

87
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,989
Just by asking me that question,

88
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:48,203
you've put me back down
to a level four.

89
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,831
You now owe me 2,000 energon cubes.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,262
Do you know
how foolish you sound right now?

91
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:55,630
What else do you believe in,
blood transfusions?

92
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,855
Jehovah's witnesses
are a type of christian, right?

93
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,788
But we don't celebrate
birthdays or Christmas.

94
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:03,363
And we can't drink.

95
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,638
- But it helps.
- So you're like a muslim.

96
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,014
Don't we have
a diverse little family.

97
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,952
I say we open up this party
to all faiths.

98
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:14,854
I brought my star of Bethlehem,

99
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,828
which led the wise men
to the savior of all mankind.

100
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:21,871
And you guys can bring a little trinket
or doodad from your philosophies.

101
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:22,905
Sounds good?

102
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:26,074
As an agnostic,
I'm gonna bring my winning smile.

103
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,190
So boring.

104
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,007
Done.

105
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:53,762
"True or <i>falso</i>
or none of the above"?

106
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,521
That doesn't make any sense.

107
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,310
Look at that.

108
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:04,238
- Forehead's taking a test.
- Get going, Chuck Norris.

109
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:08,617
- Did you just shoo me?
- Why don't you just kiss him already?

110
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,203
Dude, I will shoo your nose
down your throat!

111
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,080
Can you do something about this?

112
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:15,626
I'll allow it.

113
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,951
<i>Qué pasa</i> here, huh?

114
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,881
It's <i>usted</i>, dude. Even I know that.

115
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:28,841
You picked the wrong day
to correct my Spanish, no sleeves.

116
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,974
- It's on!
- He's my bodyguard.

117
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,934
- Wanna dance?
- Maybe to some show tunes?

118
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,371
I wanna beat the crap out of you.
I'm gonna enjoy it.

119
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,909
You're like this school.

120
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:41,150
Obnoxious, cramping my style.
You smell like french-fry oil.

121
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,860
I don't get it!

122
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:46,155
3:00! Bike rack!
But not the one by the parking lot!

123
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:49,533
The one by the trash cans
where they building the wheelchair ramp!

124
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,486
Best exam ever.

125
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,610
So help me
if that jerk-weed made me fail.

126
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:04,111
Well, I aced it, <i>amigo</i>.
That means "cousin. "

127
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:05,734
What's my role in the fight?

128
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,427
Is there a key moment
where I finally stand up for myself?

129
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:11,752
- Maybe you should just hang back.
- I will.

130
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:12,848
In his face!

131
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,342
Whatever you do,
don't tell Shirley about the fight.

132
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,609
She'll start in with all her mother-y,
guilt-inducing powers.

133
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,071
You know what I mean?

134
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet
'cause it gets me chicks.

135
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:24,548
I know guys like this Mike.

136
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:26,487
Used to be a nerd. Now, a meathead.

137
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:27,863
Dangerous combo.

138
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:31,200
Tyson, Lou Ferrigno,
Rosie O'Donnell.

139
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,660
You're a pretty big dude.
Probably got some moves.

140
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:35,694
I got some...

141
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,373
- theories.
- Never fought?

142
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:38,795
Technically, no.

143
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,959
I'm too charming and likable.
Call me a name.

144
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,295
I can't.

145
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,757
Are you telling me
you never been punched in the face?

146
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,343
This is the moneymaker.

147
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,673
First time I got punched in the face,
I was like, "Oh, no!"

148
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:55,298
But then I was like,
"This is a story."

149
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:58,118
A good one.

150
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,979
Every man should be punched in the face.
It's a rite of passage.

151
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:04,765
In my day, Friday night
was smoke a doobie, feel up a gal,

152
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,483
and then get your teeth knocked out
by a Republican.

153
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:10,280
The plan here isn't for me to get hit.
It's for me to hit him.

154
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:11,657
It's settled.

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,858
We have to teach Jeffrey
how to fight.

156
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:15,421
I know a few moves.

157
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,371
I assume you're handy
with a switchblade.

158
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:21,375
Abed, you get back to the family tent,
try to find a chicken for Jeff to chase.

159
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,672
I appreciate the enthusiasm,
but I think I got this.

160
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:28,757
Look who it is.

161
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,826
We got forehead, old head,
dumb head, and...

162
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:33,642
The other head.

163
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,113
See you at 3:00, forehead.

164
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:38,183
A snowman!

165
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:42,223
See this, funny guy?

166
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,114
- Classic Rosie.
- Fight lessons in a half an hour?

167
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,075
Good plan.

168
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,465
Is this your Hanukkah holder?

169
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:11,596
It's pretty.

170
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:14,344
We'll just...
Let's just put it...

171
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,221
There we go. That's nice.

172
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:21,185
I can't believe
I never knew you were a Jew.

173
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,646
I'd say the whole word next time.

174
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:30,611
So do you think
everyone will start arriving soon?

175
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:32,488
After Jeff's fight.

176
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:34,448
After what?

177
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,075
Jeff wants to fight that bully.

178
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:38,994
On Christmas?

179
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,663
Will you excuse me for a moment?

180
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,795
And can you finish the manger scene?

181
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,879
We know you were one of us.

182
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,303
'Sup? 'Sup?

183
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,948
- 'Sup!
- No, it's a question.

184
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,928
Not a real question, a rhetorical one.
You have the answer. He does not.

185
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:07,351
Then you give him
the Forest Whitaker eye.

186
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:08,915
That's pretty good.

187
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,880
Hold that stare.
There you go. Hold it.

188
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,155
Then you look straight through
his eyes and deep into his soul.

189
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,780
And then you move to Vermont.

190
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:19,243
I am sick and tired of you
saying that fighting is gay!

191
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,912
She got a point. In boxing,
you fight for the purse and the belt.

192
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:24,615
- I've gotta write a paper about that.
- I've seen enough.

193
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,417
Let's see what we're working with.
Go ahead, throw a few at the old paws.

194
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,349
What are you,
a north Korean seamstress?

195
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:35,001
- Not if that's bad.
- Get mad! Come on!

196
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:37,380
If it helps,
think of me as somebody who annoys you.

197
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,216
That's it!
That's...

198
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,577
that's good.
Britta, put your blouse back on.

199
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:47,078
this is not a game.
You gotta be ready for anything.

200
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:49,064
Dude, that is not cool!

201
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,774
Black girl thinks it is.

202
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,945
- What you doing?
- Why does she have to be black?

203
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,655
What is going on?

204
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,436
We're trying to get jeff ready
for the fiiiii...

205
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:01,836
iiight.

206
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:06,971
- I couldn't think of another word.
- Idiot.

207
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,084
He meant we were figh...

208
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:13,297
ting.
It is hard to think of another word.

209
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,621
There's no other way to me
to take this

210
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,941
than as a giant middle finger
to this day.

211
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,133
- December 10th?
- It's our Christmas,

212
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:21,879
and I'm having a party.

213
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:24,391
Due to my divorce
and my relatives picking sides,

214
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,074
this will be the only Christmas
party I throw this year.

215
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:28,604
Will you be there,

216
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:32,274
or will I have another
family letting me down?

217
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,891
I told him not to fight.

218
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:35,766
He wouldn't listen.

219
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,572
I don't know what that is.

220
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:45,787
I have two boys.

221
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:48,717
And when we have a serious discussion,
I find that a...

222
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,380
brownie helps them to relax.

223
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:54,671
Why do you hate me and Jesus?

224
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,377
I think my brownie's working.

225
00:11:57,502 --> 00:12:00,594
Please don't do something
so ugly on a day so important to me.

226
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:02,554
Again, it's december 10th.

227
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,057
You think religion is stupid?

228
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:08,259
No, to me,
religion is like Paul Rudd.

229
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:11,106
I see the appeal, and I would
never take it away from anyone.

230
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,213
But I would also never
stand in line for it.

231
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:14,490
And look, Shirley,

232
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,713
the die has been cast with this
crazy bully guy. He picked on Abed,

233
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,387
and he corrected my Spanish.

234
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:22,369
So you go to your party,
and I'll see you soon.

235
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,202
I forbid you from fighting.

236
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:28,538
You don't get to.
You're not my mom.

237
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,650
You're right.

238
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:33,177
But if you show up for the fight,
don't show up for my party.

239
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,672
- Come on, Shirley, don't be mad.
- I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.

240
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,513
That's "mom" for mad.

241
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,170
Hash browns and applesauce...
that's nice.

242
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:51,182
what is that interesting smell?

243
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:53,174
It's a traditional muslim dish.

244
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:55,120
It looks delicious.

245
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:57,827
I'm guessing as a woman
I won't be allowed to eat that.

246
00:12:57,952 --> 00:12:59,186
That's too bad.

247
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:03,356
Look, Britta brought
what she believes in...

248
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:04,491
nothing.

249
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,635
Where should I put
my buddha incense holder?

250
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,381
I'm pretty sure that's a bong.

251
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,889
Where's Jeff?

252
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,544
I guess he made his choice.

253
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:18,540
- I want to go to Jeff's fight.
- As I told Jeff,

254
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,675
no one that goes to the fight can
come to my party. He's dead to me.

255
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,201
And if any of you leave,
you'll be dead to me too.

256
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:26,690
Let's sing.

257
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,245
<i>Jesus is a friend of mine</i>

258
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,440
Everybody!

259
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,568
Come on, everybody.
You don't know it?

260
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:41,497
You're banning Jeff from the party?
That doesn't seem very christian.

261
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,067
Well, that's an

262
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:46,032
interesting point of view
coming from an atheist.

263
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:48,632
I did my best to create a

264
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:51,092
special christmas for my one

265
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:52,744
intact family, and...

266
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:55,459
this is the thanks I get.

267
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:58,018
Shirley, you are a guilt machine.

268
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,330
And Annie knows a thing
or two about guilt.

269
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:01,760
Am I right, jew?

270
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,383
Say the whole word!

271
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:05,260
Jewie?

272
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:09,389
You would never catch a jehovah's
witness saying "jewie. "

273
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:11,391
Tell it to the birthday
cake you never got.

274
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:14,085
There's an old buddhist
saying in my vision group.

275
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,229
You're not a buddhist.
You're in a cult.

276
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,447
- Suck it, Nietzsche!
- Guys,

277
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,234
everyone's faith is weird.
Let's just not talk about it.

278
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:34,194
Are we really gonna let
religion divide us like this?

279
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,333
I think there's one thing
we can all agree on.

280
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,234
I get 72 virgins in heaven.

281
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,671
That we would all like to
have Jeff at this party.

282
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,882
He can't come.

283
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,594
Listen.
I get that this is your first christmas

284
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,930
since your husband left you,
and I don't know,

285
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:52,819
maybe that's why you're being
so stubborn, because you're

286
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:54,768
trying so hard to
re-create something

287
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,986
that you're afraid
that you've lost forever.

288
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,690
If you really want us to
be your second family,

289
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,943
then you've gotta start
treating us like one,

290
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:05,575
Even if that means supporting us

291
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,031
when we do things
that you don't agree with.

292
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:09,952
You can start

293
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:12,405
by rooting for Jeff
while he rolls around

294
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,830
on the ground groping another man.

295
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,083
That's what I'll do.

296
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,390
The cranberry sauce
has real cranberries.

297
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,219
If this dude doesn't show up,
we're definitely going to Applebee's.

298
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:40,544
'Cause I'm getting into a fight
no matter what today, dude.

299
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:43,483
Look who showed.

300
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:45,261
Check him out.

301
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,872
What's up, dude?

302
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,867
No backup today?

303
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,952
Looks like grandpa couldn't show up
to get their teeth knocked out.

304
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:55,650
Can I ask you a question?

305
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,664
Are you perpetually
on your way to the gym?

306
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:59,332
Dude, my life is a gym!

307
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,025
- Well, 'sup?
- 'Sup, man?

308
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,054
What is that?
All right, just one sec.

309
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,617
These are very expensive.

310
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:19,144
All right...

311
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,026
Dude, you wear a bracelet?

312
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:29,559
- Your name's Mike, right?
- So?

313
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,532
I'm not gonna fight you.

314
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,701
I've a friend
that believes this is the time

315
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,995
where you put aside differences,
and make peace.

316
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,775
Me...
I don't believe in any of that,

317
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,803
but I do believe in friendship.

318
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:44,364
And as much as I hate you
and the cast of breakin',

319
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:46,379
I have to ask myself,

320
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:48,214
what would Shirley do?

321
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,656
- What would Shirley do?
- I think...

322
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:55,274
That she would...
shake your hand

323
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:57,223
and wish you a merry Christmas.

324
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,064
Kick his ass!

325
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,649
Cavalry's here.
Shirts off!

326
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,153
- Come on, I'm being punked, right?
- Kick off. Come here.

327
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:40,183
- Please, it's Christmas.
- It's December 10th!

328
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,378
Not the moneymaker.

329
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:52,487
You're welcome!

330
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:44,253
That was nice.

331
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:46,190
Thank you.

332
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:48,835
I get it, yes.
It is I, senor chang.

333
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,453
Shakira, hold this.

334
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:55,192
I have finished
grading everyone's finals,

335
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,551
and...

336
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,595
all of you... are moving on.

337
00:19:03,415 --> 00:19:05,393
Except... for Jeff.

338
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,604
Turns out you...

339
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:10,342
Pause for dramatic effect...

340
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:12,734
will be seeing me next semester.

341
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:18,698
In spanish 102!

342
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,702
Because he passed, you know.
And I'm the only spanish teacher.

343
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:26,315
I meant about Jeff passing.

344
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,232
You being our spanish teacher...

345
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,713
Man, Mike got you good.

346
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,799
Actually,
that was my present to Jeff.

347
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:38,790
I don't care.
I got a mountain to shred.

348
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:42,305
Jeffrey, you're a man now.

349
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:44,099
How's it feel?

350
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:47,143
I got hit in the face four times
before you punched me.

351
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:49,854
Some people don't know
how to say thanks.

352
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,315
Pierce, thank you.

353
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:56,565
And thanks to all of you...

354
00:19:57,316 --> 00:19:58,372
for showing up,

355
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:01,219
and having my back

356
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:03,287
when we fought those fly dancers.

357
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:08,424
Merry...

358
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:09,919
"holiday".

359
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,676
Actually,
I was gonna say merry semester, and...

360
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:15,228
happy new one.

361
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,930
<i>Oh, Christmas troy,
Oh, Christmas troy,</i>

362
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,700
<i>The candles shine so brightly.</i>

363
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:35,942
<i>Much pleasure thou canst give me.</i>

364
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:40,113
Why do you do stuff like this?

365
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,285
'Cause it's fun.

366
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:47,037
<i>The sight of thee at Christmastide,</i>

367
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,255
<i>Spreads hope and gladness far
and wide,</i>

368
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,526
<i>Oh, Christmas troy,
Oh, Christmas troy,</i>

369
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,964
<i>Thou tree most fair and lovely.</i>

370
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:02,535
Don't move.

371
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:04,929
This nose smells
like a special drink.
