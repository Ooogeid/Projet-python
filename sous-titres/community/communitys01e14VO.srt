1
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:03,674
Before we start,

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:05,830
I'd like to have
a preliminary powwow,

3
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:08,747
or prelimi-wow,
about what I'm calling

4
00:00:08,872 --> 00:00:10,635
our library's backdoor conundrum.

5
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:13,071
Sounds like a porno
with Kate Winslet.

6
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:16,703
The door on that side
is locked after 5:00,

7
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:19,185
so, we have to walk
all the way around.

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,771
If we were to move
our meetings to 4:30...

9
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:26,609
I have a regular class at that time.

10
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,111
It's like math
or other regular classes.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,739
I have something unimportant
that can't ever move.

12
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,034
One of us could stand by the door
and let the rest in?

13
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,161
- I nominate Pierce.
- Where is he?

14
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,996
I have not seen him around all day.

15
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:40,706
I haven't either.

16
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,333
- Has anyone called him?
- I did. Several times, actually

17
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,053
but he never returned my calls.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,966
The last thing I told him
was "suck it".

19
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,676
- Me too.
- Good morning.

20
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,512
Thank God.

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,573
You thought I was dead, didn't you?

22
00:00:57,698 --> 00:00:58,766
- No.
- I did.

23
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,102
You have any idea
how emasculating that is?

24
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:05,114
I'm not Mickey Rooney. Don't cross
your fingers to see if I'll come.

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,943
When I was 30, people used to wish
that I was dead to my face!

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,611
That's called respect.

27
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:14,206
Who is the lucky brunette?

28
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,652
Last name Beeswax,
first name None-a-ya.

29
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,480
My third wife was biracial.

30
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:21,330
- Stop it!
- I am trying to help you

31
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,272
to keep you out of trouble,
what if the next girl saw these?

32
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:26,100
Then she would know it's hers!

33
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:30,089
You slept with the same woman twice?

34
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,651
Can't I be the friend whose trademark
is his defined boundaries,

35
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:37,555
like, Privacy Smurf, Discreet Bear,
or Confidenciality Space?

36
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,060
If you like her,
why would you wanna keep her a secret?

37
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,175
- Don't you want us to meet her?
- We agree to keep it low key.

38
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,438
Ridiculous. Obviously it's a guy.

39
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:46,700
You're wrong.

40
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:47,963
It's two guys.

41
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:49,984
Sometimes I do wish you were dead.

1x14: Interpretive Dance

45
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:21,896
Sorry I'm late.

46
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:35,561
Professor Slater, quick question.

47
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:37,742
You know the answer.
I don't date students,

48
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,048
even if you are no longer
in my statistics class.

49
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,625
I'm seeing someone right now,
thanks.

50
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:45,655
- Really? How's that going?
- Fine. She's smart and pretty.

51
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,488
Sometimes I feel she's waiting for me
to stop talking and take off my pants.

52
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,550
She is.

53
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:57,206
I've never been
someone's dirty secret.

54
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,356
I've never had
a dirty little secret.

55
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:00,838
It's so unprofessional.

56
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:03,004
But the sneaking
does make the sex 38% hotter.

57
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,134
You do like statistics, don't you?

58
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,065
- Midterms and whatever.
- Chalk.

59
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,114
There's that transcript you wanted.

60
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,807
I didn't expect to see you here.

61
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:17,154
Hopefully, I'm not... interrupting.

62
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,462
You know, we laugh...

63
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:24,326
but the fact is
student/teacher relationships do happen,

64
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:27,289
and they are a magnet for lawsuits.
So we do stay vigilant.

65
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,329
In fact, physically attractive
students and faculty

66
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:32,419
are placed on a watch list

67
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:35,130
and ranked by their potential
to incite fraternization.

68
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,051
- You rank people by how hot they are?
- You got it... number two.

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,679
- Dean Pelton.
- Yes, Pr Seven... Slater.

70
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,639
I'll return this tomorrow.

71
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:46,392
Be extra careful now.

72
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,751
Two people of your rankings
in this small a room...

73
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:53,440
with this type of lighting
and his upper body and what her heels

74
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,192
and hemline are doing to enhance

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,226
what were already
quite a few favors from God...

76
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:01,157
It's all the more important
to keep it tasteful.

77
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:12,418
- He might have ruined...
- It's dead.

78
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,394
I can't wait for the recital.
You are wonderful,

79
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,846
especially you, Troy.

80
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,639
Thanks, madame Leclair.

81
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:30,582
And if any of you mention
my dancing outside of class,

82
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:33,856
I'll break off your legs and use them
to smash in your friends' cars.

83
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:49,121
Since when have you
taken modern dance?

84
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,779
6 months. Coach told me
it would help with my coordination,

85
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:54,906
and I fell in love with it,
in a very straight way.

86
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,479
It's tempting to sneak a peek,

87
00:04:57,604 --> 00:05:00,129
but I'm gonna need for you
to keep your eyes up here!

88
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:02,680
I should haven't dismissed you
as a shallow jock.

89
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:05,168
We haven't spent
that much time together.

90
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,719
Because you don't play football
or have fun.

91
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:10,732
I have fun tap-dancing.
I started last semester too.

92
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:12,825
It was something
that I wanted to do,

93
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,603
but it was too embarrassing,
so I never told anyone.

94
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:16,728
Same here.

95
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,278
- Nobody can know about this.
- Who are we kidding?

96
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,611
Look at how much time
and energy we put

97
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:26,992
to hide something which passionate us.
We are leading a double life.

98
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:29,912
I'm spending a lot of money
on breakaway clothing.

99
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,623
We should look at this
as an opportunity to come clean.

100
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:35,292
Are you saying we tell the group?

101
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,295
We could invite them
to the dance recital on Friday.

102
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,423
I don't know.

103
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:43,590
Let me think about it.

104
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,015
Let's do this.

105
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,767
Sorry.

106
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,773
Would you come to my office?
We never finished our intercourse.

107
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:00,702
I have study group right now,

108
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,362
and nobody uses intercourse
to mean anything other than sex.

109
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:07,408
This is a wall of windows.
My study group's behind it.

110
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,734
I know.

111
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:11,110
As soon as we touch,
the blinds will open,

112
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,998
and six annoying but loveable misfits
will be staring at us.

113
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,928
Come on, what are the odds?

114
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:18,679
Fine.

115
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:27,737
Was that so bad?

116
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,659
Could you open the back door?

117
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:43,444
You all remember Michelle Slater,
my professor from last semester?

118
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,429
As most of you may realize by now,

119
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,889
she's the woman
I've been seeing lately.

120
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,369
Why are hey looking at me
like an animal?

121
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,070
Jeff is like a dad to the group,

122
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:56,165
so this is like being told
that you're our mom.

123
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,929
You know it's nothing like that?

124
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,870
Absolutely. Do you cook macaroni?
Macaroni's my favorite.

125
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:05,833
The important thing is
we all understand

126
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,592
Professor Slater and I
need this to be our little secret.

127
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:11,695
Everyone understand that?

128
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:15,406
Sure.

129
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,187
See? All good.

130
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:21,171
Thank you, everyone.
I appreciate it.

131
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:22,691
I should get going.

132
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,150
You've taken a big step
in knocking down the barriers

133
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,052
between students and teachers...

134
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:40,033
like Rosa Parks.

135
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,002
- I don't think it's like that.
- It is.

136
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,797
If you need to explain it,
it's not just like that.

137
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,383
Is your heart gonna be okay?

138
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,133
I will try to find
the tools to survive.

139
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,167
Everybody, speaking of secrets,

140
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:58,102
we have something
that we would like to announce.

141
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,246
There's a dance recital on Friday.

142
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,291
I would be honored if you'd attend,

143
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,264
because since last semester...

144
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:08,779
I have been taking a tap class.

145
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:12,950
That's... funny.

146
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:16,203
- I don't know how funny it is.
- Come on.

147
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,106
We're not making fun of you.

148
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,083
But obviously, you kept it a secret
'cause you saw the irony too.

149
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,148
Irony?

150
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:24,694
You're not typically
vulnerable or feminine,

151
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:27,980
and the act of dancing is considered
vulnerable and feminine.

152
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,801
I disagree. What about
Fred Astaire or Baryshnikov?

153
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,594
Yeah, I guess.

154
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,541
There are exceptions to the rule,

155
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,430
but even when Jerry Rice
went on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>...

156
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:40,727
Oh, God. I liked him.

157
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,575
What... What's your secret?

158
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,212
My secret...

159
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,182
Is that...

160
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:54,741
I knew Britta's secret.

161
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,996
I saw her in her dance outfit,
and she looked ridiculous.

162
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,013
So I helped her protect her shame.

163
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:02,924
I'm glad she's out now.

164
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,288
There you are.

165
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,090
Just got word of your relationship
with Professor Slater.

166
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,052
I'd like to see you in my office
in half an hour.

167
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,638
None of you left.
How is that possible?

168
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,099
For one thing,
it's all over Twitter.

169
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,928
Britta in a tutu...
Can you imagine?

170
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:30,999
What the hell? We were supposed
to come out together.

171
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:33,572
I changed my mind.

172
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,075
They're gonna find out
that you dance at the recital.

173
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,886
I'm not gonna be in the recital.

174
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,418
I'm dropping the class.

175
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:42,164
How can you do this?
I'm so disappointed in you.

176
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,469
You don't get to talk to me like that.
You are not Shirley!

177
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:47,252
And Shirley is not my mom.

178
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:50,229
It's not like
we were in the same boat.

179
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:51,997
Girls are supposed to dance.

180
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:54,259
That's why God gave them
parts that jiggle.

181
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:56,559
But I'd be going
from starting quarterback

182
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:58,764
to a guy that twirls around
in tights.

183
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,725
I've got more to lose on that stage
because I'm a man.

184
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:02,842
Guess what?

185
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:06,104
A real man doesn't bail
on his friends or on himself.

186
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:10,859
You're a dancer, Troy.
It's who you are.

187
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:13,664
Not anymore.

188
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:17,533
Excuse me.

189
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:23,353
Upset about Jeff?

190
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:25,591
No. I am upset about...

191
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,752
Something I can't talk about.

192
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,373
We can talk about anything...

193
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:32,530
Politics, medicine, Jeff.

194
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,823
Did you hear
that the shroud of Turin...

195
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:37,979
Here's the thing about Jeff.

196
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,828
Chasing after you
made him a better person

197
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:42,682
'cause you always
called him on his stuff.

198
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,651
All this time, you've been warming
him up and stirring in sweetener

199
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:48,647
and making him just right.
You weren't ready to take a sip yet,

200
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,373
but it didn't mean you want him snatched
off the counter and guzzle down.

201
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:54,412
Shirley, I did not warm Jeff up.

202
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,154
Nobody ever will.

203
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,157
Do you think professor Slater
is getting flowers right now?

204
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:02,244
Do you think that they are gonna go
to the movies and hold hands,

205
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,027
visit her parents?

206
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,553
The only thing keeping them going
was the thrill of the secrecy,

207
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,502
and now that it is out,
it is over, believe me.

208
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:15,784
Can I just ask
as a divorced black housewife...

209
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,261
What part of being a single white
slacker makes you people so jaded?

210
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,251
You people?

211
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,307
What do you mean, you people?

212
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,597
I cannot believe I got to say that.

213
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,739
It's the little things, isn't it?

214
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:30,866
Now that your secret is out there,

215
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,109
I'm gonna talk you through
this teacher/student relationship form,

216
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,445
we can get you two
on your very attractive way.

217
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,598
We haven't even admitted
to being a couple.

218
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:41,283
In fact, this is all based on hearsay,
worse than hearsay...

219
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,826
Pierce's Twitter account,

220
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,455
in which he says he's 47 and teaches
a women's-only Pilates class.

221
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,685
Jeff, it's okay. It's out.

222
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,710
And you know what?
It doesn't bother me. I'm happy.

223
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,711
Sweet.

224
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,674
First question.
"How long have you been doing it?"

225
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,845
Not it. I mean this... dating.

226
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:03,260
A few weeks.

227
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,184
And...
How long have you been doing it?

228
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:09,889
We don't have to answer that.

229
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:11,605
Now...

230
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:14,209
This is just hypothetical.

231
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:17,152
Might you ever consider
spending the night with a third person?

232
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,803
That's not on there!

233
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,073
It's on there.

234
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:24,569
Just exploring your options,
obviously.

235
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:26,662
No agenda.

236
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,895
I'll put "TBD".

237
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:31,291
Would you describe yourself
as boyfriend and girlfriend?

238
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,920
- What?
- Oh, boy.

239
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:37,255
It's semantics, really, isn't it?

240
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,226
We've slept together every night
for the last three weeks.

241
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:44,226
- How would you describe me?
- The best friend ever.

242
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:49,935
I guess
I've had the wrong idea about us.

243
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:51,645
This is good.

244
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,763
I'd be better off dating...

245
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:56,483
an adult.
See you around

246
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:04,282
I'll get the break-up form.

247
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:12,151
I got freaked out
by that boyfriend label.

248
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,165
I'm...

249
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:15,711
afraid of commitment.

250
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:18,713
- How original.
- The biggest truths aren't original.

251
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:20,674
Truth is ketchup.

252
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:22,092
It's Jim Belushi.

253
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:24,185
Its job isn't to blow our minds.

254
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,716
It's to be within reach,
so the truth is...

255
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,977
I get claustrophobic
when things get official.

256
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:30,958
You're acting
like I'm a Venus flytrap.

257
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,511
I didn't want or need
more than what we were doing.

258
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:35,628
Let's get back to it.
Should I get the door?

259
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:37,630
I can't,
you went to the friend place.

260
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:39,668
That's you getting official, not me,

261
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,445
unless there's something
I need to know

262
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,527
about the lunch lady or that blonde

263
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:45,997
with the infinite supply
of leather jackets,

264
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:48,240
somewhere between our 9th and 11th
slumber party,

265
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:51,163
statistically speaking, most people
would call us more than pals.

266
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,583
Yeah, but soon as you say it,
it can get complicated and messy.

267
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:56,907
- How?
- Because when you say it,

268
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:58,879
later on,
you might have to un-say it.

269
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,756
Whoopee flippin' ding, winger.
It happens 50 million times a day.

270
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:04,532
It's the Jim Belushi
of sexual commitments.

271
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:07,471
It barely means anything,
and it grows on what's there over time.

272
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,265
Boy, that guy's really taking a pounding
in this conversation.

273
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:12,976
I'll see you around.

274
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:25,030
I really liked what we were doing.
And if the ratio

275
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,773
of work to pleasure
can really stay at that same level,

276
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:30,281
I don't care what it's called.
I'll do it.

277
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,902
Let's do it.

278
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,794
That's a big crowd out there.

279
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,245
Abed's really good
at inviting people.

280
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:03,151
We're all here to support you.
Jeff even brought his girlfriend.

281
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:06,863
She's his girlfriend now?
Can't wait till he hears about it.

282
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:09,916
He knows. They even had
to file paperwork with the dean.

283
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,556
It's pretty serious.

284
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:13,330
Our little Jeff's growing up!

285
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:18,667
Break a leg, Britta.

286
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:22,339
I have no idea how someone
could do what you're about to do.

287
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:28,927
I brought goobers.
Anybody want a goober?

288
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,512
Get them while they're gooby!

289
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,062
Well, this is already ridiculous.

290
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,946
<i>Tea for two</i>?
There...

291
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:46,848
There're five people.

292
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:54,679
Good lord.

293
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,709
Is she a water pot or a tea kettle?

294
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,602
Don't you think the flowers
are dying from the tea?

295
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,551
Everyone can hear you.

296
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:42,167
Water it!

297
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,670
- What's going on?
- So embarrassing.

298
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:55,705
Plot twist.

299
00:16:57,464 --> 00:16:59,643
Easy, girl. There we go.

300
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:06,941
Play something modern.

301
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:09,661
What are you doing here?

302
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:11,446
Being a friend and a man.

303
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,011
It's OK.

304
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,928
Culturally, it's unacceptable,

305
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:41,059
but it's theatrical dynamite!

306
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,534
Yeah, all right!

307
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,939
Bring it!

308
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,622
Greendale!

309
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,536
Hi, guys. That was really cool.
I wish I knew how to tap-dance.

310
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,674
It takes a lot of hard work,
but you could always take a class.

311
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,607
Pass.

312
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,639
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

313
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,221
You looked so pathetic,

314
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:23,759
you made going up there
the most masculine option.

315
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:34,522
What you did up there really took guts.
I'm impressed.

316
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,982
Thanks, Pierce.

317
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:38,971
And such a creative way
to tell the world you're gay.

318
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,885
Good job up there.

319
00:18:42,482 --> 00:18:44,956
Where's your date?
Didn't she want to get my autograph?

320
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,209
She's getting a permission slip
to allow us to drive home together.

321
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,367
I heard you are official now.

322
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:51,703
Yeah, I guess.

323
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,590
You actually had a big part in that.

324
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,564
If I can handle
having a girl for a friend,

325
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,892
who's to say
I'm not ready for a girlfriend?

326
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:01,347
Makes perfect sense. Break a leg.

327
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,576
Flowers.

328
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:08,521
Yeah. That's what people do, right?

329
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,833
I was gonna throw them up on stage,
but I thought they might catch fire.

330
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,677
No, this is... This is good.

331
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:15,445
You can hand them to me. Thank you.

332
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:17,945
See you Monday.

333
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:49,062
Good night, everybody.

334
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:53,599
- Five letters... Broadway musical.
- Annie.

335
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,388
- Six letters... To puncture.
- Pierce.

336
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:59,593
- A water filter that starts with "B".
- Brita.

337
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:02,927
Here's a tough one, though.
Helen of...

338
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:03,876
Troy.

339
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:07,298
Damn, you're good.
I never even heard of that last one.

340
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:10,208
One of the two brother actors.
Bridges. Four letters.

341
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:13,631
I know.

342
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:15,189
- Bridges.
- I don't know.

343
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,372
Come on, guys.
Can't you see the pattern there?

344
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:19,968
Can you see it?
